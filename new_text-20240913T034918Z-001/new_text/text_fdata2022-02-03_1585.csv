or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story atlanta grocery costs keep climbing prices of meat seafood produce cereal and other kitchen staples shot up 9 in 2021 that s according to data from iri a chicago based market research firm and the trend is continuing this year big name brands are raising prices kraft heinz announced hikes on velveeta cheese oscar mayer meats maxwell house coffee and kool aid general mills and campbell soup also jacked up food prices and procter gamble raised the price of tide laundry products why do grocery staples keep rising with no end in sight blame the supply chain the ongoing labor shortage and covid a lot of that is actually a delayed reaction from the that the supply chain has been feeling for the last several months said doug baker vice president of industry relations for fmi the food industry association they put off as long as possible and now we re going to feel the effects of that for the next few months the number of cargo ships parked off the california coast hit a record high in january with nearly 100 still waiting offshore even after the ports of los angeles and long beach unloaded 13 more containers than ever before in 2021 the cost of labor fuel ingredients packaging and transportation keep skyrocketing driven largely by the worker shortage and a massive spike in demand for goods the extraordinary cost pressure that we re seeing across all different business right now is landing in that last resort and that s why you re seeing the inflation said tony sarsam ceo of food distributor spartannash omicron is adding to price pressures peeling workers from warehouses processing facilities and grocery stores for example us pork production dropped 8 in the week ended january 14 with many employees either sick or quarantined disruptions everywhere with fewer workers distributors are cutting deliveries to some grocery stores by 20 to 40 fresh encounter an ohio based grocery chain says more than 40 of orders have been delayed or canceled it s been whack a mole it s one item one day and then a completely different segment the next said fresh encounter ceo michael needler jr obviously our customers are frustrated when they can t get their items but hopefully we re able to have a substitute item for them a recent survey found 37 of customers are very concerned about grocery shortages which they ve seen on items like pet food paper goods and cream cheese various items have come in and out of stock throughout the past year right now soft drinks are one of the hardest products to find on the shelves we ve had issues with some sweeteners where they ve been delayed and we ve had issues with cans and glass said norm snyder ceo of beverage company reed s adding that the labor shortage has been the biggest obstacle especially during covid surges you have a group of people that are all working in close proximity to one another he added if one person gets sick the protocol because everyone s exposed is to shut down so we ve had several instances where lines have been shut down for one or two weeks the biden administration says it is working to ease inflation accusing some of the largest meat processors of raising prices just to drive up profits but experts are projecting more grocery price hikes ahead we re going to continue to see supply chain disruption and we will continue to see periods of inflation at least for the next several months as the industry continues to recalibrate fmi s baker said what you can do about it beth moncel who runs the blog budgetbytes to teach people how to cook on a budget offered several tips for grocery shoppers you have to be really strategic and intentional moncel said planning is probably one of the best ways to save money on groceries moncel suggested shoppers peruse grocery sales flyers before shopping join store loyalty programs and plan meals around cheap filling items like rice and beans as well as shelf stable ingredients like frozen vegetables that s really going to help you reduce waste moncel said and reducing waste is probably one of the biggest areas where you can save money on your groceries because every time you throw food away you re literally just throwing money in the garbage deals can be had if you know where to look for example florida based supermarket chain winn dixie announced it is lowering the cost of 150 popular items by roughly 18 to ease inflation s burden on shoppers we work with our national brand partners in selecting those products that mean that much to the customer at this particular time said anthony hucker ceo of southeastern grocers winn dixie s parent company secondly we have our own brand of products that typically range between 20 and 30 less than the national brand and the third thing we do is actually absorb some of the costs ourselves
vermont gov phil scott may be a republican but like other fellow blue state gop governors his support for the second amendment has been hit or miss since he took office back in 2017 his biggest miss came in 2018 when he signed a rash of gun control measures into law including a ban on gun sales to those under the age of 21 a ban on bump stocks and a universal background check requirement advertisement but scott hasn t signed every gun control bill that s been approved by the democrat controlled state legislature in 2019 scott vetoed a bill that would have imposed a 24 hour waiting period between purchasing a gun and being able to take possession of it though he touted the state s red flag gun seizure law as one reason why he felt waiting periods weren t needed now scott s once again reiterating his position that vermont has enough gun laws on the books already which could spell trouble for the democrats gun control agenda this session a proposal to ban guns in vermont hospitals could face a hurdle when it reaches governor phil scott s desk senate bill 30 which passed the house last week would ban guns in hospitals and expand the length of a background check waiting period up to a month lawmakers still need to reconcile their versions of the bill before delivering it to the governor s desk scott on tuesday said he does not support the current version of the bill and doesn t believe additional gun laws are needed make improvements there if necessary but have them at our disposal and make sure people know how to use the tools we have now rather than go make new gun laws he said it sure sounds like scott s not inclined to sign sb 30 into law but don t expect democrats to give up just because of his objections democrats still dominate both the state house and senate and while their numbers aren t large enough to guarantee an override of any veto by scott lawmakers did manage to cobble together the votes last year to undo the governor s veto of a bill allowing non citizens to vote in local elections in two communities advertisement in order for sb 30 to become law over scott s objections it needs support from 100 of the 150 house members and 20 of the 30 members of the state senate the house version of sb 30 was originally approved by a vote of 84 42 which is 16 votes shy of the 100 votes necessary for an override but an earlier roll call vote on the bill was far closer at 97 49 the original senate version was ultimately approved on a 19 10 vote but a vote to approve an amendment to the bill passed in the senate by a vote of 20 9 however there are major differences between the version passed by the house and the bill as originally introduced in the senate the house amended the bill to not only ban the lawful carrying of firearms within a hospital building but to impose background checks on all firearm transfers in the state with only limited exceptions for immediate family members and a person who transfers the firearm to another person in order to prevent imminent harm to any person provided that this subdivision shall only apply while the risk of imminent harm exists oddly while anyone possessing a gun in a hospital building would be subject to a 250 fine someone selling a gun to their longtime neighbor and hunting buddy without putting them through a background check first could face up to a year in jail is anyone with actual violent intent going to be dissuaded from bringing a weapon into a hospital because they could face a fine honestly what is the point here other than for lawmakers to be able to tell voters they did something about gun violence this year advertisement phil scott is right that these measures both unnecessary and unworthy of support but that doesn t mean they won t become law it looks like if there s any opportunity to stop this awful bill from becoming law it s going to be on the senate side where members may very well decide that the amended legislation isn t really something they want to defend on the campaign trail this year frankly given the signs of a red wave election in november i d be staying as far away from gun control as possible if i were a democratic lawmaker even in a state as liberal as vermont but then my opposition to gun control prevents me from becoming a democratic lawmaker or voter for that matter in the first place

gabaix and koijen calculated the effects of fund flows on individual prices as well as on the market in aggregate they used a variety of data sources piecing together a picture using various public filings and reports containing information on holdings and flows in stock and bond markets generally covering the years 1993 to 2020 before posting their paper they asked 102 academic researchers in economics and finance to predict what every 1 entering the stock market would do to prices the prevailing view held by just over half of respondents was that it would have no price effect of those who said it would have some effect only three people said it would have a multiplier effect greater than one as in every 1 entering the market would push up prices by 2 but in the inelastic markets hypothesis money that flows into the stock market leads to stronger price effects because there are essentially a set number of available shares and many of those are not being actively traded pairing their theory with an empirical analysis the researchers estimate that every 1 put into the market pushes up aggregate prices by 5 the researchers say that while this may seem like a big multiplier it s roughly in line with what other researchers find at a micro level for example aqr s andrea frazzini and ronen israel and yale s tobias j moskowitz estimated the price impact one large trader had on prices jean philippe bouchaud chairman of capital fund management in paris this past summer released his own research in which he writes that gabaix and koijen s rather awesome recent paper validates what he has found over two decades he calculates that the multiplier for dollars invested can be even higher for volatile stocks or lower for companies for which a smaller fraction of the market cap is actively traded the mystery of apparently random movements of the stock market hard to link fundamentals is replaced by the more manageable problem of understanding the determinants of flows in elastic markets gabaix and koijen write their work they continue might lead to a more concrete understanding of the origins of financial fluctuations across markets deconstructing market moves this logic implies that it s possible to trace fluctuations in markets back to who caused them which is something koijen and his colleagues have been doing the idea of tracing movements back to investors isn t new but academics abandoned it decades ago in part because the data weren t easily available or available at all now it s easier to obtain measurements of holdings and fund flows and to compare those with price data koijen new york university s robert j richmond and princeton s motohiro yogo deconstructed fund flows in the roughly 50 trillion us stock market to determine what and who is moving prices day traders might like meme stocks they write while some pension and sovereign wealth funds have mandates to invest in sustainable more environmentally friendly companies many hedge funds meanwhile look for arbitrage opportunities read who is driving stock prices as well as the investors with the most influence over companies market capitalization the researchers developed a framework that starts with a simple model they applied to data to identify the characteristics that determine demand and ultimately prices they then divided investors into eight groups according to investor size and strategy from huge passive investment advisers to smaller actively managed advisers and hedge funds then they imagined a world in which the assets of one of those groups flows to all other institutional investors for example we ask by what percent does the average stock price move if we take blackrock s assets and redistribute these assets to all other institutional investors they write because blackrock has certain portfolio tilts this experiment would lower the stock price along characteristics that blackrock favors performing this portfolio thought experiment leads to many observations among them that certain small active investors have the largest influence on valuations hedge funds hold less than 5 percent of the equity market koijen richmond and yogo find and yet controlling for size they are the most influential players in the market more so than far larger pension funds and insurance companies at the other end of the spectrum we find that passive investment advisors both small and large and long term investors have a relatively small impact on valuations the researchers write that s in line with the inelastic markets hypothesis that when many players are sitting on the sidelines the ones on the field are moving prices and most responsible for fluctuations as well as outright volatility the international picture with international holdings data koijen and yogo performed a similar decomposition exercise applying the idea to international stock bond and currency markets global investors hold financial assets across many countries and have exchange rate exposure not only through short term debt but also long term debt and equity they write the portfolio decisions of these investors across countries and asset classes are important for exchange rates long term yields and stock prices while they re making a case that demand matters they re not saying it s the only thing that matters many other forces can move markets including government and monetary policies volatility sovereign debt ratings and macroeconomic conditions to tease apart the various forces at work they developed a model to study what moved exchange rates long term yields on bonds and stock prices across 36 countries between 2002 and 2017 the international monetary fund s annual coordinated portfolio investment survey provided information on the holdings of investors worldwide and they essentially mapped investor portfolios at the country level with asset prices estimating the demand for assets

a new report shows air cargo demand was flat in january compared to last year and 2019 but the sampling of airlines shipment business doesn t take into account ongoing disruptions to the air logistics system that have prevented carriers from transporting as many goods as shippers are presenting essentially resulting in an undercount of volume the amount of air cargo moved by airlines last month inched up 0 1 compared to the opening month in 2021 and 0 2 versus 2019 amsterdam based clive data services reported wednesday the market monitor uses a formula that combines weight and dimensional information to measure how much freight passenger and all cargo airlines carry each month data from 2020 is not considered a reliable benchmark because of the unique pandemic effects the figures showed a sequential improvement from december when clive reported a 5 contraction in cargo volume on the positive side cargo capacity was up 6 points versus january 2021 but is still 4 below pre pandemic levels the january results are emblematic of a predictable soft start to the year after the holiday rush but volumes and rates started to increase in the past couple of weeks as shippers tried to get products exported before china s lunar new year holiday which started early this year on feb 1 last week the international air transport association released figures showing air cargo volume grew 8 9 in december and 9 4 for the critical international sector compared to 2019 for the entire year air cargo was up 6 9 iata said december capacity was 4 7 below pre pandemic levels with the heavy international segment down 6 5 the airline group collects data from nearly all its members about cargo weight multiplied by distance carried but the reporting is a month behind and many industry professionals consider clive s methodology more sophisticated the one area where numbers from the two organizations appear to closely align is in cargo capacity which remains depleted because passenger airlines have only partially restored services due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreaks and government travel restrictions all cargo airlines have brought much more space to the market in response to a huge need from cargo owners seeking alternatives to congested ocean shipping for their most popular products but it hasn t been able to make up the difference for more information about the sonar data platform click here clive also measures how much of the aircraft s cargo hold was actually filled with shipments it said the january load factor on average was 62 a point higher than in 2019 but 6 points below the first month of 2021 logistics companies say bookings for airfreight shipments are robust especially on the trans pacific and westbound asia to europe routes as companies move goods ahead of factory slowdowns in china related to lunar new year celebrations adding to the capacity pressure is increased use of air to distribute covid test kits and nasal swabs as governments try to contain the latest covid wave but the air logistics system continues to be buffeted by events that are chipping away at already tight capacity and reducing efficiency including bad weather and the rollout of 5g wireless service in the u s that led several international carriers to cancel flights for several days until fears about potential interference with aircraft flight

results for its first quarter of fiscal 2022 which ended december 31 2021 i am proud of the cmc materials team for delivering our fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue said david li president and ceo of cmc materials strong growth in our electronic materials segment was driven by robust demand for our innovative and high performing solutions and supported by a healthy semiconductor industry additionally we are encouraged by the sequential and year over year improvement in our pipeline and industrial materials pim business regarding the company s previously announced pending transaction with entegris inc entegris transaction mr li commented our strong focus on technology innovation and customer partnerships will continue as part of entegris leading electronic materials platform while providing expanded opportunities for our stakeholders key financial information for the first quarter revenue was 317 0 million 10 1 higher than the same quarter last year growth was driven by 13 0 growth in the company s electronic materials segment which represents more than 80 of the company s revenue revenue in the performance materials segment declined 3 3 during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the company implemented price increases to its global customer base to largely offset the expected higher costs for raw materials freight and logistics revenue was up 1 6 sequentially driven by both volume and price gross margin was 39 7 versus 42 7 in the prior year adjusted gross margin 1 was 41 2 versus 44 2 in the prior year this decline was primarily due to higher raw materials freight and logistics costs across both segments during the first fiscal quarter the company began the implementation of global price increases to largely offset the increased costs for raw materials freight and logistics these global pricing actions are expected to largely offset those increased costs in the second fiscal quarter the company continues to evaluate further pricing actions to offset additional inflationary headwinds as needed was 41 2 versus 44 2 in the prior year net income was 27 4 million compared to 31 5 million in the same quarter last year in the quarter the company recorded a 9 4 million impairment charge for the company s exit of the wood treatment business 6 1 million in transaction expenses related to the entegris transaction and 3 0 million of severance costs related to the future forward strategic cost optimization program previously announced in november 2021 adjusted net income 1 was 59 4 million 4 6 higher compared to the prior year the increase was driven by higher revenue lower operating expenses and a lower effective tax rate which reflected increased benefit from stock option activity during the quarter higher raw materials freight and logistics costs partially offset the increase was 59 4 million 4 6 higher compared to the prior year diluted eps was 0 95 compared to 1 07 in the same quarter last year adjusted diluted

last year adjusted ebitda margin 1 for the quarter was 29 0 compared to 31 8 in the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda margin 1 decline was due to higher raw materials freight and logistics costs partially offset by global price increases adjusted operating expenses 1 as a percent of sales were down slightly year over year was 91 9 million up slightly compared to the same quarter last year adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter was 29 0 compared to 31 8 in the same quarter last year 1refer to financial tables and use of certain gaap non gaap adjusted financial information below for information about these non gaap financial measures and reconciliations of these non gaap measures to their most comparable gaap measure electronic materials revenue was 267 7 million 13 0 higher than revenue in the same quarter last year due to growth across all segment businesses continuing the company s track record of outpacing wafer start growth sequentially revenue was 5 3 higher driven by growth in cmp slurries and electronic chemicals cmp slurries increased 8 5 compared to the first fiscal quarter of 2021 driven by customer technology advancement and continued robust demand for the company s products cmp pads increased 8 9 year over year due to a continued robust semiconductor demand environment and new position wins electronic chemicals increased 13 9 compared to the same quarter last year driven by strong customer demand particularly in europe and new position wins adjusted ebitda was 88 1 million or 32 9 of revenue compared to 80 8 million or 34 1 of revenue in the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda margin1 decline was due to higher costs for raw materials freight and logistics which more than offset the benefit from higher revenue from all businesses in the segment global price increases which began to be implemented during the quarter are expected to largely offset the higher costs for raw materials freight and logistics performance materials revenue was 49 4 million for the quarter 3 3 lower than revenue in the same quarter last year and 14 3 lower sequentially due to the exit of the wood treatment business which is expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2022 lower revenue from the wood treatment business more than offset the year over year increase in the pim business pim revenue increased 2 8 compared to the same quarter last year and 5 2 sequentially the pim business continued to execute against its strategic initiatives by pursuing new customer opportunities and achieving additional progress on developing the r d pipeline with a focus on driving profitability improvement adjusted ebitda was 15 0 million or 30 4 of revenue1 compared to 23 0 million or 45 0 of revenue1 in the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda decline was primarily the result of the exit of the wood treatment business and a significant increase in the cost of a key raw material in the pim business please refer to the financial table below titled segment revenue and adjusted ebitda for more information current financial guidance the company currently expects total revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 to be flat to up low single digits sequentially compared to revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 electronic materials revenue is expected to be up low single digits sequentially primarily because the company is exiting the wood treatment business performance materials revenue is expected to be down mid to high single digits compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 in terms of adjusted ebitda margin for the company s second fiscal quarter historically this quarter has been lower than the first fiscal quarter due to the timing of typical annual items such as merit and benefit increases the company is reiterating full fiscal 2022 guidance which includes adjusted ebitda1 to be between 355 million to 385 million depreciation and amortization to be between 50 million to 55 million tax rate to be between 20 to 23 and capital spending to be between 60 million to 80 million interest expense is now expected to be between 38 million to 40 million the company s outlook includes its exit of the wood treatment business by the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2022 which is expected to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 37 million compared to fiscal 2021 the company expects to generally offset this impact with organic growth as well as the initial impact of the future forward program which benefits the second half of the fiscal year additionally in the second quarter the global pricing actions taken are expected to largely offset the increased costs for raw materials freight and logistics the company continues to evaluate further pricing actions to mitigate additional inflationary headwinds as needed please refer to the company s fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2021 earnings slides and remarks document for additional details on the exit of the wood treatment business and full fiscal 2022 guidance the document can be accessed here or by visiting the quarterly results section of the company s investor relations

chicago smart economic policymaking invariably requires trading off some pain today for greater future gains but this is a difficult proposition politically especially in democracies it is always easier for elected leaders to indulge their constituents immediately on the hope that the bill will not arrive while they are still in office moreover those who bear the pain caused by a policy are not necessarily those who will gain from it that is why today s more advanced economies created mechanisms that allow them to make hard choices when necessary chief among these are independent central banks and mandated limits on budget deficits importantly political parties reached a consensus to establish and back these mechanisms irrespective of their own immediate political priorities one reason why many emerging markets have swung from crisis to crisis is that they failed to achieve such consensus but recent history shows that developed economies too are becoming less tolerant of pain perhaps because their own political consensus has eroded financial markets have become volatile once again owing to fears that the us federal reserve will have to tighten its monetary policy significantly to control inflation but many investors still hope that the fed will go easy if asset prices start to fall substantially if the fed proves them right it will become that much harder to normalise financial conditions in the future investors hope that the fed will prolong the party is not baseless in late 1996 fed chair alan greenspan warned of financial markets irrational exuberance but the markets shrugged off the warning and were proved correct perhaps chastened by the harsh political reaction to greenspan s speech the fed did nothing and when the stock market eventually crashed in 2000 the fed cut rates ensuring that the recession was mild in a testimony to the congressional joint economic committee the previous year greenspan argued that while the fed could not prevent the inevitable economic hangover from an asset price boom it could mitigate the fallout when it occurs and hopefully ease the transition to the next expansion the fed thus assured traders and bankers that if they collectively gambled on similar assets it would not limit the upside but it would limit the downside if their bets turned bad subsequent fed interventions have entrenched such beliefs making it even harder for the fed to rein in financial markets with modest moves and now that much more tightening and consequent pain may be needed a consensus in favor of it might be harder to achieve fiscal policy is also guilty of peddling supposedly painless economic measures most would agree that the pandemic created a need for targeted spending through extended generous unemployment benefits for example to shield the hardest hit households but in the event the spending was anything but targeted the us congress passed multi trillion dollar bills offering something for everyone the paycheck protection program ppp for example provided 800 billion in grants effectively for small businesses across the board a newstudy from mit s david autor and his colleagues estimates that the programme helped preserve 2 3 million job years of employment over 14 months at a stupendous cost of 170 000 257 000 per job year worse only 23 34 per cent of this money went directly to workers who would otherwise have lost their jobs the balance went to creditors business owners and shareholders all told an estimated three quarters of ppp benefits went to the top one fifth of earners of course the programme may have saved some firms that otherwise would have collapsed but at what cost while capitalists anticipate profits they also sign up for possible failure moreover many small businesses are tiny operations without much organisational capital if a small bakery had to close the economic fallout would have been mitigated by the enhanced unemployment insurance and if it had a loyal clientele it could restart after the pandemic perhaps with a little help from a bank the standard line is that the unconstrained spending was driven by a sense that unprecedented times called for unprecedented measures in fact it was the response to the 2008 global financial crisis that broke the previous consensus for more prudent policies lasting public resentment that wall street had been helped more than main street motivated politicians in both major parties to spend with abandon when the pandemic hit but targeted unemployment benefits were associated with the democrats leaving republicans seeking wins for their own constituencies who better to support than small businesses while political fractures were driving up untargeted spending budget hawks were nowhere to be found their voices had been steadily drowned out by economists in addition to the cranks who show up periodically to advocate ostensibly free lunches through money financed spending a growing chorus of mainstream economists had been arguing that prevailing low interest rates gave developed countries significantly more room to expand fiscal deficits politicians who were eager to justify their policies ignored these economists caveats that spending had to be sensible and that interest rates had to stay low only the headline message mattered and anyone suggesting otherwise was dismissed as a hair shirt fanatic historically it has been the fed s job to take away the monetary punch bowl before the party gets frenzied and congress s job to be prudent about fiscal deficits and debt but the fed s desire to spare the market from pain has driven more risk taking and reinforced expectations of further interventions the fed s actions have also added to the pressure on congress to do its bit for main street which in turn has led to inflation and a belief that the fed will back off from raising rates all of this makes a return to the previous consensus more difficult when the fed does raise rates significantly the government s costs of servicing the debt from past spending will limit future spending including on policies to reduce inequality which has fueled political fragmentation combat future emergencies and tackle climate change every economy has a limited reservoir of policy credibility and resources which are best used to mitigate genuine economic distress not to shield those who can bear some pain if everyone wants a free lunch the bill eventually will be paid by those least able to afford it emerging market economies have had to learn this the hard way developed

beijing feb 2 xinhua china will be able to cope with the potential impact from the shift to monetary tightening in major economies like the united states economists and officials say the u s federal reserve signaled after a policy meeting in late january that the central bank is ready to raise interest rates as soon as march to combat surging inflation as it exits from the ultra loose monetary policy enacted at the start of the covid 19 pandemic concerns grew whether the fed s tightening moves like interest rate hikes and balance sheet cuts will trigger capital outflows and currency depreciation in emerging markets and developing countries weighing on their recoveries analysts say that global volatility caused by the u s fed policy shift is unlikely to rattle china s markets because the country s industrial chain competitiveness stable financial system and long term growth prospects will help keep cross border capital flowing and the yuan exchange rate steady the chinese economy is resilient against external fluctuations said wang chunying deputy head of the state administration of foreign exchange forex holdings of chinese companies mostly coming from export is relatively ample wang said from 2020 to 2021 forex deposits on the chinese mainland expanded 160 billion u s dollars in total with a currently low leverage ratio due to the tepid growth of cross border loans or trade financing forex flow in and out of the real economy will remain stable she added yuan denominated assets are gaining more traction among overseas investors as the country s financial market opens wider wang added official data showed that overseas holdings of bonds and stocks together registered a net increase of over 700 billion dollars during the 2018 2021 period with an average annual growth rate of 34 percent while overseas investors remain upbeat about china s long term prospects overseas capital accounts for roughly 3 to 5 percent of china s bond and stock markets which is a relatively low level compared with economies such as japan the republic of korea and brazil this indicates potential for further inflow according to wang the generally limited effect the looming u s fed tightening could have on china is not enough to sway monetary policy analysts believe the determinant of china s monetary policy is the status of economic operation said bai xue an analyst with golden credit rating the downward pressure facing china in the first half of this year calls for effective pro growth measures to maintain stability bai said strengthening the yuan in 2021 also provided wiggle room for monetary policies without breaking the reasonable and equilibrium level of the exchange rate according to bai instead of resorting to a massive stimulus china has made full use of cross cyclical adjustment and maintained reasonable and ample liquidity in the market said sun guofeng an official with the people s bank of china since the second half of last year the central bank reduced the reserve requirement ratio rrr for financial institutions twice with the two cuts injecting a total of 2 2 trillion yuan about 345 billion u s dollars of long term funds into the economy it has also increased the re lending quota for small businesses by an additional 300 billion yuan cut the interest rates of its medium term lending facility loans and reverse repos and lowered the loan prime rates going forward china s policymakers will continue to use facilities like rrr open market operations and the medium term lending facility mlf to maintain a reasonable abundance of market liquidity said wen bin the chief analyst at china minsheng bank adding structural monetary policy will also be adopted to lower borrowing costs for companies

not constitute an offer of any of the securities described herein reference is made to the stock exchange announcement published on 2 february 2022 by ensurge micropower asa ensurge or the company regarding a contemplated private placement the private placement of new shares in the company the offer shares at a subscription price of nok 0 60 per offer share ensurge is pleased to announce that the private placement has been successfully placed through an allocation of 125 561 401 offer shares in tranche 1 and an allocation of 41 105 265 offer shares in tranche 2 for total gross proceeds i e both tranches of approximately nok 100 million pareto securities as the manager acted as sole lead manager and sole bookrunner in the private placement the net proceeds from the private placement will be used for general corporate purposes which include expanding the company s manufacturing capabilities and its presence in new evolving markets allocation to investors and payment instructions is expected to be communicated on 3 february 2022 the allocated offer shares will be settled with existing and unencumbered shares in the company already admitted to trading on oslo børs borrowed by the existing shareholder alden as alden pursuant to a share lending agreement entered into between alden the company and the manager to facilitate settlement on a delivery versus payment basis the offer shares allocated to applicants in tranche 1 will thus be tradable from notification of allocation subject to timely payment on 3 february 2022 while the offer shares allocated to applicants in tranche 2 will be tradeable one trading day after approval by the extraordinary general meeting expected to be held on or about 24 february 2022 the egm the settlement date in the private placement for tranche 1 will be 7 february 2022 and the settlement date for tranche 2 is expected to be on or about 1 march 2022 the manager will settle the share loan with i new shares in the company to be resolved issued by the board pursuant to an authorization the board authorization granted by the company s annual general meeting held on 3 june 2021 tranche 1 and ii new shares in the company to be issued following and subject to approval by the egm to be summoned shortly after notification of allocation in the private placement tranche 2 following registration of the share capital increase pertaining to the offer shares in tranche 1 of the private placement with the norwegian register of business enterprises the company will have a registered share capital of nok 206 042 023 33 divided into 1 873 109 303 shares each with a nominal value of nok 0 11 subject to approval by the egm the subscribers in the private placement will receive two non tradeable warrants for every two offer shares subscribed for in the private placement the private placement warrants at no additional cost and with an exercise price equal to the subscription price for the offer shares 50 of the private placement warrants will be exercisable on 30 june 2022 and the remaining 50 will be exercisable on 30 november 2022 the private placement implies a deviation from the pre emptive rights of the existing shareholders of the company the board has considered this and is of the view that it would be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders to deviate from the existing shareholders pre emptive right to the offer shares and that this would also be in compliance with the requirements in the norwegian public limited companies act on equal treatment of shareholders and the prohibition against giving anyone an unreasonable advantage at the company s or the shareholders expense and the obligation relating to equal treatment of shareholders cf the rules on equal treatment under oslo rule book ii for companies listed on the oslo stock exchange and the oslo stock exchange s guidelines on the rule of equal treatment in reaching this conclusion the board inter alia emphasized that the total number of offer shares represents less than 10 of the issued and outstanding number of shares in the company and consequently the dilutive effect is limited the subscription price of nok 0 60 per share represents a nominal deviation from the closing price of the share on 2 february 2022 and is therefore considered to represent professional investors view of the market price for the shares a share issue in the form of a private placement enables the company to capitalize on current market conditions which are deemed beneficial to the interest of the company and its shareholders alternative transaction structures would imply a longer lead time and potentially significant discounts as the private placement is structured to ensure that a market based subscription price is achieved it is not planned to conduct a subsequent share issue directed towards shareholders not participating in the private placement completion of tranche 1 is not conditional upon completion of tranche 2 the settlement of offer shares under tranche 1 will remain final and binding and cannot be revoked or terminated by the respective applicants if tranche 2 is not completed completion of tranche 1 and tranche 2 is not conditional upon the approval of the private placement warrants at the egm the settlement of offer shares under tranche 1 and tranche 2 will remain final and binding and cannot be revoked or terminated by the respective applicants if the issuance of private placement warrants is not completed by applying for offer shares in the private placement the applicants allocated shares in tranche 1 have undertaken to vote in favor of the approval of tranche 2 and the private placement warrants at the egm advisors pareto securities as acts as

improvement adjusted ebitda was 15 0 million or 30 4 of revenue1 compared to 23 0 million or 45 0 of revenue1 in the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda decline was primarily the result of the

end of the second fiscal quarter of 2022 which is expected to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 37 million compared to fiscal 2021 the company expects to generally offset this impact with organic growth as well as the initial impact of the future forward program which benefits the second half of the fiscal year additionally in the second quarter the global pricing actions taken

understanding of allstate s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non gaap measures our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited adjusted net income is net income loss applicable to common shareholders excluding net gains and losses on investments and derivatives except for periodic settlements and accruals on non hedge derivative instruments which are reported with net gains and losses on investments and derivatives but included in adjusted net income pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses business combination expenses and the amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles income or loss from discontinued operations adjustments for other significant non recurring infrequent or unusual items when a the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years or b there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years related income tax expense or benefit of these items net income loss applicable to common shareholders is the gaap measure that is most directly comparable to adjusted net income we use adjusted net income as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations we believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the company s ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses business combination expenses and the amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles income or loss from discontinued operations and adjustments for other significant non recurring infrequent or unusual items and the related tax expense or benefit of these items net gains and losses on investments and derivatives and pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process business combination expenses and income or loss from discontinued operations are excluded because they are non recurring in nature and the amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles is excluded because it relates to the acquisition purchase price and is not indicative of our underlying business results or trends non recurring items are excluded because by their nature they are not indicative of our business or economic trends accordingly adjusted net income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business a byproduct of excluding these items to determine adjusted net income is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods adjusted net income is used by management along with the other components of net income loss applicable to common shareholders to assess our performance we use adjusted measures of adjusted net income in incentive compensation therefore we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income loss applicable to common shareholders adjusted net income and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance we note that investors financial analysts financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize adjusted net income results in their evaluation of our and our industry s financial performance and in their investment decisions recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management s performance we note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward looking valuation technique uses adjusted net income as the denominator adjusted net income should not be considered a substitute for net income loss applicable to common shareholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business the following tables reconcile net income loss applicable to common shareholders and adjusted net income taxes on adjustments to reconcile net income loss applicable to common

shareholders equity is a ratio that uses a non gaap measure it is calculated by dividing the rolling 12 month adjusted net income by the average of allstate common shareholders equity at the beginning and at the end of the 12 months after excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses return on allstate common shareholders equity is the most directly comparable gaap measure we use adjusted net income as the numerator for the same reasons we use adjusted net income as discussed previously we use average allstate common shareholders equity excluding the effect of unrealized net capital gains and losses for the denominator as a representation of common shareholders equity primarily applicable to allstate s earned and realized business operations because it eliminates the effect of items that are unrealized and vary significantly between periods due to external economic developments such as capital market conditions like changes in equity prices and interest rates the amount and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance underwriting process we use it to supplement our evaluation of net income loss applicable to common shareholders and return on allstate common shareholders equity because it excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period we believe that this measure is useful to investors and that it provides a valuable tool for investors when considered along with return on allstate common shareholders equity because it eliminates the after tax effects of realized and unrealized net capital gains and losses that can fluctuate significantly from period to period and that are driven by economic developments the magnitude and timing of which are generally not influenced by management in addition it eliminates non recurring items that are not indicative of our ongoing business or economic trends a byproduct of excluding the items noted above to determine adjusted net income return on allstate common shareholders equity from return on allstate common shareholders equity is the transparency and understanding of their significance to return on common shareholders equity variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods we use adjusted measures of adjusted net income return on allstate common shareholders equity in incentive compensation therefore we believe it is useful for investors to have adjusted net income return on allstate common shareholders equity and return on allstate common shareholders equity when evaluating our performance we note that investors financial analysts financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize adjusted net income return on common shareholders equity results in their evaluation of our and our industry s financial performance and in their investment decisions recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management s utilization of capital we also provide it to facilitate a comparison to our long term adjusted net income return on allstate common shareholders equity goal adjusted net income return on allstate common shareholders equity should not be considered a substitute for return on allstate common shareholders equity and does not reflect the overall

made in support of our refreshed strategy and our longer term outlook 01 34 iâ ll now hand it off to brent brent yeagy 01 37 thanks ryan iâ d like to start todayâ s call with an important announcement about the next step we are taking in our companyâ s transformation with our investors and other stakeholders we often talk about the momentous transition that happened in transportation logistics and distribution as the industry adapts to the compilation of forces 01 56 at wabash we see a different future reality in our competition in the context of social technological and logistic changes and weâ ve chosen to go down a substantially different path to reshape the industry and pull that future forward for our customers 02 11 there is no other truck body or trailer manufacturer that thinks the way we do that acts the way we do that is making the kind of changes prepare our customers for a very different world one that is coming fast and the forced disruption 02 26 on our last earnings call we announced the change of our company name from wabash national to wabash we signaled a strategic shift in our brand strategy today we re excited to reveal that wabash national and our family of brands have rebranded under one powerful wabash brand that unites our products our people and our customers and our business partners 02 48 as released in our 8 k disclosure in early january all legacy brands including supreme walker brenner bulk transcraft and benson will hence fourth share the market as wabash over the next year we will also introduce new brands to the market including a new brand for our proprietary molded structural composite technology which will go to market as econex technology one of the most environmentally conscious materials in the market to advance sustainability throughout the transportation logistics and distribution industries 03 22 moving on to capacity and product updates our in dry van capacity timeline remains on track given historic capacity constraints and associated production inefficiencies emerging sets of new customers with digital brokers and private fleets and trailer pools and a dealer network capable of further increases in sales we see this as a critical opportunity to grow our production capacity 03 48 while stakeholder questions about adding capacity during a period of elevated industry demand are certainly valid this additional drive van capacity is key to the growth of our entire portfolio through customer cross selling opportunities and strategically positions wabash for the next decade rather than just capitalizing on strong market conditions over the next few years 04 09 in terms of specific efforts to grow and diversify our revenue streams through product development during the fourth quarter we announced the launch of a new light duty refrigerated home delivering truck body that was developed in collaboration with the national grocer 04 23 we re excited to commercialize this new product that serves in a growing market with needed and desirable features like zones maximized cargo capacity and driver access 04 35 additionally the use of econex formerly known as allows our customers improved operating efficiency while also producing environmental impact with 25 to 30 thermal efficiency as well as reduced truck body weight 04 50 while our initial builds are on internal combustion engine chassis we expect this truck body to translate very well to electric chassis applications 05 00 additionally during the fourth quarter we announced the development kick off of the next generation walk in van to further broaden our product offerings in support of efficient delivery of items to the home 05 09 we have engaged the leading to utilize our combined expertise to optimize the product design and continue to leverage wabashâ s material technology expertise to offer a likely design we re looking forward to moving from development of validation and on the key customer testing later this year 05 28 additionally we have partnered with purdue university to enhance our speed in the market with these other projects we are excited to leverage produced expertise scenarios including advanced engineering material sciences and electrification to help bring solutions to market faster through the transportation logistics and distribution industries 05 47 it is clear that the refinement of our strategy and vision to focus on solutions for transportation with some distribution markets combined with customer alignment with an organizational structure had accelerated our internal rate of change and folks start development activities on innovative products and services that will create value for our targeted set of customers 06 08 wabash has always led the industry and product designs and a future weight reduction as a key customer benefit and in recent years that value proposition has gained increased customer focus as part of environmental impact in carbon reduction strategy 06 22 our products will continue to extend benefits like rate savings and thermal efficiency as competitive differentiators in a world that is likely has an increasingly prioritizing esg initiatives at an accelerated pace as one of the very few public companies among our array of competitors in different product segments we look at esg and corporate responsibility as different opportunities for competitive differentiation 06 46 our cross functional corporate responsibility team has brought us a long way in a very short period of time regarding our public disclosures on esg initiatives and i encourage you to review our latest sustainability report to learn more about our accomplishments in this important area 07 01 one new development i d like to highlight is wabash being recognized as one of america s most responsible companies by newsweek this ranking was compiled by evaluating information across environmental social and corporate governance areas to determine companies that take these responsibilities more seriously than others 07 19 we intend to keep pushing forward with a continuous improvement mindset on how wabash can continue to extend our leadership position on engaging with customers communities and other constituencies on these important topics and i look forward to talking more about this in our upcoming investor meeting 07 34 in addition to our corporate responsibility team i d also like to thank our board of directors for engagement and careful stewardship on esg matters employee engagement is critical but the involvement of our board directors allows us to push our commitment to the next level 07 49 moving on to market conditions and our backlog freight rates remain at strong levels for carriers throughout peak season and have continued to remain elevated in 2022 industry reports show strength in new trailer order activity during certain months in q3 and q4 and orders naturally tail off as order books have become practically full across the industry 08 11 overall our backlog ended the fourth quarter at approximately 2 5 billion up sequentially by approximately 600 million from the end of q3 this represents a 31 sequential increase in backlog or a 70 increase versus the same quarter of 2021 08 28 while our van business is essentially fully booked for 2022 our other transportation solutions products support higher than normal backlogs which continues to indicate constructive market demand conditions for 2022 08 42 as we ve executed well relative to our competition to contain any 2021 backlog slippage to the first quarter of 2022 we will continue to maintain a forward looking posture by collaborating with customers on longer term deals to include 2023 far from broadly opening up the order book the industry is well positioned to work in partnership with select customers who purchased from across our first to final mile portfolio the plans on how we best serve their demand for equipment in the future years while purposely maximizing the incremental capacity we bring online 09 16 our outlook for 2022 is essentially unchanged with a small suite at the revenue line and a moderate adjustment on the income statement for reduced amortization as a result of the changes to our product branding strategy 09 28 i ll let mike cover that in further detail but i d like to reiterate that we are looking at 2022 as a year where we can achieve significant revenue operating income and earnings per share expansion even if the supply chain shows no improvement as our backlog clearly indicates we have upside to our outlook at supply chain conditions have 09 50 i d like to conclude my comments by reinforcing how excited i am to announce our product brand strategy because the way wabash goes to market has undergone a considerable shift during my tenure as ceo and the refreshed brand strategy is the final piece of the puzzle 10 05 with accelerating innovation and product development activities shaped by the changing transportation landscape and intensified focus on sustainability i believe wabash is well positioned to move our industry forward 10 17 with that iâ ll ask mike to provide additional color on both our 2021 financial performance and our 2022 outlook mike pettit 10 25 thanks brent turning to our review of our quarterly financial results on a consolidated basis fourth quarter revenue was 479 million with new trailer and truck body shipments of 11 655 units and 3 230 units respectively 10 43 in terms of operating results consolidated gross profit for the quarter was 42 6 million or 8 9 of sales on a gaap basis the company recorded an operating loss of approximately 19 million this result includes a non cash charge for impairment of trade names and trademarks related to the retirement of legacy product brand names 11 05 on a non gaap basis adjusted for the non cash impairment operating income was 9 7 million or 2 of sales during the fourth quarter operating ebitda for the fourth quarter was 23 8 million or 4 8 of sales 11 21 finally for the quarter gaap net loss was 25 3 million or negative 0 51 per diluted share on a non gaap basis adjusted for impairment of trade names and trademarks as well as debt transaction costs net income was 3 7 million or 0 07 per share these quarterly results were somewhat below our expectations as the supply chain continued to struggle to support our production activity with issues temporarily causing acute disruption within certain product lines 11 53 additionally covid related spiked towards year end in relation to the omicron variant as we saw in late november and december increase well over rate experienced during the rest of 2021 12 07 from a segment perspective transportation solutions operating income of 80 million or 4 1 of sales parts and services revenue of 38 1 million and non gaap adjusted operating income of 4 4 million or 11 6 of sales 12 27 while operating cash outflows of approximately 7 million for the year shows the impact on working capital driven by significant year on year revenue growth i d like to point out that from q3 to q4 we generated 66 million of cash from operations as both accounts receivable and inventory declined 12 47 during 2021 our capital spending at 49 million investment in project that we expect to be highly impactful to our future growth initiatives 12 56 as a reminder in late september and early october we upsized our revolving credit facility by 50 million to 225 million and closed and issuance of 400 million in senior secured notes respectively 13 14 after repaying our previous senior notes and term loans our improved debt structure results in 3 million in annual interest expense savings and we began to see flow through during the fourth quarter 13 26 more importantly these transactions create a reasonably priced patient debt structure that allows us to invest in our business and enhances our opportunity to create value with a lower cost of capital 13 38 with regard to capital allocation during the fourth quarter we utilized 21 million for capital investments as spending on our incremental dry van capacity began 12 million to repurchase shares and paid our quarterly dividend of 4 million per share 13 57 our capital allocation focus continues to prioritize reinvestment in the business through growth capex while also maintaining our dividend and evaluating opportunities for share repurchase alongside of both our m a opportunities 14 11 moving on to our financial guidance for 2022 our prior outlook remains their expectation of the midpoint by 50 million to 2 3 billion while remaining conservative there are assumptions about the production activity current supply chain conditions will allow 14 31 we did add employees during q4 which will allow us to continue to increase line rates operating income increased versus our prior guidance result in a combination of lower amortization going forward as well as an accompanying increase due to the slightly improved revenue outlook 14 53 these changes result in our eps outlook ticking up to 1 75 from 1 70 per share previously i d like to reiterate that our guidance continues to assume no change in supply chain conditions as brent mentioned we believe our backlog that there is clear upside opportunity to our 2022 financial outlook should the supply chain improve 15 18 we also believe our parts and service segment will begin charting a path of sustainable growth during 2022 by prioritizing expansion of recurring revenue services grew revenue and operating income year over year by 27 million and 5 8 million respectively 15 36 i like to remind everyone that q1 tends to be our lowest quarter on terms of revenue and eps generation additionally we do expect q1 of 2022 to be the lone quarter over 2021 backlog pushed into 2022 resulting in an unfavorable margin mix compared to the remaining quarters of calendar year 2022 15 56 our expectations for the first quarter revenue to come in between 470 million and 500 million and to be between 0 10 and 0 15 per share from an eps perspective operating margin in our full year 2022 guidance is expected to approximately 6 and with continued growth next year we believe we can achieve our 8 operating margin target in 2023 16 22 in closing i believe we are well positioned to execute the next steps of our strategic plan while also continuing to serve strong near term customer demand for our first to final mile solutions our one wabash team has done an admirable job of embracing significant strategic and organizational change weâ re all excited to move forward under a unified product brand strategy knowing that we will be able to leverage the strength of our wabash brand name as we continue to grow our business with unique new products and services 16 53 i ll now turn the call back to the operator and will open it up for questions question and answer session operator 16 58 thank you and weâ ll take our first question from felix boeschen with raymond james felix boeschen 17 16 hey good morning everybody brent yeagy 17 18 good morning mike pettit 17 19 good morning felix boeschen 17 20 i wanted to start off on some of the comments around the backlog and sort of forward sales expectations but obviously the backlog is actually a little bit higher than your 2022 sales guidance as of now so iâ m just trying to understand and recall the incremental 200 million is there a chance that weâ d get booked in 2022 or is that specifically earmarked for 2023 at this point brent yeagy 17 45 yes thanks felix i ll take that one so as a whole has done a really outstanding job of constructing a backlog that gives us a tremendous amount of optionality and that was very purposeful on how we looked at managing the supply chain and available capacity in 2022 18 00 so with the guidance being predicated on the supply chain not getting better we wanted to make sure that did when it does we have the ability of pulling that backlog into 2022 assuming timing allows 18 20 so that gives us tremendous flexibility that s why we say there is â we constructed the backlog in a way to allow a constructive upside to be possible and we re working every day to see if we can make that happen felix boeschen 18 35 okay got it that s super helpful and then brent in the release you specifically mentioned some of the new pricing initiatives and specifically about and raw materials can you broadly comment on how that pricing change has been received by your customers and i just want to clarify is this exclusively on the trailer book or truck bodies also brent yeagy 18 58 yeah so first off let me say i am exceptionally pleased with how we are executing based on how our commercial group is executing our variable pricing model and how we ve been successful passing through incremental inflation even in the last 30 days as we manage component and other related price increases 19 20 so i feel very good about that it is primarily based where most of the work has been done to date on the van side of the business however we are implementing i will call it purposeful variations to that same mindset across the entire business throughout 2022 so we are managing well on that front felix boeschen 19 46 okay helpful and then just my last one maybe this was better from mike but just around the 1q guidance you mentioned that there would be some of the 2022 or 2021 backlog that s going into 2022 that is going to be a negative is there any way to quantify how much of the 1q sales is going to be a 2021 backlog and i kind of understand how we can isolate some of the mixed dynamics in that guide mike pettit 20 18 yes it is â i would say you could have a look at generally the shipment and build that we had in q4 is really the main piece that pushes into 2022 it s not a build and ship but it is going to be a headwind and so you ve got really two factors of much lower than what we ll see in q2 to q4 as the shipments are always a little bit lower in q1 and we have that overhang 20 57 i would say it s â of the build is going to be in the 5 to 10 range is what you have pushed in some of that ballpark brent yeagy 21 08 i ll add a little bit more beyond your question just anticipating others when we think about q1 as it carries forward not only do you have the i ll call it that s moderate margin headwind that mike is talking about when we think about q4 and what we shipped and how we execute on the production front the omicron reality did create a pretty forceful event in the december timeframe and just as the world and the united states is dealing with it that s continued through really the month of january we re now starting to see it trail off just as we re seeing it around the country 21 53 so that s another reason when we think about q1 being not only our most seasonal lowest quarter of the year leading into it as well there s nothing surprising about that based off of what s going on around the world felix boeschen 22 17 got it very helpful iâ ll stop there brent yeagy 22 19 thank you operator 22 24 next we ll go to justin long with stephens justin long 22 28 thanks and good morning brent yeagy 22 30 hi justin justin long 22 32 i wanted to ask about new trailer asp obviously a lot of momentum on that front any updated thoughts on how that metric could trend going into 2022 and if i look at the fourth quarter i know there s been the re segmentation but it looks like new trailer asp actually went up a good bit sequentially maybe 10 or so in the fourth quarter but margins in the transportation solutions segment actually went down so brent you may have answered this question a moment ago with omicron is that really what drove that discrepancy or is there anything else thatâ s contributing to that mike pettit 23 17 we continue to see into 2022 which we talked about that a lot in the q3 call we also mentioned that q4 would be the peak paying quarter of the price cost relationship so what you really are seeing is you re seeing the price starting to catch up but you still have that extra material cost in q4 that wasnâ t fully 100 priced in which we knew is going to happen in 2021 23 41 we believe most of that is behind us in 2022 if you continue to see the asp increase and the material costs will essentially flatten out is the best way to think about that also as you mentioned and brent mentioned omicron did get us in december which was some of the conversion costs 23 56 the majority of that margin you re seeing compression is on the material cost versus price relationship brent yeagy 24 01 yes i guess a little bit more on the omicron piece mike alluded to the fact that we ve been very successful in the last quarter bringing in additional headcount to meet our 2022 capacity plan requirements our supply plan requirements that happens â and that was very favorable in the context with the absenteeism rates spiking in december 24 25 the additional headcount that we brought in was able to mitigate that to some degree but it did preclude us from building the extra volume that weâ ve planned on getting from that all and conversion cost math when you think about the quarter right but the bright side of that is that we have labor in place we continue to add plan for all 2022 and while we re taking a little bit of conversion costs near term we re setting the table for full 2022 justin long 25 01 okay that makes sense and that s helpful guidance for the first quarter on the remainder of the year in terms of the cadence of eps and maybe where you re expecting to exit the year kind of what s embedded in the guidance once pricing catches up with cost mike pettit 25 31 yeah weâ re going to see is the big step up is going to be from q1 to q2 and that again some of the units that we push from q4 to q1 some of the omicron that brent mentioned so q1 in the lower shipments is going to be the lowest youâ ll see the big step up into q2 you ll see some moderate increase from there and then we get to q4 but it s going to be much more â much smoother eps profiles in q2 to q4 with a moderate step up and then if you calendarize q4 into 2023 that s when you can really start to see the eps power that it will have in 2023 justin long 26 06 okay and last question i had was just given the re segmentation can you give us some help around gross margin by segment and what s getting baked into the guidance for brent yeagy 26 21 obviously you re going to see a much larger step up in gross margin from 2021 in the transportation getting â that s where we have the real price material cost disconnect so you ll see that normalize in 2022 i don t expect to see a significant change in the gross margins on the parts and services business we re really happy with the steadiness of that business 26 47 underneath the hood i said in my prepared remarks but it s worth mentioning again is don t forget we divested the extract business last year and we discontinued some on site you see really nice growth into 2021 from continues so i don t expect a lot of margin improvement in that business but i would expect some pretty nice top line and bottom line growth in the parts and services business justin long 27 20 great thanks for the time brent yeagy 27 23 thank you justin operator 27 26 next weâ ll go to mike shlisky with d a davidson mike shlisky 27 39 hey guys good morning brent yeagy 27 41 good morning mike mike shlisky 27 43 so can you tell first off are there any unusual one time expenses that have to take place in 2022 as you rebrand all the other companies and all the other segments under the one wabash system mike pettit 28 00 no weâ ve took that whole charge in the q4 financials on our gaap presentation of the financials for q4 all of the charges related to the one wabash and branding changes in q4 there ll be some minor obviously signage and branding things but nothing as material to call out for 2022 mike shlisky 28 20 great maybe just a little deeper on that i was curious about the supreme brand change over as well i mean that s a pretty big well established company as you bought it a few years back and the brand name was really important there i know you had an impairment here but just tell us about a little bit like what are the steps youâ re taking to kind of ensure the old brand fades out the new brand comes in a way that doesn t challenge customer brand recognition or the way customers view those products brent yeagy 29 01 yeah this is brent what i would say is that when we took on this initiative to understand what was the right direction going forward we represent the company to all of our stakeholders we did a significant amount of third party research facilitated by outside partners to make sure that we had real data on what was the truth on the ground across that stakeholder group 29 31 the feedback has been overwhelming that when we think about how the strategy is being executed how to bring engineered solutions to the world the wabash brand is what carries now that does not take away necessarily from any of the brands that weâ ve had but to make sure that we have a one wabash approach that matches how we operate internally how we ll represent to the customer how we ll sell them versus the final mile solutions the wabash brand is what tested it was shown to carry across all of that 30 09 so we feel extremely comfortable based on feedback from our largest customers that move the needle that they are enthused as well as our dealer body is enthused with the direction that we re going so where we anticipated possible push back we got the opposite which was embracing of the idea mike shlisky 30 38 got it that s great color i also wanted to ask about the new upcoming walk in brand product that is a â market that s been can you give us a little more color as to how you intend to compete there is your product being relative with evs solely in mind will it be an only ev type product or do you plan to try and go chances that are out there today brent yeagy 31 08 let me answer the second part of the design application that we re working on would be compatible with all engine types or power going forward that was a key design criteria as we look to meet our customerâ s expectations yes thereâ s a limited amount of call it competitive entry into the specific space from a body type standpoint 31 36 how we approach this is really being pulled by our customers as we sell first to final mile we sold them a full portfolio they are asking us to get into this and provide a superior solution than what s being presented to â with different materials and to do it with a different mindset this is our entry into that space it is very holistic in the way that we re approaching it and so you can think about our portfolio strategy with customers 32 07 those would we most strategically aligned with that we are giving them very specific solutions to pull through to do the initial conversion of profit once we build a platform look at how we can broaden that to a larger market segment but we have our hands full just meeting the expectations asking us to do something different mike shlisky 32 36 got it got it well said thank you very much brent yeagy 32 40 thanks mike operator 32 43 as there are no further questions at this time i now turn the call back over to ryan reed for any additional or closing remarks ryan reed 32 50 thanks david and thanks everyone for joining us today we ll look forward to following up with you during the quarter operator 33 00 and that does conclude today s conference we thank you for your participation you may now disconnect

you for your cooperation at this time for opening remarks i would like to turn the conference over to the company s president and chief executive officer mr greg gantt please go ahead sir greg gantt president and chief executive officer good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call with me on the call today is adam satterfield our cfo after some brief remarks we will be glad to take your questions old dominion finished 2021 with outstanding fourth quarter financial performance that resulted in new company records for annual revenue and profitability the fourth quarter of 2021 was our fourth straight quarter with double digit revenue growth and the sixth straight quarter of double digit growth in earnings per diluted share we are encouraged by the momentum in our business and believe that we are uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2022 we can do this by continuing to execute on the same strategic plan that has driven our history of long term profitable growth this strategy is centered on our ability to deliver a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers the od family of employees worked through every challenge thrown its way in 2021 and continue to deliver best in class service while skillfully managing the 19 4 growth in our ltl shipments per day for the full year i can assure you that delivering on time without damage is a significant accomplishment with this type of volume growth that is why i m so proud that in 2021 we once again earned the mastio quality award which recognizes us as the national no 1 ltl carrier for the 12th straight year providing superior service not only allows us to win market share it also supports our long term pricing strategy we have consistently focused on improving our yields at the individual account level to both offset our cost inflation and support further investment in our business this approach has helped strengthen our financial position over time and allow us to do something that others in our industry have not consistently invest in new capacity we have historically invested 10 to 15 of our revenue in capital expenditures each year and we expect to spend approximately 825 million this year we believe consistent and long term investments in capacity are valued by customers as an integral component of quality service and these investments are also necessary to support our ongoing market share initiatives we simply never want our service center network to be a limiting factor to growth which is why we have spent over 1 8 billion over the past 10 years to expand our service center capacity across the nation we currently have approximately 15 to 20 of spare capacity in our network although our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes another 300 million to further expand our service center capacity to stay ahead of our anticipated growth curve there are of course two other ingredients in the capacity equation our fleet and our people we intend to spend 485 million for new tractors and trailers this year we would frankly like to spend more but we have been limited by several suppliers that are facing manufacturing challenges we are fortunate to enter the pandemic with one of the youngest fleets in our industry and as a result we can continue to use existing equipment that otherwise would have been replaced this year this strategy may continue to cost us a little more in maintenance and repair costs as it did in 2021 but we believe our current fleet and these additions will be sufficient to accommodate our expected growth as we have done in recent quarters we also expect to continue to utilize purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our equipment the final ingredient and the most important piece of our strategic plan is the investment that we continuously make in our people the od family of employees grew by 20 in 2021 which including adding over 1 700 drivers in a challenging labor market we expect that 2022 will be another big recruiting year for od while the labor market remains challenging we are confident in our ability to add to our team due to our outstanding company culture in addition we offer a rewarding pay and benefits package and soon expect to make company record discretionary contribution to our employees 401 k retirement plan our long term strategic plan is straightforward difficult for others to successfully replicate and build on itself year after year our success over the years has proven the flywheel effect of our strategic plan and we believe it will span even faster in 2022 we are encouraged by the opportunities ahead and we are confident that the disciplined execution of this strategic plan will produce further profitable growth and increase shareholder value thank you for joining us this morning and now adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer thank you greg and good morning old dominion s revenue grew 31 4 to 1 4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and our operating ratio improved 270 basis points to 73 6 the combination of these changes resulted in a 49 7 increase in earnings per diluted share to 2 41 for the quarter our revenue growth included a nice balance of increases in both volume and yields which were both supported by a favorable domestic economy we believe we are currently winning a significant amount of market share based on a comparison of our shipment trends with publicly disclosed information for other ltl carriers our ltl tons per day increased 14 3 and our ltl revenue per hundredweight increased 16 1 our ltl revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 9 2 due primarily to the success of our long term pricing strategy as well as changes in the mix of our freight on a sequential basis fourth quarter ltl shipments per day increased 0 1 over the third quarter of 2021 which compares favorably to the 10 year average sequential decrease of 3 5 ltl tons per day increased 2 4 as compared to a 10 year average sequential decrease of 1 7 these 10 year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison for january our revenue per day increased 25 7 as compared to january of 2021 this growth included a 7 7 increase in ltl tons per day and a 16 8 increase in ltl revenue per hundredweight our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 73 6 and once again included improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue within our direct operating costs productive labor as a percent of revenue improved 320 basis points which more than offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation the increase in our operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel we continued to use purchased transportation during the quarter to supplement the capacity of our workforce and our fleet and we expect to use a similar amount of these third party services in the first quarter we are very proud that our annual operating ratio of 73 5 surpassed our previous internal goal of 75 as we execute on a long term continuous improvement cycle for our operating ratio we intend to follow the same successful approach that we have in the past which is to focus on density and yield the spare capacity within our ever growing network allows us to drive additional volumes through our system which generally creates strong incremental margins at the local service center level we are confident in our ability to further improve our operating ratio and have dropped our internal goal another 500 basis points as a result we will now be focused on achieving an annual operating ratio in the 6s old dominion s cash flow from operations totaled 340 million and 1 2 billion for the fourth quarter and 2021 respectively while capital expenditures were 165 4 million and 550 1 million for the same period greg mentioned earlier that we currently expect capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately 825 million this total includes 300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long term strategic plan we would also increase our expenditures for new equipment if availability improves during the year we paid 23 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter while we did not utilize cash for share repurchases our 250 million accelerated share repurchase program remained active during the fourth quarter we utilized 691 4 million of cash for our shareholder return programs during 2021 and that consisted of 599 million for share repurchases and 92 4 million for cash dividends we were pleased that our board of directors approved a 50 increase for the quarterly dividend to 0 30 per share in the first quarter of 2022 our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 25 as compared to 25 1 in the fourth quarter of 2020 we currently expect an effective tax rate of 26 for 2022 this concludes our prepared remarks this morning operator we ll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time questions answers operator thank you and the first question will come from jack atkins from stephens please go ahead jack atkins stephens inc analyst ok great good morning guys and thanks for the longer term color on the new operating ratio target that s exciting so i guess for my first question if we could maybe kind of shorter term kind of focus on what you saw in january adam thanks for the trends from a tonnage perspective and a yield perspective but anything that you could maybe add was weather in the first couple of weeks in the month a little bit of a challenge we ve heard that the rise in covid cases in december and january presented some challenges for carriers just sort of curious if you could maybe comment on what you saw there sort of within the month and i ll follow up after that adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer sure and good morning jack there were several things impacting january and certainly every january we deal with weather it s not a onetime event and it s included in all of our 10 year average trends that we typically compare to similar to the effect of covid in certain months of last year when you only look on a one month period we did have some effect we felt like both directly and indirectly with customers that were impacted through labor shortages and so forth and so we saw a little bit of that impact as well during the month and we came off an incredibly strong december so to talk about december first a little bit just on a weight per day basis december s tons per day was down 1 1 our 10 year average is a decrease of 9 1 so from a sequential standpoint we felt like we were going to see that buildup in december coming off november that had a little bit of some of the same effects that we talked about earlier so we expected that but the timing of year end also had a little bit of effect of both helping december and then starting out that first day of january being a lot softer we don t typically get into these half day conventions and so forth like some others do but i would just say that first day of the month was certainly not a full normal day like what we saw for the remainder of the month so with all that said we still grew revenue at 25 we re really pleased to see that we saw a continuation of the strong yield trends continue and solid volume performance given all the factors that we just discussed jack atkins stephens inc analyst ok that s great to hear and thank you for that i guess maybe a longer term question adam i don t know if you want to take it or if greg wants to take it but i would just be curious to get your sense for the trajectory of the growth rate for the ltl market more broadly not just in 22 but over the next several years i think there s a sense that some folks have a concern maybe that some folks have that ltls have benefited from all the supply chain disruption maybe more so than others but there seems to be increased shipper demand for ltl capacity because of e commerce and a number of other factors you guys are investing for growth i would just be curious if you could maybe walk us through sort of your maybe your longer term perspective for the ltl market not just in 22 but over the next several years greg gantt president and chief executive officer jack i ll take a shot at that and i ll let adam add to this but you re right from what we have seen and from talking with our customers we expect continued growth it looks like if anything this e commerce is continuing to drive the ltl market and the industrial economy has been strong and everything that we see on the horizon is we expect continued growth hey i want to roll back to the covid question that you asked prior just for everyone s information and i m sure somebody else intends to ask this but we have seen our numbers go in the right direction over the last several weeks i think it s important to note i think we ve heard the same thing on the news as to what s happening around the country but our trend has been really positive over the last few weeks our cases are really down and it looks like from our perspective this thing could be dying out so hopefully that s happening everywhere and i think if it is that will sure be a boost to everything related to the economy and certainly to conducting business more as normal been a long time since normal but hopefully we can get back to that and i ll let adam add to that longer term growth question adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer jack i would just repeat what greg said and certainly feel like there continue to be tailwinds to the industry and we feel like the industry has already been growing above gdp and believe really that the industry as a whole could have grown more but we the industry continues to be capacity constrained and that s why we talk about the service advantages that we have in the marketplace as well as the capacity advantages that have driven much of our growth and we probably could have grown even faster this year but it s something that we ve certainly taken advantage of all the investments that we ve made over time we ve invested a lot in our network over 1 8 billion in the last 10 years growing our door count over 50 while our shipment count has grown over the last 10 years about 70 or so when you look at the other group of public carriers there s been a decrease in the number of service centers in the industry so and then for that reason the other carriers the total shipments managed by the group is pretty flat as well so we ll see how that continues to trend but there s service value that we add and i think our customers are starting to appreciate that more when they look through their supply chain in total in leveraging an ltl carriers network it s why it s so important that we continue with our yield improvement initiatives to continue to have the financial strength to invest further in our system to allow us to continue to grow with our customers because that s a big piece of the overall quality equation and that service value that we deliver they can call on us and they certainly are doing so when you look at our volume performance this year customers are increasingly calling on us to deliver for them because of capacity shortfalls that they re experiencing through either other carriers or other modes jack atkins stephens inc analyst ok that s helpful thanks again for the time operator the next question will be from jason seidl from cowen please go ahead jason seidl cowen and company analyst thank you operator thanks for taking my questions i wanted to focus a little bit on the yield side first the numbers you gave imply probably the largest sequential 1q increase we ve seen in a little bit of time i wondered if you could talk about contractual rate renewals and how they trended in 4q and how they re looking early on and then i want to chat a little bit about your length of haul growing again in 4q is that the type of business that you re winning out there in the marketplace or is there something structurally going on in the marketplace to lengthen that loh which you re seeing adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i think that on the length of haul just to address that piece of your question first it was a little bit longer we were at 944 miles in the fourth quarter but we ve been around 935 to 945 miles when you look longer term we ve seen length of hauls decrease we ve certainly seen this regionalization of kind of going back to the longer term question we believe this regionalization of the industry will continue and we re seeing good growth in our next day and second day lanes but the last couple of years there s been pockets of growth in different places we ve had tremendous growth off the west coast which typically has a little bit longer length of haul with it so there s just been some different growth and in different areas with certain customers that s moved it up a little bit but it s pretty much staying within a fairly consistent band and wasn t really expecting material change from where we are other than eventually getting back to seeing it decreasing a little bit and with regards to the yield performance for us we have a long term consistent strategy that focuses on trying to achieve yield improvement to offset our cost inflation each year and we need cost plus because again it gets back to supporting the investments that customers are demanding from us in additional real estate capacity as well as into our technologies as well from a revenue per shipment standpoint just getting away from the per hundred because certainly some of those metrics the change in weight per shipment the change in the length of haul both had the effect of increasing the revenue per hundredweight but our revenue per shipment excluding the fuel was up 6 and that was a good performance but overall we had to see some higher renewals kind of in the back half of the year our cost inflation on a per shipment basis in the back half of the year was a little bit higher than what we had anticipated the average cost per shipment for the full year would be and we ll see that trend a little bit higher in the first half of next year and then kind of normalize but certainly we re continuing to get increases to offset that cost inflation so those renewals in the back half of this year it s probably been a little bit higher than those in the first half of 2021 that is and so it s always just a continuous improvement cycle that we have we look at each account on its own operating merits the freight that we get and ways that we can improve yield and that s not always through price either so i think we ve been successful certainly when you look at that revenue per shipment and cost per shipment delta in the fourth quarter and really for the full year as well just reinforces that long term consistent approach that we ve strived for jason seidl cowen and company analyst appreciate the color thanks for the time again operator and the next question will be from scott group from wolfe research please go ahead scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks good morning adam can you share the yield trends ex fuel in january and then any thoughts on just that 1q or seasonality and how you re thinking about that adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer sure so the per hundredweight with the fuel as we said earlier was between 16 5 to 16 8 and without the fuel right at 11 so we re still seeing increasing rates really on the average price per gallon and as that increased through the year it s the average in january was up about 39 versus january of last year just for the national average there so that fuel price component is certainly picking up and going into both the that revenue component but also getting into the cost as well and certainly there s more than just the direct cost of diesel fuel that we use in our operations as fuel prices go higher that certainly works its way into tires and other components that we have to deal with so anything that s sort of fuel related we ll see that same type of inflation on with that said and in regards to our costs typically the fourth quarter to first quarter sequential is about 100 basis point deterioration now one thing to say before i get into a little bit more detail about that is typically that includes kind of a flattish when you look at the insurance and claims line kind of flat performance from 4q to 1q we had a benefit in the fourth quarter as you could see on that insurance and claims line and that mainly comes from the actuarial assessment that we do each year that was only 0 7 where we averaged 1 1 to 1 2 in the first three quarters of 21 we expect that number to go back up to about 1 2 in the first quarter give or take so we ve got a little natural drag if you will versus the our normal sequential performance if you will with that said however we re still targeting about 100 basis points of change there and plus or minus certainly that s just one specific number but i think that given the strong revenue performance i think that we can offset much of that so maybe 80 to 120 basis points to give us a little range there will be what we re trying to target achieving in 1q certainly the 1q performance when you look at the average a lot goes into that the revenue effect like we mentioned earlier can be a little different from one period to the next and certainly there s the costs that come in there s not as consistent performance from 4q to 1q like there is in maybe some of the other quarters just given the natural disruption that happens in those periods but that natural disruption goes into that 10 year average scott group wolfe research analyst very helpful and then just last one if i look over the last five years your operating ratio has improved about 200 basis points a year on average do you think that s a realistic way to think about either 22 or the next several years i m just trying to think about when realistically you can get to that sub 70 or adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes we didn t put a time line per se because really we re looking for profitable growth each year and some years we get a little bit more revenue contribution some years we get a little bit more margin contribution they all go into that profitable growth line and we pretty much played 2021 like a piano and got a little bit of both revenue and margins so we are pleased to see that and that followed a very successful 2020 so the five year of 200 bps is probably a little bit stronger given the performance in 18 as well when you look over a longer term it s been more in the 100 to 150 basis points and we talk about 10 year sequentials from quarter to quarter and that s probably been more in that long term but right now demand continues to be incredibly strong so we certainly are expecting another very solid revenue performance year this year and we re going to be investing dollars investing significantly for headcount growth as greg mentioned so we can continue to give the same service that our customers expect and we re going to be adding to our fleet and into our network so there s a lot of investment that goes into continuing to take advantage of the market share opportunities that we feel are out there so it s not we re not going to give a specific goal for what we think we can do in 22 but certainly the focus will be to produce as much profitable growth as we can scott group wolfe research analyst appreciate the time guys thank you operator the next question is from jordan alliger from goldman sachs please go ahead jordan alliger goldman sachs analyst i was just very curious obviously demand is very strong for ltl you do start to face some pretty tough comparables as you get into the second quarter particularly around volumes so if industrial production grows 3 5 4 this year i mean how do you think about high level sort of ability to grow tonnage i assume on a full year basis but looking past the first quarter the second how you may be thinking about those more challenging comps adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer jordan you broke up a little bit so i don t know if i missed anything at the start but just in regards to the volume environment again it just gets back to the underlying strength of demand and certainly that s all the customer feedback that we ve been hearing coupled with capacity issues in other places of our customers supply chain when we look at the economic trends we feel like that we would expect continued strength with our industrial related customers as well as the ongoing strength with our retail related customers as well so we re used to tough comps if you will given our long term revenue performance over the last 10 years that s pretty much we ve produced about 11 average growth in revenues and even though we ll follow up what would have been a record growth year of 1 2 billion of new revenue produced last year we certainly have got big expectations for 22 just given all those factors so we ll see how the comparisons work out and i think that if you just assumed normal sequential trends that would still put us at kind of the high single digit low double digit type range operator and the next question will be from tom wadewitz from ubs please go ahead tom wadewitz ubs analyst yes i wanted to ask you about i guess price and i don t know if you want to refer to like contract renewals but i think you saw some acceleration in price through the year in 21 maybe you see that stay elevated in the first half and kind of ease in second half but i wanted to see if you could offer some kind of high level thoughts on where maybe where contract renewals were in fourth quarter and what you think the profile looks like on price in 2022 and then i had a follow up on cycle question adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes tom we ve kind of just stopped talking about contractual renewals because i somewhat feel like that s obviously a very big piece of the overall revenue equation about 25 of our business is on our tariff business and certainly the majority being on contract but it seems like it s a talking point from the others in the industry that doesn t always reconcile with necessarily what you see out of the yield performance but it all just sort of goes into it whether it s price increases other operational changes that drive yield and so forth and the things that we look for and i will say that like i mentioned earlier we expect our we saw higher cost per shipment in the back half of last year we expect our cost per shipment this year to probably be on a net basis maybe in the 4 5 to 5 range and that s excluding all the effects of fuel but it s going to be weighted heavier we re going to see higher cost per shipment inflation in the first half of the year and then think that some of those expenses normalize when we get into the back half and start lapping over where we ve recently been seeing inflation in our business so with that said certainly the contracts that mature in the first half of the year they didn t have as much of an increase last year so they will probably get a little bit more and then those in the back half that maybe got a little bit higher increase reflecting what the actual cost trends were in the back half of 21 may not see as much but overall the focus continues we ve got to look at how our cost inflation is trending and then try to target 100 150 basis points above that we did the january numbers i didn t miss this earlier but we did take our general rate increase which is on our tariff business that was effective at the beginning of january so that was a part of that yield performance that we ve already seen to start off the year tom wadewitz ubs analyst so you think you moved back in the second half of the year toward kind of more normal annual ltl pricing call it mid single digits is that a reasonable expectation if you look toward kind of second half of the year adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer well again i think that we ve got to look at how our cost inflation at that time is trending and if we re seeing some normalization in that point then the expectation comes back but at the end of the day we ve got to look at each customer s account the revenue inputs and the cost inputs in terms of what we re actually seeing and how the account is operating and look at ways to drive improvement in that customer s operating ratio if we can do that by price that s one way to look at it there may be other operational changes new pieces of business that we may get different factors that can overall drive an improvement for us we re looking at driving a continuous improvement cycle in each customer account and that a customer account builds up to each individual service center and those built to the company so certainly we re looking to improve the operating ratio and that s how you got to go about tackling it tom wadewitz ubs analyst ok that makes sense if i can ask one more i guess for greg how do you think about the cycle and with respect to it seems like historically you probably have some give back in a cycle where you ve had strength in ltl in the site truckload market and truckload loosens that there might be some impact in the cycle historically do you think that it s reasonable to expect that this time i mean it does seem like ltl has been the one mode that could add capacity and it would be natural to think some ltl freight in the market maybe not for od but in the market goes back to truckload later this year or next year do you think that s right or is that is it going to be different maybe this time greg gantt president and chief executive officer tom i can tell you we don t have any volumes at this point in time to go back to truckload i think if you look at what we ve done and what we ve been able to take out over the course of time due to capacity restraints and whatnot most of those type volumes are out of our network at this point in time so i don t i think the environment for us from that standpoint is extremely positive as far as we can see through 2022 certainly things change as you go through the year but right now i don t see any volume going over the truckload at all not from our standpoint and as adam has mentioned numerous times we re continuing to add capacity i would expect that we ll be on a strong trajectory all year long tom wadewitz ubs analyst thank you operator and the next question will come from amit mehrotra from deutsche bank please go ahead amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst yeah good morning i just wanted to clarify one question i guess from jordan earlier you talked about high single digit low double digits maybe i didn t catch it was that first quarter full year was it tonnage with the shipment what are you exactly referring to on high single digit low double digits adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer i wasn t giving any specific guidance there i was just basically saying that if you assume normal sequential trends in our tons that would about be if you just roll them out quarter by quarter what the year might look like but certainly at this point we feel like just like what we saw last year that the demand is so strong out there and we ll see how the year progresses in the past we ve typically had probably about six quarters or so when you look through past growth cycles we typically have had six or so quarters where we significantly exceed our 10 year trends and then it kind of reverts back to the average and the average sequential performance for us includes a lot of market share wins going back to my previous comment we ve grown our shipments over the past 10 years around 70 so those 10 year trends include a lot of market share and we certainly think that given the comparison of our volumes that we ve seen to the industry for the third quarter that s kind of the way things have trended we have the spare capacity that s out there that we try to invest ahead of the curve so that the network is not a limiting factor and we can help our customers grow when we get into the strong demand period so we ll see how the quarter by quarters trend trended as we work our way through 22 but the one thing we ll say is that the underlying demand has not changed it was consistently strong through 21 and the customer conversations that we have today indicated that that strength is going to continue for the foreseeable future amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst yes so that was just more of a tonnage commentary by extrapolating current trends and kind of where the year shakes out ok so i get that so the other question i had is incremental door capacity in 2022 obviously all this new capacity that you re putting online doesn t come on on january 1 and so any help around what the kind of incremental store capacities from these investments pro rata for when they actually come online in 22 and even 23 if you could talk about that adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes we i think we ve said before that we intend to add somewhere in the neighborhood of eight to 10 service centers this coming year we don t necessarily always share the door detail for example but when we look we don t give it year by year more for strategic reasons but if you look over the last 10 years we ve expanded the door count by about 50 in total so as greg mentioned before we ve got about 15 to 20 spare capacity in the network we were fortunate that we started out the 21 in a really good spot so despite the 19 4 growth that we had in shipments during the year we were still able to keep a fair measure of spare capacity out there so we ll continue to build on that level we ve got a few other things that will happen earlier in the year those were projects that already have been in the works and some that we thought we might have been able to finish by the end of the year but so we ll get some new capacity out there on the service center side pretty early and we ll be adding to it pretty consistently throughout the year amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst ok i wanted to come back i think to scott s question on long term margin improvement i want to kind of approach it a little bit different way if i could i mean adam you ve talked about direct and indirect costs as a way to kind of articulate the inherent operating leverage in the business i think it was like 25 previously you ve obviously made the cost structure looks different now given the progress that you ve made and the pricing initiatives to a certain degree but wondering it seems like the new baseline operating leverage is kind of 30 plus versus that 25 i don t know if you would agree with that or if that s the right baseline to use that can maybe help infer our pace of margin improvement going forward adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer sure yes we ve talked about the cost structure in previous quarters and effectively our total direct costs for last year were about 55 of revenue and our overhead was around 19 of revenue and so some of that overhead maybe 5 is also variable in nature so when you look at the total variable cost and that structure that revenue growth can give us the incremental margins in the 35 to 40 range in a short period of time and certainly we did i think 39 for all of last year so really strong operating leverage year for us but our story like i said it s not just all margin improvement we want to continue to build up the network to take advantage of the market share opportunities we feel are out there and we want to keep growing the top line which takes investment and so we know that we need to continue to invest to keep taking advantage of that revenue growth opportunity and so that that may cause some quarters that the incremental margin might not be in that 35 to 40 range and that s ok that s why we don t manage the business to an incremental margin per se we re going to do the right things right that we feel like build out the network to allow us to keep achieving the top line growth and have the ultimate effect of also driving long term margin improvement for us amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst it makes sense ok thank you very much appreciate the time operator thank you and the next question will come from jon chappell from evercore isi please go ahead jon chappell evercore isi analyst thank you good morning i m just going to combine a couple into one because they re kind of all related adam trying to talk about market share on this call and in the press release is there any way to quantify how your market share how much you ve taken effectively from the ltl pie over the last call it five years and as you look at your service center growth for this year and i m sure you re not completely in tune with what everyone is doing but you probably have a pretty good sense for the market how much do you think that you re set up to take this year and the second part of it is as you think about these market share gains that you ve won especially in the last 12 months have these been kind of just traditional contract duration traditional customers but given the tightness in capacity across the entire logistics here are you winning kind of longer term contracts new types of customers as you ve taken share recently greg gantt president and chief executive officer yes i think our biggest wins have come from our ability to service the customers as they see the need i mean a lot of our competitors just haven t been able to provide the capacity that we have and that s in my opinion as to why we ve taken the share that we have just to get back to that share growth over the last five years adam you may need to help me here but i was pretty say it s pretty fair to say we ve been growing about that share about 1 a year it s kind of a creep if you will it s not really a leap by any stretch but it is has been very consistent and we continue to see that as we go as far as the service center network and whatnot adam mentioned we re looking at 8 to 10 this year we ve got quite a few in the process now the good thing is some of those are fairly large there s a couple of big ones in there that will give us quite a few additional doors so i think we re going to be in a good spot as i ve mentioned over the last several years on all of our calls i think we talk about the places where we re challenged and we still got places that are a challenge to expand and whatnot but we do have some guidings working and i think we re going to be better off as the year progresses so we see how the growth trends and whatnot but i think we re in a really good spot and i would expect that that work is going to pay off for us jon chappell evercore isi analyst great thank you guys operator and the question will come from todd fowler from keybanc capital markets please go ahead todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst hey great thanks and good morning i was wondering if you could comment a little bit headcount has been growing faster than shipment count for the past couple of quarters and i understand there s probably some catch up there what s your expectation for headcount growth into 22 and also relative to shipment count and then just any general comments on labor availability thanks greg gantt president and chief executive officer todd certainly we re trying to add labor as we speak there it has been a challenge as i mentioned before but we have been able to successfully add folks and right now we have needs certainly as we get into the stronger parts of our season later in the spring and certainly through the summer and into the fall we need to continue to add folks without a doubt so i would expect that those trends would pretty much mirror our shipment growth and tonnage growth so i don t expect that to be a whole lot different but yes we need to add and those efforts are certainly underway at this point todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst but greg or adam could you i mean you care to kind of put like a finer point i mean should the spread between headcount growth and shipment count start to narrow or do you expect to continue to try and add in front of the shipment growth for the next kind of foreseeable future adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i think that we finally just sort of caught back up with it at the tail end of 21 i mean we would expect to see probably the headcount a little bit stronger than the shipment count certainly probably for the first half of this year but even when you look over the longer term those two numbers kind of work in concert with one another they re pretty matched evenly and i think that really the top line is what dictates it todd and certainly last year really going back to 2020 once the recovery began which for us was in may we were pretty much playing catch up we ve had this tremendous volume performance really unlike anything we ve ever seen with the fourth quarter being higher than the third i mean just really tremendous recovery since that drop in april of 2020 so we ve continued to add people really at levels above what the normal sequential trends in headcount would be i think that will continue in the first quarter and until we get back to the levels where we can support the freight that we re seeing but we ve got to match it too with the equipment base that we have and so it s just something that we ve got to manage through as we work our way through the year but as long as we keep seeing that top line performance and strength coming at us we re going to continue to try to hire and have the right people in the right place that is efficiently operating keeping our service metrics best in class and taking care of our customer and the lever that we ll continue to pull and we think that we ll have to keep using this in 22 will be the purchase transportation and we ve had to utilize that i think probably every quarter as we worked our way through last year we talked about trying to get away from it and ultimately we do we want that number to revert back to that old 2 to 2 5 that was there for our canadian operation in our truckload brokerage business where we ve got 100 of our line haul network in sourced and we re using our people and our equipment to service our freight but until then we ve got some good partners and they re continuing to deliver within our service expectations and keep our service metrics best in class and really just helping us to be able to grow the top line so we ll continue to pull that lever while we have to todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst well adam my follow up was on purchase transportation and kind of the expectations and the service so you covered that one for me i ll pass it along thanks for the time operator and the next question will come from bascome majors with susquehanna please go ahead bascome majors susquehanna international group analyst yeah thanks for taking my questions on the real estate expansion as some of your peers become more eager to invest in growth like you ve been doing for quite a time here are you starting to see more competition locations that you d like to expand in or is it really just you versus broader industrial real estate greg gantt president and chief executive officer yes it s certainly the latter bascome just i don t know that it s the competition for real estate generally speaking it s just being able to find the real estate that we need and being able to get it owned and get the building done sometimes you can find the land and perhaps you ve got to jump through to get it zoned and meet all the building requirements and all those different things but trust me there s a lot of challenges out there from a real estate standpoint it s not easy as we ve grown and as we require bigger and bigger facilities to meet our needs and to plan for years down the road it s just gotten more and more difficult but certainly there is some competition in certain locations and i ve talked about that numerous times before but the competition in certain markets is definitely tougher than others some places it s still relatively easy we can find and meet our needs but there are some that again they re rather challenging if you will bascome majors susquehanna international group analyst and to that point you mentioned a couple of locations would be particularly large adds this year can you talk to the geography or timing of those greg gantt president and chief executive officer yes one of those is in the northeast that we ve owned for several years now it s been it was occupied with tied up with the lease we should get that late this year sometime it s up in northern pennsylvania we own it today but it s not available for the time being but we will get i think about midyear we ll probably have a little work to do to get it up and running but that should come on late this year we ve got another fairly large facility in southern minneapolis the southern part of minneapolis to help us better serve that area we re up on the north side now and certainly with the growth that we ve had in that market we need to have another facility in the south it s getting close i think we re just a couple of months away from opening that we re working on a big one that s well underway in kansas city that will give us another additional fair amount of doors so we ve got a lot of irons in the fire around the country and a lot of good things working so again i think we re pretty well positioned from that standpoint got a few others that i ll probably rather not talk about at this point but a lot of work going on in the real estate department that s for sure bascome majors susquehanna international group analyst thank you operator and the next question will be from ken hoexter from bank of america please go ahead ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey great good morning greg and adam thanks for getting me in here just a real quick adam to clarify the your target you said moving from 75 to 500 basis point improvement to 70 and then you talked about sub 70 can you just kind of clarify what the target is and outlook there adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer sure it s i mean 70 is the target but we want to see something start with the 6 so it will be a 69 or whatever we get to when we cross that line we obviously blew through the 75 this year pretty strong and have got a good jump on making our way toward that 70 goal but nevertheless that s the goal if you will at a raw 70 but seeing an or start with a six ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst and i think it s still fairly balanced between pricing cost just as you ve been doing but you mentioned in the opening comments some maybe seeing some scale of maintenance cost increases as you kind of extend the life of the fleet can you talk about the impact of that we should see in the near term or this year adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer well i mean there s some trade offs there and when you look at the depreciation expense for example we re seeing some improvement there that was at 4 7 of revenue and that typically runs quite a bit higher so we re seeing some increased maintenance costs if you will to maintain our fleet our average fleet age is up to five years now for our power equipment it s been as low as 3 5 years when you look over the last five seven years or so and so it s certainly a bit higher than what we would like to see and but there s also a little bit of a drag just in total operating supplies and expenses on the fuel element the older equipment is not as fuel efficient as the newer equipment so that s just something that we ve got to keep balanced we ll probably see once we can start replenishing the fleet at the levels that we would like to we ll see some incremental depreciation costs that will come online that will somewhat offset the costs that we re seeing in operating supplies and expenses but it will offset some of the purchased transportation costs that we re seeing and certainly i m sure you re familiar with the truckload rate environment is pretty strong right now so those loads that we are moving with third parties we re paying a pretty fair price for ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst lastly for me just adam i know you said that the peers hadn t been growing kind of looking back but i guess somewhat backward as we ve heard a lot from the carriers they re starting to talk about growing real estate even arcbest xpo talking door and service center ads that we hadn t heard in a while does that give you or greg any thoughts on potential pricing pressure that we haven t seen in the past greg gantt president and chief executive officer i wouldn t i don t think so i don t think so we just got to keep doing our thing and providing value to our customers and i don t see that as a negative certainly adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer and generally speaking i think that i can t speak for everyone and we don t really know other than what we hear from customers but we anticipated that we would see capacity issues with the industry this year just based on some internal computations that we go through and we started hearing that before we got to midyear before the real rush began and so i think that there s probably some needs out there like i mentioned we still feel like the industry is growing and when you look over the last 10 years there s been a couple of other carriers that have also increased their market share i think that the industry revenue is continuing to consolidate with the larger national non union providers and we think that that trend will continue in the future but certainly we ve got service advantages as well and it all comes back to the service value you deliver for your customer and we think we ve got an unmatched value proposition that wins market share for us and we re going to continue to execute and keep giving the very best service to our customers and we think that that will drive the market share and fill in the real estate capacity that we continue to expect to add ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst great stuff appreciate the time operator thank you and the next question is from chris wetherbee from citigroup please go ahead chris wetherbee citi analyst hey hey thanks for taking my question maybe just a follow up on that last point about the market and competitive dynamics i guess i m just trying to make sure i understand how you guys might respond to the extent that there is maybe a larger push by some of your competitors into the market you guys have always been extraordinarily disciplined with the way you approach the market i m guessing in a scenario where maybe some of your competitors get a bit more aggressive to expand and obviously there s a lot of demand out there so i don t know what necessarily has it an impact on the pricing dynamic but i guess i think i know the answer to this but i m kind of curious of your take on how you would adapt to a market which might actually see more sort of push for market share from some of your competitors than we ve historically seen over the last several years adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer well i think what we d expect chris is that the industry has been very price disciplined really going back to the last slowdown in 2016 and so i think that we ve seen some margin improvement by some of those other carriers if they don t have capacity maybe they ll continue to follow our lead in terms of continuing to consistently try to increase price when you look at the current environment much of the revenue growth is coming by yield from other carriers i go back to the third quarter performance we grew our shipments 19 on average the public carrier group was up 1 so that wide delta in volume growth we want to have that volume contribution and we ve got the capacity to grow both volumes and yields whereas we ve seen in prior growth periods like 2017 2018 what we ve seen this year or 2021 rather the other carriers that don t have barely any capacity to grow throughout the entire system just take advantage of the strong demand and increase yields which if they re increasing fast for us because again our pricing approach is one that s long term and consistent customers know what to expect if other carriers are increasing the rates faster than us and closing some of that price gap that service value looks better and better and so i think that s what we ve seen in the past it s what we would continue to expect to see to see that wide outperformance if you will against the other public carrier group data that we see on average chris wetherbee citi analyst got it that s very helpful thanks for the time i appreciate it operator and the next question is from bruce chan from stifel please go ahead bruce chan stifel financial corp analyst hey good morning gentlemen thanks for squeezing me in here i know you mentioned that there s no truckload for to give back the cycle and that s good to hear but as we think about some of your comments earlier adam around regionalization and secular growth in e commerce how are you thinking about your freight mix characteristics and then do you think you can kind of keep those as they are or do you think there may be some pressures on length of haul and shipment density as you start to grow your share and expand your network over time adam satterfield senior vice president finance and chief financial officer yes i mean it s certainly we constantly communicate with our customers including third party logistics companies to try to navigate through and foresee the types of changes that are coming down the line that goes into some of our thinking in terms of how we expand our service center network and where we re building facilities so we certainly foresee some of those changes that have been happening over the last 5 10 years continue i think they ve all been favorable trends for the ltl industry and i think we re certainly maybe benefiting more than anyone and the reason for that and some of how we think some of this market share growth we ve seen recently will be very sticky is that there s an increased premium that s being placed on service quality and when you think about especially as low as inventory balances are right now shippers have got to get their product on the shelves and so they re increasingly relying on a carrier that can give 99 on time service performance and not have damages and if you re delivering into one of the big retailers that have these chargeback programs in place then it puts some even more importance if you will on that service value so that s how we re winning share in that retail segment of the market certainly we ve still got our healthy mix of industrial freight and think that that will continue to grow as well but we re really winning across all segments if you will with direct industrial and retail related customers and seeing tremendous growth with our third party logistics customers as well so but we think that those trends are going to continue and the importance on total service value will continue to rise operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to greg gantt for any closing remarks greg gantt president and chief executive officer well thank you all for your participation today we appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything

wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer thanks scott good morning and thanks for joining us our q4 performance exceeded expectations we re excited to share what 2022 will bring no doubt 2021 was a challenging and rewarding year all rolled into one while the global pandemic s ebbs and flows continued to impact our markets we accomplished a lot performance accelerated across the year we exited 2021 on a high note earning our highest quarterly revenues and margins of the year in the fourth quarter this was largely due to the solid foundation our teams laid in 2020 and early 2021 on an adjusted basis we earned 0 25 per share building on our return to profitability in the third quarter and well ahead of expectations for the full year 2021 ebitda margins were 10 4 only 30 basis points below full year 2019 and that s despite 32 lower revenues it s a strong statement of what we ve accomplished transforming our business to emerge stronger from the downturn the team executed for our customers at the highest level while maintaining lean cost structures this gives us confidence that continued strong financial performance is ahead don will share more details about our financial performance in a few minutes but i wanted to give you the great news upfront let s start with the progress we made on our strategic initiatives in the quarter first we ve been on a glide path to fully fund our defined benefit pension obligations this will ultimately eliminate annual cash contributions and expenses our pace of progress significantly accelerated in 2021 we ended the year at an 84 funded status up from 75 at year end 2020 we took further action to reduce plan participation through another third party annuitization we re working from every angle to eliminate this financial obligation the end of our pension saga is near next we ve been laser focused on generating cash and maintaining a healthy level of total liquidity throughout the pandemic in the face of significant uncertainty a year ago we shared our 2021 goal to achieve positive free cash flow excluding pension contributions we achieved that goal in the fourth quarter we generated over 230 million of free cash flow as a result we ended the year with over 1 billion in cash and liquidity third earlier this morning we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million of ati stock with our strong cash and liquidity position and our current stock price we strongly believe that it s the right time and the right method to return cash to shareholders while scott might kick me under the table i ll take this opportunity to advertise our upcoming investor day on february 17th where we ll share our long term top line bottom line and cash generation targets as well as more details on our capital allocation strategy i hope that you ll all join us at that virtual event all right back to the script our progress on our strategic initiatives lastly we continue to make progress on the transformation of our specialty rolled products business what we call srp we updated you on our targets last quarter and we re on track to complete the footprint consolidation and exit standard stainless sheet product sales by midyear 2022 we ve made significant progress toward this goal in two ways first product mix enrichment in the fourth quarter 96 of srp sales were high value products that s a big difference from a few years ago and the product mix and margin benefits from this effort are expanding standard stainless inventory continues to dwindle we intend to deliver the remaining amount over the next several months and to be clear we re no longer melting or producing new standard stainless sheet products second footprint consolidation since year end we ve sold our facility in pico rivera california when we announced the srp transformation just 14 months ago we said we would reduce the footprint by five facilities with this sale we ve completed three of those five we ll complete the remainder of the consolidation in the next few months in a moment don will share the aa s segment financials where the srp business unit accounts for a majority of the revenues spoiler alert they are much improved and poised to get even better so in short we have a clear strategy to become an aerospace and defense leader in 2021 and especially in the fourth quarter our progress toward achieving our goals has been substantial now let s talk about our recent performance by end market as well as where we re headed i ll start with our core market jet engines the industry s long predicted recovery has begun in earnest the positive impacts are expanding within ati our forgings growth began early in 2021 on the material side there have been a lag as customers work through excess inventory that rapidly changed in q4 demand for jet engine materials snapped back to support increasing oem build rates origin customers were low on inventory here s an industry stat that helps put this expanding production ramp into perspective the industry s jet engine orders in november 2021 were the highest monthly total since june of 2019 and that s almost exclusively for narrowbody engines this time around as wide body production rates are still low one more stat this time ati focused our 2021 isothermal forging sales nearly doubled year over year largely driven by our share gains what s especially astounding about this accomplishment we achieved this level despite producing leap 1b parts only in the last four months of the year and with low wide body demand that s a clear sign that good news is on the horizon for both the aerospace industry and ati looking ahead we expect continued strong forgings and materials growth as our customers increase narrowbody production rates in 2022 and 2023 there s a road map for boeing 737 max to return to service in china global domestic air travel rates continue to improve albeit with a short term negative blip due to the omicron variant allow me a moment to congratulate the team at our iso forging center of excellence in wisconsin our fourth iso press commissioned in 2021 has achieved all necessary customer qualifications we ll be putting that tremendous press to good use for our customers going forward the team worked hard to achieve this milestone we celebrate their efforts and look forward to the results that will lead to a strong return on investment for that new asset thank you to our outstanding team moving to airframes where market demand remains subdued international travel rates are still well below 2019 levels due to the effects from the global pandemic and ever changing travel restrictions country by country on a positive note we showed sequential revenue growth due to a large discrete commercial space order that we expect to complete in q1 2022 we believe the airframe market is at or at least very near the low point we expect essentially flat underlying demand in 2022 for ati we have a few modest tailwinds that should benefit our 2022 performance first accelerating growth from the european airframe oem that began in 2021 and second we ll see new business from a producer of an electric autonomous aircraft taxane technology for use with narrow body airplanes in the defense market sales in comparison to prior periods were mixed this was largely due to the timing of long lead time orders in our naval nuclear market and the sale of our flowform product line in mid 2021 to help normalize the impact from quarterly timing variations full year 2021 defense sales across all sectors were up a little more than 1 if you remove the impact from the flowform sale revenues improved by nearly 5 our full year growth was largely driven by increased military jet engine products and the naval nuclear materials which more than offset the temporary project gap in ground vehicle armor in 2022 we expect continued growth the current budgets for the departments of defense and energy provides funding for programs of ati s key customers this anticipated expansion will be led by a recovery in vehicle armor as new abrams tanks are produced and the u k ramps up its ajax program continued strong funding for hypersonics where ati plays an increasingly expansive role will provide more long term growth opportunities now let s talk about ati s other markets where we support critical applications that leverage our aerospace and defense capabilities and capacities first up is energy where oil and gas markets generally improved and specialty energy markets broadly declined oil and gas sales were driven by the final shipment of nickel alloy materials for a large pipeline project off the coast of brazil we also saw increased drilling activity associated with higher oil prices and strong end user demand while we anticipate oil and gas sales to be lower in the first quarter largely due to the completion of the discrete fourth quarter pipeline project we expect strong underlying market fundamentals to continue we anticipate more offshore pipeline projects to be sourced in 2022 and ati will remain competitive as nickel alloy markets tighten specialty energy markets declined versus both prior periods for two primary reasons first after robust q3 results asian land based gas turbine sales were lower second reduced pollution control demand in india resulting from pandemic induced project delays in 2022 we anticipate pollution control projects to restart in india and underlying land based gas turbine demand to remain strong in asia improving from q4 levels lastly the electronics and medical markets are smaller for us but we saw demand growth continue electronics sales grew significantly for our hafnium based materials coupled with ongoing solid demand within our asian precision rolled strip business looking ahead we expect electronics demand remain strong in 2022 medical market sales rebounded sharply from prior year hospitals reopened for elective surgeries they also resumed installation of new and maintenance of existing mri machines the near term outlook for medical markets is being modestly impacted by the current omicron surge reducing hospital capacity for non covid related care that said underlying medical equipment demand remains solid looking forward to 2022 and what ati can deliver for our shareholders customers and dedicated employees our markets are recovering well by concentrating on the things under our control in 2020 and 2021 we ve positioned ourselves to win we re a leaner company more focused on aerospace and defense with amazing capabilities and a winning team i bet you can sense my enthusiasm and confidence if you like what you hear today and want to hear more come back on february 17th at our virtual investor day for a more complete picture of our long term plans and goals with that i ll turn it over to don to give you more detail on our q4 and full year financial results and our 2022 outlook don don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks bob i ll echo bob s sentiments on our strong finish to 2021 our efforts over the past two years are paying off and we re seizing market momentum as we accelerate into 2022 you can see it in our earnings you can see it in our balance sheet and you ll see it in our 2022 guidance it s clear that we are executing before we look ahead let s talk about what s gotten us to this point starting with our fourth quarter results revenues were 765 million up 6 sequentially and 16 year over year earnings increased even more rapidly thanks to mix enrichment and cost structure improvements we generated adjusted ebitda of 95 million up nearly 20 versus q3 and up about 300 year over year this translated into adjusted fourth quarter eps of 0 25 this included a 0 03 benefit from a favorable tax item related to our asian precision rolled strip business on a reported basis earnings per share was a loss of 0 23 reflecting on debt extinguishment charge and small restructuring adjustments i ll provide some additional fourth quarter color starting with our high performance materials and components segment or hpmc fourth quarter segment revenues increased by 5 versus the third quarter and by 41 versus the prior year these gains illustrate the impact of the ongoing commercial aerospace recovery which began in early 2021 with forgings and expanded to include materials in the fourth quarter hpmc ebitda was 61 million in q4 which was significantly better than both prior periods robust year over year incremental margins of 60 were driven by improved product mix and higher volumes spread over our leaner cost structures the segment also benefited from two additional items in the fourth quarter first a roughly 5 million benefit related to the u s government s aviation manufacturing jobs protection program and second about 4 million from a year end customer credit in advanced alloys and solutions or aa s solid customer demand continued across the segment s business units and end markets fourth quarter revenue grew by about 5 against both the prior quarter and prior year we generated nearly 50 million of segment ebitda in q4 up substantially versus prior year this included benefits from higher raw material prices as predicted aa s ebitda was lower compared to the third quarter this was largely due to the impact of a planned shutdown at our vandergrift facility to upgrade a specialty finishing line i ll share a couple of data points that demonstrate the benefit of our specialty rolled products transformation first with the exit from standard stainless sheet production we re seeing a significant product mix enrichment bob mentioned that high value products made up 96 of our fourth quarter srp sales second we delivered year over year incremental margins of more than 100 how does that happen mix improvements structural cost savings and raw material pricing the srp team has done a great job taking decisive actions and executing well we ll continue to build on this foundation for years to come before i move to the balance sheet i ll offer a few comments related to our 2021 results and how they position us for growth in 2022 first revenues increased steadily across the year after considering the srp strike impacts in q2 and q3 this reflects a growing economic recovery particularly in commercial aerospace our largest end market our fourth quarter revenue run rate puts us north of 3 billion annually similarly adjusted ebitda expanded across the year and ended on a high note at 95 million in the fourth quarter adjusted ebitda margins also expanded as expected in q3 we eclipsed our 2019 annual ebitda margins of 10 7 q4 brought another step change in those margins q4 margins were 12 4 170 basis points higher than 2019 and keep in mind those margins were delivered at a revenue run rate roughly 1 billion lower than 2019 sales turning to the balance sheet and cash flows we ended 2021 strong the team reduced inventory and overall managed working capital across the business this along with capital spending discipline pushed us to our goal of positive free cash flow for the year excluding pension contributions we generated over 230 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter and ended 2021 with well over 1 billion of cash and available liquidity building on bob s investor day sneak peek our improved balance sheet will be the catalyst for growth deleveraging and improving shareholder returns now pension we have talked many times about our pension glide path this is what we meant we ended 2021 with a net pension obligation of 396 million a 275 million or 41 drop from where we started 2021 planned funded status increased to 84 a 900 basis point increase from the funded status at the beginning of 2021 how did we accomplish the improvement so quickly by executing a solid investment strategy that enhanced strong market returns modest help from market interest rates and 67 million in planned contributions our consistent approach to reducing plan participation is also paying off these favorable items more than offset unfavorable changes in actuarial assumptions we can see the light at the end of the pension tunnel i ll share the 2022 financial benefits from this improvement in a few moments as bob mentioned earlier we received board authorization to repurchase up to 150 million of our stock this will be a great tool for increasing shareholder value as we work to offset potential dilution from our convertible note maturities in july of 2022 and in 2025 lastly as we ve rapidly increased ebitda over the past 12 months our leverage metrics have improved quickly in the fourth quarter alone we improved our net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio by 230 basis points from 6 3 to 4 times as our trailing 12 month earnings continue to improve this metric should decline steadily toward our target of two times our confidence is growing in the aerospace and broader market recoveries in part due to our strong market positions and increasing customer demand the added clarity is encouraging as a result we believe that we can provide full year 2022 earnings and free cash flow guidance in addition to the coming quarter s eps let s start with our outlook for the first quarter of 2022 we anticipate higher sequential earnings in our aa s segment from increased volumes partially offset by lower expected raw material benefits this growth will be partially tempered by the impact from the lunar new year holiday on our asian precision rolled strip business in the hpmc segment earnings are likely to be flat to modestly lower when compared to the fourth quarter results that included strong product mix related to the commercial aerospace and commercial space markets the customer credit of 4 million booked in q4 is also not expected to repeat in q1 beyond individual segment drivers a few additional items are likely to temper our first quarter results first scrap input material costs especially for nickel are rising to near prime levels this is due in large part to the aerospace production ramp and improving overall market demand levels as we continue to modernize our melt technologies and increasing majority of our inputs come from scrap sources we have seen marginally higher absentee rates early in q1 due to the omicron virus the good news is that the absent rates appear headed back to normal and the q1 financial impact will be modest next corporate costs should increase due to higher base and incentive compensation levels along with elevated travel and business transformation expenses in aggregate we expect adjusted earnings to be in the range of 0 18 to 0 26 per diluted share including an ongoing benefit from the aviation manufacturing jobs program the midpoint of that range puts us several cents higher than our q4 2021 adjusted eps after taking into account the unique items i mentioned earlier our local leadership teams are doing a great job keeping their people safe and keeping our operations going while following quarantine protocols to mitigate exposures to date we haven t had significant production disruptions related to our staffing levels or our supply chains it s a battle warfighting and winning every day and i thank our team for their hard work for the full year i ll start by giving you my thoughts on the outlook for a handful of discrete items we expect to achieve additional structural cost savings in 2022 of roughly 15 million to 20 million related to our srp business transformation these savings are connected to the remaining footprint consolidation actions expected to be complete by mid 2022 similar to prior year we anticipate paying between 15 million and 20 million in cash taxes in 2022 these relate largely to foreign jurisdictions as we don t expect to be a u s cash taxpayer for the next several years as a result of the significant increase in our pension funded status at the close of 2021 retirement benefit expense should decrease by about 5 million from 2021 levels finally we anticipate interest expense to be about 92 million a decrease of around 5 million driven by our 2021 debt actions on the cash flow side we anticipate no required pension contributions into our u s defined benefit plans that said as part of our balanced capital allocation strategy we expect to make roughly 50 million in voluntary contributions as we target increased planned funding status we expect between 210 million and 225 million in capital spending similar to our initial 2020 estimates the increase reflects funding growth projects required to meet future production requirements including 2021 jet engine related share gains lastly we anticipate managed working capital levels improving as a percent of sales as part of our ongoing efficiency efforts however due to the expected production ramp to support growing markets it s likely that managed working capital dollars will increase modestly in 2022 so where does that position us for the year we anticipate a return to full year profitability in 2022 with earnings per diluted share of 0 85 to 1 05 excluding the impact of any stock repurchases let me put a few assumptions and caveats around our 2022 guidance the guidance assumes increasing production rates on narrow body aircraft at both large global oem producers we also assume neither our first quarter or full year outlook includes impacts from significant new disruptions related to covid or geopolitical tensions around the globe we re focused on what we can control and proactively deploying mitigation plans around the things that are outside of our control looking at 2022 free cash flow we anticipate generating at least 60 million our 2022 guidance excludes any voluntary pension contributions like any decision to invest in growth or reduce leverage voluntary pension contributions are a capital allocation decision we expect to have the luxury of funding growth and reducing pension obligations in 2022 while maintaining the flexibility to pivot as needed to achieve our objectives i ll conclude by saying that 2021 was a strong year of recovery for ati our performance showcased our efforts to transform into a premier aerospace and defense supplier we ended the year at a high point and as you can see from our guidance we expect to go up from there we re poised for success and confident in our ability to execute i invite you to join us for our february 17th virtual investor day to hear our vision for the future of ati we re on our way to what promises to be an exciting and profitable journey now i ll turn the call back over to bob bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer thanks don we concluded 2021 with strong performance it was a great quarter it didn t just happen we worked hard to get here with a great team executing fully that gives us a running start as we begin 2022 with strong momentum last quarter i told you we re pivoting to growth now we re firmly on that trajectory we re seeing strong growth in our largest end market jet engines along with several of our smaller markets our market shares have increased we ve got the tools to help offset inflation through pricing and productivity and we re executing at a high level to fulfill our customers needs on a timely basis our balance sheet is strong with ample cash and liquidity this enables us to fund our strategic growth plans as part of a balanced capital allocation approach our markets are recovering well and we re positioned to win we ve got amazing capabilities and a winning team and we can t wait to show you what we can achieve operator we re ready to take questions questions answers operator thank you and the first question will come from richard safran with seaport global please go ahead richard safran seaport global securities analyst thanks bob don scott good morning bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer morning richard richard safran seaport global securities analyst interesting quarter the first question i d like to ask is on the q4 to q1 earnings run rate and what that implies or says about 22 now don i may have missed this with your opening remarks about scrapping but could you discuss more about the quarterly cadence for 2022 and why you re expecting earnings to be much lower in q1 versus what we saw in q4 could you just go over the dynamics there don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure let me first give you some context around the 0 25 delivery in q4 and then i ll kind of walk you through how we re thinking about q1 and then the more wholesome 2022 so first 0 25 in q4 a fantastic outcome on all measures in our business and we re very very proud of that delivery but as you look at our 0 25 in q4 there are a couple of items that i highlighted in the earlier discussion that are certainly unique to q4 they re kind of normal course in a business but we wouldn t expect to repeat in q1 and so as you start with the 0 25 per share in q4 one item that you d want to pull out is the tax benefit related to our asian precision rolled strip business that was about 0 03 that we recorded in q4 it s kind of a normal course thing that we that happens but more typically done in the fourth quarter as we received notification from the taxing authority so that won t repeat in q1 there s also the customer credits that i noted and that would represent also coincidentally another 0 03 per share and that wouldn t be something that we would expect to repeat in q1 so you take that 0 25 solid performance in q4 back up 0 06 it gives you a better starting point to think about what q1 would look like and so that 0 19 compared to our range for q1 of 0 18 to 0 26 and a 0 22 midpoint it highlights growth between q1 q4 rather and q1 as i noted also in the earlier conversation there are a couple of items to note as you think about q1 first of all we are expecting to see volume and price improvements from q4 to q1 so a good guide there we do have some what i would say short term headwinds that we expect in q1 things like the absence rate related to the omicron impact to the business short term not expected to be material by any stretch but still when you compare two quarters together it would be an impact also scrap which i mentioned in my dialogue so that s some context about the q4 to q1 then what you want to do is remember kind of the bigger picture which has to do with how to think about the full year results that we guided to clearly we re expecting to see a significant improvement in profitability in 2021 our eps was 0 13 on an adjusted basis we re guiding at 0 85 to 1 05 for full year 2022 you talked about the cadence right and what i would highlight there is we are in a recovery in our end markets and so we would expect growth in our profitability throughout the year and as you look at our guidance and kind of where we started with q1 at a midpoint at 0 22 in and the midpoint of the full year and i think the math works out to be about 0 95 you are seeing some growth expected throughout the year and the way to think about it i think rich is relatively steady growth as a general assumption is probably a safe way to go so hopefully that s helpful context to you richard safran seaport global securities analyst it is of course so last question here just quickly i d like to know if you could you expand on your opening remarks and talk broadly about what the end objective here is with your capital structure i m looking for what you expect to accomplish in 22 what levers you have etc so if you could just maybe talk to that a little bit don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i would love to as you think about our strategy around capital allocation what you should begin to see is a balanced approach we re in a great position coming into 2022 we ve got a very healthy balance sheet almost 700 million of cash well over 1 billion of liquidity we put ourselves very purposely in a position where we have choices as to where we re going to allocate our capital and really we do view it as a balanced approach and what do i mean by that well we want to continue to delever the balance sheet and our no 1 in delevering is attacking that pension obligation we made phenomenal progress in that in 2021 and we re going to continue that guide path glide path activity in 2022 so we ll do that delevering another key area for us is investing for growth and so right now our focus is primarily around organic growth with capex if you think about our guidance around capex for 2022 we guided at 210 million to 225 million and the way to think about that range of capex rich is about 60 of that capex is really going to be pointed toward growth capex growth capex that will allow us to take advantage of the share gains that we ve captured and participate in the ramp that s hitting our business right now and so that s another key use and then you re seeing another key use that s highlighted this quarter with the announcement of our stock repurchase program returning capital to shareholders is an important element to our strategy and we believe that right now stock repurchase like we ve announced is a very efficient way to deliver that capital back to our customers or excuse me to our investors and so that s another key element of our strategy so as you take a step back and if you were describing our capital allocation strategy what you want to remember is balanced and putting ourselves in a position where we re not choosing between one or another but really able to execute on all of the opportunities whether it s organic growth delivering and return of capital that s what we re our objectives are around capital allocation richard safran seaport global securities analyst thank you operator the next question will come from seth seifman with j p morgan please go ahead seth seifman j p morgan analyst thanks very much and good morning i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are on production rates especially on the two main narrowbody programs bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer so i think as we go into those kinds of questions we always give you the starting answer which is we actually produced orders not necessarily to the build rates but what i would say is that on the forging side there s not a lot of inventory in the pipeline we continue to see the demand going up at the same rate that the production rates are going up so the trend lines going to intersect probably 12 months ahead nine to 12 months ahead of what the production is so i would say our increase is tracking to the trend line of what the major narrowbody guys are talking about i think there s some question about supply chain disruption in the forgings path and for the billet that we supply into forgings we re on track we do get some of our billet on a directed buy from other people and that s been a little bit disrupted for various reasons discussed in the press but i think our forgings business is probably the greatest bellwether for telling us where we are on on the engine side into the narrowbody business so trend lines are lining up seth seifman j p morgan analyst ok and then do you see i know you ve talked about some of the share gains that you have and some of the investments you mentioned next year is going toward realizing those are there shorter term share gain opportunities that might be out there as the ramp proceeds particularly on the narrowbody side bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer yes i think the opportunities for us will come through performance with what we ve historically called emergent demand i think the pressure of the supply chain is going to be a relatively unprecedented ramp because the demand is sitting there and the oems are increasing their bills to capture it as fast as they can and obviously most of the supply chains have adjusted themselves through the pandemic so it s going to be exciting for the entire supply chain as we go forward for us we feel well positioned in terms of having said right from the start of the pandemic we were going to remain recovery ready we delayed a couple of investment during the pandemic we talked this morning about the fourth iso press and that heat treating facility coming online in wisconsin we feel really good about that that will give us a really preferential position i think for emergent demand we ll be ready when other people stumble and so i think that gives us an opportunity for more of the merchant demand most of the major contracts were let going into the last ramp pre pandemic so i think the supply base feels pretty comfortable that they have the contractual positions in place but they re going to do whatever it takes to hit their ramp targets so that s our opportunity to perform seth seifman j p morgan analyst great and then if i could follow up just with one last quick one within the guidance don how are you treating the convert that comes to you later this year don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer so in terms of the shares outstanding when you say how are we treating it seth seifman j p morgan analyst yes yeah exactly don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so first of course we do assume it will convert but when you think about the share count at this point in the year what i would assume is basic shares outstanding about 127 million shares and then we re still including even though we have a share repurchase program in place in our guidance we re still assuming that all of the fully diluted shares are outstanding and that s 152 million roughly of shares so that s how i would think about it as you re modeling year if there are shares or when there are shares brought in under the share repurchase program obviously we ll share that with you guys each quarter so you understand what to adjust when it comes to your eps calculations seth seifman j p morgan analyst got it thank you very much operator the next question will come from david strauss with barclays please go ahead josh korn barclays analyst hi good morning this is josh korn on for david so regarding the guidance for next year what are you assuming for oil and gas in 2022 given the much higher oil prices bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer yes this is bob in terms of oil and gas i think we still see good demand in oil and gas we talked about it in the commentary there s two elements for us in oil and gas there s the we call it flow lines and umbilicals but it s a smaller part of our business today than it used to be and then we have the opportunity for some of the clad pipe products that go into more of the challenging oil and gas reserves i wouldn t say it s going to be a huge uptick and part of that is that i think the nickel products in the united states will be relatively tight based on the uptick in demand in aerospace and defense and we also see an uptick in india with what we call flue gas desulfurization projects that go into coal fired power plants to make their emissions much lower that was slower in so we should see an uptick there but that s more in the specialty energy side so i would say modest continued growth but that s going to be a tight market based on the nickel demand that s going on in the market josh korn barclays analyst ok and then is there anything else left to spend within capex on the transition to the higher value add products don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes this is don so yes in our 2022 capex it includes additional spending to largely finish the transformation for srp and that s being executed on plan everything is unfolding as expected or maybe even a bit better so yes that s included there josh korn barclays analyst ok thank you operator the next question will come from phil gibbs with keybanc capital markets please go ahead phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst good morning bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer morning phil phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst i know we don t talk too much about it over the years but things might be changing a bit given some of the new business awards that you ve had and gained over the last couple of years how should we think about pricing overall just pricing in terms of that kicking in in 2022 and hitting the bottom line is that a bigger than normal driver this year bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer i think you have to break it down by between the two segments phil good morning by the way and i think on the high performance we will see continued mix enrichment there better product form next generation alloys next generation platforms so we ll get product mix and the pricing that goes with that you ll start to you ll still continue to see that growth i think on the aa s side probably there you ll see as we get into the higher value products we re still going to get mixed enrichment the thing about that segment about a third of it is transactional so we ve really got some good upside in the tight market there and almost all of our ltas have significant material inflation pass through and we re certainly doing that and then some in terms of the material pass through so i would say still sometimes it s hard to differentiate price from product mix because of the different alloys and programs we re participating in but we still feel like there s good pricing opportunities due to the tightness in the market throughout 2022 it helps a lot that we re no longer in the stainless sheet business and i think the metrics will become clear now in 2022 that we re almost out of that business for sure phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst ok so it does sound like there s some benefit in the guide from pricing and mix this year as there should be bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer yeah a little bit i think that s right with the nickel price strength that we ve had who knows where it s going to go for the balance of the year but so far so good there phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst and then obviously geopolitical risks are always apparent in global market like aerospace and we ve seen the russian rhetoric s world before is this time any different than years past where you ve got the potential to see emergent demand or fill the gap and then i think do those to those conversations on the other side take kind of a bit of a cooling process maybe to some of those other periods just because boeing at the current time has enough inventory in the 787 channel bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer yeah good question i ll take that one don if it s all right with you the you referenced kind of the russian situation and i would just start by saying we monitor it closely it s hard to speculate as to what any solution would quickly certainly we learned in the downturn of the pandemic has moved quickly now you actually had both positives and risks kind of as you walk through your question and i would say that you re right with that probably the risk we manage most closely is what i d call the nickel supply for nonrotating parts and products made in our advanced alloys and solutions segment but it wouldn t affect really our hpmc segment because of how we source that material it s mostly on the nickel side but in the aa s segment we always have the backdrop of scrap units and a few other things we can be working on but that s the risk side we think we ll watch that very closely and have some alternatives and you re right i think there s some upside in terms of opportunities probably on the titanium space and some of those other ones if something like that were to happen so it s a balanced approach we stay close to it we assess it and we control what we can and adapt and i think the organization s proven they can do that over the last two years but it s something we re watching very closely phil gibbs keybanc capital markets analyst and then the last question is just for don in terms of your expectations for 2022 how are you thinking about the corporate effective tax rate i know you gave the cash piece but the corporate effective tax rate within that eps number and then also what the raw material plus or minus was after a pretty strong year this year don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah corporate the way to think about the corporate tax rate is it s going to be extremely low i think i d shared that we expect cash taxes to be in the 15 million to 20 million range and we re fully reserved on the federal side for u s purposes so i really expect an extremely low effective tax rate for the overall organization so i think there s just before we leave the theme of guidance and how to think about some of the activities that are going on in the market geopolitically might be helpful to you to just touch base a little bit on inflation and how we re managing inflation and the questions around price i think one thing that our team has done an extremely good job at is as the supply chain volatility has hit the world our team has done a terrific job managing all those dynamics and one way that we ve been successful in doing that is being very proactive around offsetting inflation through price also through efficiencies we believe we have a core competency and improving our efficiencies from period to period but i think it s an important thing for us to highlight the organization is very focused on monitoring what s happening with input costs and quickly reacting to those dynamics making sure that we re getting the right price adjustments to offset so thanks for let me add that thanks don for speaking about it appreciate it operator the next question will come from gautam khanna with cowen please go ahead gautam khanna cowen and company analyst hey good morning guys don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer good morning gautam khanna cowen and company analyst i had two questions first you heard raytheon and boeing point out that forging and casting space will be a or is a pinch point in the supply chain and i wondered how might just commented that it s not them i was wondering are you guys seeing constraints to your output in the forging and casting space or do you think those comments of some of the prime contractors relate to other competitors or perhaps or just speculating on what might happen and then i have a follow up bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer yep all right good question gautam i would say testing is a separate issue and we re not in that product line anymore so we don t see too much of that activity luckily on the forging side i would say our perspective i d start off with a real clear definitive statement it s not us either and part of the advantage of the ati supply chain is we re vertically integrated back to billet depending on the product depending on the application 70 of what we do comes from our own operations so we re close coupled and we certainly see the advantage from a supply chain signal and response but the other 30 is billet that s on a directed buy that comes to us and yes i would say one of our competitors is pretty open about a press that they re working to supply so we re seeing a little disruption from that and then i think any time somebody is restarting billet or powder billet capacity you can run into bounce right so we are seeing some of those kinds of challenges in the supply chain not totally unexpected but things that we re working hard with our customers to overcome gautam khanna cowen and company analyst ok and then just to follow up on that the special metals corp has got that strike on five months now like you mentioned the readiness at carpenters out of commission for a little bit does this confer are you seeing emergent demand right now for nickel billet or how might that actually change share or does it bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer yeah good question so simple answer to your question is yes we re seeing emergent opportunities due to the supply chain disruptions of others right i think there are opportunities as we have been through this ourselves but we re obviously in a great position trusted supplier have the relationships part of our strategy shift as part of our transformation is to move more to long term agreements so i think as we see this disruption especially with our transformation of the sheet business the specialty rolled products business with our new capabilities coupling melt to hot rolling to finishing and the wider widths and tighter gauges there s a lot of pull for that demand so we feel like there s a merchant demand that we ll be able to sustain longer term in our specialty rolled products business and the aa s segment so yes we re seeing it and we re trying to take advantage of it gautam khanna cowen and company analyst last one if i might bob you ve told us to tune into the investor day but in the past you guys you mentioned 600 million plus of ebitda as being achievable should anything changed on that view bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer i ll go first and say no but then i ll ask don to add color don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer i would add no all joking aside we re on track and you can see that in our hopefully you can see that in our 2021 performance and you re right i have talked a number of times about how to think about the long term profitability of our business relative to where we were at in 2019 and what i would say is we are absolutely on track with the color that i ve shared with you guys in the past when it comes to february 17 we re going to share more information and trying to help you understand a few things about how do we think about top line growth over the extended period of time how do we think about margins over the extended period of time and then really importantly we also want to talk a bit about cash generation over the extended period of time and metrics like cash conversion yields and those kinds of things because they re important part of understanding the value opportunity and potential in our business so we re going to spend some time with the attendees on all those topics and more gautam khanna cowen and company analyst thanks looking forward to it guys bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer all right thanks gautam operator the next question will come from josh sullivan with the benchmark company please go ahead josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst hey good morning bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer good morning josh josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst so i understand the s p rate due to omicron in q1 but what about the incremental labor needs throughout the year and then to hit the higher production levels how heavy a lift is that on headcount do you see any tight areas there especially as you re talking about capturing this emerging demand just curious about what you re seeing in those specialized labor markets you guys access bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer right so it s very regional and the issue we re dealing with the absenteeism has been really short term i appreciate you asking about it because it s been a daily fight we got to make sure that who s going to come in and what kind of crewing you have and it s an opportunity for me to say hey man i really respect the challenge our first line supervisors are going through but they re up to the challenge and they re working through it and we are seeing very much a commitment to operating safely but also it s regional right so if you think about our company we think about the carolina s we think about wisconsin we think about pennsylvania and we think about oregon right so omicron kind of started in the east and went west and we re starting to see that impact decline now you asked a question about labor our investments over the last few years have brought a tremendous amount of automation into our operation probably as a guide over the course of 2022 we ll hire between 400 and 450 operating people against a base of 6 000 to 6 500 give or take depending on how you count so 15 kind of increase and again it s the short term impact of omicron was in reliable training progress so we re kind of working through that now but as it recedes we should be back on track but again it s not a huge issue i d also say aerospace and defense jobs are great jobs especially where we are in the cycle and people that we re hiring to see that it s not quite like retail or distribution or warehousing these are jobs that people really cover it so i think we re recruiting from a good base and obviously we re committed to remaining globally competitive so there s always that constructive tension and certainly any issues that we deal with we should be able to offset it with pricing as we think about inflationary trends there does that help josh josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst yeah that s all great stuff and then just on the fourth isothermal forge that you guys have coming online how should we think about the utilization filling up there versus what was built on the organic demand that was originally designed versus this emergent demand that you re thinking about just curious how you re thinking that s going to come together bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer yeah so it s a great complex combination of the isothermal press and then some heat treating capacity that came with it every good operating leader always wants to use the new stuff bullish they want to use it fully because it s more automated more consistent higher productivity not that we had a quality issue but the more consistent see to it more reliable so what you ll see is on the new asset it should be fully utilized and then what normally happens is the oldest press tends to be either we invest in maintenance to make sure it s recovery ready for the peak that s coming or we optimize our product mix across those kind of assets to make sure that each one is running the most optimal product mix so i expect utilization of that particular unit to be pretty good pretty fast that s why they were committed to getting all the necessary customer qualifications done during this period of reduced demand we ll just call it so we feel pretty good but i would say it d be highly utilized and then our less efficient press will probably get less utilization josh sullivan the benchmark company analyst and then just one last one just on the timing of the naval nuclear material how should we think of that cycle through 22 and 23 bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer the naval nuclear sales through 2022 23 i think you ll see continued growth there are certainly some positive pull the australians are thinking they re doing their thing with the british and the americans on more submarines i think that will benefit us and we re starting to see the pull for that so i think you ll see a continued increase through 2022 into 2023 the cycle is pretty long here and the commitments should be multiple years past that but i d say when don was kind of talking about the growth through the year the aerospace increase is one of those the defense side with naval nuclear leading away is the second one that should be a real positive upward lift operator the next question will come from paretosh misra with berenberg capital markets please go ahead paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question so metal prices have been quite strong is that a risk in the second half of this year or next year that that could be a revenue headwind even though i realized that you pass those through to your customers bob wetherbee board chair president and chief executive officer i think it s hard to predict nickel prices paretosh we don t i would say one of the things we re doing that we re focused on is improving our inventory intensity reducing the use of inventory as a percentage of our sales we had over 700 basis point reduction in the intensity probably the biggest single upper down risk we face today and that is work in process inventory so our goal is to have as little as we need for wip that will help us i think the transformation that we re doing will help accelerate that because we got less footprints and less travel between locations and will help us accelerate the reduction but it is possible i would say we re doing everything we can do to mitigate it going forward and getting out of the stainless business sheet business actually takes away the greatest single risk we ve had historically in that area so i think we feel like we re moving in the right direction paretosh misra berenberg capital markets analyst fair enough fair enough and then how should we think about the incremental margins in 2022 given the some headcount increase through the year and other some other moving parts don newman executive vice president and chief financial officer sure this is don i ll take that question first we had a fantastic experience around our incremental margins in second half of 2021 and as you think about the incremental margins going forward you re pointing out potential headwinds to it there s also potential tailwinds that can come up from time to time i think what you really want to do is you want to stick with the guidance that we ve given in the past which is incremental margins through this upcycle in the 30 to 40 range we re going to have some quarters like this quarter where they were extremely strong and we ll have other quarters might be a little bit short of that goal but long term i would really stick with that 30 to 40 incremental operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr scott minder for any closing remarks please go ahead scott minder vice president treasurer abd investor relations thanks as bob and don mentioned we plan to hold a virtual investor day on february 17 where we ll expand on our business strategy and provide long term financial targets more information on how to attend the event can be found on our website at atimetals com thanks again for joining

mcinerney tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you sarah and congratulations on your promotion to head of investor relations for genworth sarah has been with genworth for 10 years and she held several leadership roles in genworth s finance organization she knows genworth and our two businesses very well we refreshed genworth s board of directors over the last two years with the addition of four new directors who received strong support at genworth s may 2021 annual shareholders meeting as more fully described in our proxy statement issued last april our new directors bring excellent credentials to the board and they ve already stepped up to challenge management and guide the company forward i also want to welcome two new outstanding genworth leaders to the c suite effective on january 1 2022 melissa hagerman and greg karawan melissa was appointed executive vice president and chief human resources officer she s a strong advocate for our people and understands the vital role they play in delivering current results and implementing our vision for the future she has played a leading role on genworth s hr team including working with genworth s various businesses and functional units she will focus on our post covid strategy our return to work arrangements talent management and talent development of genworth s key leaders and managers greg was named executive vice president and general counsel greg hails from brooklyn and has a strong litigation background he led genworth s litigation function for many years he was also instrumental in the resolution of the axa litigation with genworth and as genworth s chief liaison with axa in their ongoing legal dispute with banco santander greg has also been the top legal officer for genworth s u s life division for many years let me now turn to genworth s outstanding performance for the full year 2021 genworth s u s gaap net income for the full year was 904 million adjusted operating income for 2021 was 765 million adjusted operating income was 1 48 per share which is well above analysts expectations and our own internal projections these outstanding results were led by a record year for nat and adjusted operating income available to genworth shareholders in 2021 was 520 million both u s life and runoff achieved excellent financial results during 2021 full year adjusted operating income for u s life and runoff combined was 321 million led by strong ltc adjusted operating income of 445 million for the year because of the upcoming significant changes to the life insurance industry s u s gaap accounting regime based on new long duration targeted improvement or ldti rules genworth will also be highlighting u s life s statutory results additionally u s insurance regulators focused on u s statutory results when assessing the financial condition and performance of life insurers therefore because of the importance that insurance regulators put on statutory accounting and the fact that future statutory results will be based on a consistent methodology we think that highlighting these results going forward will provide important additional information for shareholders and investment analysts we have included our statutory information through september 2021 on pages 15 and 16 of the investor deck while our fourth quarter statutory processes including cash flow testing are still in process we do expect u s life statutory after tax net income for the full year to be approximately 660 million the strong net income result was driven by outstanding results for ltc with pre tax statutory income of approximately 910 million in 2021 the glic consolidated statutory balance sheet was significantly strengthened this year we expect glic s capital and surplus to increase from 2 1 billion at the end of 2020 to approximately 2 9 billion at year end 2021 similarly glic s negative unassigned surplus is expected to improve from negative 1 8 billion to approximately negative 1 0 billion at year end glic s rbc ratio at year end 2021 is projected to be approximately 290 an increase of approximately 61 points from 229 at the end of 2020 the significant improvements in the glic rbc ratio and statutory balance sheet were driven by excellent statutory net income in 2021 primarily from the strong ltc results the year end statutory results in rbc calculations are preliminary as they are still under review and they will be filed with our year end statutory filings i m very pleased with our strong statutory results for the year moving on from our strong 2021 financial results i want to provide an update on the five strategic priorities we announced last year the first strategic priority is to maximize the value of our equity position in enact to benefit genworth s shareholders genworth s board considered several different options for enact in 2021 including selling 100 of enact maintaining 100 ownership before deciding ultimately to move forward with a partial ipo our objective has always been to protect and ultimately unlock enact s value enabling us to maximize value for genworth shareholders over the longer term the various third party sale transactions we considered were either not supported by regulators or involves significant regulatory risks which we would potentially delay the timing of returning cash proceeds to genworth shareholders genworth therefore decided to proceed with a partial ipo and sold approximately 18 4 of enact shares which we believe was the best viable option for shareholders genworth s 81 6 retained interest will allow us to receive significant future cash flows from enact to enable delevering at genworth and return of capital to genworth shareholders but at the same time we retain future optionality with our holdings in enact including a tax free spinoff to genworth s shareholders as well as other options genworth has decided that retaining our current holdings in enact for the foreseeable future is the best option as we achieve our debt target and return capital to genworth shareholders we will continue to be open to other options in the future in the interim we believe enact has various levers to create near and long term value and genworth will continue to advance initiatives that support enact s value as the majority owner like debt reduction and other levers to further improve our holding company ratings which we ll discuss later i m extremely proud of the significant progress achieved in 2021 on our second strategic priority which is to reduce genworth s holding company debt to approximately 1 billion this has been a long term objective for the company because this amount of debt is much more appropriate given genworth s annual operating cash flows to the parent holding company we reduced our outstanding debt by approximately 2 1 billion last year including paying off the axa promissory note and redeeming the 400 million of parent holding company debt due in 2023 we now have approximately 1 2 billion of parent holding company debt outstanding however because genworth ended the fourth quarter with cash of 356 million our net debt position is already below 1 billion we will look to continue to reduce our debt to meet our target in the near term looking at other key indicators of balance sheet strength our u s gaap debt to capital ratio at the end of the year was 13 one of the lowest among life insurers that report this metric looking ahead we expect genworth s interest coverage ratio to improve significantly after we retire the remaining of genworth s 280 million of debt due in 2024 our pro forma cash flow coverage will be approximately five times based on a conservative view of projected future cash flows we are hopeful that with a substantial reduction in outstanding parent holding company debt in 2021 our improved cash interest coverage ratio significant excess cash available to repurchase our outstanding 2024 debt the long duration of the remaining 2034 and 2066 debt and the expectation of continued strong u s statutory net income that the rating agents will continue to upgrade the parent debt ratings over time the third strategic priority is perhaps the most important priority for the next several years since the end of 2012 genworth has made outstanding progress on moving the legacy ltc portfolio closer to breakeven we continue to define our multiyear ltc rate action plan or myrap during 2021 genworth delivered a new record for approved ltc rate increases of 403 million from 45 states on 173 separate rate filings the net present value of the 2021 ltc rate increases was approximately 2 3 billion during the fourth quarter annual ltc assumption review we made long term assumption changes mainly to our benefit utilization trend assumptions based on cost of care growth 2021 margins reflect the updated unfavorable benefit utilization trend assumptions fully offset by higher model future in force rate actions our 2021 ltc margins remain positive in the 0 5 million to 1 0 5 billion to 1 billion range and the assumption update did not cause a financial statement impact in the quarter dan will review the assumption changes in more detail during his remarks we have the strongest and most experienced ltc premium increase team in the industry led by jamala arland jamala arland and her team are continuously improving the ltc projection models to capture more accurate data and determine the level of actuarial active premium increases to request regulators have a high regard of genworth s ltc projection models which have made the premium approval process more efficient these models have also helped us update the level of net present value or npv from prior approved premium increases and benefit reductions given our new cost of care assumptions in addition to the approximately 2 3 billion npv benefit from the 403 million of approved increases in 2021 the models project based on the latest assumption changes that the npv achieved since 2012 has improved by an additional 2 8 billion compared to our earlier projections as of the end of 2021 genworth now projects that the ltc premium increases and benefit reductions achieved since 2012 have improved the legacy ltc portfolio by 19 6 billion on a net present value basis this is a 5 1 billion increase from the 14 5 billion that reported at the end of 2020 i am incredibly proud of the progress we ve made toward stabilizing the legacy ltc book through our holistic approach and i look forward to sharing further updates in the future the four strategic priority is advancing genworth s ltc growth initiatives this is an important long term priority because we believe that genworth can only stand on its own without ongoing support from enact dividends if we bring the legacy ltc portfolio closer to breakeven and develop a viable growth strategy that genworth investors believe is sustainable if we can achieve both objectives it would facilitate the future spinoff of genworth s 81 6 of enact because the remaining genworth business would be viable as a stand alone public company to support our growth strategy we are in the process of standing up a new business line global care solutions and we have hired joost heideman as ceo to lead genworth s ltc growth initiatives that will be developed within the new business line joost has approximately 30 years of experience in the insurance industry he has worked for both large global insurers and for venture capital has focused on new health insurance models in emerging markets joost worked with me at ing group for over a decade including stints helping me oversee ing s worldwide insurance and investment management businesses in over 40 countries and restructuring ing s very large side agency distribution channels in the emerging markets in asia latin america and eastern europe after leaving ing in 2014 jos was chairman and ceo of unive a mutual life and health insurer in the netherlands he was working with dutch venture capitalist to develop a new digital health insurance venture in east africa in 2020 until the covid 19 pandemic halted that venture i m very pleased we were able to recruit joost in 2020 as an outside consultant to help us develop our ltc growth strategies and that he will now be overseeing the implementation of those strategies as the ceo of global care solutions because of the geopolitical challenges between china and the u s we have reduced our focus on china opportunities until those issues become more transparent we have redirected our focus on two new u s ltc businesses as part of our new global care solutions the first business will offer fee based advice consulting and services in the aged care space we see meaningful opportunities to provide advice consulting and services to address the needs of elderly americans their caregivers and their families genworth s carescout subsidiary led by ed motherway currently provides some of these services acquired by genworth in 2008 carescout is a market leader in providing ltc care assessments and care support through our network of 35 000 clinicians nationwide joost and ed will work together to further develop the long term opportunities for carescout genworth has not funded carescout over the last five years as our focus had been directed toward seeking premium increases on our legacy ltc portfolio we see tremendous potential in the business as part of our ltc growth strategy so we are making an investment of approximately 8 million in carescout in the first quarter to expand its clinical assessment capabilities in care support solutions this investment will allow carescout to extend their assessment services to help support the many healthcare organizations that are experiencing a high volume of patients ongoing assessment staffing shortages and numerous work for disruptions due to the covid 19 pandemic we expect this investment to triple the annual assessment revenues in the next few years to approximately 30 million longer term carescout and its future service affiliates are expected to provide a diversified source of capital light fee based revenues as we deploy new capabilities and solutions to meet the needs of a growing marketplace we have several significant elder care capabilities and experience that other competitors do not have including 40 plus years of experience in the ltc insurance business data on 330 000 ltc claims paid to date to legacy ltc policyholders existing relationships with a network of 35 000 care assessment professionals who are mostly registered nurses and existing relationships with 90 000 providers and caregivers throughout the u s our carescout and other service strategies are based on converting these considerable capabilities into a viable and scalable advice consulting and service businesses for the elderly and their families the second ltc growth business strategy is based on transforming the existing ltc insurance market the new genworth ltc products to be sold in the market will be designed to solve the myriad of issues that have plagued the legacy ltc insurance business the most important change is to transform the lt insurance market is to implement an annual rerating model genworth believes the primary problems with all insurers legacy ltc insurance products were caused by the level premium regulatory model legacy ltc products were sold pursuant to a regulatory regime designed to make premium adjustments difficult to obtain even though it is impossible to price products with assumptions that will hold and of course they did not hold for 30 to 40 years we are in the process of finalizing genworth s first new ltc individual insurance product the new product is priced for a mid teen return using pricing assumptions that we believe are conservative the product has a maximum lifetime benefit of 250 000 and the pricing assumptions for the key ltc risk were interest rates lapses morbidity and mortality are based on genworth s current experience and projections for these factors however because we understand that these pricing assumptions may not hold over the next 30 to 40 years we will only write new business in states that will allow annual rerating to change premiums if pricing assumptions and market reality differ over time we have had extensive discussions with regulators and we believe enough regulators support the concept of annual rerating to move forward with the product however because of regulatory issues with the need for large premium increases on genworth s legacy books and the need for many states to change to their current rate stabilization rules some of which require legislative action we do not expect to be able to launch the new ltc product in most states right away we may however decide to accelerate the launch with a handful of states who seem enthusiastic about bringing a new innovative ltc product into their state s insurance market i believe that these innovative forward thinking states can help rebuild a robust long term care insurance market that contributes to solving the massive long term care funding crisis based in the country and that is at the core of genworth s multifaceted growth initiatives genworth s current financial strength and ratings are also an issue for the viability of the new ltc product as a result last year we have been working with a third party reinsurer with an a rating from a m best we have a new genworth insurance company which will only write new business and will not have any legacy ltc business we expect that 75 of the risk with a new ltc product will be reinsured with the a rated reinsurer though the level of reinsurance that we expect to be reduced to 50 over time preliminary discussions with am best have provided a good understanding of their methodology around investment grade ratings genworth expects to offer several additional new and innovative ltc products including hybrid products and a nonguaranteed ltc benefit product in the future genworth s fifth strategic priority is returning capital to our shareholders given that our net debt position is now below 1 billion and we expect enact to share their dividend policy later this year we plan to consider initiating a capital management program later in 2022 we ll have an update on genworth s capital management plans on the next earnings call in closing i m very pleased with the strong operating performance and the progress on our strategic priorities achieved in 2021 we have made outstanding progress on genworth s turnaround and i remain confident in our plans to drive shareholder value and with that i ll turn the call over to dan to discuss our fourth quarter results and financial position in more detail dan sheehan chief financial officer and chief investment officer thanks tom and good morning everyone the fourth quarter was another excellent quarter for genworth with net income of 163 million and adjusted operating income of 164 million or 0 32 per share in the fourth quarter we also continued to make significant progress on our debt management strategy in this quarter alone we fully retired 400 million of debt due in august 2023 and reduced our february 2024 debt maturity by 118 million for a total of 518 million even with this debt management activity we ended the quarter with a solid holding company cash and liquidity position of 356 million turning to the operating companies our mortgage insurance subsidiary enact holdings posted its earnings call earlier this morning and provided a detailed update on its results for the quarter so i ll focus on the key highlights for the fourth quarter enact reported adjusted operating income of 125 million to genworth and a strong loss ratio of 3 driven in part by a 32 million pre tax reserve release on pre covid delinquencies i ll note that genworth s fourth quarter adjusted operating income excludes 18 4 of minority interest which accounted for 29 million of adjusted operating income last quarter minority interest accounted for only 4 million of adjusted operating income due to the timing of the initial public offering in september absent minority interest enact s adjusted operating income increased largely driven by the favorable reserve development in the quarter enact saw a 9 year over year increase in insurance in force growth driven in part by 21 billion of new insurance written in the quarter in addition enact finished the quarter with an estimated pmier sufficiency ratio of 165 or approximately 2 billion of published requirements the decline in the pmier sufficiency versus the prior quarter was largely driven by the dividend they paid in the quarter subsequent to the quarter in january enact executed an excess of loss reinsurance transaction which will cover the 2022 production and is expected to provide approximately 300 million in pmiers credit reinsurance transactions are a key part of their credit risk transfer program that is designed to provide cost effective capital relief and reduce loss volatility we re very pleased with enact s performance for the full year and the fourth quarter which included the payment of its first dividend as a public company the 1 23 per share dividend generated 163 million for genworth with respect to our expectations for future dividends from enact enact is evaluating its dividend policy and expects to initiate a regular common dividend around mid 2022 turning to the u s life insurance segment we reported 41 million of adjusted operating income in the quarter driven by the continued strength of ltc earnings from the multiyear rate action plan and variable investment income mortality continued to be elevated in the quarter in part from covid 19 which benefited ltc earnings but negatively impacted our life insurance results results in the quarter also included charges in our term universal life and universal life insurance products of 102 million related to assumption updates and dac recoverability testing in our long term care insurance business we reported strong results with fourth quarter adjusted operating income of 119 million compared to 133 million reported in the prior quarter and 129 million in the prior year as we discussed last quarter while our overall gaap margins are positive we ve established a gaap only profits followed by losses reserve which covers projected losses in the future this reserve reduced ltc earnings by 121 million after tax during the quarter as of year end the pre tax balance of the profits followed by losses reserve was 1 3 billion up from 625 million at year end 2020 our fourth quarter adjusted operating earnings from in force rate actions were 296 million after tax and before applying profits followed by losses which increased from 225 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 page 12 of the investor presentation illustrates the strong full year earnings trends from our in force rate actions and a 1 2 billion benefit in 2021 the legal settlement on our ltc choice one policy forms continued to favorably impact our results by 57 million or 14 million after profits followed by losses this quarter the choice one legal settlement applies to approximately 20 of our ltc policyholders as of quarter end approximately 65 of the settlement class had reached the end of this election period we currently expect the remaining class members to make their elections over the course of this year there are two other similar legal settlements pending the one for our pcs 1 and pcs 2 policy forms comprises approximately 15 of our ltc policyholders and is subject to final court approval should the settlement be approved in the near term we expect claimants to start making their elections in mid to late 2022 additionally we ve reached an agreement in principle for a settlement on our choice two policy forms which covers approximately 35 of our ltc policyholders or as many policies as the two other settlements combined the choice two settlement is still subject to the execution of a formal agreement in the court schedule and ultimate approval subject to these events we anticipate that we ll begin implementing an approved settlement by early 2023 while our financial results in 2021 have been favorably impacted by the choice one legal settlement and the other two settlements are expected to positively impact future financial results it s difficult to quantify their overall impact on our financials as full implementation will take several years that is subject to specific policyholder elections in terms of ltc invoice rate action approvals it was a record year for genworth due in part to regulators recognition of the importance of actuarially justified rate increases for genworth and the industry during the quarter we received approvals impacting approximately 223 million of premiums with a weighted average approval rate of 36 on a year to date basis we received approvals impacting nearly 1 1 billion in premiums with a weighted average approval rate of 37 this is favorable compared to the prior year when we received approvals impacting 1 billion in premiums with a weighted average approval rate of 34 we experienced favorable variable investment income at ltc again this quarter reflecting higher limited partnership income gains on treasury inflation protected securities bond calls and mortgage prepayments while we saw a very strong variable net investment income in 2021 which is not subject to reductions from profits followed by losses we do expect this investment performance to moderate over time claim terminations in the fourth quarter were higher versus the prior quarter and lower versus the prior year as noted on page eight we made a minimal adjustment to our previously established covid 19 mortality reserve for the quarter decreasing the cumulative balance to 134 million as the pandemic continues mortality experience may fluctuate and the covid 19 mortality adjustment would be reduced if mortality experience becomes unfavorable turning to page 11 of the investor presentation new active claims are higher than the prior year but new claims incidence experience remains lower than pre pandemic levels and continues to drive favorable incurred but not reported or ibnr claim reserve development in the fourth quarter given the gradual increase in incidents we reduced our covid 19 ibnr claim reserve by 34 million resulting in a cumulative balance of 75 million we completed our annual review of key actuarial assumptions in each of our product lines during the fourth quarter our assumptions for ltc claim reserves or disabled life reserves held up in the aggregate and the margin for policies not yet on claim included in our active life reserves remains positive therefore we did not increase our reserves and there was no p l impact from these updates please note that the covid 19 pandemic impact to the businesses were not considered when reviewing our long term assumptions as they are not currently expected to be indicative of future trends or loss performance as part of the ltc active life margin testing process we reviewed our long term assumptions relative to experience during this year s assessment we updated several assumptions with respect to lapses mortality expenses interest rates and most significantly benefit utilization trends margin testing results for the ltc block are shown on page nine these results remain positive in both the historical and acquired blocks the combined margin was approximately 500 million to 1 billion which is consistent with the prior year s range as tom outlined given the expected future increase in the cost of care we expect our long term benefit utilization to trend higher than previously assumed this is one of our key long term assumptions that impacts trends modeled over a 60 year period prior to this update we had assumed that the long term benefit utilization would improve over time based on our experience it has not improved as much as we predicted largely due to the cost of care growth driven both by broad based inflation and minimum wage increases in some large states among other factors therefore we ve increased the outlook for our future benefit utilization trend since margin testing remained positive we re not required to increase our ltc active life reserves for policies not yet on claim as the model benefit from adjustments to our multiyear rate action plan offsets the approximately 4 billion impact from the assumption updates i m pleased that our progress on the multiyear rate action plan and other risk mitigation actions combined with future actions have allowed us to absorb these assumption updates without incurring any charges in our financial results a multiyear rate action plan is essential to our strategy of proactively managing and mitigating adverse emerging experience and with this updated trend assumption it further emphasizes the ongoing need for rate actions the success of the multiyear rate action plan has strengthened our ability to pay claims in two ways first there is the increased premium revenue second in connection with approved rate actions and the legal settlements we ve managed our long term exposure to generous product features like lifetime benefits and compound inflation riders as policyholders have elected benefit reductions to mitigate rate increases as evidenced on page 13 44 of policyholders have selected reduced benefit or non forfeiture options which reduces our long term risk our peak claim mirrors are over a decade away and as always we ll continue to monitor emerging experience to help evaluate the need for future changes we now project the need in aggregate for approximately 28 7 billion in ltc premium increases and benefit reductions on a net present value basis which is important in our progress toward achieving economic breakeven on our legacy ltc block while this amount has increased as a result of the assumption update we are over two thirds of the way there having achieved 19 6 billion in rate actions since 2012 the 19 6 billion we ve achieved has grown significantly since last year in part because of the value of our 2021 rate action approvals of 2 3 billion additionally the benefit utilization trend assumption update for higher cost of care growth increased the value of our previously achieved rate actions by 2 8 billion the remaining amount we have left to achieve is 9 billion which has grown from last year largely to offset the unfavorable impact from the assumption updates based on our proven track record and the strength of the multiyear rate action team and their process our ability to close the remaining amount is achievable as i ve shared before we re managing the u s life insurance companies on a stand alone basis through capital and surplus rate increases and reduced benefit options we re working to ensure our ability to pay ltc benefits over the long term turning to our life insurance products we reported a fourth quarter adjusted operating loss of 98 million compared to operating losses of 68 million in the prior quarter and 20 million in the prior year overall mortality for the fourth quarter continued to be elevated versus expectations though improved versus the prior quarter and prior year the fourth quarter included approximately 27 million after tax and covid 19 claims based upon death certificates received to date as part of our annual assumption review we made assumption updates on the term universal and universal life products as well for both mortality and interest rates which resulted in a combined unfavorable impact of 70 million in the fourth quarter in our universal life products we recorded a 32 million after tax charge for dac coverability testing compared to 30 million in the prior quarter and 50 million in the prior year these charges continue to reflect unfavorable mortality experience and block runoff in fixed annuities adjusted operating earnings of 20 million for the quarter included the benefit from favorable mortality in the single premium immediate annuity products in the runoff segment our adjusted operating income was 16 million for the fourth quarter compared to 11 million in the prior quarter and 13 million in the prior year variable annuity performance was driven by equity market performance which was favorable versus the prior quarter though less favorable than the prior year for the u s life insurance company statutory financials and cash flow testing results remain in process and will be made available with our year end statutory filings we expect consolidated capital in genworth life insurance company or glic as a percentage of rbc to be approximately 290 at december 31 in line with the 291 at september 30 this is due in part to the expected negative impacts of the life assumption updates and cash flow testing offset by the 170 million statutory capital benefit from the life block reinsurance transaction completed in the quarter rbc is significantly higher than the 229 at december 31 2020 due primarily to the favorable ltc statutory earnings in the year this increase was driven by the benefit from in force rate actions including the impacts from the choice one legal settlement favorable investment performance and favorable terminations we expect glic consolidated year end capital in surplus to be close to 3 billion as we ve seen a strong trend throughout the year pages 15 and 16 highlight recent trends in statutory performance for ltc and glic consolidated on a quarter lag basis due to the timing of when statutory results are finalized statutory earnings for ltc are generally higher than gaap earnings as the concept of profits followed by losses that i discussed earlier does not exist under statutory accounting statutory earnings are also aligned to taxable earnings which have resulted in strong cash tax payments to the parent holding company throughout 2021 rounding out our results we reported an adjusted operating loss in the corporate and other segment of 18 million which was an improvement of 31 million from the prior year reflecting lower interest expense given the reduction of holding company debt as well as lower corporate expenses turning to the holding company we ended the quarter with 356 million of cash and liquid assets page 17 provides a detailed cash activity for the quarter key items in the quarter included the debt reduction of 518 million of principal the dividend from enact of 163 million and 75 million in the intercompany cash tax payments reflecting strong underlying taxable income from enact and the u s life insurance business the holding company received 370 million in cash taxes in 2021 we will continue to utilize holding company tax assets in 2022 and anticipate that the holding company will receive approximately 200 million in cash taxes in 2022 subject to ultimate taxable income generated given our current tax position we do not anticipate paying federal taxes in the near term in closing when i think about where we started 2021 i m incredibly proud of our financial results and the progress we ve made against our strategic priorities for the full year 2021 net income was very strong at 904 million versus 178 million in 2020 and adjusted operating income was 765 million versus 310 million in 2020 enact contributed 520 million in adjusted operating earnings to genworth in 2021 and we re very pleased with ltc s 445 million in adjusted operating earnings while statutory results are still in progress we estimate full year after tax statutory net income for the u s life insurance business of 660 million driven by ltc s estimated 910 million of pre tax statutory income throughout 2021 we improved our financial strength and flexibility each quarter putting up strong operating results driving efficiencies to reduce our annual run rate expenses by approximately 75 million maximizing the value of our assets and reducing our debt and overall cost of capital with the completion of the enact ipo we achieved rating upgrades from moody s and s p at the parent holding company in recognition of the improved credit risk profile and increased financial flexibility enact was also upgraded by moody s s p and fitch which has enabled it to expand its customer base and be more competitive against peers in 2021 we took a proactive approach to managing our holding company debt which has strengthened our balance sheet as we head into 2022 we retired over 2 billion in debt including the axa promissory note and of approximately 1 2 billion of parent holding company debt remaining as of year end we plan to retire the remaining 2024 debt of 282 million ahead of its maturity date after we retire the 2024 debt our next debt maturity will be more than a decade away in 2034 and we would expect cash interest coverage to be approximately five times based on a conservative view of projected cash flows which will be great progress while it has been over 13 years since genworth returned capital to shareholders we plan on announcing more specific capital management plans later this year given the tremendous improvement in our financial condition achieved in 2021 the timing is dependent on redeeming the remaining 282 million of debt due in 2024 and enact s announcement of its future dividend policy the bottom line is that we ve had a terrific year and are entering 2022 with a strong foundation and a clear path for the future we look forward to sharing more with you soon now let s open the line for questions questions answers operator and we ll go first to ryan krueger with kbw ryan krueger kbw analyst hi good morning could you give a little more detail and quantification on what the impact to your long term care reserve margins was from i guess the changes excluding the assumption of higher future premium rate increases in other words i m just trying to isolate what the assumption changes were prior to then assuming higher future premium increases tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer dan do you want to cover that dan sheehan chief financial officer and chief investment officer yeah thanks tom so ryan if you look at page nine of the investor presentation we provide a little bit more detail there what i would say sorry i had an echo what i would say is two things one is the disabled life reserve assumptions overall are holding up sorry about that i had a call coming in at the same time on the active life side the biggest impact was the benefit utilization where we look at our long term assumptions and we updated them to reflect emerging experience and increased cost of care growth that we ve seen both in the overall economy from higher inflation but also specifically from some of the minimum wage increases that have been passed through at different state levels the other assumptions that were material enough to mention here was healthy life mortality and that s to reflect emerging experience i should note that we did not include any experience from the covid pandemic in our assumptions these are very long term assumptions and we continue to believe that the covid impacts are temporary we also updated interest rate assumptions and despite the fact that rates have increased recently we do know that overall rates have been coming down and then to the point that you mentioned we did offset that with rate increases ryan krueger kbw analyst got it i guess the separate question is i guess it sounds like tom you mentioned the potential to spin off enact eventually over time but it sounds like it s contingent on getting more rate increases in ltc that you feel like that can stand alone how does the i guess the potential to recover some of the axa proceeds come into play i guess if you did receive a material amount back from that would that potentially accelerate your ability to spin off enact or is it more dependent on long term care rate increases and developing the new business there tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer well ryan it s a great question obviously if there s a settlement and recovery on the axa litigation that would be a significant amount of cash flow which will clearly allow us to accelerate both our capital management program we could also further reduce debt it would help if we have any capital investment in the new business and clearly it would help us with the spin off the issue is it s pretty clear the value of the spin off and obviously our shareholders recognize that value the challenge is the remainco and our view is we would need remainco to be viable and we think to be viable as a public company it would need to be in good shape on the ltc side and we talked about we re making great progress there so i think that will continue very confident in that and then these growth strategies hopefully they will produce good results sooner rather than later and i think if remainco therefore based on not a large gap remaining to breakeven and investors can see the growth potential then i think that helps with the timing of the tax free spin off ryan krueger kbw analyst thanks and then just last question on capital return i guess are you contemplating share repurchase or is it more focused on the potential dividend tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer you know ryan we ll evaluate that but i think you know there s dan and i talked a lot of our big shareholders and even our retail shareholders some prefer share buybacks some dividends my guess is that in the early days capital management and maybe more share repurchases than a regular dividend but we ll look at them ryan krueger kbw analyst understood thanks for the answers tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thanks ryan operator we ll go next to joshua esterov with creditsights joshua esterov creditsights analyst hi good morning appreciate the time nice quarter today i have a couple of questions for you folks first in light thinking about the term life reinsurance transaction that you executed how well do the legacy fixed annuity or the variable annuity policies in the runoff segment still fit into the overall scheme obviously there s been a lot of interest from third parties in acquiring or reinsuring some of these blocks of businesses and i m wondering if genworth has been exploring options for that for those products potentially for the purposes of further bolstering rbc ratios as well tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer look i think we remain very open to transactions that make sense and add value so we did the life transaction clearly there are parties as you mentioned josh that have interest in fixed annuities and as those opportunities show up we fully evaluate them and make a decision based on the pricing and so on whether it makes sense to move forward or not obviously in the case of this life transaction it made sense to move forward with it and there was a significant benefit to stat capital i think dan said 170 million joshua esterov creditsights analyst got it thank you and kind of as a follow up to that is there anything in particular about the fixed annuity or the va block that is generally kind of supportive of the company s overall goals including a lot of the ones that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks with resuming some kind of ltc whether that s direct insurance or services business tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer yeah i would good questions josh i would say on the variable annuity it s been a runoff a long time and it s a relatively small block i think around 5 billion and we re open to opportunities there but it s relatively small on fixed annuity and you can see in the quarterly results and the full year results it s performing very well so it provides a very good statutory in u s gaap earnings on the other hand if we get a very attractive offer and value we d certainly consider selling it or reinsuring it it really comes down to and of course like everyone we get calls all the time on this it comes down to an economic analysis does it make more sense to hold it with the earnings that come with it or is offer on the reinsurance or deal strong enough where it makes sense to do the transaction versus holding it so that s the balance we do joshua esterov creditsights analyst understood appreciate that and then separately obviously you ve done a fantastic job of reducing the overall parent company debt burden and i m just hoping you can maybe help me understand a little bit better how you re thinking about prioritizing the remaining debt reduction initiatives that you folks have in mind so by way of example so like in the fourth quarter you took out a portion of the 2024s and you noted earlier that you intend to continue to take out that obligation those are trading above par at this point some other securities namely thinking about the junior subs out there trading well below par maybe an opportunity to take some of those out at a gain obviously very low coupon there is kind of the offset and just trying to get a sense of your thoughts on that and maybe even further out beyond that where do you feel you stand with regards to maybe at some point access to the debt markets to potentially fuel repurchase activity share repurchase activity tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer well there s a lot there josh and so i would say and i ll turn over to dan in a second on the specifics but at a strategic level i think the first priority would be to redeem the 280 million of 24s that are outstanding that s a huge thing when we get there because that would mean the remaining debt is 900 million the 34s and the 66s the interest expense is 35 million to 40 million so we got our interest coverage ratio when we get the debt there in a very strong place certainly our debt to capital interest coverage would be investment grade and so we re hopeful the rating agencies will see that the 66 yes they re trading below 100 but as most companies when they have these hybrid securities and you have senior securities like the 34s ahead of it we would have before we could repurchase the 66 we d have to take the 34s out and there are pluses and minuses to that so i think where we are is we ll definitely take the 24s out i think this year and then the others we ll see i don t think you ll see us issue shares to buy back i mean i m sorry if you knew debt to buy back shares i do think to the extent that the axa litigation gets resolved that would give us a significant opportunity to do further capital management but i don t see us we ve been i ve been here nine years we ve gone from over 4 billion of debt to 900 million and we re very comfortable with that so as i said in my remarks the lowest debt to capital ratio in the industry among the lowest and the with the annual interest so low we re really out of place we have a very strong balance sheet now and so we wouldn t want to jeopardize that there are also some rating agency and debt to capital issues that with the gses have for the parent dan do you want to just give a flavor for we did do quite a bit of repurchase of the 24s and just how you and your team look at the outstanding debt and the trading opportunities with ours dan sheehan chief financial officer and chief investment officer yeah thanks tom so i ll back into this a little bit we ended the year at 356 million of past which is in excess of the amount we have remaining on the 2024s at 280 once we pay off the 24s our thought is that we would want to hold somewhere between let s call it 100 million to 125 million maybe as much as 150 million of cash and so if you think about that we need a couple of more quarters of internal cash generation from cash tax payments and hopefully ultimately a dividend from enact to get to that level once we do we ll be in a position to consider paying off early the 2024s and we ll assess that quarter by quarter as we continue to make progress here beyond that we have not thought very significantly about paying down debt beyond that 900 million outstanding simply because shareholders have waited a long time for us to get into a position like this where we generate excess cash and so once we get there we ll evaluate it but right now our priority remains in getting ourselves in a position to pay off those 2024s and hit our debt target joshua esterov creditsights analyst thank you both appreciate all the feedback tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thank you josh operator ladies and gentlemen we have time for one final question from ryan gilbert with btig ryan gilbert btig analyst hi thanks very much good morning everyone first question s on holding company cash in 22 and sources of uses it sounds like based on the comments that you just made the retiring the remaining 2024s will be a use of cash in 22 is there any way you can quantify sources and uses for the other line items over the year tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer i ll let you handle that one dan dan sheehan chief financial officer and chief investment officer yeah i guess i would make a couple of comments first of all we ve put an estimate out there at about 200 million of cash tax payments coming in i would just state one thing related to that which is it will be a little bit front end loaded in that we ve had a very good year in 2021 and there will be a little bit of a catch up payment in the first quarter so if it looks like we re ahead of the plan at that point i would just hold off on changing those estimates what i would say in terms of sources and uses i mean for the most part our expenses are debt service coverage at this point we ve got a little bit of ins and outs beyond that we do fund compensation earlier in the year and get reimbursed and so there will be some pluses and minuses as we go through but the vast majority of expenses beyond the debt redemption will be just interest expense ryan gilbert btig analyst ok got it and then second question is on i guess just following up on the dividend versus share repurchase commentary and i believe you said last quarter that you expect a significant reduction in book value in conjunction with the ldti accounting change does that play into your consideration on dividends versus repurchases and basically what i mean is if there s a significant reduction in book value then repurchase might be less accretive than to book value per share than what it currently screens at tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer well ryan i would say that we re very much looking forward as dan said it s been a while since we ve been able in more than a decade to return capital to shareholders so we are very anxious to implement a capital management program i think we ll do that this year and we ll have more to say to that next quarter in may between regular dividends or share buybacks obviously we ll look at that at the time ldti and u s gaap accounting changes it s going to be interesting because the biggest change there and you can argue that as we decided what they decided but the biggest impact of ldti is the discount rate you have to use a single corporate rate and that s today and it s higher than it was a quarter ago but it s a significant reduction from our earned rate and i would argue discounting at the earn rate is probably more what i think makes sense i think i guess the fasb decided the a rate is more of a current market rate so you look at the liabilities with that discount rate i don t think it s going to have a big impact on our capital management how we look at regular dividends versus share buybacks i also think the regulators really don t focus at all on u s gaap and i think they ll certainly look at what the implications are of ldti but their focus will be more on statutory but certainly to the extent that when we get through all that process and we expect that like most of the life industry because it affects all of us we ll have more to say that on that in the details on midyear we certainly will evaluate the pluses and minuses of either but i don t see ldti itself as having a significant impact of what we decided to do some of it will be based on feedback from shareholders in terms of how they balance repurchases for dividends i will say and dan and i talk to shareholders all the investors and shareholders all the time there seems to be somewhat of a priority for buybacks over regular dividends but we ll look at it at the time and i think the board dan and i will spend quite a bit of time in the first quarter with outside advisors thinking all through that and we ll have more to say on our first quarter call in may ryan gilbert btig analyst ok got it that s very helpful last question from me on the just on the ltc business and the myrap i appreciate all the commentary this quarter but i do want to acknowledge that it looks like the deficit between the approval and the needed increases on a cash basis has expanded to over 9 billion from 8 billion last year and you said that you re confident that you ll be able to close that gap in the coming years and i m wondering if there s any specifics you can add to what gives you that confidence in your ability to close the gap is it just you re picking up the pace on getting premium rate increases approved or do you think you re near the tail end of the assumption revisions any specifics would be helpful tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer yeah so ryan great questions and it s a complex question but i would refer you to slide 14 i think slide 14 has a lot of very viable information and if you look at the two biggest blocks are choice one and choice two and together there are about 650 000 policies so that s about 65 and the average age for choice one rounded to 75 for choice two it s 72 so therefore and with the peak claim years being sort of mid 80s or call it 80 to 85 somewhere in there on choice one it s five to 10 years before those policyholders really get to their pre claim years there are some claims and you can see it again on that page 14 and for choice two it s eight to 13 years so we re going to have several years before we get to those peak claim years a very strong statutory earnings which will build statutory capital and we had a record year this year of approved premium increases 403 million we had never gone over 400 million but each of the last three if you look at the last three years and go back on approved premium increases they were 350 million or more each year if you go back to six years ago that s a significant increase in the amount of approved increases for the last few years so i just think what s different today is regulators are much more comfortable giving premium increases i said jamala arland and her team do a great job i think regulators definitely acknowledge that we have a very strong projection model and so yes the we did it did increase to 9 billion dan went through the numbers but we ve gotten 20 billion with 5 1 billion in 2021 alone but those the changes in the assumptions and if you again on the bottom of page 14 you ll see the average approval on choice one choice two i think choice one is unlimited it s 185 choice two is 125 and that s less than what we got on the older blocks so most of the 9 billion is going to ultimately be on the choice one and choice two and one there s a longer premium runway because the policyholders will be paying premiums longer and we re going to be getting the premium increases well before we get to the peak claim here so again i feel very comfortable we have significant time many years to work with regulators to get those premium increases so that s why we feel very good about where we are given the tremendous progress the last three years this year was a record i think we ve got off to a pretty good start in 2022 we did a lot of filings for approved increases last year so i just think if you look at our three year track record it s extremely strong and it s much better than if you looked at three years before that and i think that will continue so we re confident that we re going to close the gap ryan gilbert btig analyst ok good to hear i really appreciate it thank you for the time tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer thank you ryan operator ladies and gentlemen i will now turn the call back over to mr mcinerney for closing comments tom mcinerney president and chief executive officer jennifer thank you very much and thanks to all of you for the call today and for the good questions we re incredibly proud as you heard both dan and i say of genworth s operating performance and the progress against our five strategic priorities in 2021 and we think it was an exceptional year for the company and a major transformational year and i think it bodes very well going forward for shareholder value creation i think our earnings are strong both in enact particularly the statutory earnings for the life companies we expect to continue to be strong and i think the board dan and i are very pleased that we think later this year again a little more to say in may we ll look to return capital to shareholders first time in 13 years so that s a major strategic priority for us as you can imagine in terms of giving our shareholders and investors a sense of the confidence we now have and how well we expect to do for the next several years so with that i want to thank you for your interest and support of genworth and with that i ll turn the call back over to jennifer operator duration 68 minutes call participants sarah crews director of

certain financial measures such as adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue adjusted loss adjusted loss per share eps and adjusted cash flows used in operating activities these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies

these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under ifrs these non ifrs measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus may highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures we also believe that

indicators we monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business formulate business plans and make strategic decisions these key performance indicators are also used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures we also believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies arpu average revenue per user or arpu represents the total subscription revenue and transaction based revenue of the company in the period divided by the number of customer locations of the company in the period for greater clarity and consistent with how we have historically calculated arpu the number of customer locations of the company in the period is calculated by taking the average number of customer locations throughout the period customer locations customer location means a billing merchant location for which the term of services have not ended or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract and in the case of nuorder a brand with

certain financial measures such as adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue adjusted loss adjusted loss per share eps and adjusted cash flows used in operating activities these measures are not recognized measures under ifrs and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies rather these measures are provided as additional information to complement those ifrs measures by providing further understanding of our results of operations from management s perspective accordingly these measures should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for analysis of our financial information reported under ifrs these non ifrs measures are used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus may highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures we also believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non ifrs measures in the evaluation of issuers our management also uses non ifrs measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period to prepare operating budgets and forecasts and to determine components of management compensation adjusted ebitda is defined as net loss excluding interest taxes depreciation and amortization or ebitda as adjusted for share based compensation and related payroll taxes compensation expenses relating to acquisitions completed foreign exchange gains and losses transaction related costs restructuring and litigation provisions adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue is calculated by dividing our adjusted ebitda by our revenue adjusted loss is defined as net loss excluding amortization of intangibles as adjusted for share based compensation and related payroll taxes compensation expenses relating to acquisitions completed transaction related costs restructuring litigation provisions and deferred income tax expense recovery adjusted loss as a percentage of revenue is calculated by dividing our adjusted loss by our revenue adjusted loss per share eps is defined as net loss excluding amortization of intangibles as adjusted for share based compensation and related payroll taxes compensation expenses relating to acquisitions completed transaction related costs restructuring litigation provisions and deferred income tax expense recovery divided by the weighted average number of common shares basic and diluted adjusted cash flows used in operating activities is defined as cash flows used in operating activities as adjusted for the payment of payroll taxes on share based compensation the payment of compensation expenses relating to acquisitions completed the payment of transaction costs assumed through recent acquisitions the payment of transaction related costs the payment of restructuring costs and payments related to litigation provisions net of amounts received as insurance and indemnification proceeds see the financial tables below for a reconciliation of the non ifrs financial measures key performance indicators we monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business formulate business plans and make strategic decisions these key performance indicators are also used to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on ifrs measures we also believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use industry metrics in the evaluation of issuers our key performance indicators may be calculated in a manner different than similar key performance indicators used by other companies arpu average revenue per user or arpu represents the total subscription revenue and transaction based revenue of the company in the period divided by the number of customer locations of the company in the period for greater clarity and consistent with how we have historically calculated arpu the number of customer locations of the company in the period is calculated by taking the average number of customer locations throughout the period customer locations customer location means a billing merchant location for which the term of services have not ended or with which we are negotiating a renewal contract and in the case of nuorder a brand with a direct or indirect paid subscription for which the terms of services have not ended or in respect of which we are negotiating a subscription renewal a single unique customer can have multiple customer locations including physical and ecommerce sites and in the case of nuorder multiple subscriptions in light of the acquisition of nuorder the definition of customer locations was adjusted during the three months ended september 30 2021 to include brands with direct or indirect paid subscriptions gross transaction volume gross transaction volume or gtv means the total dollar value of transactions processed through our cloud based saas platform excluding amounts processed through the nuorder solution in the period net of refunds inclusive of shipping and handling duty and value added taxes we believe gtv is an indicator of the success of our customers and the strength of our platform gtv does not represent revenue earned by us we have excluded amounts processed through the nuorder solution from our gtv because they represent business to business volume rather than business to consumer volume and we do not currently have a robust payments solution for business to business volume forward looking statements this news release contains forward looking information and forward looking statements collectively forward looking information within the meaning of

executive vice president and co chief operating officers and bill wheat our executive vice president and chief financial officer the d r horton team delivered an outstanding first quarter highlighted by a 48 increase in earnings to 3 17 per diluted share our consolidated pre tax income increased 45 to 1 5 billion on a 19 increase in revenues and our consolidated pre tax profit margin improved 380 basis points to 21 2 our homebuilding return on inventory for the trailing 12 months ended december 31 was 38 5 and our consolidated return on equity for the same period was 32 4 these results reflect our experienced teams their production capabilities and our ability to leverage d r horton s scale across our broad geographic footprint even with the recent rise in mortgage rates housing market conditions remain very robust and we are focused on maximizing returns while continuing to increase our market share there are still significant challenges in the supply chain including shortages in certain building materials and a very tight labor market we are focused on building the infrastructure and processes to support a higher level of home starts while working to stabilize and then reduce construction cycle times to our historical norms after starting construction on 25 500 homes this quarter our homes and inventory increased 30 from a year ago to 54 800 homes with only 1 000 unsold completed homes across the nation our january home starts and net sales holders were in line with our targets and we are well positioned to achieve double digit volume growth in 2022 we believe our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage position us very well to operate effectively through changing economic conditions we plan to maintain our flexible operational and financial position by generating strong cash flows from our homebuilding operations while managing our product offerings incentives home pricing sales base and inventory levels to optimize returns mike mike murray executive vice president and co chief operating officer earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 increased 48 to 3 17 per diluted share compared to 2 14 per share in the prior year quarter net income for the quarter increased 44 to 1 1 billion compared to 792 million our first quarter home sales revenues increased 17 to 6 7 billion on 18 396 homes closed up from 5 7 billion on 18 739 homes closed in the prior year our average closing price for the quarter was 361 800 up 19 from the prior year quarter while the average size of our homes closed was down 1 paul paul romanowski executive vice president and co chief operating officer our net sales orders in the first quarter increased 5 to 21 522 homes while the value increased 29 from the prior year to 8 3 billion a year ago our first quarter net sales orders were up 56 due to the surge in housing demand during the first year of the pandemic when we had significantly more completed homes available to sale and prior to the significant supply chain challenges we ve experienced since our average number of active selling communities decreased 3 from the prior year quarter and was up 3 sequentially our average sales price on net sales orders in the first quarter was 383 600 up 22 from the prior year quarter the cancellation rate for the first quarter was 15 down from 18 in the prior year quarter new home demand remains very strong despite the recent rise in mortgage rates our local teams are continuing to sell homes later in the construction cycle so we can better ensure the certainty of the home close date for our homebuyers with virtually no sales occurring prior to start of home construction we plan to continue managing our sales pace in the same manner during the spring and we expect our number of net sales orders in our second quarter to be equal to the same quarter in the prior year were up by no more than a low single digit percentage our january home sales and net sales order volume were in line with our plans and we are well positioned to deliver double digit volume growth in fiscal 2022 with 29 300 homes in backlog 54 800 homes in inventory a robust lot supply and strong trade and supplier relationships bill bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer our gross profit margin on home sales revenues in the first quarter was 27 4 up 50 basis points sequentially from the september quarter the increase in our gross margin from september to december reflects the broad strength of the housing market the strong demand for homes combined with a limited supply has allowed us to continue to raise prices and maintain a very low level of sales incentives in most of our communities on a per square foot basis our home sales revenues were up 3 4 sequentially while our cost of sales per square foot increased 2 9 we expect our construction and lot costs will continue to increase however with the strength of today s market conditions we expect to offset most cost pressures with price increases in the near term we currently expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be similar to or slightly better than the first quarter jessica jessica hansen vice president investor relations in the first quarter homebuilding sg a expense as a percentage of revenues was 7 5 down 40 basis points from 7 9 in the prior year quarter our homebuilding sg a expense as a percentage of revenues was lower than any first quarter in our history and we remain focused on controlling our sg a while ensuring our infrastructure adequately supports our business paul paul romanowski executive vice president and co chief operating officer we have increased our housing inventory in response to the strength of demand and are focused on expanding our production capabilities further we started 25 500 homes during the quarter up 12 from the first quarter last year bringing our trailing 12 month starts to 94 200 homes we ended the quarter with 54 800 homes in inventory up 30 from a year ago 25 600 of our total homes at december 31 were unsold of which only 1 000 were completed our average cycle or average construction cycle time for homes closed in the first quarter has increased by almost two weeks since our fourth quarter and two months from a year ago although we have not seen much improvement in the supply chain yet we are focused on working to stabilize and then reduce our construction cycle times to historical norms mike mike murray executive vice president and co chief operating officer at december 31 our homebuilding lot position consisted of approximately 550 000 lots of which 24 were owned and 76 were controlled through purchase contracts 23 of our total owned lots are finished and at least 47 of our controlled lots are or will be finished when we purchase them our growing and capital efficient lot portfolio is a key to our strong competitive position and is supporting our efforts to increase our production volume to meet demand our first quarter homebuilding investments in lots land and development totaled 2 2 billion of which 1 2 billion was for finished lots 570 million was for land development and 390 million was to acquire land paul paul romanowski executive vice president and co chief operating officer forestar our majority owned residential lot manufacturer operates in 55 markets across 23 states forestar continues to execute extremely well and now expects to grow its lot deliveries this year to a range of 19 500 to 20 000 lots with a pre tax profit margin of 13 and a half to 14 at december 31 forestar s owned and controlled lot position increased 33 from a year ago to 103 300 lots 58 of forestar s owned lots are under contract with d r horton or subject to a right of first offer based on executed purchase and sale agreements 330 000 million of our finished lots purchased in the first quarter were from forestar forestar is separately capitalized from d r horton and had approximately 500 million of liquidity at quarter end with a net debt to capital ratio of 33 9 with its current capitalization strong lot supply and relationship with d r horton forestar plans to continue profitably growing their business bill bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer financial services pre tax income in the first quarter was 67 1 million with a pre tax profit margin of 36 4 compared to 84 1 million and 44 9 in the prior year quarter for the quarter 98 of our mortgage company s loan originations related to homes closed by our homebuilding operations and our mortgage company handled the financing for 66 of our home buyers fha and va loans accounted for 44 of the mortgage company s volume borrowers originating loans with dhi mortgage this quarter had an average fico score of 721 and an average loan to value ratio of 88 first time homebuyers represented 55 of the closings handled by the mortgage company this quarter mike mike murray executive vice president and co chief operating officer our rental operations generated pre tax income of 70 1 million on revenues of 156 5 million in the first quarter compared to 8 6 million of pre tax income on revenues of 31 8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2021 our rental property inventory at december 31 was 1 2 billion compared to 386 million a year ago we sold one multifamily rental property of 350 units for 76 2 million during the quarter there were no sales of multifamily rental properties during the prior year quarter we sold two single family rental properties totaling 225 homes during the quarter for 80 3 million compared to one property sold in the prior year quarter for 31 8 million at december 31 our rental property inventory included 519 million of multifamily rental properties and 642 million of single family rental properties as a reminder our multifamily and single family rental sales and inventories are reported in our rental segment and are not included in our homebuilding segments homes closed revenues or inventories in fiscal 2022 we continue to expect our rental operations to generate more than 700 million in revenues we also expect to grow the inventory investment in our rental platform by more than 1 billion this year based on our current projects in development and our significant pipeline of future projects we are positioning our rental operations to be a significant contributor to our revenues profits and returns in future years bill bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer our balanced capital approach focuses on being disciplined flexible and opportunistic during the three months ended december our cash used in homebuilding operations was 115 million as we invested significant operating capital to increase our homes and inventory to meet the current strong demand at december 31 we had 4 1 billion of homebuilding liquidity consisting of 2 1 billion of unrestricted homebuilding cash and 2 billion of available capacity on our homebuilding revolving credit facility we believe this level of homebuilding cash and liquidity is appropriate to support the scale and activity of our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions our homebuilding leverage was 17 3 at the end of december and homebuilding leverage net of cash was 6 9 our consolidated leverage at december 31 was 25 1 and consolidated leverage net of cash was 15 2 at december 31 our stockholders equity was 15 7 billion and book value per share was 44 25 up 29 from a year ago for the trailing 12 months ended december our return on equity was 32 4 compared to 24 4 a year ago during the quarter we paid cash dividends of 80 1 million and our board has declared a quarterly dividend at the same level as last quarter to be paid in february we repurchased 2 7 million shares of common stock for 278 2 million during the quarter our remaining share repurchase authorization at december 31 was 268 million we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases on a consistent basis and to reducing our outstanding share count each fiscal year jessica jessica hansen vice president investor relations as we look forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2022 we are expecting market conditions to remain similar with strong demand from homebuyers but continuing supply chain challenges we expect to generate consolidated revenues in our march quarter of 7 3 billion to 7 7 billion and homes closed by our homebuilding operations to be in a range between 19 000 and 20 000 homes we expect our home sales gross margin in the second quarter to be approximately 27 5 and homebuilding sg a as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter to be approximately 7 5 we anticipate the financial services pre tax profit margin in the range of 30 to 35 and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately 24 in the second quarter for the full fiscal year we continue to expect to close between 90 000 and 92 000 homes while we now expect to generate consolidated revenues of 34 5 billion to 35 5 billion we forecast an income tax rate for fiscal 2022 of approximately 24 and we also continue to expect that our share repurchases will reduce our outstanding share count by approximately 2 at the end of fiscal 2022 compared to the end of fiscal 2021 we still expect to generate positive cash flow from our homebuilding operations this year after our investments in home building inventories to support double digit growth we will then continue to balance our cash flow utilization priorities among increasing the investment in our rental operations maintaining conservative homebuilding leverage and strong liquidity paying an increased dividend and consistently repurchasing shares david david auld president and chief executive officer in closing our results reflect our experienced teams and production capabilities industry leading market share broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands our strong balance sheet liquidity and low leverage provide us with significant financial flexibility to capitalize on today s robust market and to effectively operate in changing economic conditions we plan to maintain our disciplined approach to investing capital to enhance the long term value of the company which includes returning capital to our shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases on a consistent basis thank you to the entire d r horton team for your focus and hard work we are incredibly well positioned to continue growing and improving our operations in 2022 this concludes our prepared remarks we will now host questions questions answers operator your first question for today is coming from john lovallo with ubs john your line is live john lovallo ubs analyst good morning everyone and thank you for taking my question the first one gross margins across the industry have risen to levels that are probably not sustainable over the longer term i guess the question is do you believe that this kind of mid to high 20 margin range could persist at dhi for maybe a couple of years and then as we move forward what has structurally changed in your opinion that would allow you to have trend margins that are maybe 100 to 200 basis points above the historical average jessica hansen vice president investor relations sure john we re very pleased with where our gross margins have gotten through this cycle and certainly the strength in the market has been a large driver of that we probably would never sit here today and say that those are sustainable at these levels through cycles typically gross margin does get somewhat competed away when markets soften that being said we re at extremely strong levels today and can still generate very strong returns even with some margin compression and we ll continue to meet the market over time in terms of what we believe is sustainable though compared to our historical averages certainly we re carrying less interest in our cost of sales today and with what we ve done from a deleveraging and our balance sheet focus we would expect that to be a sustainable cost advantage and then there s scale advantages with where we ve gotten in terms of our volume and our building efficiencies with our labor trades and our material suppliers we would expect some component of the scale advantages to be sustainable as well david auld president and chief executive officer and john we talked a little bit about this internally we talk a lot about it the industry is changing it s just a much more disciplined industry than it was through the last cycle as we gained in market share as the other publics gained in market share there s just less at least in my mind my expectation is there ll be less volatility at the cycle up and down it s just the real business is today not speculation john lovallo ubs analyst yes that makes a lot of sense ok and then my second question in an environment where rates are likely to rise here what do you view as the strategic advantages of implementing a predominantly spec focused building model and targeting entry level buyers perhaps maybe versus a build to order model targeting better finance buyers mike murray executive vice president and co chief operating officer first of all john what we would say is that we re able to more closely time the application for the mortgage the qualification for the mortgage and the closing of that mortgage so the buyer is spending less time in backlog when they re buying a house that has already started the production process that allows us to have fewer bad things happen to their potential credit profile where then they fall out of backlog and no longer qualify less interest rate risk while they re in that cycle and then finally just a continued focus on affordability i mean we re going to continue to seek to be affordable for our homebuyers and our markets john lovallo ubs analyst got it thank you guys mike murray executive vice president and co chief operating officer thanks john operator your next question is coming from stephen kim with evercore isi stephen your line is live stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah thanks very much guys i appreciate all the color here i was particularly intrigued by your comment about the number of homes you have under construction 56 600 i think and i think you also mentioned that your cycle time increased about two weeks so correct me if i m wrong but that would imply i think that your time from start to close is about seven and a half months first of all is that correct jessica hansen vice president investor relations roughly yes david auld president and chief executive officer yes stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah so if i think about your 56 600 homes and assume that you ll you assume basically a 7 5 month cycle time that would imply that you should be able to close 45 280 over the next two quarters your guidance for the second this next quarter is i think for 19 000 to 20 000 homes so considerably less than half of that amount and so i m curious as to is there anything wrong with the way i m thinking about how your homes on your construction should ultimately result in closings over the next two quarters given your cycle time is seven and a half months and if therefore we should be thinking that there might be an acceleration in 3q closings on that basis or if you if this represents some conservatism about extending cycle times mike murray executive vice president and co chief operating officer thank you steve i think one of the things you need to look at is how long those houses have been in production we started a substantial number of those homes in the most recent quarter i think we stepped up our starts from q4 to q1 by about 3 000 homes so those homes are obviously going to take a little longer to deliver in the process paul romanowski executive vice president and co chief operating officer and as we re looking at the remainder of the year the guidance we re providing for q2 is based on where the homes are in construction today but yes as we look at the full year based on when we started the homes and we look at where our guidance is for the full year we are a bit more back end loaded in terms of our closings in q3 and q4 than historically we are part of that is because of the elongated construction times that we have not seen improved yet and it s based on where our homes in construction currently set in terms of the construction cycle stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah great that s very helpful my second question relates to your initiatives in the rental area which i think is you ve talked about growing that inventory and therefore i would assume the associated revenues pretty significantly on a longer term basis my question is twofold one is there a rule of thumb that we could think what let s say every 1 billion of inventory on a steady state basis might yield in terms of a level of revenues that we could be forecasting and then secondly conceptually do you think that the demand for selling your rental properties is likely to be more resilient in the face of a rising rate environment than perhaps sales to folks who would be looking to actually move in i know that s your core business but nevertheless there is so much concern that many people have about rising rates and the impact on the entry level buyer that i was curious as to whether you felt like there was a backstop behind that buyer for rental operators that are sort of getting in line and would love to buy the homes that you re building for rent paul romanowski executive vice president and co chief operating officer well i ll start steve i guess first we re still growing this business and learning this business still a little bit early for us to be able to generalize on averages in terms of what level of revenue we might see per unit we re building across our entire homebuilding footprint so every property is unique in terms of size and the product and the market in which it s in so we re individually underwriting each one relative to whether it s better for rent community versus a for sale community obviously we ve been very pleased with the value that we ve been able to generate thus far and very excited about the opportunity of growing this business and adding value over time and been very pleased with the demand that there has been for our communities thus far and the execution that we ve seen in terms of our sales thus far bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and stephen we see such strong demand today for this product in this low interest rate environment and i think to your question of if we see rates tick up do we see that shift we like the ability to be in the market with this rental platform and be able to adjust to those shifts and market conditions we do believe that we re going to continue to see strong demand maybe not as strong as it is today with such a new category but we feel good about our position and the number of communities we re planning stephen kim evercore isi analyst sounds good thanks very much guys operator your next question is coming from mike rehaut with j p morgan mike your line is live mike rehaut j p morgan analyst great thanks good morning everyone first question i had was on the sg a side you came in nicely below your prior guidance at seven and a half percent versus 8 before versus your 8 guidance and down 40 bps year over year you re also guiding for i guess 2q guidance to be down only 10 bps year over year so i was just curious around what were the sources of the significantly better than expected results in the first quarter and why you don t expect further leverage in the second quarter similar to the first bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer sure thanks mike in the current environment where we re seeing such significant average selling price increases that s certainly one driver of the sg a leverage on the p l a little difficult to predict exactly where the average asp might fall in a particular quarter the trend over time has been upward over the last several quarters though and that s certainly a contributor to it so i would say we re probably a little bit conservative in projecting out the level of increases in our asps we are very actively building infrastructure to support the significant increase in scale that we have seen across our business over the last year and that we re projecting for the rest of the coming year and so we are anticipating significant increases in our sg a spend to support that and so we re just basically balancing that versus our expectations for our closings and with our closings expectations essentially roughly flat with last year in q2 based on our guidance we re not getting the volume leverage but we are still seeing the leverage from selling price increases mike rehaut j p morgan analyst ok bill so before i just hit on the second question just to make sure i understand given the expectation for the stronger revenue growth on a full year basis it seems like it s safe to assume maybe more than like a 10 bps sg a leverage for the full year if i m thinking about that right given you have the higher confidence let s say around an asp for the full year at least if you could comment on that that would be helpful and then secondly just on the rental income side that was a source of upside i believe relative to our expectations i believe relative to guidance as well if i m not mistaken 45 of a margin is that the right that 45 just any guidance or thoughts around how to think about the remainder of the year relative to the revenue generation you continue to expect bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer ok well first to wrap up the sg a question we re not guiding specifically to the full year on sg a however with the kind of heavier volume expected in our annual guidance in q3 and q4 we would expect to see more leverage on sg a probably than 10 basis points in q3 and q4 versus q2 with respect to the rental expectations we ve guided annually to more than 700 million of revenue we ve been very pleased with the margins and the execution we ve seen on the sales very recently the margin this quarter obviously was very strong some projects will continue to generate those margins others could certainly be short of that we haven t specifically guided to the margin on that business as of yet because each project is unique in terms of volume in the coming quarter we would expect q2 volume to be relatively similar to q1 and which we closed two single family properties and on multifamily property and then for the year basically lining that out to the 700 million of revenue mike rehaut j p morgan analyst great thanks so much operator your next question is coming from alan ratner with zelman alan your line is live alan ratner zelman and associates analyst hey good morning great quarter thanks for taking my questions first one i might be parsing the comments a little bit too much here so i just want to get some clarification i think you guys said earlier that you expect to offset most cost increases with price increases and obviously up to this point it s based on the margin trajectory you ve been able to offset more than the cost increases so i m just curious if that s a change in your thinking whether you re going to be maybe a little bit less aggressive pushing prices as 22 progresses or am i reading too much into that comment david auld president and chief executive officer i just alan as we continue to increase our starts for demand i would say at some point there s going to be more of an equilibrium and at that point margins and asps should mitigate some we don t know again we re a return based absorption targets start targets being able to sustain a level of starts drives efficiencies through the entire process we don t know what the future is we do know that we can operate within that future and maximize the results both returns and market share gains jessica hansen vice president investor relations and part of that thought process also alan is our continued focus on affordability and so although the market is really strong today and we continue to take price we re probably not out there like some other builders trying to take every last dollar of price we re doing what we can to meet the market and try to stay affordable in spite of rising cost conditions alan ratner zelman and associates analyst got it yeah both of that makes a lot of sense and jessica your follow on comment there was actually something i was going to ask next and that s that your price increases especially on the order side have been very strong and we re starting to hear from some builders talking about their desire to actually bring that average price back down a little bit over the next year or two as they introduce new communities and maybe they re a little bit further out or maybe the floor plans are a bit smaller so should we think about that similarly with you guys are you actually kind of looking at that average price and kind of your standing in the marketplace and trying to actually bring that down on at least an absolute basis going forward david auld president and chief executive officer alan we re always focused on affordability and we talk entirely about a sustainable run rate in these communities and that involves not overpricing at any point in time so but yes we re looking at product we re looking at communities land how do we drive more and more efficiency into the process so that we can maintain a more affordable living cost and then that s to me that s market scale as consistency and starts it s as we continue to drive market share gains consolidate labor we re in a better position to acquire land and it s just an ongoing continuous effort to get a little bit better every day alan ratner zelman and associates analyst makes a lot of sense if i can sneak in one last one just on january you and others have obviously highlighted very strong demand continue in january i m curious if you ve seen any notable shifts in sentiment or activity across your price points given the uptick here in rates are you seeing maybe more discretionary buyers jumping in because their concerned rates are going to continue climbing so like in your active business or emerald or has the strength been pretty consistent with what you ve seen prior to this move mike murray executive vice president and co chief operating officer alan i don t think we ve seen in the last month any real discernible difference we still have more buyers in all of our markets than we have homes available and so we are continuing to release those homes at a later stage of construction and so meeting that demand with the inventory as it gets to that point in its construction cycle so hard to gauge whether it s a significant shift of any sort and we still are seeing strong demand across all of our markets and across all demand basis david auld president and chief executive officer all price points alan ratner zelman and associates analyst perfect all right thanks for the time guys appreciate it jessica hansen vice president investor relations thanks alan operator your next question is coming from carl reichardt with btig carl your line is live carl reichardt btig analyst thanks hi everybody paul i think you are the one who said this that you re working to stabilize and then reduce cycle times pragmatically what specifically do you do to make that happen given that builders are outsourcers effectively and why and how do you do that better at horton than say a peer would david auld president and chief executive officer carl i think a lot of the things at horton is just because we just work harder than other everybody works hard but our people are just phenomenal problem solvers and it s a part of the culture the decentralized nature i mean they take ownership and they saw problems what we have tried to do is guide the divisions to understand the capacity within communities and consistently start homes to meet that capacity and when they do that the capacity increases because the people in those communities get a little better at building those houses and we re seeing that in i don t know what the industry average is but i got to believe we are completing homes even though it is not to our historical norm steel more rapidly than our peers out there but it s a consistent starts limited product limited options making it easier for these traits to get in and get out reducing the skus that we re asking our suppliers to hold and in some cases ordering early in some cases i mean anything everything that we can do to eliminate or break a bottleneck and the people in the field are doing and i can tell you 100 stories but i m not going to carl reichardt btig analyst fair enough thanks david and then i wanted to ask about lot count you re over 550 000 under control now and the buildup spend significant right i mean i think it was up 40 last year so at some point these lots got to come to market so if you think about how they might is this you could have bigger communities going forward you could have more communities going forward in existing markets you could have new markets can you sort of break out as you look at your lot position now sort of as you grow where those different elements fit into the long term puzzle here kind of bigger communities more communities in existing markets i e potentially more share or new markets thanks bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer yes d all of the above it will be some margin carl reichardt btig analyst i said that one already but in terms of sort of the long term split is kind of what i m asking bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t know that we d see a big change in our long term split we are continually evaluating new markets and at the same time the mandate is to the teams in the field aggregate your market share we feel that local scale drives a lot of value in the business for us and the lot supply is a key part of it i will tell you the frustration it takes longer just like it has to build a house it takes longer to get a neighborhood approved it takes longer to get lots built today than it did a year or two years ago and so we re continuing to challenge that so just like our housing supply has increased relative to our current delivery levels our lot controlled lot position has increased to support those lots coming on just taking longer to get into the finish line jessica hansen vice president investor relations and our market count has continued to expand so we re in 102 markets today that s up just four markets sequentially we continue to fill out kind of the more midwestern ohio valley part of our footprint and continue to look at additional markets that would make sense to expand into as well carl reichardt btig analyst thanks everybody david auld president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question is coming from matthew bouley with barclays matthew your line is live matthew bouley barclays analyst good morning everyone thank you for taking my question so have a question on cancellations and interest rates just given how low cancellations are at this point i know you do those stress tests on the backlog and have talked about sort of flexing 100 basis points increase in mortgage rates but i guess to what degree does the speed of rates rising coupled with these extended cycle times play into all that i mean we had a 50 basis point rise in just four weeks you got buyers in backlog that may have to wait several months at this point so how do we think about risk to an uptick in cancellations here thank you bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer well i think as you look at those stress tests that we do and we ve run it again and seeing a slight uptick in it but still nominal and the interest rate increase we ve seen today have spurred further demand much more so than knock people out of qualification and ability to qualify jessica hansen vice president investor relations and i think mike mentioned earlier but that s also part of the key to selling homes later in the construction cycle as they re not having to lock for longer or be worried about what an interest rate move does so if we re selling closer to the time of completion and home closing there s less risk in that regard as well matthew bouley barclays analyst yeah ok good that make sense and then second one on the cycle times again maybe they improve at some point maybe they don t but assuming there s not a significant amount of new building products capacity coming online this year are there any structural changes you re making to the supply chain even if it s not possible in every single building material is there anything you can do with more prefab packages for example i heard you say earlier simplification of skus and any of these changes you re making today are they structural in nature or is it simply adjusting to whatever the market is at any point bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer i think as david mentioned before i mean it s everything everywhere we definitely empower our local business leaders to solve the bottlenecks that are unique to their market and there are some that are broader in nature and our national purchasing team and regional purchasing teams do a great job of partnering with those manufacturers and our trade partners to give them more forward visibility to our expected demands and then help to understand how that product gets from point of manufacturer through distribution kind of get the product that s being earmarked for us into the distribution chain through it on to our job sites when we need it not always a perfect process we would certainly like it to be faster but it s increased communication simplification of product and a lot of anything we need to do market by market matthew bouley barclays analyst great well thank you for the color bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator your next question is coming from susan maklari with goldman sachs susan your line is live susan maklari goldman sachs analyst thank you good morning everyone david auld president and chief executive officer good morning susan maklari goldman sachs analyst my first question is is thinking about the potential use for more incentives in the market given the fact that the inventory is so low do you think that the likelihood of us seeing any real meaningful increase there is actually much more is actually much lower than it has been in the past do you think that we would need to see just a lot more on the ground in order for anything to meaningfully change david auld president and chief executive officer i don t see any change in the incentives coming it s i m sure at some point the inventory will catch up with demand it is still significantly out of balance especially if you re looking at the areas where the florida the texas the arizonas even across the midwest where you have job growth and influx of people it s you never say never but the difficulty of getting lots on the ground and then getting houses built is it s going to be very difficult to catch up with demand anytime in the next couple of years susan maklari goldman sachs analyst ok that s bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer now susan you touched on it with the level of inventory out there the use of incentives i think you d have to see a significant increase in the level of unsold inventories especially unsold completed inventories and today we re at 1 000 unsold completed homes at the end of december very low for us this time of the year to be carrying that few homes susan maklari goldman sachs analyst right ok thank you for that and then my follow up is thinking about the operational pressures in the industry even if the supply chain on the material side does eventually catch up and things there normalized do you think that we could be facing an overall tighter labor environment and construction relative to where we were before covid and if so how do you think about your ability to overcome that and continue to increase the level of production that you can deliver david auld president and chief executive officer it goes back to market scale and even within submarkets being able to control a labor base and keeping them busy keeping them in the same location i just can t i can t oversell that advantage where you ve got a program where we re releasing 15 20 30 houses every month month after month after month after month the aggregation of labor in those kinds of communities is it s very advantageous in today s world and it also gives you the ability to kind of direct some of that labor through the two or three or four or five a month absorption communities so it s market scale it s again everything that we ve done simplifying the product trying to maintain affordability and then having well located communities with long runway long run rate times susan maklari goldman sachs analyst ok that s very helpful thank you and good luck david auld president and chief executive officer thanks jessica hansen vice president investor relations thanks susan operator your next question is coming from eric bosshard with cleveland research eric your line is live eric bosshard cleveland research analyst good morning david auld president and chief executive officer good morning eric bosshard cleveland research analyst a couple of things first of all the outlook on costs if you could just provide some clarity on where that goes and especially trying to figure out the movement in lumber how that is flowing through where were trough lumber and where the lumber impact goes going forward especially on the cost side jessica hansen vice president investor relations sure so i ll start with lumber and then somebody else can chime in on the rest of our cost structure lumber costs have remained really volatile as i know you re aware we have had some opportunities to purchase at costs that were well below the peaks we saw i guess last spring and into the summer however those reductions in prices lasted a shorter period of time than we really expected and really probably hoped and lumber has been on the rise again for the last few months so there s been other supply chain delays that also caused the volatility in lumber prices we do hope that we ll see a mix that leans toward slightly lower costs in q2 which is baked into our q2 gross margin guide for flat to slightly up gross margins but then we do expect our lumber cost to trend back up in our closing starting in q3 and other costs bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer it s kind of a mixed bag but we would generally be seeing slight cost pressures in most places and so that s been offset by price increases i think some of the lumber relief we should see in q2 early q3 will help with some of that as well but as jessica mentioned lumber prices have gone back up and so those will be flowing through closings later this fiscal year jessica hansen vice president investor relations and really with home prices continue to increase i mean generally all costs typically follow and so we really wouldn t expect to see much in the way of cost relief until you see some sort of slowdown in home price appreciation eric bosshard cleveland research analyst ok and then secondly it seems like just a math equation but i know there s more to it than that but the incremental the modest increase in the revenue guide for the year with the same deliveries it appears that it s just looking at price and extrapolating that out but what else were the considerations and taking a bit more optimistic position on the full year revenue growth especially in front of the selling season paul romanowski executive vice president and co chief operating officer yeah eric it really is just an extrapolation of where we see prices now we ve got a few more months of visibility into our selling prices and where our closing prices moved up to in q1 and what our visibility is going into q2 that we feel like the sales prices that are baked in and that we have visibility to that justified increasing a pretty nice increase in our annual revenue guide but obviously with the continued challenges on the supply chain construction cycle times elongating we didn t really feel like we had any more room on the volume side as of yet so it s really solely priced and we feel good about that guidance for the year eric bosshard cleveland research analyst ok that makes sense thank you operator your next question is coming from rafe jadrosich with bank of america rafe your line is live rafe jadrosich bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi it s rafe here good morning thanks for taking my question jessica hansen vice president investor relations good morning rafe jadrosich bank of america merrill lynch analyst i wanted to start on the rental business can you talk a little bit about the returns you re targeting in the rental business and how that could compare to homebuilding longer term and then will you be targeting different markets in the rental business compared to the homebuilding segment bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer so rafe what we re seeing is we re growing that business pretty aggressively and we ve been very pleased with actually the returns that that business is produced on a trailing 12 month basis the profits that segments generated relative to its inventory investment have been about 20 and that s in a heavy growth ramp so we would expect to see that continue to increase especially when we get to have more of the projects delivering on a more consistent basis and i would say that the markets we seek to serve with that it s going to line up very well with our homebuilding for sale footprint as well we ve seen a lot of markets accept the product very well and the investor base very excited about those projects as well rafe jadrosich bank of america merrill lynch analyst and then on in terms of the pace of your home starts obviously the average ticked up a lot in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter i think about 1 000 a month what s allowing you to increase that pace sequentially and then how should we think about that going forward bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i think that that s in line with our plans and what we have set forth across all of our divisions and communities we target an absorption pace per community plan well ahead to make sure that we have those permits in hand and lots in front of us it s not easier today to put lots on the ground any more than it is easier to build a home but we have incredible operators in the field who stay ahead of this and it s allowed us to continually sequentially quarter over quarter increase our start pace and that s a cadence that we hope to continue the real key to our ability to do that is our lot position having that long lot position controlled and strong supplier relationships on will and the developer side puts our operators and positions to continue to start and increase our start base rafe jadrosich bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thank you operator your next question for today is coming from mike dahl with rbc capital markets mike your line is live mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions just a couple of follow ups here and maybe first one ties into the last one a little bit but the order guidance for your fiscal 2q being flat to low single digits it seems like you ve been pretty successful getting some inventory rebuild both sequentially and year on year your comps get a little easier in 2q versus 1q so can you just talk about the moving pieces on that order guide and why there can be some upside there bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer i think we re still seeing a restriction on sales relative to where the inventory is getting to in production so we re still waiting to sell the homes closer to the delivery date and so that s kind of what s really the real driver is on our sales expectation our comp is still up against a 35 increase last year in the second quarter it does certainly get to be a much easier comp in q3 and q4 this year from a sales perspective mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst got it ok and my second question i wanted to follow up on one of steve s questions from earlier around kind of rentals being potentially a backstop for sale because it s kind of an interesting concept especially as you scale that side of your business and the partnerships you have with buyers of those assets and so if the idea is at some point in time if for sale demand were to slow there could be an institutional buyer that would be looking at additional communities that you may have currently built as for sale but someone may want to buy wholesale and turn to rentals can you talk a little bit more about how you would view opportunities like that and i know the economics and the returns can look very different so maybe just even conceptually what it would have to take in terms of what the moving pieces around the return dynamics if you were to look at bulk sale in a community that was not intended for bulk sale at some point in the future david auld president and chief executive officer yeah mike i ve always we ve always believed that the rental platform when we get it built out will derisk our land portfolio because it does give us another lever but from just a philosophical standpoint we believe in the for sale business we believe home ownership in the country is very important today our goal is to deliver more homes because the demand is there and it s hard to believe five years from now homes are going to be more affordable than they are today so every family can get a home we feel like we is a win for us and for that family when we look at the risk in the rental platform the ability to scale that up the segment that s going to create it s going to be a real business all on its own and because of the geographic platform and the embedded divisions within that geography our ability to scale that and touch every market is we see as just great opportunity for our shareholders and for our people internally mike dahl rbc capital markets analyst ok thanks david david auld president and chief executive officer you bet operator your next question is coming from ken zener with keybanc ken your line is live ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning everybody david auld president and chief executive officer hey ken ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst i thought you guys were better because you paid for your own phones i have two simple questions one obviously with insatiable demand how you guys are approaching the cycle time in construction basically it looks like your investments in your inventory units are slowing right cycle time is about 5 sequentially you guys rose inventory 14 is that pretty much the move that you guys will pursue into the second half if the cycle time continue to compress that you ll just grow more units into the ground to compensate for that slower cycle time david auld president and chief executive officer we have start targets and we talk about consistent sustainable starts driving ultimately sales and closings and it s based on the capacity with the innovations to deliver those homes ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst ok i mean it seems to me that s the way you re approaching it and i guess realizing these conference call is long already david could you just we spoke about this in the past the interest rate you paid on your first home you highlighted obviously the very strong demand strong job growth can you guys just comment i mean we recently wrote about it but can you comment on the fact with your perspective about your comfort with the real rates being negative now compared to when you took your first mortgage rate just as a kind of a broad thought appreciate it david auld president and chief executive officer it s a great time i think it s more affordable today than it certainly was in the 80s the ability to get into a house lock down your homeownership or your housing cost for the next 20 years is a significant driving force in what s going on because as overall cost inflation interest rates as those continue to move up the people that have bought a house today even if it s at a price that s 15 20 higher than it was last year are i mean it s just a great thing so the other thing ken that we really don t talk much about but it s when i was 20 i mean that was just that was what was expected you figured out a way to buy a house and that became less cool for use of a stupid term as the millennials came into their 20s but what i m seeing and what my millennial daughter is telling me is now it s that s a big part of the narrative on social media is it s people want to own homes again and it s just i m amazed sometimes at some of the conversations around housing and i look at what it was and look at what it is i look at the just the demographic demand that s out there i look at the wealth effect of everything that s happened over the last 10 years and the american public is they re in a good place and from an affordability standpoint home ownership is better than it was in the 80s so i m very optimistic about what s going on i m very optimistic about this company and i m just in all of our people and how what they are accomplishing out there so i don t know if i answer your question but i told you what i m willing ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst always clear thank you operator your next question is coming from truman patterson with wolfe research truman your line is live truman patterson wolfe research analyst hey good morning everyone thanks for takin my question here so david i just want to follow up on one of your prior comments about the public scanning market share and i know it might be difficult to generalize but i m hoping to understand what you re hearing on the ground from local operators regarding some of your private builder competitors are they expecting their home inventory to jump significantly through 2022 expecting strong activity or strong active land or community count growth or are you expecting more of the same of a pretty constrained environment for your private builder peers i m also asking this in light that you all make a 10 plus of the market you all had really nice order growth in the quarter but when you look at new home sales in the fourth quarter it was down more than 20 plus so i m really hoping you can help us think through this as we move through 22 david auld president and chief executive officer we actually were talking about this and getting ready for the call the private builders and even some of the smaller public builders are going to have very difficult time delivering houses i mean we re having it is hard for us i mean it s probably harder to complete and finish a house today as it s been in my career in home building and as these private guys who don t have our scale who don t have our ability to driver result their houses are setting and that s going to cut off their access to the next house they start anecdotally we are talking to the builders end markets they re just tired they don t they ve got six seven eight banks they re sideways with two of them and they re looking to us to take out their log supply and they maybe become a developer for us in that market so it s if the supply chains don t loosen up i think you re going to see the consolidation accelerate in the market by the big box because what is the big constraint on the market on housing is the ability to get lots in front of you and the private guys they don t have that ability that publics do and that s so when you look at new home sales decline that doesn t have anything to do with demand that has to be built 60 of the homes being built out they re being built by nonpublic and i think all of this cycle you re going to see that group s ability to start houses continue to deteriorate and that is going to get picked up by the public even if the overall housing market new home housing market declines i think the top tier developers are going to pick up market share and they re going to continue to grow so that s what happening truman patterson wolfe research analyst ok interesting there s clearly been a lot of discussion with the fed likely raising rates this year we can debate what sort of impact that might have on demand versus lack of supply and everything but hypothetically let s say demand does soften which consumer segment do you all think holds up relatively better between entry level move up luxury active adult and are there any geographies that you all think might underperform jessica hansen vice president investor relations this is probably i know somewhat of a contrarian view the way the market sometimes it reacts to entry level builders but we generally continue to think about an entry level buyer as a buyer out of need rather than discretion so although as prices continue to rise and or rates are to increase and affordability gets negatively impacted you do lose a subset of entry level buyers that can qualify for arm we do expect over the long term that to continue to be the lion s share of the demand which is why we continue to focus on affordability because as i said those buyers are buying out of need whereas the further the price curve you go that s a more discretionary buyer maybe a little bit more financially savvy that is more focused on timing of an interest rate versus just an absolute monthly payment truman patterson wolfe research analyst ok thanks for taking my questions operator in the interest of time your final question is coming from deepa raghavan with wells fargo securities deepa your line is live deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst hi thanks very much for squeezing me in a couple ones for me so let me ask on the affordability issue we look at trends it just doesn t correlate to the concern that s out there on affordability and dave like you pointed out rates are still historically low and it looks like we could end up having the whole the industry the homebuilders could end up having good pricing power this year too my question is is the affordability issue being raised too ahead of its time or do you believe 2022 or 2023 can be structurally impaired or impacted from some buyers being priced out in this continually tight imbalanced environment bill wheat executive vice president and chief financial officer as we ve seen in our sales offices and demand we re not seeing people being priced out to any of the reits today and we re generally focused at a price point lower than most of our competitors in the markets that we serve what i would say is that going forward you see very good household income growth inflation is certainly out there it s across the board and as someone touched on before we could be at negative real interest rates to own a home so it s a very powerful economic decision to go ahead and buy a house today and lock in that interest rate relative to current inflation expectations so still feel very good about the demand we re seeing into 22 hard to predict much beyond that because you just don t know but we do like what we see in 22 for sure deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst ok that s helpful dave when we met you last summer you mentioned expanding in ohio valley in parts of midwest as newer markets but can you talk through what s the economic engine that will drive job growth there it s hard for us to conceive that post covid with people decided to pack their bags and move to ohio just because they can work remotely david auld president and chief executive officer yes there s a big population base there now you ve got some of the best universities in the country that are there you re seeing a migration out of what we ve historically been the tech areas and or the think tank areas financial areas into these incubators which are these major universities i m just i m a big believer that long term the quality of life just the access to really smart people is going to drive companies and grow companies into these markets you see it in austin you see it in nashville columbus it s just across indianapolis there are brilliant people starting what are going to be great big companies that find that environment just a better place to be than some of the what has historically been high tech high income markets and the population of the u s it those towns those cities are great cities and they offer a lot and that s what deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst all right thanks yup thanks very much appreciate the color and good luck david auld president and chief executive officer thank you operator that is all the time we have for questions today i would like to turn the floor back over to david auld for any closing comments david auld president and chief executive officer

some readers responded to one of my earlier columns urging the national progressive civic groups with millions of members back home to overcome the dominance of giant corporatism with a ten year plan richard parker here the people rule a constitutional populist manifesto cambridge harvard university press 1998 budgeted at 1 billion a year see think big to overcome losing big to corporatism january 7 2022 readers wanted to know more about the plan and where the money would come from to implement this grand initiative new billionaires are proliferating in numbers reflecting the record stock market surges some are enlightened and worried enough to gather with citizen group leaders to review the plan the strategy timetable and required budget those who count themselves in and want to back the plan would pledge to contribute the total pledges of 10 billion for the ten year effort after the funding is secured possibly augmented with internet crowdfunding the plan commences in several coterminous stages the first stage is to get through congress vetoproof if necessary the long overdue necessities for half of the u s population which is poor with collateral benefits for the entire country a brain trust will expertly draft legislation addressing the elements of ending endemic poverty these include a living wage medicare for all insurance already well drafted in h r 1976 and supported by over 118 co sponsors affordable housing adequate nutrition that abolishes hunger in america personal and environmental health care with emphasis on prevention necessary public services for families and communities and a system of private retirement savings to supplement social security these conditions for good livelihoods which were mostly secured years ago by some western countries lead to larger market demand have consistent left right support in europe and in the u s and they make for strong economies see reframing the politics of polarization by hazel henderson august 4 2021 the driving pressure to implement the plan would come from civic offices staffed by two full time people in each of the 435 congressional districts and for us senators in all fifty states plus territories groups would be established with an expanding corps of citizen volunteers committing 500 hours and 500 annually forming a grassroots juggernaut these citizen groups would focus intensely on their members of congress using precise petition backed citizen summonses to their senators and representatives to appear at town meetings which these organizers arrange with detailed and broadly supported agendas the yearly cost to establish these offices and recruit significant numbers of volunteers as the ever deepening force is about 100 million a year this sum would include inter district coordinators and other facilities to organize the self funded expanding volunteer corps passage of vital and overdue bills is less difficult than assumed by a society that is presently awol from the playing field of legislation such catch up legislation can already count on the overt support of about thirty percent of congress with the latent support of at least a quarter of congress once the organized rumble from the people is heard that was the case with nixon republicans in the 1960s and early 70s once the political tea leaves become clear lawmakers become responsive this is what happened in corporate president richard nixon s first term sometimes leading to great majorities behind environmental consumer and labor bills nixon even sent to congress a basic minimum income plan a better health insurance proposal than clinton offered as president and congressional voting rights legislation for the district of columbia congress did not pass these three reforms coming from a republican white house nonetheless nixon felt he had to propose these bills the second stage parallel to the first is to create facilities that invite and enable an accelerated banding together of willing people in their various roles people can have rights and remedies under the law but without organized groups they are mostly not used defended or improved whether you are customers of insurance utility and banking companies or tenants or consumers of food energy transportation and healthcare or using government services or have been wrongfully injured membership in these communities as organized advocacy groups is essential such groups would work to fundamentally change existing dysfunctional systems extending to protections of children services for students and corporate control of the vast commons public lands public airwaves etc that we the people already own daily seeking their own interests corporations are organized to the teeth by comparison to millions of citizens this is why corporations control the major sectors of our government our economy and other societal institutions day by day the large drug companies have 500 full time lobbyists regularly working on congress with large industry backup forces the people are vastly outmatched so what do we expect without a strong citizen team on the field corporate power stems not from votes corporations don t vote yet nor so much from the campaign money it comes as a byproduct of the almost wholly unorganized populace not utilizing its powerful exclusive sovereignty we the people under our constitution in our country s history it is remarkable what a small percentage of people often under one percent when organized and representing broad public concerns have achieved against all odds see my book breaking through power it s easier than we think 2016 much of the conceptual work on these legislated facilities has been developed and used to produce pilot projects vis à vis

the discount brokerage is updating its business model interactive brokers ibkr 1 11 was once the low cost provider among financial brokerages but robinhood s entry and no fee trading commissions going mainstream have forced the company to adjust its business model in this episode of beat and raise recorded on jan 21 fool com contributors toby bordelon and brian withers discuss how interactive brokers is turning to sources like margin lending and how it still delivered strong growth in 2021 10 stocks we like better than interactive brokers when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and interactive brokers wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 10 2022 toby bordelon let s start with interactive brokers lets see what we got here here is interactive brokers brian pretty good they missed on revenue but it was up 22 percent year over year meet on those earnings per share which is nice to see net income i don t have the number off here but net income was up 39 percent to 1 64 billion which is fairly astonishing for them what i have here are full year numbers by the way for the fourth quarter that revenue number was up only 0 7 percent to 603 million net income for the fourth quarter was actually down 11 percent for 338 million but not too bad earnings per share you see they re up 34 percent for the quarter again down 17 percent 67 cents a share for the quarter meeting expectations there you see the stock chart here they ve been lagging the s p 500 for about a year i don t know i think with companies like robinhood there s been a lot of pressure on brokerages especially discount brokerages if you remember years ago when interactive brokers first came onto the scene their whole deal was like way low commissions you can trade stocks like for a dollar a trade well what happens if that s what you build your business on when companies like schwab which we talked about yesterday go no commissions and they have all the other services they rely on for fees and interactive brokers doesn t quite do as much there s pressure there there s pressure on them but one thing interactive brokers does do very well margin loans that s pretty much what to do they pride themselves on low interest margin loans thereby encouraging their customers to take on margin to trade and so that was pretty good the net interest income was up 31 percent for the quarter it says seven billion dollars for the quarter 295 billion for the year and then net interest income for a large part of that is those margin loans they got going on they make a lot of money off of that margin loans were actually up 40 percent to almost 55 billion in total outstanding by the end of the quarter that business is still doing quite nice customer accounts up 56 percent they have 1 68 billion now customer accounts customer equity up 30 percent you think of this as their assets under management they are not an asset manager but the value in their accounts up 30 percent to almost 375 billion they are quite good there commission revenue was up 11 percent they still do charge commission in some cases they are still getting a lot of money for that so 32 million for the fourth quarter interestingly they introduced crypto trading this past quarter in the united states brian withers i think they had to toby bordelon well they had to do something they got that going now it s a partnership with paxos they have to do that and they say they re rolling out crypto trading to other countries assume interactive brokers has operations all over the place they re in a lot of different countries they also introduced spot gold trading in the us they re trying to move beyond equities and into other things customers might be interested in this was fascinating to me in the conference call the ceo made a point of saying they don t sell their order flow for their interactive brokers pro customers which is a nice little dig at robinhood there he made a point of being clear about that that s not our business pretty good i would say overall pretty good all things considered they are in a spot with the pressure on commissions and with interest rates being so low and make being careful themselves not to charge not much more than the prime rate for their margin loans there s two big sources of income for them traditionally commissions and that interest it s just been not high at all brian withers they re known for options trading toby bordelon they are brian withers not having the most user friendly interface i don t know if they have an app you re a customer i assume right toby bordelon i m actually not i used to be but i don t have an account anymore they do have an app i don t know what the state of it is now but it s certainly not that gamified version you ve seen with robinhood right brian withers right toby bordelon they re not attracting that younger crowd as much as robinhood is that s an issue for them they re not like schwab they don t have that bank aspect they don t have the wealth management services that they offer to provide that source of revenue they re in a tough spot in the current environment they did say that as interest rates increase that should be good for them in theory they should be able to expand their margins a bit off of that they are looking for that the concern you have with the market you can have it in the falling market may be a slowing economy same issue i consider having with schwab does that mean people save less invest less do they trade less because they lose interest it s less exciting to trade in a falling market than in a rising market they start to lose some customers their customer acquisition slows down that could weigh on them the environment we re moving into on the other hand if we do get rising interest rates that could be a risk for the economy it could be good for them to the extent that they are able to expand that margin of interest they charge maybe get a little more revenue there i don t know you can see the chart it s not great compared to the s p 500 i think they re doing fairly good often considered they did have a good year the numbers were good everything looks good for them in terms of growth but we just want to see some expansion business a little bit i think and try to hopefully inch those margin rates up a little bit brian withers it ll be interesting to see it sounds like they re making the right moves and recognizing the position that they re in but i look back this is a stock advisor rec from 2014 it s done pretty well it s up 164 percent since then but over that long period of time certainly the competitive dynamics have changed a bit toby bordelon yeah definitely has it ll be interesting to watch them over the next couple of years to see where they fit where do they fit is there really a place for them to carve out between these newer robinhood type brokerages out there versus the more full service but still discount and cheap schwab type companies keep an eye on them but i can t say i m super excited about what i m seeing just yet

ratings of kemper l h reflect its balance sheet strength which am best assesses as strongest as well as its adequate operating performance neutral business profile and appropriate erm with respect to the parent company am best notes that kemper corp continues to benefit from a financial leverage profile that remains within am best s guidelines for the current rating levels as well as a favorable holding company liquidity profile additional financial flexibility through access to debt and equity capital markets despite reduced dividend capacity from the subsidiary operations as a result of operating losses and lower statutory capitalization at year end 2021 is another positive rating factor the negative rating outlooks for kemper p c the lead rating unit of the group and for kemper corp as well as for infinity whose debt is guaranteed by kemper corp and matures in september 2022 primarily consider the significant earnings deterioration of kemper p c and for kemper corp overall in 2021 this earnings deterioration resulted in reduced capital levels at the operating companies and holding company and the likelihood of continued earnings weakness and the potential for further capital erosion in 2022 remains a concern for am best underlying the significant deterioration in underwriting performance was a sharp rise in claims severity in the automobile line of business which accounts for approximately 95 of kemper p c s premium volume largely reflecting significant supply chain issues labor shortages and inflationary pressures the automobile line of business also experienced higher claim costs as well as a higher claim frequency particularly in the latter half of 2021 kemper l h reported positive net income of 28 2 million in 2021 which was significantly down from 60 0 million in 2020 primarily reflecting higher pandemic related life insurance mortality the negative outlooks for kemper corp follows that of kemper p c the lead rating unit the negative outlooks for kemper l h primarily reflects that operation s significantly smaller scale within the organization and am best s view that its credit profile is therefore a function of its intrinsic strength and that of its p c insurance affiliate and holding company a return to strengthened profitability and improved capital strength for kemper p c and kemper corp could lead to an outlook

reached in july 2021 interestingly wall street punters goldman sachs jpmorgan and morgan stanley see deficits in 2022 while opec the international energy agency iea and the u s department of energy doe have all forecast substantial oil surpluses and yet another oil and commodity expert has thrown a cautionary note that a surplus could be building in the oil markets at a faster than expected clip flying under the radar in its latest commodity update dated feb 1 standard chartered says a surge in u s oil output in q4 2021 has gone largely unnoticed by the oil market and oil analysts stanchart notes that in october 2021 the u s energy information administration eia forecast that u s oil liquids supply excluding refinery processing gains would be 17 86 million barrels per day mb d the following month however the analysts estimate using revised data published in the eia petroleum supply monthly psm on 31 january that u s oil supply actually averaged 18 795mb d in november a m m increase of 352 thousand barrels per day kb d that s a good 935kb d higher than the above eia forecast and just 375kb d 1 96 below january 2020 s all time high related u s natural gas prices jump 10 on arctic blast the u s added over 900kb d to supply in h2 2021 with only saudi arabia adding more stanchart says the surge in u s production is evident in the latest set of earnings reports by oil companies with 2 018mb d of q4 oil liquids output having been reported so far a q q increase of 98kb d 5 1 company guidance suggests that the surge is likely to continue in particular by big oil with exxonmobil nyse xom saying its target is to increase its permian output by 25 while chevron nyse cvx has projected full year growth of 10 for its permian output for a similar period the surge in u s supply runs counter to the market narrative by investment bank proponents of an oil super cycle growth in u s supply was predicted to be limited in 2021 because of investor pressure for dividends rather than growth however stanchart analysts say that many analysts missed the fact that at current prices oil and gas companies can significantly increase both dividends and capex indeed the analysts have predicted that we will see substantial upward revisions to 2022 u s oil supply growth are likely from agencies consultants and wall street analysts if u s supply merely stays at its november 2021 level throughout 2022 annual average growth would still surpass 1mb d more than the current u s supply growth forecasts by the international energy agency iea and the opec secretariat stanchart says it expects u s oil supply to continue to surprise on the upside in 2022 and that this surge will not remain under the market radar for much longer capital discipline advertisement luckily for the bulls the banker says u s production growth will not continue indefinitely and independent producers will be forced to stick to capital discipline the commodity experts have forecast that growth will slow in 2023 and beyond with production growth from independent publicly listed companies becoming crimped even at higher price levels weighed down by esg mandates shareholder demands for capex discipline and pressure to return capital rising service costs and underinvestment affecting the drilling of new wells further the key factor for supply growth in several regions is whether drilling will ramp up fast enough to offset any reduction in the completion of ducs without extra drilling growth is likely to slow and for now there are no signs in the bakken and niobrara in particular of any upswing in activity going by the latest baker hughes data by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com
sarah bloom raskin president biden s nominee to serve as vice chair of supervision at the federal reserve is expected to get some tough questions at a thursday confirmation hearing over her work for reserve trust a non bank financial technology company that received special access to the fed s payments system while she was serving as a director reserve trust a colorado chartered trust company is the only non bank fintech company to have a fed master account it got the account while raskin was serving as the company s director access to the fed s payments system is a major advantage for financial institutions because it allows them to earn interest from deposits parked at the fed and eases the ability to transfer large sums of money other non bank financial institutions have to partner with banks insured by the federal deposit insurance corp to access the fed s services the only question is why is there only one there have been other applicants who haven t been able to get an answer said sen pat toomey pa the ranking republican on the senate banking committee raskin s compensation while at reserve trust which falls under the fed s oversight is also likely to come up raskin who as fed vice chair of supervision would be the nation s most powerful banking regulator received nearly 200 000 shares of reserve trust stock while at the company that she sold at some point in 2020 for 1 5 million toomey noting that reserve trust got the master account while raskin was a highly compensated director said there are going to be lots of questions about that raskin is married to rep jamie raskin d md one of the impeachment managers during former president trump s second impeachment trial seven gop senators including toomey voted to convict trump jamie raskin filed a periodic transaction report with the house clerk in august reporting the sale of 195 936 shares of reserve trust at 7 50 a share the document listed the transaction date as dec 18 2020 sarah bloom raskin had previously disclosed the sale to office of government ethics oge according to banking committee republican staff but her initial disclosure to the banking panel did not mention it she later amended her disclosure to the committee to include the sale of reserve trust stock a senate republican aide said raskin was required to file the report within 30 to 45 days of the transaction and filed it months after it was due jamie raskin told the hill in a statement i filed my ptp late because we experienced a family tragedy in the middle of the reporting period raskin s son 25 died by suicide on dec 31 2020 just a week before the jan 6 attack on the capitol raskin has written about thomas bloom raskin s death and how the family coped with the tragedy in the memoir unthinkable sen sherrod brown d ohio the banking panel s chairman predicted that republicans are going to attack sarah bloom raskin s support for having the fed consider the impacts of climate change on the banking system and other issues at thursday s hearing they ve opposed most nominees that are going to stand up and make wall street accountable he said asked whether raskin s position at reserve trust when it became the first state chartered trust company to obtain a federal reserve master account raised any concerns of possible influence peddling brown responded sounds like another issue that republicans are just going to manufacture to try to bring down nominations and to stall them and bring them down a white house official said raskin s financial disclosures have been reviewed and certified by career ethics officials the office of government ethics and the federal reserve the official also said that raskin has agreed in her ethics agreement pursuant to all applicable ethics rules and regulations to recuse from any particular matter that presents a conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict and divest any assets which creates a conflict of interest the official noted that raskin left reserve trust in august of 2018 and that the oge and fed determined that recusal was not required for future matters involving the company because she left her position more than two years ago throughout her career sarah bloom raskin has taken her ethical obligations seriously the official said liberal democrats such as sen elizabeth warren d mass who want the fed to conduct stricter oversight of financial institutions are solidly behind raskin and say she would be a major improvement over former fed vice chair randal quarles warren praised raskin last year as a tough and thoughtful financial regulator with decades of experience at both the state and federal levels in the important role of vice chair for supervision she brings a commitment to protect the american people that has been sorely missing from the fed board for years she said raskin is also drawing criticism from republicans because of her stints at promontory a consulting firm now owned by ibm that traditionally has been stocked by former federal financial regulators she joined promontory s advisory board as vice chair after serving under former president obama as the treasury department s deputy secretary responsible for domestic and global policy and operations from 2014 to 2017 she also served as a governor on the federal reserve board from 2010 to 2014 prior to that raskin served as one of promontory s first managing directors joining the firm shortly after its founding promontory drew fire from democrats and the media in 2013 for its relationship with banks after a review of foreclosure practices it conducted on behalf of banking regulators left homeowners with little compensation while netting huge fees for itself the firm s close ties with regulatory agencies previously earned it the nickname shadow regulator its relationships with client banks drew criticism from senate democrats after the 2008 2009 housing collapse democrats at the time questioned whether promontory conducted a truly independent review of banks foreclosure practices on behalf of the office of the comptroller of the currency raskin briefly held roles at both reserve trust and promontory for a few months at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019 according to information she provided to the banking panel toomey said democrats on the banking committee are applying a different standard to raskin than to other former officials associated with promontory toomey said democrats have made a big deal about promontory with respect to other people they ought to be consistent he said asked tuesday about raskin s time at promontory warren told the hill we need to change the rules and put a stop to the revolving door the revolving door undermines public confidence in our officials and that s true regardless of which for profit outfit you went to work for she added updated 10 24 p m
