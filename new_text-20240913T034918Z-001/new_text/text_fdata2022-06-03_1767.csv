russian forces hammered ukrainian positions in the donbas region yesterday as kyiv said moscow was in control of 20 of ukrainian territory on the eve of the war s 100th day vladimir putin s troops have set their sights on capturing eastern ukraine since being repelled from around the capital kyiv after their invasion began on february 24 while their advance has been much slower than moscow expected russian troops have expanded their control beyond the 43 000sq km 16 600sq miles taken when russia seized crimea and parts of the donbas in 2014 today about 20 of our territory is under the control of the occupiers ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky said in an address to luxembourg lawmakers the invasion which enters its 100th day today has allowed moscow to capture territory that was much greater than the netherlands belgium and luxembourg combined added the president thousands of people have been killed and millions forced to flee with ukraine s east now bearing the brunt of russia s assault which zelensky said was killing up to 100 ukrainian soldiers every day street fighting was raging in the industrial hub of severodonetsk in luhansk part of the donbas the strategic city is a key target for moscow which already controls 80 of the area but luhansk regional governor sergiy gaiday vowed ukrainian forces would fight until the end severodonetsk s azot factory one of europe s biggest chemical plants was targeted by russian soldiers who fired on one of its administrative buildings and a warehouse where methanol was stored ukrainian troops were still holding an industrial zone gaiday said a situation reminiscent of mariupol where a huge steel works was the southeastern port city s last holdout until ukrainian troops finally surrendered in late may in the city of sloviansk about 80km 50 miles from severodonetsk residents recounted constant bombardments by russian troops paramedic ekaterina perednenko 24 said she had only just returned to the city five days ago but realises that she will have to leave again it s very difficult here shooting is everywhere it s scary no water electricity or gas she said retiree leonid 79 said he was also leaving the city and would seek refuge elsewhere in europe i feel pain the most prominent feeling i have is that we didn t deserve this we don t understand why we are punished like this he told afp valeriy zaluzhnyi the commander in chief of ukraine s armed forces assessed that the most difficult situation is in the lugansk region where the enemy is trying to displace our units he pleaded for modern armaments from the north atlantic treaty organisation nato telling france s top general thierry burkhard that the enemy has a decisive advantage in artillery it will save the lives of our people he said bridget brink the new us ambassador to kyiv promised yesterday that the united states would help ukraine prevail against russian aggression after presenting her credentials to zelensky earlier this week us president joe biden announced that washington was sending more advanced himar multiple rocket lunch systems to ukraine the mobile units can simultaneously launch multiple precision guided missiles up to 80km away they are the centrepiece of a 700mn package that includes air surveillance radar more javelin short range anti tank rockets artillery ammunition helicopters vehicles and spare parts kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov accused washington of adding fuel to the fire although us officials insist ukraine has promised not to use them to strike inside russia beyond plying ukraine with armaments western allies have also sought to choke off russia s financial lifeline in a bid to get putin to change course ramping up an already long list of embargoes the united states blacklisted putin s money manager and a monaco company that provides luxury yachts to moscow s elite washington hit sergei roldugin labelled putin s middle man roldugin s opera singer wife elena mirtova and foreign affairs ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova with sanctions as well as several large yachts in which putin allegedly has an interest the treasury said across the atlantic eu nations agreed new sanctions that would halt 90 of russian oil imports to the bloc by the end of the year russia warned that european consumers would be the first to pay the price for the partial oil embargo eu ambassadors dropped however the leader of russia s orthodox church patriarch kirill from a proposed blacklist to win over opposition from hungary however some relief was in view for the overheated oil market as top producers including saudi arabia agreed to add 648 000 barrels per day to the market in july up from 432 000 the war has wrecked ukraine s economy forcing the central bank to more than double its key interest rate in an unprecedented action yesterday to prop up the hryvnia however it carries far wider consequences too with risks that it could trigger a global food crisis growing ukraine one of the world s main producers will likely export only half the amount of grain that it did in the previous season the ukrainian grain association said the conflict was already translating into higher costs for consumers purchasing essentials from cereals to sunflower oil to maize with the poorest among the hardest hit the head of the african union senegalese president macky sall is to

co chairwoman of the legislative planning and development committee brian a pounds hearst connecticut media house majority leader jason rojas d east hartford brian a pounds hearst connecticut media fewer than half of connecticut s towns and cities filed affordable housing plans in time for the june 1 deadline that was required by a 2021 law which itself was a major compromise amid staunch opposition from suburban mostly affluent communities against state mandates they claim threatened local control but with no mechanism to actually enforce the law there will be little repercussions to prod towns and cities to comply with the filing requirements which are part of a larger law that also establishes a commission on connecticut s development and future among the towns that failed to file are the affluent fairfield county municipalities of darien easton greenwich new canaan redding ridgefield trumbull and westport but officials from bridgeport ansonia east haven hamden hartford meriden new haven north haven norwalk shelton torrington and waterbury also failed to meet the deadline advertisement article continues below this ad only 81 of connecticut s 169 municipalities met

include ansonia beacon falls bethel clinton colebrook derby kent litchfield oxford seymour thomaston watertown and west hartford failed to meet the deadline in cases where towns or cities have failed to adopt affordable housing plans by the deadline chief elected officials are required to notify the opm with the reasons why plans were not adopted on time and provide a date by which plans may be adopted and provided the state department of housing and the regional plan association created a guidebook for municipalities to help in their deliberations at a time the state is experiencing a crisis in affordable housing advertisement article continues below this ad cities and towns have a statutory responsibility to have filed plans by june 1 chris collibee spokesman for opm secretary jeffrey beckham said thursday after the list of participating communities was updated we anticipate continuing to receive additional filings over the next couple of days he said opm will work with the state department of housing to contact those towns and cities that have not communicated their plans and work with them to ensure compliance it is important to note that approximately 20 percent of towns that have not filed their plans have communicated with opm that they are on track to complete their plans in the near future collibee said the reporting deadline was among the few requirements that emerged from the 2021 legislature when the issues of racial exclusion and local control broke out in the general assembly and ended efforts to require local land use officials to create more dwelling units state rep cristin mccarthy vehey d fairfield co chairwoman of the legislative planning and development committee whose panel originated last year s reporting requirement and the june 1 deadline said thursday the pressing need for affordable housing units is no secret advertisement article continues below this ad i think the big picture is do we all agree on the definition of a problem and do we agree on the lack of housing stock mccarthy vehey said in a phone interview we know there s a tremendous need housing starts in connecticut have been so low compared to other states and compared to particular times in our state municipalities have asked for power to act locally and that s what we did she recalled that in 2021 any pro housing bills with legal provisions faced strong objections while state law has vaguely required the filing of affordable housing plans every five years last year s bill finally provided a deadline date a plan is a critical first step toward planning affordable housing mccarthy vehey said there is a lot of resistance our towns need those road maps and by asking them to create their own plans we re asking them to create their own road maps house majority leader jason rojas said thursday that the problem goes beyond affordable homes into housing in general along with traditions of local control and the growing need for dwellings at a crucial time when the economy needs workers towns missing the deadline this is a list of towns that had not filed an affordable housing plan as of june 2 ansonia ashford avon beacon falls bethel

costs it depends on the supply rojas said in a phone interview whether you own a house or rent one it s expensive both ways we always hear that local land use officials always support housing but far too often we see less than that we re giving them the chance to come up with plans informed by local conditions kevin maloney communications director for the connecticut conference of municipalities said thursday that while towns and cities have benefited from resources provided by state officials many communities particularly smaller ones with limited resources have struggled to develop these plans ccm is continuing to work with the state to support communities in this effort maloney said we are confident towns and cities are working hard to complete these plans during the legislative session that ended last month a number of housing initiatives failed including a bill that would have allowed local housing authorities to buy and develop units in neighboring municipalities this year of the 23 bills that originated in and were approved by the legislative housing committee only one became law requiring municipalities with 25 000 or more residents to create fair rent commissions advertisement article continues below this ad christie stewart director of the bridgeport based center for housing opportunity which works in fairfield and lichfield counties said thursday that some towns will need more prodding that others but the future of connecticut is at stake the legislation has no teeth but it s such a contentious issue that even without teeth it s a tiny step forward stewart said in a phone interview they can t bury their heads in the sand affordability is relative but it s going to take a pro active approach and adherence to plans what remains to be seen is to take these plans and see how they get implemented how do we prioritize stewart said that while some towns realizing there are no consequences may never file affordable housing plans no municipal officials should continue to ignore the need for more housing units the center for housing opportunity also posts information on meetings of local boards including the june 7 meeting of the greenwich planning and zoning commission between zoning restrictions and the limited capacity of developers we have kind of a broken housing system she said here s a challenge use your local control and decide where to develop housing options in your towns this is about pro active planning for vibrant sustainable communities while the population undergoes a massive demographic shift advertisement article

who don t even suspect they have covid many patients they come in with things that we wouldn t think about covid but we re testing them because they may have a single symptom that can put them in that direction so they re not highly symptomatic said dr john brooks infectious disease specialist at mclaren health care and chair of mclaren s emerging pathogens response team but any symptom that we have any concern we test and say oh by the way you were positive and they re like what i didn t know i was the fewer cases are one reason for the relaxed covid advice from the centers for disease control and prevention suggestions which were released thursday for several counties now 10 of michigan s 83 counties including wayne oakland and macomb counties are now considered to have high community transmission levels a cdc measure that indicates people in those counties should wear masks indoors those counties still include many of the most populated including wayne oakland and macomb across the state 46 of michiganians live in counties considered to have high community transmission levels but more than half of michigan counties reported the number of covid patients in the hospital are down another sign people are generally getting less sick a week earlier 14 counties had high community transmission levels which was a dip from the week before when 22 counties around the state had high levels the cdc reported that 39 counties were in medium community levels where people are recommended to wear masks around those susceptible to severe illness the remaining 34 counties are considered to have low transmission rates seasonal surges rather than the random ones of the past two years are one of the signs that a virus is becoming endemic sims said a endemic virus will still have a baseline level he said but it will generally be much smoother when waves come giving medical professionals a chance to prepare for them several doctors noticed they had seen more people with influenza a which is typically seen during the winter months rather than influenza b which often is the main strain of the virus at this time of year brooks said that it may be the changes in ways people have worn masks that have led to the delayed push from influenza a it s possible flu b will have a delayed season or may not be prevalent this year he said i don t think we quite know at this point what is going to happen he said doctors are able to forecast what they think will come next for covid though dr dennis cunningham system medical director of infection control and prevention at henry ford health said the downturn in cases is part of a little bit of a break that will be seen across much of the country as people spend more time outside it s likely the next surge will come from new omicron substrains seen in south africa he said the symptoms are similar but people generally need a higher level of antibodies to be protected cunningham said government officials have anticipated the new subvariants ba 4 and ba 5 are expected in the u s by the fall but it could come as soon as mid summer this is why that booster dose is so important cunningham said we know that four to six months after a booster those proteins start dropping so that s why i want the message to be for people to get their booster experts agree that the methods of staying safer are the same today as they have been for much of the pandemic wash your hands wear a mask in crowded places even if you re outside outdoors is safer but not necessarily safe sims said get vaccinated and stay home when you re sick health officials encouraged people to test often especially if they have a new symptom develop free covid tests are available through the u s postal service at special usps com testkits and many stores have home tests in stock doctors urged people not to underestimate covid even during what appears to be a lull in cases i m happy that the number of cases is dropping cunningham said but it s still pretty high we re not out of the woods quite yet hharding detroitnews com twitter hayley__harding

recently we ve heard a lot of claims and counter claims about modern rifles we can call them modern but these guns are not new honest gun owners use them every day occasionally some criminals use them as well about one out of eight gun owners have a modern rifle as we d expect rifles are used in armed defense about an eighth of the time semi automatic magazine fed rifles were introduced to the civilian market here in the usa in 1905 that was 116 years ago the us military adopted them three decades later during world war ii the only thing unique about the original m 16 was its plastic stock rather than being a fire breathing monster the m 16 is noted for its low recoil the civilian version the ar15 was introduced in 1956 so it has been with us for over six decades if the ar brought innovation to the civilian market it was its adjustable stock the ar can be adjusted to fit people of smaller stature in seconds the ar is the gateway rifle the volks gun i think that is why the democrats want it banned here are two recent news stories that involve a modern rifle a homeowner with an ar 15 stopped two intruders it was mid morning when a homeowner in brownsboro texas heard the sounds of breaking glass coming from inside his home the homeowner grabbed his ar rifle and went to see what was happening the homeowner saw two strangers in the middle of his house the defender told the intruders not to move the second intruder a female accomplice ran away the defender let her go and called 911 police arrested the male intruder the homeowner pointed out the broken glass near his front door police took the intruder to jail and searched the neighborhood for the second robber the defender was not charged with a crime the homeowner did not press the trigger as he defended himself that is the usual outcome and happens 80 percent of the time we use our gun for self defense there are exceptions when we need to shoot a woman with her concealed carry license stops mass murder by a felon with an ar 15 a woman with her concealed carry permit was attending a graduation birthday party at an apartment complex in charleston west virginia the party had spilled out into the parking lot with about 40 people at the celebration at about 10 at night a man drove through the parking lot and people shouted for him to slow down this driver took offense and came back a half hour later he climbed into the back seat of his car and started shooting at the crowd with his ar rifle that is when our armed defender shot back several times she stopped the attacker no one else was injured she called 911 and remained at the scene emergency medical services declared the attacker dead at the scene from multiple gunshot wounds the attacker was a convicted felon with a long criminal record the police are investigating where he got his firearm it looks like gun control laws don t stop criminals from using guns but there is more we can learn from these two news accounts ar rifles do not turn honest homeowners into enraged murderers our neighbors only use lethal force as a last resort these rifles do not make criminals into unstoppable killers modern rifles are mundane the sad news is that honest reporting about ordinary citizens defending themselves doesn t make money for the mainstream news media the media needs to say that a particular piece of steel plastic and aluminum is unusual what else will keep us watching through the commercial advertisements about rob morse the original article is posted here rob morse writes about gun rights at ammoland at clash daily at second call defense and on his slowfacts blog he hosts the self defense gun stories podcast and co hosts the polite society podcast rob was an nra pistol instructor and combat handgun competitor

get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview the recent spate of deadly shootings has pushed congress once again to try to take action on a host of gun safety measures the latest attempt at controlling america s gun violence comes as president joe biden begs congress to finally act on it including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines and repealing the immunity that protects gun manufacturers this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now the house will in the coming days vote on an expansive gun control package called the protecting our kids act and house speaker nancy pelosi has also said there will soon be a hearing on legislation to ban assault weapons more limited bipartisan measures are under negotiation in the 50 50 senate where anti gun control republicans are likely to block more aggressive action saving our children can and must be a unifying mission for our nation pelosi wrote in a letter thursday to democrats to all those in the congress who would stand in the way of saving lives your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children the action follows mass shootings last month that killed 10 mostly black people in a racist rampage at a buffalo new york supermarket and 19 children and two teachers at robb elementary school in uvalde texas on wednesday five people were killed on the campus of a tulsa oklahoma hospital including the gunman who shot himself advertisement for gods sake how much more carnage are we willing to accept biden asked on thursday in a speech delivered from the white house singling out republicans for blocking gun safety measures this time we must actually do something house democrats have already passed legislation to expand background checks for gun sales the senate has not taken up the legislation the latest package of bills coming from the house also faces tough prospects in the evenly divided senate but democrats are still pushing them in part to put their republican colleagues on the record for opposing gun safety measures for the children we ve lost for the children we can save for the nation we love let s hear the call and the cry biden said let s meet the moment let us finally do something here s a look at the measures under consideration and what s ahead advertisement raising the purchase age for semi automatic rifles to 21 the house will vote next week on the protecting our kids act package which would raise the purchasing age for semi automatic rifles from 18 to 21 the shooters in buffalo and uvalde were both 18 and acquired their guns legally don t tell me raising the age won t make a difference biden said in his thursday speech the bill would also limit access to high capacity magazines and ban bump stocks for civilian use bump stocks use the recoil of a semiautomatic firearm to rapidly pull the trigger and mimic fully automatic firing related story purchases of ghost guns or homemade guns that are assembled from parts would be subjected to existing firearm regulations and new federal offenses would be established for gun trafficking and straw purchasers advertisement another measure in the package would create criminal penalties for violating requirements for the residential storage of firearms red flag bill to remove firearms from people who pose a danger to themselves and others the house will also vote next week on the federal extreme risk protection order act a federal red flag legislation that would allow family members and law enforcement to seek a court order to temporarily remove access to firearms for those who pose a danger to themselves or others it would also encourage states to enact their own extreme risk laws nineteen states and the district of columbia currently have extreme risk protection orders in place the legislation is proposed by rep lucy mcbath a georgia democrat who lost her son to gun violence and rep salud carbajal a california democrat whose sister took her own life with a gun lindsey graham a former senate judiciary committee chairman introduced similar legislation in the past saying it seeks to balance the second amendment rights of the individual with concerns from law enforcement and family members about those who may be experiencing a mental health crisis advertisement creating an amber alert style notification for mass shootings in her letter to colleagues pelosi said the house will also consider legislation to create an amber alert style notification in the event of a mass shooting this bill dubbed the active shooter alert act introduced by reps david cicilline a rhode island democrat and fred upton a michigan republican will be brought to the floor in the weeks ahead she said i ve talked to my law enforcement at home in michigan and they support this upton said in a statement it s a way that they can be there to respond to the scene and get innocent people out of the area to safety chris shelton 36 oversees his son luke shelton 7 as he steadies an ar 15 rifle at the national rifle association annual convention on may 28 2022 in houston texas photo by brandon bell getty images assault weapons ban pelosi said the house will soon hold a hearing on legislation to ban assault weapons or military style weapons that congress banned in 1994 congress allowed the ban to expire a decade later in 2004 advertisement pelosi said the ban was proven to save lives and one that the american people support today during the time of the ban some researchers have found gun massacres dropped by as much 37 but rose by 183 in the decade after the prohibition expired senate negotiations two overlapping bipartisan groups of senators are discussing measures that include red flag laws expanding background checks school safety measures and mental health resources sen chris murphy the connecticut democrat who pleaded with his colleagues to do something after the uvalde shooting is at the helm of the negotiations in a fox news op ed murphy a leading gun control advocate since the 2012 sandy hook elementary school shooting in newton connecticut wrote on wednesday that he acknowledges that he will need to accept a smaller set of reforms than he would prefer to find common ground advertisement my desire is simple to find a way for republicans and democrats to come together around a small but meaningful set of changes to our nation s gun laws along with major investments in mental health that will make it less likely that another sandy hook or uvalde ever happens again he wrote senate minority leader mitch mcconnell has signaled he s willing to work with democrats on gun safety legislation but has not said which measure he d endorse

efforts led by sens chris murphy d conn and john cornyn r texas in the senate he tore into republicans who stood in the way of tightening restrictions my god the fact that a majority of senate republicans don t want any of these proposals to even be debated i find unconscionable the president then made the matter an election year issue imploring voters to make the matter of gun control central to your vote his calls went beyond what the house package would do calling for an outright ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines strengthening background checks and requirements for gun owners to properly store their firearms biden admitted the likely defeat on an assault weapons ban but said that the minimum age for such weapons should at least be raised from 18 to 21 the house is currently marking up a bill that would raise the purchasing age of semi automatic rifles from 18 to 21 the president targeted much of his ire at gun manufacturer immunity the gun industry

not to act no more excuses thoughts and prayers are important but not enough we need congress to act the vice president said in remarks thursday biden has said there is little left for him to do from the executive branch and urged congress to take up measures that would ban assault weapons and strengthen universal background checks meanwhile a manhunt is underway for an unidentified gunman who shot five family members on thursday as they attended the funeral for a man who was shot and killed by a police officer last month on wednesday a gunman opened fire at a tulsa hospital killing four people with an ar 15 he purchased three hours before the attack the shooting came just over a week after a gunman mowed down 19 children and two teachers at robb elementary in uvalde texas using an ar

legislation offered by rep lucy mcbath d ga whose son was a victim of gun violence a decade ago republicans remained firm in their resistance and the eight piece measure is unlikely to make it through the senate after the house passes it but a bipartisan group of senators led by chris murphy d conn and john cornyn r texas are working on a slimmed down gun control measure that focuses on on state based red flag programs school safety and mental health programs nineteen states currently have red flag legislation which allows law enforcement to take away firearms from those who are deemed by a cour to be a threat to themselves or others on the books as the president visited uvalde over memorial day weekend he expressed optimism that legislation could pass by claiming republicans are getting more rational biden specifically called cornyn and sen majority leader mitch mcconnell rational though he said he didn t know the status of the talks asked if he had his own responsibility to act biden replied i can t dictate this stuff he implied the onus was on congress to enact lasting change i can do the things i ve done and any executive action i can take i ll continue to take but i can t outlaw a weapon i can t change a background check i can t do that the president said republican rep greg steube of florida argued that the law limiting high capacity magazines would have unintended

supplementary financial measures are utilized by the company as measures of financial performance non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that these non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the company s business and facilitate meaningful comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods and future periods non ifrs measures presented in this earnings release include certain figures from our statement of operations that are adjusted to exclude significant items although figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results a limitation of utilizing these figures that exclude significant items is that the ifrs accounting effects of these items do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of the company s business accordingly these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing the company s financial results therefore management believes that the company s ifrs measures of financial performance and the respective non ifrs measures should be considered together non ifrs measures adjusted figures figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results financial statement items that exclude significant items are non ifrs measures to calculate these non ifrs financial statement items we exclude certain items from our financial results prepared in accordance with ifrs the items which have been excluded are referred to herein as significant items the following is a description of the composition of the non ifrs measures used in this earnings release note that some significant items excluded may not be applicable to the calculation of the non ifrs measures for each comparative period i revenue excluding significant items

amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination acquisition related expense items which includes costs recognized in relation to both prospective and completed acquisitions certain incentive based costs related to the acquisitions and growth initiatives in cgwm uk and us capital markets costs associated with the redemption of convertible debentures costs associated with the reorganization of cgwm uk and fair value adjustments to the derivative liability component of non controlling interests in cgwm uk iii net income before taxes excluding significant

all of us in north dakota owe a big thank you to joe o mahoney and eugene millikin never heard of them well that s not unusual but if your water supply is from the missouri river or if you are an irrigator from that river or use and enjoy its recreational benefits or power benefits or flood control benefits its dams then you should be aware of what these two gentlemen did to help all of us in north dakota achieve those benefits joe o mahoney and eugene milliken were both us senators during the 1940s when the federal government began finalizing legislation and plans to build the great dams along the missouri river those large dams and a collection of minor dams on minor tributaries are placed from montana through the dakotas nebraska kansas and culminating in the state of missouri they include the garrison dam in north dakota and the oahe dam of south dakota which backs water up all the way to south bismarck plans to harness the missouri river begin in earnest in the early 1940s the plan was eventually dubbed the pick sloan act named after the primary architects of the plan general lewis pick of the us army corps of engineers and district engineer glenn sloan of the us bureau of reclamation immediately from the start there were conflicts between the two federal agencies doing the planning and also between the interests of the upstream states the dakotas montana wyoming and colorado versus the interests of the downstream states nebraska kansas iowa missouri the corp and downstream states favored a management plan that would emphasize flood control fish and wildlife protection and navigation interests the bureau of reclamation along with the upstream states placed emphasis on water supply irrigation development recreational opportunities and power generation of course all the interests and benefits were recognized by both federal entities and all the states as beneficial but some were deemed a higher priority than others advertisement enter o mahoney and millikin millikin was a senator from colorado and o mahoney a senator from wyoming one a republican one a democrat both of their respective states colorado and wyoming are contributors of water to the missouri river system and therefore had a stake in how that river system was to be managed however admittedly their interests would have been of a lower level than the other states as mentioned it was in these other states that most of the river reconstruction and most of the program benefits would be realized but both senators had an immediate and strong appreciation for the needs of the upstream states it was the upstream states that would be asked to contribute essentially all the land needed to construct the major dams ultimately a contribution of over 1 7 million acres shared almost equally and exclusively by montana north dakota and south dakota it was also these upstream states that would house the facilities that would provide the power generation facilities of the program most of which power which would eventually be shipped out for use by other states and it was the downstream states that would realize most of the benefits of flood control water supply power supply and navigation o mahoney and millikin saw the disputes being formed between a program that favored the downstream states with flood control and water supply vs a program that provided larger ensured benefits for the upstream states particularly for irrigation development as such the o mahoney millikin amendment to the 1944 flood control act was presented and adopted which says that navigation shall not conflict with the beneficial consumptive use of water for domestic municipal stock water irrigation mining or industrial purposes a win for north dakota and for all the upstream states from the passage of the flood control act in 1944 and even with the inclusion of the o mahoney millikin amendment we have seen the downstream interests in the management of the missouri river system continue to press for more favorable management and use of the system for their downstream navigation interests that push for navigation water downstream leaves the upper states in a position of possible low water levels in our reservoirs and in the river at times when we may and do need such water that action by the downstream states would certainly be more aggressive and more effective had the o mahoney millikin amendment not been included in that act thank you sens joe o mahoney and eugene millikin for the efforts you took over 80 years ago that continue yet to this day to benefit our state of north dakota ken royse bismarck is program manager of the missouri river joint water board this letter does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the forum s editorial board nor forum ownership

in remarks on march 5 2022 on pli s corporate governance webcast commissioner allison herren lee of the securities and exchange commission stated that 20 years after its enactment it is time to revisit the unfulfilled mandate of section 307 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 and establish minimum standards for lawyers practicing before the commission commissioner lee who announced that she will not seek a second term when her current one ends this month took issue with what she called the goal directed reasoning of some securities lawyers that is focusing primarily on the outcome sought by executives rather than the impact on investors and the market as a whole such lawyering commissioner lee observed has a host of negative consequences including encouraging non disclosure of material information harming investors and market integrity and stymying deterrence the solution commissioner lee opined is to fulfill the mandate of section 307 which empowered the commission to issue rules in the public interest and for the protection of investors setting forth minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the commission in any way in the representation of issuers over the last 20 years the commission has declined to adopt enhanced rules of professional conduct for lawyers appearing before the commission there are good reasons for the commission s inaction including the attorney client privilege the goal of zealous advocacy the fact specific nature of materiality determinations and the traditionally state law basis for the regulation of attorney conduct commissioner lee moreover did not propose specific new rules and recognized that the task was difficult and should be informed by the views of the securities bar and other stakeholders nor did she say that action by the commission was imminent it is unclear whether the commission has authority to promulgate new rules under section 307 given a 180 day sunset under the statute that occurred in 2003 indeed neither commissioner lee nor any of the other sec commissioners have issued statements on this topic since the pli webcast sec enforcement director gurbir grewal has however indicated an increased emphasis on gatekeeper accountability in order to restore public trust in the market nonetheless given the commission s existing authority to impose discipline under its rules of practice practitioners should be mindful of the potential for increased scrutiny moving forward background in the wake of corporate accounting scandals involving enron worldcom and other companies congress enacted the sarbanes oxley act in 2002 o safeguard investors in public companies and restore trust in the financial markets the act was aimed at combating fraud improving the reliability of financial reporting and restoring investor confidence including by empowering the sec with increased regulatory authority and enforcement power to that end the act includes provisions to fortify auditor independence promote corporate responsibility enhance financial disclosures and enhance corporate fraud accountability the sarbanes oxley act was passed just six months after the collapse of enron in december 2001 and neither the house nor senate bills originally contained professional responsibility language hours before the senate passed its version of the act however the senate amended the bill to include language that would eventually become section 307 around the same time 40 law professors sent a letter to the sec requesting inclusion of a professional conduct rule governing corporate lawyers practicing before the commission the letter picked up on a 1996 article by professor richard painter then of the university of illinois college of law which recommended corporate fraud disclosure obligations for attorneys similar to those imposed on accountants by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 senator john edwards one of the sponsors of the senate floor amendment of the bill emphasized the importance of including professional conduct rules for attorneys in such a significant piece of legislation stating that ne of the problems we have seen occurring with this sort of crisis in corporate misconduct is that some lawyers have forgotten their responsibility is to the companies and shareholders they represent not corporate executives in its final form section 307 imposed a professional responsibility requirement for attorneys that represent issuers appearing before the commission specifically section 307 directed the commission within 180 days of enactment of the law to issue rules in the public interest and for the protection of investors setting forth minimum standards of professional conduct for attorneys appearing and practicing before the commission in any way in the representation of issuers and at minimum promulgate a rule requiring an attorney to report evidence of a material violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the issuer or any agent thereof to appropriate officers within the issuer and thereafter to the highest authority within the issuer if the initial report does not result in an appropriate response since enactment of section 307 however the commission has promulgated only one rule pursuant to its authority commonly known as the up the ladder rule the up the ladder rule imposes a duty on attorneys representing an issuer before the commission to report evidence of material violations of the securities laws when an attorney learns of evidence of a material violation the attorney has a duty to report it to the issuer s chief legal officer clo and or the ceo if the attorney believes the clo or ceo did not take appropriate action within a reasonable time to address the violation the attorney has a duty to report the evidence to the audit committee another committee of independent directors or the full board of directors until the attorney receives an appropriate response alternatively attorneys can satisfy their duty by reporting the violation to a qualified legal compliance committee to date the sec has never brought a case alleging a violation of the up the ladder rule commissioner lee s remarks in her remarks commissioner lee stated that it is time to revisit the unfulfilled mandate of section 307 and consider whether the commission should adopt and enforce minimum standards for lawyers who practice before the commission commissioner lee criticized goal directed reasoning employed by sophisticated counsel in securities matters and cited as an example bandera master fund v boardwalk pipeline a recent decision in which the delaware court of chancery rebuked the attorneys involved for their efforts to satisfy the aims of a general partner instead of their duty to the partnership client as a whole the court specifically stated that counsel knowingly made unrealistic and counterfactual assumptions knowingly relied on an artificial factual predicate and consistently engaged in goal directed reasoning to get to the result that wanted bandera and cases like it according to commissioner lee are emblematic of a race to the bottom caused by pressure on securities lawyers to compete with each other for clients while failing to give due consideration to the potential impact on investors market integrity and the public interest in commissioner lee s view goal directed lawyering not only falls short of ethical standards but causes harm to the market and reduces deterrence commissioner lee expressed concern that in an effort to give management the answer it wants lawyers may downplay or obscure material information although recognizing that materiality determinations are fact intensive commissioner lee said that should not provide blanket cover for legal advice aimed at concealing material information from the public non disclosure has a host of negative consequences including distorting market moving information interfering with price discovery misallocating capital impairing investor decision making and eroding confidence in the financial markets and regulatory system further such lawyering diminishes deterrence by creating legal cover for inadequate disclosure making it more difficult for regulators to hold responsible individuals accountable this type of legal counsel in commissioner lee s view is merely rent seeking masquerading as legal advice while providing a shield against liability commissioner lee stated that the existing framework governing professional conduct is not adequate to hold lawyers accountable for such reckless advice according to commissioner lee state bars the principal source for lawyer discipline nationwide are not up to the task because they lack resources expertise in securities matters and the ability to impose adequate monetary sanctions additionally commissioner lee noted that state law standards focused mostly on the behavior of individual lawyers assigning few responsibilities to the firm for quality assurance indeed state law standards are mostly drafted in a one size fits all fashion according to commissioner lee and do not take into account the different issues faced at large firms who represent public companies which are quite different from a solo practitioner handling personal injury or estate law matters likewise although the sec has the power under rule 102 e of its rules of practice to suspend or bar attorneys whose conduct falls below generally recognized norms of professional conduct there has been little effort to define or enforce that standard nor has the sec rigorously enforced standards of attorney conduct under the one rule it has issued under section 307 the up the ladder rule commissioner lee stated that it was time for the commission to fulfill its mandate under section 307 although not proposing any specific rules commissioner lee offered the following concepts as a starting point greater detail on lawyers obligations to a corporate client including how advice must reflect the interests of the corporation and its shareholders rather than the executives who hire them requirements of competence and expertise as an example disclosure lawyers should not opine on materiality without sufficient focus or understanding of the views of reasonable investors continuing education for securities lawyers advising public companies similar to requirements set by the public company accounting oversight board for minimum hours of qualifying continuing professional education for audit firm personnel oversight at the firm level similar to quality control measures implemented at audit firms emphasis on the need for independence in rendering advice similar to substantive and disclosure requirements implemented in rule 2 01 of regulation s x for auditors obligations to investigate red flags and ensure accurate predicates for legal opinions similar to the obligations that an auditor must perform to certify to the accuracy of their client s financial statements and retention of contemporaneous records to support the reasonableness of legal advice commissioner lee noted that the content of any specific rules or standards will require careful thought as well as assistance from the securities bar experts on professional responsibility and other interested parties and market participants she invited input from the legal community and other stakeholders and noted that she appreciated the complexity of the task and concerns of the american bar association and others regarding protection of the attorney client privilege indeed outside auditors are generally regarded as public watchdogs and such communications between the corporation and an auditor are not entitled to the affirmative attorney client privilege afforded to legal counsel accordingly regulating the legal profession using a similar framework to that applied to the accounting profession has sparked more controversy nonetheless in commissioner lee s view those concerns should be weighed against the costs of there being few if any consequences for contrived or tortured advice implications the commission has declined to adopt enhanced rules of professional conduct for lawyers appearing before it in the 20 years since enactment of the sarbanes oxley act commissioner lee s call for minimum standards however potentially signals increased scrutiny by the sec with respect to lawyers who practice before the commission as commissioner lee noted that means counsel involved in the formulation and review of issuers public disclosure including those who address the many legal questions that often arise in that context nonetheless commissioner lee cautioned that she did not intend with these comments to address the conduct of attorneys serving as litigators or otherwise representing their client s in an advocacy role in an adversarial proceeding or other similar context such as in an enforcement investigation although framing her call for standards in terms of section 307 of the sarbanes oxley act it is not clear that the commission will or even can promulgate any further rules under that authority commissioner lee did not state that she was speaking on behalf of the commission or indicate that the commission would be taking concrete imminent steps to adopt such standards the commission has not put its imprimatur on the remarks by incorporating them into a formal release or statement of policy moreover the text of section 307 appears to foreclose the possibility of further rulemaking as it provides that the commission shall issue any such rules ot later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this act i e january 27 2003 consistent with that constraint the sec proposed the up the ladder requirements on november 21 2002 in release no 33 8150 and the rule became final on january 29 2003 but the sec has not issued any other rule under section 307 to date even if official action under section 307 may not be forthcoming commissioner lee s call for action should not be discounted setting aside the up the ladder requirements the sec has authority under rule 102 e of the sec s rules of practice to censure or bar a lawyer from appearing or practicing before the commission if found among other things o be lacking in character or integrity or to have engaged and unethical or improper professional conduct commissioner lee cited prior sec guidance to indicate that rule 102 e may apply to attorney conduct that falls below generally recognized norms of professional conduct a standard that has been left undefined to date in practice the sec will hold attorneys who practice before it to the standards to which they are already subject including state bar rules at minimum then commissioner lee s objective of greater accountability may be achieved through more aggressive application of rule 102 e which as she noted has generally only been applied as a follow on penalty for primary violations of the securities laws by lawyers commissioner lee s term expires on june 5 and she has announced that she intends to step down from the commission once a successor has been confirmed should the commission nonetheless take up her call to action in the future it will be no easy task to adopt clear standards that can be implemented in a predictable manner in particular commissioner lee s focus on the role of lawyers in advising issuers on determinations of materiality and disclosure does not lend itself well to oversight or enforcement the well established standard for materiality whether there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to vote is far from clear cut the supreme court moreover long has recognized that materiality depends on the facts and thus is to be determined on a case by case basis as such and as evidenced by the sundry cases concerning disclosure issues reversed on appeal disagreement between litigants as well as jurists on matters of materiality and disclosure are par for the course if that is so how can a lawyer s advice on such matters which will inevitably turn on the facts and the lawyer s judgment and experience be subject to oversight in any objective sense even if lawyers materiality advice could be evaluated under objective standards there are other difficulties first and foremost is that oversight of legal advice implicates the attorney client privilege and the underlying benefit of candid advice from securities disclosure and corporate counsel as the supreme court has observed the attorney client privilege is founded upon the necessity in the interest and administration of justice of the aid of persons having knowledge of the law and skilled in its practice which assistance can only be safely and readily availed of when free from the consequences or the apprehension of disclosure aside from situations in which the client has voluntarily waived privilege as sometimes occurs in sec investigations or where another exception to the privilege applies it is unclear how the sec could evaluate legal advice without invading privilege such attempts could have led to an increase in corporate wrongdoing as corporate executives could be more reluctant to seek expert legal advice in addition it is unclear how regulators assessing materiality advice would or could balance an assessment of whether a lawyer has given the correct advice with a lawyer s ethical obligations of zealous representation of the client the divide between overreaching goal directed reasoning and permissible zealous advocacy for the client is often murky and reasonable minds can differ depending on the circumstances moreover it is already well accepted that a corporate lawyer s obligation is to the corporation as its client not to any individual officer or director that obligation carries with it ethical duties to proceed as is reasonably necessary in the best interest of the corporation including when the lawyer is aware of violations of the law or other misconduct by senior management in that sense commissioner lee s proposal could be viewed as a call for the sec to take on enforcement of existing ethical rules rather than for the development of novel minimum standards ultimately there are good reasons for the commission s reluctance to date to formally adopt minimum standards of professional conduct for lawyers appearing before it including the attorney client privilege the goal of zealous advocacy and the fact specific nature of materiality inquiries the manipulation of facts and bad reasoning targeted by commissioner lee are not only the exception and difficult if not impossible to eliminate completely but largely covered by existing rules and practices nonetheless commissioner lee s call for lawyers to strive for higher legal and ethical standards in their counsel should be welcomed sound legal advice is not only important for issuer clients but also for the financial well being of investors the integrity of the markets and public confidence in the regulatory system and capital markets enhancements in ethical standards for the legal profession could also lead to reputational benefits and greater integrity in the profession it remains to be seen whether commissioner lee s remarks will serve as an aspirational goal for securities lawyers or translate into concrete action by the commission 1 commissioner allison herren lee

president biden said the second amendment is not absolute in a speech thursday following a wave of mass shootings across the nation pleading with to congress to pass what he called commonsense gun control legislation including reinstating an assault weapons ban requiring background checks and limiting magazine capacity the president speaking from the cross hall of the white house told americans that the issue of restricting access to guns is one of conscience and common sense for so many of you at home i want to be very clear this is not about taking away anyone s guns the president said it is not about vilifying gun owners in fact we believe we should be treating responsible gun owners as an example of how every gun owner should behave i respect the culture the tradition the concerns of lawful gun owners biden continued at the same time the second amendment like all other rights is not absolute biden added this isn t about taking away anyone s rights it s about protecting children it s about protecting families it s about protecting whole communities it s about protecting our freedoms to go to school to a grocery store to a church without being shot and killed the president s remarks come after a wave of mass shootings in recent weeks in oklahoma texas and new york tulsa oklahoma police say 5 dead including gunman after hospital shooting on wednesday a gunman killed four and then himself at the natalie medical building at st francis hospital in tulsa oklahoma last week alleged gunman salvador ramos killed 19 children and two teachers at robb elementary school in uvalde texas texas school shooting who are the victims killed at uvalde elementary school and in may officials say 18 year old payton gendron allegedly opened fire at a tops friendly market store in buffalo new york killing 10 people and wounding at least three others eleven of the victims were black individuals while the remaining two victims were white authorities have said the president pointing to new data released by the centers for disease control and prevention said guns are the number one killer of children in the united states of america the number one killer more than car accidents more than cancer biden said over the last two decades more school children have died from guns than on duty police officers and active duty military combined buffalo grocery store shooting suspect worked at hometown market in months before racially motivated attack think about that biden said more kids than on duty cops killed by guns more kids than soldiers killed by guns for god s sake how much more carnage are we willing to accept how many more innocent american lives must be taken before we say enough enough biden continued i know that we can t prevent every tragedy but here s what i believe we have to do biden said laying out his proposal to congress we need to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines and if we can t ban assault weapons then we should raise the age to purchase them from 18 to 21 strengthen background checks enact safe storage and red flag laws repeal the immunity that protect gun manufacturers from liability address the mental health crisis deepening the trauma of gun violence the president said biden called these proposals rational commonsense measures texas school shooting live updates the president has been calling on congress for months to take up gun control legislation that would require background checks for all gun sales ban the sale and possession of unserialized firearms ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines and repeal gun manufacturers protection from liability biden s 2023 budget proposal called on congress to deliver funding to implement his comprehensive strategy to reduce gun crime and make communities safer this time we have to take the time to do something the president said this time it s time for the senate to do something but as we know in order to get anything done in the senate we need a minimum of 10 republican senators biden said he supports the bipartisan efforts that include a small group of democrats and republican senators trying to find a way but my god the fact is the majority of the senate republicans don t want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote biden said slamming republicans i find unconscionable we can t fail the american people again the president said he has been in this fight of gun control for a long time i know how hard it is but i ll never give up biden said and if congress fails i believe this time a majority of the american people won t give up either pointing to the 2022 midterm elections biden said that he believes the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote enough enough enough biden said biden s address comes as congress is debating the protecting our kids act an expansive piece of gun control legislation that democrats argue is common sense while republicans say it is unconstitutional house dems gun package to raise age limit for semi automatic rifle purchases ban high capacity magazines the protecting our kids act is a package of eight bills aimed at suppressing gun ownership the bills contain proposals to raise the minimum age for purchasing a semi automatic weapon from 18 to 21 a ban on high capacity magazines a registry for bump stocks and more in a house committee meeting thursday democrats railed against the nra republicans assault weapons and the senate as they expressed outrage that the u s doesn t have tighter gun laws despite mass shootings in recent years the nra has too much of a grip on this congress and on the senate it needs to stop rep steve cohen d tenn said as the house judiciary committee prepared the package of gun related bills for a vote next week there s something gun crazed about our country that we need to deal with the legislation will likely see a vote on the house floor next week along with a bill on red flag laws republicans meanwhile argued that democrats are not taking into account mental health and other factors that cause shootings any time we address gun violence we should also address the state of affairs of our society address crime and mental health rep tom tiffany r wis said we must also address the family unit dems rail against nra senate assault weapons as house preps gun control package crisis of death but house passed gun bills will have a very difficult time making it through the senate where the 60 vote filibuster threshold gives republicans a say on any legislation there around a dozen senators from both parties are participating in talks about potential legislation that would be significantly less far reaching than anything to come from the house among the issues on the table are federal legislation to encourage states to pass red flag laws and expansion of background checks fox news tyler olson louis casiano and the associated press contributed to this report

compensation from the links on this page btw prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting marvel and dc have plenty of comic book movies and tv shows coming out in the next 12 months but not all superheroes are good guys and you ll know that if you ve watched the boys prime video s adaptation of the hit graphic novel has spawned two successful seasons of the boys the show is a graphic raunchy drama about the corporatisation of superheroes and it s been a huge hit amongst audiences it should come as no surprise that amazon is bringing out a third season of the boys but what can we expect from this new batch of episodes and more importantly when can we expect them spoilers for the boys season 1 and 2 ahead the boys season 3 plot when we last left the boys things were getting as usual pretty hectic in an attempt to stop stormfront homelander s son ryan used his laser eyes and accidentally killed his mother becca in the process he then turned against his father and chose to stay with billy butcher after the boys were pardoned hughie took a job in neuman s office not realising she is the mysterious superpowered assassin they ve been looking for that sets things up for a pretty exciting season 3 so what do we know about it so far it appears season 3 will be picking up some notable storylines from the comics it ll be interesting to see how the herogasm miniseries is adapted considering it s one of the most controversial storylines the boys has come up with essentially herogasm is an annual event for vought s superheroes to gather at a remote retreat and partake in a weekend of anything goes sex drugs and partying are no strangers in the boys but herogasm takes it to a new level executive producer eric kripke told vanity fair in an interview there will be no topping up herogasm now that i ve seen the dailies of this thing i m like what have we done it s just so crazy another big addition to season 3 is jensen ackles soldier boy who is described as the world s first superhero and fought during world war ii parallels to marvel s captain america are obvious but soldier boy is in no way the same beacon of truth and justice that steve rogers is according to eric kripke soldier boy is a huge part of the direction of the new season season 3 delves a lot more into the history of how we got here through this character of soldier boy we were able to dig into both the history of the country and also really look at toxic masculinity and masculine roles and what a shit show that s overall caused another tease for what s coming up comes from the new poster for the boys season 3 soon it ll be time to level the playing field pic twitter com ssbjxggsut the boys theboystv march 10 2022 the image shows billy butcher with glowing eyes similar to homelander s this seems to suggest the boys tv series will be picking up another notable plot aspect from the graphic novels which sees the boys inject themselves with compound v to give them an advantage against the supes they are hunting we also have the official synopsis which gives us an idea of where things pick up it s been a year of calm homelander s subdued butcher works for the government supervised by hughie of all people but both men itch to turn this peace and quiet into blood and bone so when the boys learn of a mysterious anti supe weapon it sends them crashing into the seven starting a war and chasing the legend of the first superhero soldier boy the boys season 3 cast as mentioned the most notable addition to the cast is supernatural star jensen ackles as soldier boy but he s not the only newcomer this season sean patrick flanery is playing a judge dredd inspired superhero known as gunpowder who s very much about second amendment rights nick wechsler and gaston villanueva are playing blue hawk and supersonic respectively who are two new superheroes to the world of the boys it appears the boys is also adding another notorious comic character to season three with katia winter reported to be playing russian mob boss little nina the walking dead s laurie holden will also appear as crimson countess a member of soldier boy s crew who has heat powers amazon recently released a photo of holden in costume and she s giving off very scarlet witch vibes you can also expect a number of regular cast members to show up in season 3 of the boys including karl urban jack quaid karen fukuhara laz alonso tomer capone erin moriarty antony starr jessie t usher dominique mcelligott and chace crawford claudia doumit who played victoria neuman and vought s hero pr manager ashley barrett played by colby minifie have also been upped to series regular status for season 3 aya cash s stormfront appeared to be done for at the end of season 2 but we may not have seen the last of her yet however we will probably see more of giancarlo esposito s stan edgar is there a trailer as of march 2022 we finally have a trailer for the boys season 3 gaze upon it below it looks like season 3 will have more of pretty much everything the boys is known for lots of sex blood and superpowers the second full trailer for season 3 is even wilder it puts homelander front and centre who seems to be taking the betrayal of his son quite badly he promises that the people will meet the real me which we all know can t be good meanwhile the boys seem to be back on the straight and narrow but it doesn t take long before things kick off again jensen ackles soldier boy is far more prominent in this trailer and it seems like he might be the one person who stands a chance against homelander s reign of terror is season 3 good with the release of the first episodes of the boys season 3 imminent reviews have hit the internet the new season currently has a 97 rating on rotten tomatoes empire magazine wrote the boys third season doesn t forget to deepen its characters while delivering its requisite bloodbaths and holy shit moments inverse called it the best superhero show saying the boys season 3 is still the best superhero show by a longshot it s fun weird dark emotional and often extremely gross there s an entire episode called herogasm that would make the folks at disney lose their lunches and it s still plenty relevant too the boys season 3 release date now that you re all excited about the new season of the boys you re probably wondering when it s coming out filming took place in 2021 in canada and the cast revealed shooting had wrapped in september prime video announced when we can see the boys season 3 with the first three episodes dropping

senate democrats are ready to drop some of their most pressing demands to restrict access to guns amid the nationwide onslaught of deadly massacres but even that may not be enough to reach a deal with republicans i m certainly prepared for failure sen chris murphy a connecticut democrat helping lead the talks told cnn on thursday i ve been here enough times to know that this is probably the most politically complicated and emotionally fraught piece that congress deals with murphy who is part of a bipartisan group of senators working behind the scenes to respond to deadly gun related massacres nationwide acknowledged in an interview that any accord would have to be incremental in order to win at least 10 republicans to break a filibuster in the 50 50 senate even as he expressed optimism that a deal could be reached by next week i ve also heard republicans make clear that as long as we re not talking about doing everything at once as long as we re talking about more incremental but significant changes they re open said murphy who has been briefing president biden on the state of the talks indeed as house democrats plan to move forward with a bill to ban so called assault weapons senate democrats are not even discussing a ban on firearms such as ar 15s the high powered rifle used in the texas elementary school massacre and a spate of mass shootings they are also conceding that a bipartisan bill to expand background checks on commercial firearm sales will have to be narrowed even as the house passed a bill last year to mandate universal background checks on all commercial sales and private transfers as well and sources in both parties told cnn that a push to raise the age to 21 for purchasing semi automatic rifles has yet to gain much traction in senate talks as republican opposition to the idea begins to mount and democrats are uncertain whether such an idea can win the necessary 60 votes to break a filibuster that s hard to see one gop source said of raising the age to 21 for purchasing the weapons not gonna happen texas sen john cornyn a chief gop negotiator tweeted about imposing new restrictions on guns though his office declined to specify what he meant asked last week about raising the age to 21 for buying the powerful guns north carolina sen thom tillis a republican involved in the bipartisan talks was skeptical when i think of that i think do we take a look at the age you can enlist in the military tillis said so there are a lot of complexities to that question indeed even after the democratic concessions on gun control senators say the prospects that bipartisan talks could collapse in the coming days are very real there s still significant work to do and hurdles to overcome said sen richard blumenthal a connecticut democrat who is heavily involved in the bipartisan talks murphy and blumenthal have been here before ever since the 2012 sandy hook elementary school shooting in their home state of connecticut and even soon after the murder of 20 young children and six adults there democrats fell short of the 60 votes needed to advance a bill by democrat joe manchin of west virginia and republican pat toomey of pennsylvania to mandate background checks on firearm sales at gun shows and over the internet numerous legislative efforts in the wake of many subsequent mass shootings have also floundered including an effort by murphy to revive the manchin toomey bill last year by simply closing the so called gun show loophole and leaving out background checks on internet sales altogether but despite murphy s talks with sen lindsey graham on the matter last year the renewed push never materialized into a deal it s too broad the south carolina republican told cnn when asked if he could get behind the manchin toomey plan in the aftermath of last week s uvalde texas massacre yet even so senators are reengaging in talks in a way different than other mass shootings given the scale of the uvalde massacre with the murder of 19 children and two adults at robb elementary school at the hands of an 18 year old with an ar 15 senators say a deal must be reached by sometime next week or nothing will get done again i think next week is critical murphy said given that senators have been at home during this week s recess and return to washington next week my hope is that we ll have a product for both republicans and democrats to look at when we return and that will give us a sense as to whether we can get this passed every day that goes by i m more optimistic but i don t think we ll really know until everybody gets back in town cnn s ted barrett and morgan rimmer contributed reporting to this post

non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that these non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the company s business and facilitate meaningful comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods and future periods non ifrs measures presented in this earnings release include certain figures from our statement of operations that are adjusted to exclude significant items although figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results a limitation of utilizing these figures that exclude significant items is that the ifrs accounting effects of these items do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of the company s business accordingly these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing the company s financial results therefore management believes that the company s ifrs measures of financial performance and the respective non ifrs measures should be considered together non ifrs measures adjusted figures figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results financial statement items that exclude significant items are non ifrs measures to calculate

only his hairdresser knows for sure elon musk s bid to take twitter private has mainly dropped out of the headlines which has only dimmed speculation and interest rather than end it altogether musk s public confrontation with current twitter management over the estimations of bot content on the site had convinced many that musk might be looking for a way out of the 44 billion bid or at least looking for a discount advertisement instead it appears that musk has spent the time building up his financial resources to execute the takeover as planned the washington post reported yesterday that musk has set aside some of the loans in favor of bringing in more investors in minority ownership a growing list of investors signing up to help fund the 44 billion takeover of twitter are betting on one big thing elon musk though twitter has spent years as an underperforming silicon valley punching bag investors big and small are now scrambling for a piece of it driven by optimistic revenue projections their own strategic interests and fierce loyalty to a tech executive many see as infallible the investors signing up are confident the deal will proceed according to the people despite musk recently telling his more than 90 million twitter followers the deal is on hold musk is personally vetting and approving each investor according to one of the people after initially offering to acquire twitter musk has seen his wealth take a hit with the drop in the stock market he has committed more than 33 billion to buy twitter significantly more than his initial 21 billion equity commitment lowering the amount of debt he would have to pull from banks to reach the agreed upon price the investors he has attracted would contribute to the equity batch lowering his debt burden advertisement initially musk lined up two large tranches of loans to cover nearly 25 billion of the asking price that alone looked a bit tricky as that debt overhead would require immediate servicing while musk revamped the company for better profitability by bringing in more investors in a limited partnership framework musk would probably gain more flexibility and certainly more time for his changes to produce the income he projects that approach makes musk look more serious about the deal as well as the price point however these moves leave the new york times kara swisher unmoved she believes that musk has trapped himself in a relationship with twitter that resembles a bad marriage and that he s still looking to annul it elon musk swept twitter off its feet in april when he put in a bid to buy the company for 44 billion but the impassioned beginnings of this acquisition have cooled down in the weeks since as musk has raised concerns about the inner workings of the company he agreed to buy essentially sight unseen he did not conduct due diligence before he agreed to buy the social media platform as the new york times tech columnist kevin roose puts it the deal is starting to look like an arranged marriage that s sort of going sour musk has invoked concerns about spam and fake accounts on the site as well as privacy considerations and the billionaire has gone so far as to tweet that the deal is temporarily on hold before clarifying that he is still committed to acquisition but a breakup between musk and twitter would make for a difficult costly and very public divorce advertisement swisher and her podcast guests bill cohan and kevin roose think musk is still looking for an escape route roose puts the odds at 10 15 that musk will have annulled the shotgun marriage by the time the october deadline rolls around even with musk s recent moves i think the bots thing is a total pretense he knew there was a bot problem he has bots in his replies every time he posts anything i mean i think this deal is very strange to me it feels a little like an arranged marriage that s going sour everyone pretended to be ok with it but now the date is getting closer the flowers have been ordered the caterers are hired and the groom is getting cold feet he is clearly nervous about this he wants to find a way out i do think the deal will eventually close because of some of the reasons that bill mentioned but i think it s going to be a very awkward interim and there s still a chance i would put it at maybe 10 percent to 15 percent that he finds a way out of this deal some of this analysis however rests on an assumption from all three that musk simply isn t a very serious person especially with social media here s roose s assessment for instance he s like someone who stumbled on to a prageru youtube video and emerges six months later just totally bought into the culture war it almost feels like now his account is like if ben shapiro had a passing interest in satellites and i do think that s what s motivating this he said that he s motivated by the need to free twitter of censorship and i think his recent tweets make it fairly clear that he just thinks the service is way too censorious way too woke run by radicals and he wants to basically restore it to what he feels like it was before that advertisement there may be a strong element of truth to that this musk deal does look quite impulsive at least and the fact that the bot content issue came up prior to the bid makes it look more so this has always looked more personal than financial which is why conservatives cheered musk s bid so enthusiastically if social media platforms dance to the tune of billionaires at least one platform would dance to the tune of a more friendly billionaire or so they hope for now however it s foolish to write this bid off as unserious musk might be impulsive but his instincts have been proven right in the past even if his behavior hasn t at times the attraction of other investors in this bid strongly suggests that they see value in musk s business plans even if his initial decision to buy the platform may have been impulsive and the plan more a product of reverse engineering musk has the resources to execute this deal if he wants it and he has a track record of business success that at least makes this a realistic passion project if nothing else but it s a long way to october too at least the journey should be entertaining if you re not an investor on either side of this twitter deal bad marriage
alderan resources has relinquished areas of its detroit project with the least prospectivity utah focused gold and copper explorer alderan resources asx al8 has renegotiated an option over ground within its detroit project slimming down the acreage to focus on the most prospective targets the new deal with vendors george miller and ron myers now covers 27 7 hectares down from 44 5ha and the number of claims included down from 60 to four alderan has retained the areas closest to detroit s chargeability stem and skarn anomalies and plans to drill those two anomalies this year the detroit project lies within the detroit mining district 290km southwest of salt lake city and contains numerous historical copper gold and manganese mines alderan controls tenements through a series of option agreements with companies such as tamra mining and freeport mcmoran plus a number of local claim owners the company says the renegotiation is part of its strategy of rapidly exploring option areas and retaining only those that are prospective alderan also drops option over valley crossroads ground meanwhile alderan has advised another party utah based tamra mining that it is withdrawing from the option agreement covering the valley crossroads project area this follows alderan reviewing all historical drilling and sampling data and then drilling three holes at the black rock prospect which failed to intersect significant mineralisation alderan managing director scott caithness said reducing the miller myer option fitted that strategy this enables alderan to maximise its expenditure on in ground exploration at detroit where the company is focused on the high potential drum and mizpah oxide gold deposits he added strategic ground retained and to be drilled however the chargeability stem and skarn anomalies which sit on the margins of the miller myer leases remain unexplored the renegotiation has enabled alderan to retain strategic ground around those two anomalies which it regards as important targets for future drilling the detroit mining district has been explored for copper and gold in the past by major mining companies such as anaconda copper kennecott newmont bhp asx bhp and freeport but no one company was able to build a contiguous land position to enable district wide modern exploration freeport mcmoran had tried to consolidate what is now the detroit project but those efforts were rebuffed but alderan succeeded in pulling off the consolidation records show that about 120 000oz of gold was produced there in the 1870s

companies management believes that these non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the company s business and facilitate meaningful comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods and future periods non ifrs measures presented in this earnings release include certain figures from our

by harmeet kaur cnn as the nation continues to endure devastating mass shootings and increasing homicide rates guns remain a fixture of american culture many americans consider the right to bear arms sacred seeing guns as key to their identities and individual freedoms some keep guns for protection hunting or sport while others see guns and the lax regulations around them as a threat to life and safety recurring tragedies involving guns contribute to a climate of fear in which those positions become more entrenched understanding gun ownership in the us can help inform debates about firearm laws or lack thereof obtaining a precise picture however is challenging because no definitive database of gun sales exists what we have to rely on then are polls and survey data from think tanks and academic researchers which vary somewhat in their estimates still there are some broad trends that stand out here s what those polls and surveys tell us about who owns guns in the us white men have the highest rates of gun ownership three in 10 adults say they personally own a gun while four in 10 say they live in a household where someone owns a gun according to a 2017 survey from pew research center on the whole gun owners are more likely to be white and male they re also more likely to live in rural areas and identify as republican about 48 of white men say they own a gun the pew survey found by contrast 24 of white women and 24 of non white men said they owned a gun women of color reported the lowest rates of gun ownership at 16 perhaps unsurprisingly there is a stark partisan divide in gun ownership about 44 of adults who identify as republican or lean republican say they own a gun while just 20 of those who identify as democrat or lean democrat say they do according to pew where a person lives also plays a role the pew survey found that 46 of those who lived in rural areas said they owned a gun while only 28 of suburbanites and 19 of city dwellers owned a gun the northeast has the lowest rates of gun ownership at 16 while roughly a third of people in the south midwest and west report personally owning a gun there are also some slight variations in gun ownership across educational levels those who have a bachelor s degree or higher are somewhat less likely to own a gun compared to those who have a high school diploma or only completed some college how a person is raised can also influence gun ownership about 67 of gun owners say they grew up in a gun owning household while only 40 of those who don t own guns did pew researchers report only a few gun owners hold a large share of guns there are more guns in the us than people there are about 393 million privately owned firearms in the us according to an estimate by the switzerland based small arms survey or in other words 120 guns for every 100 americans that s the highest rate of any country in the world and more than double the rate of the next country on the list a majority of those guns however are owned by a minority of people studies show take for example a report published in 2017 by researchers at harvard and northeastern universities the authors estimate that of the 265 million privately owned firearms in the us about half are owned by 3 of the us adult population and while about half of gun owners own one or two guns 8 of gun owners own 10 or more a figure that amounts to about 40 of the total us gun stock according to the report another finding that bears that out national polls show that gun ownership has declined modestly since the 1970s while fbi firearm background checks show that gun purchases are at record highs what that suggests is that while the share of gun owners in the us is getting smaller overall those who do own guns are buying more and more of them most gun owners say they own guns for protection people own guns for a number of purposes and most gun owners say they own a gun for more than one reason protection is a motivator for a vast majority of people a gallup survey conducted in october 2021 found that 88 of gun owners counted protection against crime as a reason for owning a gun while 70 counted target shooting and 56 counted hunting as reasons similarly pew found that two thirds of gun owners cited protection as a major reason for owning a gun while about four in 10 cited hunting and three in 10 cited sport shooting as major reasons about three quarters of gun owners see firearms as key to their freedoms while about half see them as important to their identities according to pew the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

said they are switching to new meat suppliers with cheaper products and are delaying price changes for items like canned goods retailers generally have been passing price increases along to consumers

funding for hpai usda s animal and plant health inspection service aphis continues its efforts to respond to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza hpai in the united states to date the virus has been confirmed in 35 states affecting more than 37 9 million domestic birds aphis response efforts include working closely with animal health officials in affected states to quickly identify and address new cases of hpai to help ensure aphis can continue to provide critical rapid response activities usda secretary tom vilsack approved the transfer of 400 million from the commodity credit corporation ccc to aphis to directly support the response efforts poultry competition usda wants to create more new and better markets for farmers the beginning of a process on the packers and stockyards act we start with the poultry tournament rule usda secretary tom vilsack explained adding there are two components the first is an effort to try to create greater transparency between integrators and producers providing additional information to the producer before they enter into contracts it s modeled after the ftc franchisee disclosure efforts vilsack reveals saying it is really designed to help producers be able to better value the costs and risks that they re taking in entering into a contract with an integrator it allows them to manage that risk by knowing a bit more about who they re doing business with we re requesting that they the integrators provide information concerning the number of placements and the stock density a history of payments under prior tournaments so that folks can understand and appreciate where they might be in the process a bit of information about the background of the integrator whether they ve been in bankruptcy at any point in time whether they re involved in litigation and the ability of producers to be able to share that information with their financial advisors and those who are providing them legal assistance so that they re in the best possible position to understand and appreciate the risk vilsack said there will be an exemption for very small live poultry dealers in this proposal in addition he said usda has provided additional disclosures concerning the inputs that a farmer is receiving both at the time of placement and at the time of settlement we want the farmer to be able to understand the breed the fact the facility that was breeding the stock that they re being provided the sex the flock age health issues that may have cropped up and essentially at the time of the settlement understanding the distribution of inputs the housing specifications feed disruptions that may have impacted and affected the rankings all of this is designed vilsack said to avoid deception and to provide farmers with the ability to understand precisely what they re getting into a 60 day comment period we believe from our analysis that the benefits of transparency and additional disclosure exceed the costs vilsack also revealed that usda will be filing a study that was done on competition in the retail and seed area meat processing expansion usda has announced a 200 million effort to try to help existing meat and poultry facilities it s an intermediary loan program it s going to provide grants to co ops other nonprofit organizations public agencies to create revolving loan funds to assist and help those facilities to remain in business usda secretary tom vilsack explained usda also announced a 25 million effort to try to expand workforce through nifa programs we think this is an opportunity to expand capacity this goes along with the additional opportunities that we announced in terms of additional processing capacity we received 263 applications for the 150 million grants that are available he detailed it totals about 895 million of interest 46 states 111 beef applications 33 poultry applications 69 pork applications 25 lamb and 14 goat the projected cost of all these projects roughly 5 billion so there s obviously great interest in this program vilsack also said usda saw great interest in the climate smart agriculture and forestry product partnership initiative we received 450 applications 18 billion in requests from all 50 states a diverse pool of applicants nonprofits cooperatives for profit organizations government entities commodity groups forest groups tribes universities small and large corporations a wide range of commodities involved this is the first of two application deadlines june 10th is our small application deadline about 8 billion of additional

president biden on thursday made an emotional appeal for ambitious new gun laws including a ban on military style rifles as lawmakers wrangled bitterly over how to prevent more bloodshed in america in an address to the nation the president prodded congress that it is time to act and repeatedly declared enough about the slaughters in schools and other mass shootings that have become all too routine in the u s if congress would not ban assault weapons outright mr biden said the least lawmakers could do would be to raise the age of purchase for semi automatic rifles from 18 to 21 mr biden also urged lawmakers to expand background checks for gun purchases change liability laws to allow gun manufacturers to be sued for shootings and make gun owners liable for not keeping their firearms locked up this isn t about taking away anyone s rights mr biden said it s about protecting children about protecting families it s about protecting our freedom to go to school to a grocery store to a church without being shot and killed he said the overwhelming majority of americans support tougher gun laws and that he hoped voters would hold the lawmakers accountable see also pelosi s gun control package defines a high capacity magazine as 10 rounds i believe the majority of you will act to turn your outrage into making this issue central to your vote he said mr biden made his plea as the body count mounted the president gave the speech a day after according to authorities a 45 year old man upset with his surgeon returned to a tulsa oklahoma hospital and shot dead the doctor and three other people it was less than a week after an 18 year old man opened fire in an elementary school in uvalde texas killing 19 children and two teachers this time we must actually do something mr biden said the issue we face is of conscience and common sense on capitol hill however the seemingly insurmountable obstacles to passing stricter gun laws came into sharper focus the debate between democrats and republicans devolved into trading insults and accusations as house democrats convened an emergency hearing of the judiciary committee to push forward their package of six gun control bills see also mondaire jones threatens court packing eliminating senate filibuster to get tough new gun laws democrats from mr biden on down rejected without hesitation republican proposals to harden security at schools while republicans scoffed at any move to further restrict firearm possession rep mondaire jones new york democrat gave voice to his party s frustration and issued what has become a routine threat to sweep aside the rules for the senate and the supreme court to achieve gun control goals if the filibuster obstructs us we will abolish it if the supreme court objects we will expand it he said we will not rest until we have taken weapons of war out of circulation in our communities on the other side of the aisle republicans bristled at democrats equating support for the second amendment with tolerating mass murder you think we don t have hearts said rep louis gohmert texas republican we care about people we care about their lives and lives that have been so trivialized we care deeply how dare you you arrogant people attributing murder to those of us who want to do something to stop it house democrats named the package of gun legislation the protecting our kids act it would raise the federal age of purchasing a rifle from 18 to 21 restrict ammunition magazine capacity though existing magazines are grandfathered in and require existing bump stocks to be registered and ban new bump stocks for civilian use it also would amend the definition of ghost guns to mandate background checks on all sales and create new requirements for firearm storage at home specifically when minors are present the package is expected to pass the democratic run house but die in the senate which is split 50 50 between democrats and republicans house democrats are not bothered by that reality they say the legislation will put public pressure on republicans within the senate to back some type of change to the nation s gun laws however senate democratic aides told the washington times that the fireworks in the house were more likely to sabotage any hope for a bipartisan compromise in the upper chamber the gun control six pack won t be the last word on the issue from the house house speaker nancy pelosi vowed to bring forward an even more contentious ban on military style semi automatic rifles which gun control advocates call assault weapons saving our children can and must be a unifying mission for our nation said mrs pelosi california democrat to all those in the congress who would stand in the way of saving lives your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children at the judiciary hearing rep jim jordan ohio republican said the democrats gun bills were nothing but partisan messaging this is not a real attempt in my judgment to find solutions he said what we re is designed to appeal to democratic primary voters in the senate a bipartisan group of nine senators continued negotiation on an overhaul of gun and public safety laws that could pass they are looking for a deal on expanding background checks for gun purchases and incentivizing states to adopt red flag laws which allow law enforcement to remove firearms from people determined by a court to be a danger a deal will require the support of at least 10 republican senators for the legislation to survive a filibuster any gun bill will face long odds given pressure from gun rights groups and the high stakes of passing gun laws in an election year senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said any legislation responding to the texas school shooting should be targeted at the problems exposed by the massacre it seems to me there are two broad categories that underscore the problem mental illness and school safety said mr mcconnell kentucky republican haris alic can be

washington president joe biden called on congress to pass gun control legislation in a speech at the white house thursday evening following mass shootings in new york texas and oklahoma during the last three weeks this isn t about taking away anyone s rights this is about protecting children biden said how much more carnage are we willing to accept the plea came after a white supremacist killed 10 black people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo new york on may 14 ten days later an elementary school in uvalde texas was attacked by an 18 year old man armed with a rifle and 19 children and two teachers were killed another mass shooting at a hospital in tulsa oklahoma on wednesday night left four dead biden said congress should ban assault weapons like the ones used in the recent mass shootings and if congress could not agree to ban them biden said the age to purchase an assault weapon should be raised from 18 to 21 he also expressed his support for laws that would safely store guns in homes where children live and for an end to the liability shield that prevents civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers the gun industry special protections are outrageous biden said it must end firearm related injuries are now the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the united states according to the new england journal of medicine protecting our kids act at the same time biden spoke at the white house the u s house judiciary committee passed a gun control package on a party line vote 25 19 following a heated all day markup called on an emergency basis by democrats after the recent spate of gun violence both the house and senate are in recess the legislation h r 7910 known as the protecting our kids act is made up of eight bills related to gun control all first introduced in 2021 by democratic lawmakers it s expected to be on the house floor next week while the legislation is expected to pass a democrat controlled house it s unlikely to advance in the evenly divided senate where a small bipartisan group of senators is discussing more limited measures the house gun control package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things republicans on the committee raised repeated objections to the bill blaming mental health problems and a lack of family values as the reasons for the recent mass shootings they criticized democrats for rushing to pass legislation this is no rush action rep steve cohen d tenn responded this has been delayed for decades he said all the provisions in the bill should be law today cohen added that assault weapons which are typically used in mass shootings were banned from 1994 until the law expired in 2004 republicans submitted 10 amendments to the bill only one was accepted by republican rep thomas massie of kentucky the amendment would require the attorney general to submit a report to the house and senate judiciary committees and to collect the demographic data of persons who were determined to be ineligible to purchase a firearm based on a background check performed by the national instant criminal background check system including race ethnicity national origin sex gender age disability average annual income and english language proficiency if available wisconsin shooting even while house members fought over gun control more gun violence broke out in wisconsin where five people were shot while attending a funeral as we sit here there are multiple shots near racine wisconsin rep sheila jackson lee a texas democrat said it is obscene one mass shooting after another jamie raskin a maryland democrat said mass shootings did not start with buffalo he argued that congress has had since the columbine shooting in colorado in 1999 to do something about gun control but rep chip roy r texas called the markup a crap proceeding saying republicans did not have enough time to prepare he said that the goal of democrats was to disarm the american people georgia democratic reps lucy mcbath and hank johnson countered that americans want commonsense gun control laws mcbath who became a gun safety advocate after her son jordan was shot and killed argued about so called red flag laws with florida republican rep matt gaetz red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others gaetz submitted an amendment to insert a line into the bill that affirms that congress disfavors the enactment of laws that authorize a court to issue an extreme risk protection order also known as red flag laws in the states because such laws trample on an individual s due process and second amendment rights but mcbath said that there is support for red flag laws including from law enforcement because they are tools to temporarily remove firearms from people in distress don t you dare try to tout that red flag laws don t count mcbath said arguing that without the laws many people s hands are tied when they want to remove a firearm from a loved one rep cliff bentz an oregon republican said that the bills before the committee would not immediately end school shootings each one of these will not help now he said these things will be challenged in the courts and nothing will happen for these kids he criticized democrats for not reaching out to republicans to work on bipartisan legislation florida republican shows off firearms rep greg steube a florida republican who participated in the markup virtually brandished several of his guns and argued that they would be banned under the proposed laws in the legislative package i hope the gun is not loaded jackson lee said i m at my house i can do whatever i want with my guns steube said the chair of the judiciary committee jerry nadler d n y asked steube if he would answer questions which he declined republican rep mike johnson of louisiana blamed secularization for mass shootings and republican rep tom tiffany of wisconsin said gun violence came down to family values tiffany accused democrats of trying to repeal the second amendment and would not engage with his democratic colleagues who tried to debate him rep madeleine dean d penn said she was horrified by the rhetoric from republicans on the committee and said that they were more concerned with protecting guns than with the victims of gun violence where is the outrage over the slaughter of 19 kids and two school teachers she said dean said that the second amendment has been idolized by republicans do you think the founding fathers were picturing ar style weapons she said school safety gop lawmakers like gaetz and tom mcclintock of california argued that gun free zones were actually dangerous and that guns should be allowed on school grounds so armed law enforcement could protect students perhaps outrage isn t the best way to write a bill gaetz said rep steve chabot an ohio republican said that what lawmakers could do immediately is work to make schools safer such as using funds to hire more resource officers and install metal detectors in schools that s one area where we could be working for common ground he said separately house speaker nancy pelosi said the house will take up a bill to ban assault rifles sometime next week when lawmakers return from recess while it will likely pass the house it has no chance of getting through an evenly divided senate where the legislation would need 10 republicans to join all democrats to advance pelosi said the house also will vote on mcbath s legislation on red flag laws the federal extreme risk protection order act or h r 2377 as we go down this path it is our responsibility to keep gun violence front and center in the media so that strengthened by public opinion we can get life saving legislation over the finish line pelosi said in a statement to all those in the congress who would stand in the way of saving lives your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children we will not rest until the job is done pelosi said the house will also vote on rep david cicilline s active shooter alert act or h r 6538 which creates a notification alert system during a mass shooting the bill by the rhode island democrat has 14 republican co sponsors assault style weapons none of the bills debated in the house judiciary markup would ban assault style weapons which were used in the new york texas and oklahoma shootings pelosi said a hearing on an assault weapons ban will be held but did not set a date jackson lee said that democrats are not done and that there needs to be a ban on assault weapons but the top republican on the committee jim jordan of ohio said the emergency markup seemed more of political theater and is not a real attempt in my judgment to solve solutions jordan said that the gun control package is a radical attempt to enact federal control over law abiding citizens republican reps andy biggs of arizona and dan bishop of north carolina echoed similar sentiments blaming the gun for what is happening in america is small minded rep ken buck a colorado republican said

house speaker nancy pelosi vowed to bring forward an even more contentious ban on military style semi automatic rifles which gun control advocates call assault weapons saving our children can and must be a unifying mission for our nation said mrs pelosi california democrat to all those in the congress who would stand in the way of saving lives your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children at the judiciary hearing rep jim jordan ohio republican said the democrats gun bills were nothing but partisan messaging this is not a real attempt in my judgment to find solutions he said what we re is designed to appeal to democratic primary voters in the senate a bipartisan group of nine senators continued negotiation on an overhaul of gun and public safety laws that could pass they are looking for a deal on expanding background checks for gun purchases and incentivizing states to adopt red flag laws which allow law enforcement to remove firearms from people determined by a court to be a danger a deal will require the support of at least 10 republican senators for the legislation to survive a filibuster any gun bill will face long odds given pressure from gun rights groups and the high stakes of passing gun laws in an election year senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said any legislation responding to the texas school shooting should be targeted at the problems exposed by the massacre it seems to me there are two broad categories that underscore the problem mental illness and school safety said mr mcconnell kentucky republican haris alic can be

mobile phone network operator with operations worldwide currently wholly owned by france telecom orange has changed hands several times during its history orange was born out of microtel a consortium formed in 1990 by british aerospace bae to bid for the licence to operate the uk s fourth mobile phone network in 1991 the bid was successful but before the network was launched hutchison whampoa bought microtel from bae in a deal that gave the british defense company 30 of hutchison uk the future s bright the future s orange when the network was launched in 1994 as orange they set about differentiating themselves from existing operators vodafone and cellnet who had gained a reputation as stuffy and old fashioned as well as from fellow newcomers one2one the basis of this was an award winning advertising campaign and branding exercise created by wolff olins and wcrs they succeeded in portraying the new comapany as fresh modern and friendly as well as establishing the orange brand as one of the most widely recognised in the uk and now worldwide the future s bright slogan has been one of the most successful in advertising history entering everday usage the brand remains strong arguably stronger than the much larger vodafone they like to say that their brand is built on strong customer service and jd power customer satisfaction surveys seem to back that up but there has been some backlash from disgruntled customers and employees many have complained of the brainwashing that orange staff seem to undergo the company had been run since its purchase by hutchison by the charismatic and eccentric hans snook he has developed a almost cult like atmosphere in the company in that respect he is to orange what steve jobs is to apple a company with which it has more in common than just a fruity name in march 1996 hutchison floated an minority portion of the company on the london stock exchange and new york s nasdaq this produced a valuation of 2 45 billion and a ftse 100 listing for orange plc three years later they sold their remaining majority stake to the german conglomerate mannessmann who then succeeded in making a compulsory purchase of the remaining shares this marriage was to be short lived as uk rival vodafone launched an audacious hostile takeover of the german giant as part of the conditions set down by the european commission when they approved the bid vodafone were forced to sell off orange many suspected that vodafone would succeed in crippling their competitor by selling them to a weak rival who they would further weaken by the extravagant price they were demanding for their prize sale this was not to be and in may 2000 orange was sold to france telecom for a cool 26 billion france telecom was a former state monopoly and imbued with the bureaucratic and slow moving culture of the french civil service this did not sit well with the touchy feely forward thinking culture that snook had developed at orange the clash of cultures is nicely illustrated by a small possibly apocryphal probably libellous anecdote that i heard from someone who worked closely with the most senior staff at orange uk the first delegation from france telecom were arriving at the london offices of their new purchase as they drew up they were greeted by the sight of the ceo s expensive car spray painted by a disgruntled employee with a slogan along the lines of hans snook is fucking my wife soon after the acquisition by france telecom snook stepped aside to spend more time with his other interests which include alternative medicine and healthcare he remained a special advisor to the board this was not before he oversaw the company s second flotation this time orange sa as it was now known was listed on euronext paris as well as the london stock exchange france telecom saw orange uk as the model to follow for the rest of their current and future mobile network operations and has committed itself to introducing the orange brand for every network in which it holds a controlling stake they have also promised to negotiate with shareholders of networks in which they are only a minority holder in order to introduce the brand a wirefree future orange has successfully bid for umts 3g licences in the uk the netherlands germany italy austria sweden switzerland portugal belgium and france they ended up paying some unbelievable amounts for some of them for example the german license cost 8 37 billion and the uk one the equivalent of 6 8 billion in the uk orange faces the prospect of 3g competition with two of its former owners as hutchison returns with its own licence orange group by country date of launch and percentage stake
adrien broner may have his return to action set for july 23 in chicago as franciso a salazar is reporting via his twitter that broner will face omar figueroa jr in a pbc main event on that date with broner seemingly confirming on instagram broner 34 4 1 24 ko who turns 33 on july 28 has seen his stock plummet the last few years going 1 2 1 in his last four fights and his win in early 2021 over jovanie santiago was a controversial decision his win prior to that in 2017 against adrian granados was also controversial just as troubling in another way is that broner s return against santiago drew lousy numbers on showtime which was really the last thing he had going for him yeah it was head to head with berchelt valdez on espn but even considering that the numbers were really weak for a broner fight broner s wider reputation among fans has become that he only fights when he needs the money which matches up against figueroa 28 2 1 19 ko whose interest in fighting anymore has also been routinely questioned over the years though when he fights he does come to fight and throw punches which is not really the case for broner figueroa 32 has lost his last two he was dominated over 12 rounds by yordenis ugas in july 2019 and came back 22 months later to get absolutely thrashed by abel ramos a fight that was mercifully stopped after six rounds he was doing his best but in that fight it became clear that he s really not a welterweight figueroa couldn t put a dent in ramos that said broner has never really been a welterweight either at least as far as being at his best so in many ways this is a well matched fight that s the way to go about it it s also a fight that was meant to happen in 2018 but figueroa pulled out with an injury it s also a rare notable event for chicago if that is where it winds up going there are boxing fans in the windy city but it s also expensive to run in the city itself and it s not exactly new york or los angeles let s be honest so if you re a chicago fight fan hey here s a card of some stature for you in all sincerity i don t hate this fight at all it s maybe not the best showtime main event if you don t stop and think about what showtime main events actually are most of the time benavidez lemieux garcia other benavidez etc but it s not a poorly matched fight and who gets their hand raised will depend on what versions of both of these guys show up on the night and then what the judges think they should do with the likely 12 rounds we get of broner not throwing very much and figueroa throwing but probably not landing a ton clean
washington president joe biden called on congress to pass gun control legislation in a speech at the white house thursday evening following mass shootings in new york texas and oklahoma during the last three weeks this isn t about taking away anyone s rights this is about protecting children biden said how much more carnage are we willing to accept the plea came after a white supremacist killed 10 black people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo new york on may 14 ten days later an elementary school in uvalde texas was attacked by an 18 year old man armed with a rifle and 19 children and two teachers were killed another mass shooting at a hospital in tulsa oklahoma on wednesday night left four dead biden said congress should ban assault weapons like the ones used in the recent mass shootings and if congress could not agree to ban them biden said the age to purchase an assault weapon should be raised from 18 to 21 he also expressed his support for laws that would safely store guns in homes where children live and for an end to the liability shield that prevents civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers the gun industry special protections are outrageous biden said it must end firearm related injuries are now the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the united states according to the new england journal of medicine protecting our kids act at the same time biden spoke at the white house the u s house judiciary committee passed a gun control package on a party line vote 25 19 following a heated all day markup called on an emergency basis by democrats after the recent spate of gun violence both the house and senate are in recess the legislation h r 7910 known as the protecting our kids act is made up of eight bills related to gun control all first introduced in 2021 by democratic lawmakers it s expected to be on the house floor next week while the legislation is expected to pass a democrat controlled house it s unlikely to advance in the evenly divided senate where a small bipartisan group of senators is discussing more limited measures the house gun control package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things republicans on the committee raised repeated objections to the bill blaming mental health problems and a lack of family values as the reasons for the recent mass shootings they criticized democrats for rushing to pass legislation this is no rush action rep steve cohen d tenn responded this has been delayed for decades he said all the provisions in the bill should be law today cohen added that assault weapons which are typically used in mass shootings were banned from 1994 until the law expired in 2004 republicans submitted 10 amendments to the bill only one was accepted by republican rep thomas massie of kentucky the amendment would require the attorney general to submit a report to the house and senate judiciary committees and to collect the demographic data of persons who were determined to be ineligible to purchase a firearm based on a background check performed by the national instant criminal background check system including race ethnicity national origin sex gender age disability average annual income and english language proficiency if available wisconsin shooting even while house members fought over gun control more gun violence broke out in wisconsin where five people were shot while attending a funeral as we sit here there are multiple shots near racine wisconsin rep sheila jackson lee a texas democrat said it is obscene one mass shooting after another jamie raskin a maryland democrat said mass shootings did not start with buffalo he argued that congress has had since the columbine shooting in colorado in 1999 to do something about gun control but rep chip roy r texas called the markup a crap proceeding saying republicans did not have enough time to prepare he said that the goal of democrats was to disarm the american people georgia democratic reps lucy mcbath and hank johnson countered that americans want commonsense gun control laws mcbath who became a gun safety advocate after her son jordan was shot and killed argued about so called red flag laws with florida republican rep matt gaetz red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others gaetz submitted an amendment to insert a line into the bill that affirms that congress disfavors the enactment of laws that authorize a court to issue an extreme risk protection order also known as red flag laws in the states because such laws trample on an individual s due process and second amendment rights but mcbath said that there is support for red flag laws including from law enforcement because they are tools to temporarily remove firearms from people in distress don t you dare try to tout that red flag laws don t count mcbath said arguing that without the laws many people s hands are tied when they want to remove a firearm from a loved one rep cliff bentz an oregon republican said that the bills before the committee would not immediately end school shootings each one of these will not help now he said these things will be challenged in the courts and nothing will happen for these kids he criticized democrats for not reaching out to republicans to work on bipartisan legislation florida republican shows off firearms rep greg steube a florida republican who participated in the markup virtually brandished several of his guns and argued that they would be banned under the proposed laws in the legislative package i hope the gun is not loaded jackson lee said i m at my house i can do whatever i want with my guns steube said rep greg steube r fl flashes three different guns during the house s gun control hearing rep sheila jackson lee d tx i hope the gun is not loaded steube i m at my house i can do whatever i want with my guns pic twitter com frc1yezjw2 the recount therecount june 2 2022 the chair of the judiciary committee jerry nadler d n y asked steube if he would answer questions which he declined republican rep mike johnson of louisiana blamed secularization for mass shootings and republican rep tom tiffany of wisconsin said gun violence came down to family values tiffany accused democrats of trying to repeal the second amendment and would not engage with his democratic colleagues who tried to debate him rep madeleine dean d penn said she was horrified by the rhetoric from republicans on the committee and said that they were more concerned with protecting guns than with the victims of gun violence where is the outrage over the slaughter of 19 kids and two school teachers she said dean said that the second amendment has been idolized by republicans do you think the founding fathers were picturing ar style weapons she said support news you trust donate school safety gop lawmakers like gaetz and tom mcclintock of california argued that gun free zones were actually dangerous and that guns should be allowed on school grounds so armed law enforcement could protect students perhaps outrage isn t the best way to write a bill gaetz said rep steve chabot an ohio republican said that what lawmakers could do immediately is work to make schools safer such as using funds to hire more resource officers and install metal detectors in schools that s one area where we could be working for common ground he said separately house speaker nancy pelosi said the house will take up a bill to ban assault rifles sometime next week when lawmakers return from recess while it will likely pass the house it has no chance of getting through an evenly divided senate where the legislation would need 10 republicans to join all democrats to advance pelosi said the house also will vote on mcbath s legislation on red flag laws the federal extreme risk protection order act or h r 2377 as we go down this path it is our responsibility to keep gun violence front and center in the media so that strengthened by public opinion we can get life saving legislation over the finish line pelosi said in a statement to all those in the congress who would stand in the way of saving lives your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children we will not rest until the job is done pelosi said the house will also vote on rep david cicilline s active shooter alert act or h r 6538 which creates a notification alert system during a mass shooting the bill by the rhode island democrat has 14 republican co sponsors assault style weapons none of the bills debated in the house judiciary markup would ban assault style weapons which were used in the new york texas and oklahoma shootings pelosi said a hearing on an assault weapons ban will be held but did not set a date jackson lee said that democrats are not done and that there needs to be a ban on assault weapons but the top republican on the committee jim jordan of ohio said the emergency markup seemed more of political theater and is not a real attempt in my judgment to solve solutions jordan said that the gun control package is a radical attempt to enact federal control over law abiding citizens republican reps andy biggs of arizona and dan bishop of north carolina echoed similar sentiments blaming the gun for what is happening in america is small minded rep ken buck a colorado republican said

bar and the insurance bar we are proud to have recovered billions of dollars for our clients and the classes of shareholders we represent abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors

in the 1950s carla torrey spent her childhood summers watching her father build houses on topsail island and other structures like the wade chestnut memorial chapel which is still around today the memories also include watching the waves hitting the shore while looking to the right and left and seeing large crowds of white people during the days of segregation there was seriously an invisible line that separated us torrey said during those days the stretch on the island was known as ocean city a place where black people could enjoy the beach without harassment it was created as a vacation haven in the late 1940s for black people and the only place they could purchase oceanfront property today torrey is working with other community members to keep the historical legacy alive as the president of the ocean city beach citizens council they didn t make it a place where black people could just go dance and seek entertainment torrey said they made it a community in july ocean city will be honored with a historical marker from the north carolina department of natural and cultural resources and the n c african american heritage commission the sign will be a part of the state s civil rights trail torrey submitted the application for the marker recognition they were assisted by the town of north topsail beach the historical society of topsail island and others a community of firsts kenneth chestnut sr said the historical marker is very significant before mentioning other ways to preserve history i m a big believer that we need to be aware of our history and know our history and this will help people become more aware of the ocean city community he said it will be a big boost for us and will expand the recognition for the ocean city community his parents wade h chestnut and caronell chestnut were the first homeowners the family home was built in 1949 and was rebuilt in 1955 after it was destroyed by hurricane hazel chestnut s father wade chestnut managed the fishing pier and led the development of ocean city more as a fading pender community fights for survival a hampstead leader lends her voice like us on facebook head to pender today to join the conversation on county events and issues i have fond memories of being at the beach in the summer and during the fall on the weekends chestnut said about getaways from wilmington some of that was playing in the water and sand and having fun with my friends and fishing he also worked at the pier doing chores and selling snow cones chestnut said he always felt safe in the beach community where families would share seafood dishes to make meals women would go crabbing and their sons would help carry baskets everyone enjoyed each other s company and it was always a family oriented safe community he said like torrey chestnut remembers those moments when beach was split in parts based on skin color that was the way of the world he said i grew up in the jim crow south and particularly here in wilmington although there was racial tension chestnut said there were some positive things he saw as a youth one was everyone fishing together at the pier when the fish were biting the pier was a business venture led by black people but white people participated as stockholders they had a common interest that found them together without regard to race at that time he said certainly ocean city was in the midst of white communities on each side but we enjoyed the beach and enjoyed families torrey lives in durham now but she still visits her family s beach home when she wants to get away from the big city she hopes the marker is an encouragement for future generations i want future generations to understand the resiliency of the african american community and how they were able to do something that was not acceptable in a lot of places she said in fact most of the beaches we weren t allowed on or they were sundown towns so we couldn t be in the area after dark it was quite a feat she also emphasized the historical significance of ocean city being founded in 1949 51 years after the wilmington massacre of 1898 where many black people were killed and ran out of town during a coup d e tat carried out by a white supremacist mob who overthrew a biracial government the idea of having a beach community with black ownership came from edgar l yow a white wilmington attorney he owned land on topsail island and shared his thoughts with dr samuel gray a black physician topsail island was previously used as a firing range during world war ii for soldiers from camp davis it later reopened for development gray contacted his friends the chestnut family who bought tracts of lands on the island chestnut s father was one of gray s buddies after the first homes were built on a one mile stretch for ocean city more homes and businesses followed a motel and restaurant were built in 1953 in addition to other establishments such as summer camp dormitories connected to the church a dining hall and the ocean city fishing pier keeping a legacy there are small logos on street signs letting visitors know they re in the historic area but community members would like to have more in terms of having a sign saying you re entering ocean city it s not there chestnut said that s one of the projects that we re working on but in the meantime the community is looking forward to historical marker unveiling at the 2022 ocean city jazz festival each year the festival is held at north topsail beach to promote and celebrate the community s history while raising funds for future projects the 12th annual event will be held july 2 3 in addition to the festival community members are working on starting a land trust and a capital campaign to have money for needs such as attorneys and other legal matters after hurricane fran in 1996 a good portion of the community was lost along with the pier motel and a lot of homes after the lots became unbuildable there are close to 60 homes in the community that are still owned by black people before fran there were more than 100 chestnut is glad people from the generation of ocean city landowners were able to pass on property to continue their legacy more n c black film festival to honor wilmington s most prolific movie maker but it s still a challenge but because of integration or people having choices the next generation live in other places so they may not think the heritage and legacy of ocean city is that important he said very often the property may be sold to a builder or developer who may lease it out or rent it out another threat is losing a calm low density family oriented community he knew years ago as more development continues on topsail island because of the real estate market with no connection to the community mother nature the intensity of hurricanes sea levels rising and erosion are also concerns there are issues the community is keeping an eye on but a third essential mission is to raise awareness about ocean city through events such as the jazz festival i call it audacity for folks that look like me to build a community at the beach and after hurricane hazel in the 1950s they could have quit and said ok we tried chestnut said about the destructive storm but they had the tenacity to build back so i consider people like myself and others stewards of what our families committed to doing for us we re stewards of what they ve passed on to us so we want to make sure we re the best stewards possible reporter chase jordan can be reached at cjjordan gannett com
washington president joe biden called on congress to pass gun control legislation in a speech at the white house thursday evening following mass shootings in new york texas and oklahoma during the last three weeks this isn t about taking away anyone s rights this is about protecting children biden said how much more carnage are we willing to accept the plea came after a white supremacist killed 10 black people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo new york on may 14 ten days later an elementary school in uvalde texas was attacked by an 18 year old man armed with a rifle and 19 children and two teachers were killed another mass shooting at a hospital in tulsa oklahoma on wednesday night left four dead biden said congress should ban assault weapons like the ones used in the recent mass shootings and if congress could not agree to ban them biden said the age to purchase an assault weapon should be raised from 18 to 21 he also expressed his support for laws that would safely store guns in homes where children live and for an end to the liability shield that prevents civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers the gun industry special protections are outrageous biden said it must end firearm related injuries are now the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the united states according to the new england journal of medicine protecting our kids act at the same time biden spoke at the white house the u s house judiciary committee passed a gun control package on a party line vote 25 19 following a heated all day markup called on an emergency basis by democrats after the recent spate of gun violence both the house and senate are in recess the legislation h r 7910 known as the protecting our kids act is made up of eight bills related to gun control all first introduced in 2021 by democratic lawmakers it s expected to be on the house floor next week while the legislation is expected to pass a democrat controlled house it s unlikely to advance in the evenly divided senate where a small bipartisan group of senators is discussing more limited measures the house gun control package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things republicans on the committee raised repeated objections to the bill blaming mental health problems and a lack of family values as the reasons for the recent mass shootings they criticized democrats for rushing to pass legislation this is no rush action rep steve cohen d tenn responded this has been delayed for decades he said all the provisions in the bill should be law today cohen added that assault weapons which are typically used in mass shootings were banned from 1994 until the law expired in 2004 republicans submitted 10 amendments to the bill only one was accepted by republican rep thomas massie of kentucky the amendment would require the attorney general to submit a report to the house and senate judiciary committees and to collect the demographic data of persons who were determined to be ineligible to purchase a firearm based on a background check performed by the national instant criminal background check system including race ethnicity national origin sex gender age disability average annual income and english language proficiency if available wisconsin shooting even while house members fought over gun control more gun violence broke out in wisconsin where two people were shot while attending a funeral as we sit here there are multiple shots near racine wisconsin rep sheila jackson lee a texas democrat said it is obscene one mass shooting after another jamie raskin a maryland democrat said mass shootings did not start with buffalo he argued that congress has had since the columbine shooting in colorado in 1999 to do something about gun control but rep chip roy r texas called the markup a crap proceeding saying republicans did not have enough time to prepare he said that the goal of democrats was to disarm the american people georgia democratic reps lucy mcbath and hank johnson countered that americans want commonsense gun control laws mcbath who became a gun safety advocate after her son jordan was shot and killed argued about so called red flag laws with florida republican rep matt gaetz red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others gaetz submitted an amendment to insert a line into the bill that affirms that congress disfavors the enactment of laws that authorize a court to issue an extreme risk protection order also known as red flag laws in the states because such laws trample on an individual s due process and second amendment rights but mcbath said that there is support for red flag laws including from law enforcement because they are tools to temporarily remove firearms from people in distress don t you dare try to tout that red flag laws don t count mcbath said arguing that without the laws many people s hands are tied when they want to remove a firearm from a loved one rep cliff bentz an oregon republican said that the bills before the committee would not immediately end school shootings each one of these will not help now he said these things will be challenged in the courts and nothing will happen for these kids he criticized democrats for not reaching out to republicans to work on bipartisan legislation florida republican shows off firearms rep greg steube a florida republican who participated in the markup virtually brandished several of his guns and argued that they would be banned under the proposed laws in the legislative package i hope the gun is not loaded jackson lee said i m at my house i can do whatever i want with my guns steube said the chair of the judiciary committee jerry nadler d n y asked steube if he would answer questions which he declined republican rep mike johnson of louisiana blamed secularization for mass shootings and republican rep tom tiffany of wisconsin said gun violence came down to family values tiffany accused democrats of trying to repeal the second amendment and would not engage with his democratic colleagues who tried to debate him rep madeleine dean d penn said she was horrified by the rhetoric from republicans on the committee and said that they were more concerned with protecting guns than with the victims of gun violence where is the outrage over the slaughter of 19 kids and two school teachers she said dean said that the second amendment has been idolized by republicans do you think the founding fathers were picturing ar style weapons she said school safety gop lawmakers like gaetz and tom mcclintock of california argued that gun free zones were actually dangerous and that guns should be allowed on school grounds so armed law enforcement could protect students perhaps outrage isn t the best way to write a bill gaetz said rep steve chabot an ohio republican said that what lawmakers could do immediately is work to make schools safer such as using funds to hire more resource officers and install metal detectors in schools that s one area where we could be working for common ground he said separately house speaker nancy pelosi said the house will take up a bill to ban assault rifles sometime next week when lawmakers return from recess while it will likely pass the house it has no chance of getting through an evenly divided senate where the legislation would need 10 republicans to join all democrats to advance pelosi said the house also will vote on mcbath s legislation on red flag laws the federal extreme risk protection order act or h r 2377 as we go down this path it is our responsibility to keep gun violence front and center in the media so that strengthened by public opinion we can get life saving legislation over the finish line pelosi said in a statement to all those in the congress who would stand in the way of saving lives your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children we will not rest until the job is done pelosi said the house will also vote on rep david cicilline s active shooter alert act or h r 6538 which creates a notification alert system during a mass shooting the bill by the rhode island democrat has 14 republican co sponsors assault style weapons none of the bills debated in the house judiciary markup would ban assault style weapons which were used in the new york texas and oklahoma shootings pelosi said a hearing on an assault weapons ban will be held but did not set a date jackson lee said that democrats are not done and that there needs to be a ban on assault weapons but the top republican on the committee jim jordan of ohio said the emergency markup seemed more of political theater and is not a real attempt in my judgment to solve solutions jordan said that the gun control package is a radical attempt to enact federal control over law abiding citizens republican reps andy biggs of arizona and dan bishop of north carolina echoed similar sentiments blaming the gun for what is happening in america is small minded rep ken buck a colorado republican said editor s note this item has been modified to correct early reports of the number of injuries at a shooting in racine wisconsin
d ray smith historically speaking column mike stallo research librarian my fellow historian and a good friend brings us a story about our library as a part of celebrating 78 years of continuous operation significant improvements have been seen over the years and our library is one we can be proud of enjoy looking back with mike oak ridge public library turns 78 years old this year in honor of that i would like to tell you about our first librarian elizabeth edwards due to the nature of wartime conditions in world war ii including sudden relocation and temporary employment the first citizens of oak ridge had not carried many books with them this quickly created a high demand for books and magazines in late november of 1943 the leaders of the town began to try to distribute reading materials to the townspeople it started with a simple magazine redistribution program citizens had been encouraged to donate magazines as they finished reading them a drop off point was designated for people to leave their donations then boy scouts would collect them and deliver them to dormitories hospitals and other common areas in town around this same time residents were offered an opportunity to subscribe to the chattanooga times newspaper and the sentinel also published in chattanooga not to be confused with the knoxville news sentinel the periodical services bureau acted as a go between for people to subscribe to various newspapers and other periodicals this was done in part for security reasons to be able to control the types of information coming into town early town council meeting minutes mention the library committee and their plans to establish a library the library project was aligned under the recreation and welfare department in keeping with the general sense of urgency of the manhattan project things moved very quickly once the decision was made to hire a librarian it took less than a month for elizabeth edwards to be chosen as the head librarian elizabeth edwards career as a librarian spanned nearly 45 years she was not afraid to take on a challenge and was willing to relocate on short notice edwards was born in chattanooga tennessee in 1907 where she grew up and attended college at chattanooga university which later became the university of tennessee at chattanooga she got her degree in 1927 and entered the apprentice program at the chattanooga public library in 1928 she moved to new york to continue her training in library science at columbia university she completed studies at columbia and returned to chattanooga to work as the head cataloger for a year afterward she returned to the new york library system working at several different branches from 1931 1944 including the queens borough public library and kingsbridge branch of the nyc public library just before coming to oak ridge to be our first librarian in 1944 elizabeth edwards and her mother made the move to 102 union road in oak ridge the house was decorated with items from their travels to italy france and england her father had been a prominent jeweler in chattanooga and the family had taken many trips abroad before his passing in 1925 passport records indicate that she traveled overseas on her own several times as well the house was also home to a top of the line sewing machine on which elizabeth and her mother both talented seamstresses made all their own clothes working at a large metropolitan library like queens new york gave edwards experience managing a busy library with a high circulation rate surprisingly the pace of activity in oak ridge surpassed that of queens oak ridge s population hit its highest level in may of 1945 with just over 75 000 living here the same year queens had a population of 61 000 the library like the rest of the town was built with a wartime sense of urgency and elizabeth edwards had to develop this new library from the ground up shortly after arriving edwards began writing a column for the local newspaper the oak ridge journal the column was called bookworm club and it was used to report on the happenings of the library as it was developing and later to announce the arrival of new materials to the library while still in new york edwards had ordered several thousand books to be delivered to oak ridge the demand for books was high and prior to her arrival the library committee had begun asking for book donations from private citizens edwards also called for volunteers to help set up the library girl scouts assisted with shelf labels as well as unpacking and shelving books the library opened its doors in late may of 1944 and was fully open for checking out books by june 5 1944 the first library was located on the corner of kentucky and tennessee avenues the number of books in stock on opening day was about 1 700 most of them donations from citizens but by august of 1945 it had grown to nearly 10 000 it was still a small collection for a town of 75 000 but nonetheless very impressive considering the circumstances and wartime funding limitations by 1948 the holdings would be right at 35 000 titles while at oak ridge elizabeth edwards also started the mobile book program which helped to get the books out to people who couldn t easily get to the library not everyone had cars and public transportation could be hectic in april 1945 the traveling library began using a converted army jeep to haul the books typically all the residential areas were visited every two weeks although the main library was not segregated many african americans did not feel comfortable using it and instead took advantage of the mobile service later in 1949 a book return deposit was installed in the gamble valley recreation center to further extend services to the black community this mobile book service was something elizabeth edwards continued to employ at the other libraries she directed during her time in oak ridge edwards recalled ordering a book why not split the atom a week later a man she was later to know as a special government agent came to tell her the book was lost on the bus when she told him she would call the bus company to try to locate it he said to her miss edwards that book is lost on the bus and it is going to stay lost do you understand he came back several times to check the card file and several other books were lost on the bus miss edwards modest about her scientific background admits that she began to get a glimmering of what was going on in oak ridge she worked at oak ridge for slightly less than two years before returning to chattanooga where she would be the director of the chattanooga public library for the next 20 years under her watch the book stocks and patrons increased greatly the chattanooga library desegregated in 1949 by allowing black high school students to come study and within two years they encouraged black adults and young children to visit as well after some tension and differences of opinion with the chattanooga library board edwards resigned her post and left chattanooga in 1966 the community was sad to see her go and gave her a big going away party although she resigned under stress she had no ill feelings about chattanooga as a whole and still had a great fondness for her library patrons and staff after leaving chattanooga she took a position with the rolling prairie library in decatur illinois this system was still new having only been established a year earlier the rolling library was a large network of mobile book services which also included framed art prints 8mm and 16mm film books by mail and continuing education programs edwards was instrumental in helping to get the rolling prairie library operation running smoothly after retiring from the rolling prairie library in 1971 elizabeth moved back to her hometown of chattanooga where she enjoyed her retirement cooking sewing and being active in local politics she passed away in 1990 in closing i would like to share a story that elizabeth edwards told as she was reflecting on her time in oak ridge one hot day my car broke down and i waited 40 minutes on a bus there was a cloudburst and everyone was dripping wet an excited woman boarded the bus and announced i just heard over the radio that oak ridge was making atomic bombs the other passengers looked at her coldly as if she were a spy finally i screwed up my courage to ask her what she had heard however that was all she knew she d had to run for the bus just as the news was released but as soon as i reached the library all the youngsters were crowding around eagerly grabbing and relaying every bit of the momentous news they could and i guess it was the most exciting day of my life thanks mike for a look back at the early years of oak ridge public library and the insights into the life of elizabeth edwards

has been slammed online for whining about aussie bagels tiktoker ashleigh who lives in tasmania said the bagels were sad and dense many aussies reacted by commenting about us gun violence and healthcare ashleigh responded by saying it s disappointing gun violence was brought up she had to turn on filters for shooting guns to have the comments removed an american expat living in tasmania who was lambasted online for complaining about our sad and dense bagels when her home country is dealing with a gun violence crisis has defended her tongue in cheek video tiktoker ashleigh who goes by the name coffeeenut online moved from new york to tasmania for university and noticed the bagels down under taste different compared to the us things in australia that genuinely do not make any sense at all to an american who just moved the bagels moving on she said ashleigh blasted aussie bagels for being so sad and dense but said our coffee culture was worth the move tiktoker ashleigh who goes by the name coffeeenut online moved from new york to tasmania for university and noticed the bagels down under taste different compared to the us ashleigh s comments didn t sit well with some aussies who began comparing her complaint to america s gun violence and wildly expensive healthcare she has responded to what was only meant to be a light hearted video by claiming she is sad and disappointed by the response on a video that was only meant to be about bagels i had to turn on tiktok filters for words like shooting guns and shot i get that people are hurt and upset about what is going on in the us and rightfully so but a tiktok on bagels is not the outlet for that i m used to people making all the classic american jokes on me but this was too far she told femail at the end of the day it s just bread i m overall really loving australia and am really happy with my move i think it s fun to compare and share my experiences between both countries especially if it s over light hearted

video by claiming she is sad and disappointed by the response on a video that was only meant to be about bagels i think the biggest differences are with the work life balance in the north east of the us there s this really toxic hustle culture where you re made to feel that if you aren t doing five things at once you aren t good enough she said whereas here in australia as well as what i noticed when i lived in nz is that people are a lot more relaxed here people actually take weekends and close their laptops at 5pm i m not used to being told it s okay to take a weekend for example in the us a lot of people fear they will lose their job if they have to take time off due to an illness ashleigh feels her move to oz has been a healthy adjustment because she s been forced to slow down there s of course other quirky differences like slang i never struggled so hard to understand english in my entire life since moving here she said ashleigh s bagel video went viral earlier this week which is when she started to receive some negative feedback from australians there s slang and then some slang is shortened further but if you don t even understand what the original slang is you won t get the shortened one i ve been told the mainland has a lot more of that ashleigh s bagel video went viral earlier this week which is when she started to receive some negative feedback from australians i ll tell you what doesn t make sense for australian people in america guns wrote one commenter on tiktok another commented well i am amazed that americans can buy guns but not a kinder surprise because

one american said what a thing to say to someone over a bagel seriously we don t have the best coffee but someone is right to criticise it in my opinion lol i wish we could get better coffee here love australians getting so offended and using this person s dislike for bagels as a scapegoat for school shootings as if this person is saying school shootings are ok and bagels are not said a second user she was being humourous people a tasmanian resident stressed before adding she s right australian bagels do suck i loved discovering bagels when i visited the us in the us bagels are a popular breakfast option that are often topped with cream cheese and butter but australians prefer bacon and egg rolls or avocado on toast along with a coffee first thing in the morning rather than a bagel

washington president joe biden called on congress to pass gun control legislation in a speech at the white house thursday evening following mass shootings in new york texas and oklahoma during the last three weeks this isn t about taking away anyone s rights this is about protecting children biden said how much more carnage are we willing to accept the plea came after a white supremacist killed 10 black people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighborhood in buffalo new york on may 14 ten days later an elementary school in uvalde texas was attacked by an 18 year old man armed with a rifle and 19 children and two teachers were killed another mass shooting at a hospital in tulsa oklahoma on wednesday night left four dead biden said congress should ban assault weapons like the ones used in the recent mass shootings and if congress could not agree to ban them biden said the age to purchase an assault weapon should be raised from 18 to 21 he also expressed his support for laws that would safely store guns in homes where children live and for an end to the liability shield that prevents civil lawsuits from being brought against gun manufacturers the gun industry special protections are outrageous biden said it must end firearm related injuries are now the leading cause of death for children and adolescents in the united states according to the new england journal of medicine protecting our kids act at the same time biden spoke at the white house the u s house judiciary committee passed a gun control package on a party line vote 25 19 following a heated all day markup called on an emergency basis by democrats after the recent spate of gun violence both the house and senate are in recess the legislation h r 7910 known as the protecting our kids act is made up of eight bills related to gun control all first introduced in 2021 by democratic lawmakers it s expected to be on the house floor next week while the legislation is expected to pass a democrat controlled house it s unlikely to advance in the evenly divided senate where a small bipartisan group of senators is discussing more limited measures the house gun control package would raise the age of purchasing semiautomatic rifles from 18 to 21 create new requirements for storing guns in a home with children prevent gun trafficking require all firearms to be traceable and close the loophole on bump stocks devices that increase the rate of fire of semiautomatic weapons among other things republicans on the committee raised repeated objections to the bill blaming mental health problems and a lack of family values as the reasons for the recent mass shootings they criticized democrats for rushing to pass legislation this is no rush action rep steve cohen d tenn responded this has been delayed for decades he said all the provisions in the bill should be law today cohen added that assault weapons which are typically used in mass shootings were banned from 1994 until the law expired in 2004 republicans submitted 10 amendments to the bill only one was accepted by republican rep thomas massie of kentucky the amendment would require the attorney general to submit a report to the house and senate judiciary committees and to collect the demographic data of persons who were determined to be ineligible to purchase a firearm based on a background check performed by the national instant criminal background check system including race ethnicity national origin sex gender age disability average annual income and english language proficiency if available wisconsin shooting even while house members fought over gun control more gun violence broke out in wisconsin where five people were shot while attending a funeral as we sit here there are multiple shots near racine wisconsin rep sheila jackson lee a texas democrat said it is obscene one mass shooting after another jamie raskin a maryland democrat said mass shootings did not start with buffalo he argued that congress has had since the columbine shooting in colorado in 1999 to do something about gun control but rep chip roy r texas called the markup a crap proceeding saying republicans did not have enough time to prepare he said that the goal of democrats was to disarm the american people georgia democratic reps lucy mcbath and hank johnson countered that americans want commonsense gun control laws mcbath who became a gun safety advocate after her son jordan was shot and killed argued about so called red flag laws with florida republican rep matt gaetz red flag laws allow the courts or law enforcement to temporarily remove a firearm from an individual who is adjudged to pose a threat to themselves or others colorado has its own red flag law gaetz submitted an amendment to insert a line into the bill that affirms that congress disfavors the enactment of laws that authorize a court to issue an extreme risk protection order also known as red flag laws in the states because such laws trample on an individual s due process and second amendment rights but mcbath said that there is support for red flag laws including from law enforcement because they are tools to temporarily remove firearms from people in distress don t you dare try to tout that red flag laws don t count mcbath said arguing that without the laws many people s hands are tied when they want to remove a firearm from a loved one rep cliff bentz an oregon republican said that the bills before the committee would not immediately end school shootings each one of these will not help now he said these things will be challenged in the courts and nothing will happen for these kids he criticized democrats for not reaching out to republicans to work on bipartisan legislation florida republican shows off firearms rep greg steube a florida republican who participated in the markup virtually brandished several of his guns and argued that they would be banned under the proposed laws in the legislative package i hope the gun is not loaded jackson lee said i m at my house i can do whatever i want with my guns steube said the chair of the judiciary committee jerry nadler d n y asked steube if he would answer questions which he declined republican rep mike johnson of louisiana blamed secularization for mass shootings and republican rep tom tiffany of wisconsin said gun violence came down to family values tiffany accused democrats of trying to repeal the second amendment and would not engage with his democratic colleagues who tried to debate him rep madeleine dean d penn said she was horrified by the rhetoric from republicans on the committee and said that they were more concerned with protecting guns than with the victims of gun violence where is the outrage over the slaughter of 19 kids and two school teachers she said dean said that the second amendment has been idolized by republicans do you think the founding fathers were picturing ar style weapons she said school safety gop lawmakers like gaetz and tom mcclintock of california argued that gun free zones were actually dangerous and that guns should be allowed on school grounds so armed law enforcement could protect students perhaps outrage isn t the best way to write a bill gaetz said rep steve chabot an ohio republican said that what lawmakers could do immediately is work to make schools safer such as using funds to hire more resource officers and install metal detectors in schools that s one area where we could be working for common ground he said separately house speaker nancy pelosi said the house will take up a bill to ban assault rifles sometime next week when lawmakers return from recess while it will likely pass the house it has no chance of getting through an evenly divided senate where the legislation would need 10 republicans to join all democrats to advance blaming the gun for what is happening in america is small minded rep ken buck of colorado pelosi said the house also will vote on mcbath s legislation on red flag laws the federal extreme risk protection order act or h r 2377 as we go down this path it is our responsibility to keep gun violence front and center in the media so that strengthened by public opinion we can get life saving legislation over the finish line pelosi said in a statement to all those in the congress who would stand in the way of saving lives your political survival is insignificant compared to the survival of our children we will not rest until the job is done pelosi said the house will also vote on rep david cicilline s active shooter alert act or h r 6538 which creates a notification alert system during a mass shooting the bill by the rhode island democrat has 14 republican co sponsors assault style weapons none of the bills debated in the house judiciary markup would ban assault style weapons which were used in the new york texas and oklahoma shootings pelosi said a hearing on an assault weapons ban will be held but did not set a date jackson lee said that democrats are not done and that there needs to be a ban on assault weapons but the top republican on the committee jim jordan of ohio said the emergency markup seemed more of political theater and is not a real attempt in my judgment to solve solutions jordan said that the gun control package is a radical attempt to enact federal control over law abiding citizens republican reps andy biggs of arizona and dan bishop of north carolina echoed similar sentiments blaming the gun for what is happening in america is small minded rep ken buck a colorado republican said
