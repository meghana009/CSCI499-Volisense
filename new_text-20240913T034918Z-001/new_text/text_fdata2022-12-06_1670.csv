as oregonians scramble to purchase firearms before the state s new gun regulations go into effect some gun shops are using a loophole to potentially bypass background checks and sell firearms to anyone including to people who might not qualify to legally own them measure 114 which was narrowly approved by voters last month will tighten oregon s gun regulations due to go into effect on dec 8 it will ban magazines that hold more than 10 bullets and require gun owners to acquire a permit and undergo training before purchasing a firearm since the measure passed gun shops have faced a surge in demand under current law purchasers are required to pass a background check before buying a gun but oregon state police which process those is overwhelmed with a backlog of requests that could take months to process under a federal loophole if a background check is not processed in three days dealers can legally sell a gun rifle or semi automatic weapon the owner of a gun store in tigard who spoke to the capital chronicle on the condition of anonymity said he s no longer waiting for background check to clear he said he and some other gun shop owners he knows are completing all sales no matter the weapons sold unless oregon state police determine a customer has failed a background check within three business days he said he s sold about 500 firearms this way all the people releasing these firearms we re not happy about this but we don t have a choice the dealer said other gun shops are openly advertising the loophole to encourage sales j b firearms in beaverton announced on nov 20 in a popular gun blog that it would invoke what it called a nuclear option to speed up the process in the post on the northwest firearms message board the store encouraged customers to buy a weapon submit information for the background check and return three days later but before thursday dec 7 to pick up their purchases we also invite and encourage all other oregon federal firearms licensees to join us in adopting this policy the store said in its announcement if this state wants to take us down we believe we should go out with a bang not a whimper the policy is controversial within oregon s gun industry according to interviews with five gun dealers across oregon and sometimes fierce debate in gun advocates facebook groups but the push for sales underscores the concern among many sellers and buyers who fear the new law will curtail firearm sales until officials implement measure 114 s permit system it could take months for the oregon state police to set up this new system it s unclear how many firearm dealers are selling weapons to customers after three days while the background check is pending lars dalseide a spokesperson for the national rifle association would not say whether he thinks store owners should do so neither would kevin starrett of the oregon firearms federation a plaintiff in a legal challenge to measure 114 it s also unclear what would happen if a customer bought a gun and later failed a background check in those cases the agency currently notifies local law enforcement and the dealer that sold the firearm according to kyle kennedy a spokesperson for osp but law enforcement agencies have limited resources and might not be able to recover firearms sold to people who fail background checks said daniel webster a professor and researcher at the johns hopkins center for gun violence solutions in maryland he said agencies would probably have to prioritize disarming dangerous people such as those convicted of violent crimes a spokesperson for the beaverton police department did not respond when asked twice whether oregon state police had sent any such notifications some oregon sheriffs have said they won t prioritize enforcing oregon s new gun regulations linn county sheriff michelle duncan said in a statement on facebook that her office will not enforce measure 114 s magazine capacity limits calling it a terrible law for gun owners crime victims and public safety the charleston loophole some researchers and gun control advocates say the three day rule gives dealers the power to skirt background checks that are required across the country oregon and federal law bar customers with criminal histories arrest warrants mental health commitments or those who have other issues from purchasing a gun the background checks also apply to private transfers of firearms except between close family members according to a spokesperson for the oregon firearms federation gun control advocates call the three day rule the charleston loophole named after a horrific 2015 mass shooting in charleston south carolina when 21 year old white supremacist dylann roof illegally obtained a firearm before the background check was complete and killed nine worshippers at a church measure 114 will close the loophole by requiring a permit system gun proponents in oregon say that in the meantime the loophole is legal if the gun grabbers don t like it it s their own fault for creating the emergency it s very very legal john price an administrator of the gun advocacy group good guys with guns oregon said on facebook an employee at j b firearms who declined to be named said plenty of stores were selling firearms after three days not all gun dealers are doing so however carlos ortegon who manages the gun shop umpqua survival in roseburg said he s turning down customers asking him to honor the rule because he won t risk arming people who might fail their background check he thinks shop owners shouldn t engage in the practice they re risking putting guns in people s hands who should not have them he said ray gunter owner of emerald valley armory in creswell said he s not selling firearms until someone passes a background check because doing otherwise might be illegal he echoed concerns from several other gun store proprietors that the policy might open them up to legal liability and license seizure but like the four other gun dealers interviewed for this story he expressed a deep frustration with the background check backlog at oregon state police its firearms instant check system unit received more than 48 000 requests for a background check between nov 9 and 22 according to the agency s data the surge has slashed its rate of ruling on a background check within three days from 84 between 2018 and nov 8 election day to 61 between election day and thanksgiving kennedy said oregon state police are now delaying all new requests for background checks starrett of the oregon firearms federation said he s not sure when the three day period technically begins when the gun dealer submits the background check or when state police notify the dealer that they ve started looking at it the latter case would narrow the rule s application to a smaller group of customers that confuses some gun shop owners and managers including gunter in creswell he said he s not taking advantage of the three day rule but might consider changing his policy if he had more clarity he said unintended consequences the store owner in tigard said smaller dealers needed to adopt the three day sales policy to survive several gun stores have already announced they will close in the coming months including gunrunner arms in junction city on its website the store blamed uncertainty around measure 114 and the current backlog for its expected closure with the source of our income being outlawed we will not be able to stay open past the first of the year its website reads at the outdoorsman in ontario owner julie clark is turning away all customers seeking a new gun despite the financial risk of getting stuck with her inventory clark is considering transferring her stock across the border to idaho and setting up shop there at a big expense she said webster the johns hopkins researcher said measure 114 s intent to make firearm sales safer in oregon could be blunted if enough oregon gun shops bypass background checks to me it underscores why you need a licensing system he said by grand stringer photo by connor radnovich both of oregon capital chronicle

the expedited legislation passed by congress to avert a strike by railroad unions dealt one more blow in the decades long war waged by the two ruling parties against the working class by chris hedges scheerpost com the congressional decision to prohibit railroad workers from going on strike and force them to accept a contract that meets few of their demands is part of the class war that has defined american politics for decades the two ruling political parties differ only in rhetoric they are bonded in their determination to reduce wages dismantle social programs which the bill clinton administration did with welfare and thwart unions and prohibit strikes the only tool workers have to pressure employers this latest move against the railroad unions where working conditions have descended into a special kind of hell with massive layoffs the denial of even a single day of paid sick leave and punishing work schedules that include being forced to always be on call is one more blow to the working class and our anemic democracy the rage by workers towards the democratic party which once defended their interests is legitimate even if at times it is expressed by embracing proto fascists and donald trump like demagogues dating back to the clinton administration with nafta the greatest betrayal of the working class since the 1947 taft hartley act the democratic party has become a full partner in the corporate assault on workers the cloying feel your pain rhetoric a staple of the joe biden white house is offset by a hypocritical subservience to the billionaire class in 1926 the havoc wreaked by rail strikes led to the federal government passing the railway labor act to give itself the power to impose labor settlements on the rail industry the biden administration used this authority to broker a tentative labor agreement that would ensure a 24 percent pay increase by 2024 annual 1 000 bonuses and a freeze on rising health care costs but workers would be permitted only one paid personal day and no paid sick leave of 12 unions voting on the deal four of them representing 56 percent of union membership in the industry refused to ratify it biden signed the legislation into law on friday the railroad barons refuse to permit sick days because they have stripped the railroads down to skeleton crews in a process known as precision scheduled railroading or psr in essence no spare labor is available which is why the reduced labor force is subjected to such punishingly short periods of time off and onerous working conditions class struggle defines human history we are dominated by a seemingly omnipotent corporate elite hostile to our most basic rights this elite is disemboweling the nation destroying basic institutions that foster the common good including public schools the postal service and health care and is incapable of reforming itself the only weapon left to thwart this ongoing pillage is the strike donate today to cn s 2022 winter fund drive workers have the collective power to slash profits and cripple industry which is why the ruling class has gone to such lengths to defang unions and outlaw strikes a rail freight strike it is estimated would cost the u s economy 2 billion a day with daily losses increasing the longer a strike continued the few unions that remain only 10 7 percent of the workforce is unionized have been largely domesticated demoted into obsequious junior partners in the capitalist system as of january 2022 private sector unionization stood at its lowest point since the passage of the national labor relations act of 1935 and yet 48 percent of u s workers say they would like to belong to a union railroad workers have been especially hard hit the workforce has shrunk from nearly 540 000 in 1980 to some 130 000 today the consolidation of the rail industry means there are only seven class i freight companies with four of those companies controlling 83 percent of rail traffic service on the nation s rail lines along with working conditions and wages has deteriorated as wall street squeezes the big railroad conglomerates for greater and greater profits indeed the fragility of the rail system led to huge backlogs and delays during the pandemic the democrats insist they are the party of the working class joe biden calls himself a proud pro labor president but they pile up one empty promise after another in 2020 they promised for example that with control of the white house and both branches of congress they would pass a law to strengthen collective bargaining instead they revoked the collective bargaining power of one of the few unionized industries that retains it they promised to raise the minimum wage they failed they promised a national paid family and medical leave program allowing all employees to take up to 12 weeks of paid time off it never happened they promised to impose a federal tax rate on corporations ranging from 21 percent to 28 percent so that wealthy americans and big corporations pay their fair share the proposed tax increase was scuttled they promised to pass legislation to ensure that super pacs are wholly independent of campaigns and political parties it went nowhere they then mounted a midterm election campaign which cost both parties a staggering 16 7 billion and was funded by massive infusions of pac money saying the right thing doing the wrong thing the democrats routinely say the right thing and do the wrong thing and this is true for its tiny progressive minority which dutifully votes to funnel billions to the war industry including the war in ukraine alexandria ocasio cortez and most other progressive house members voted for the anti union legislation while also voting for a separate resolution that would have given rail workers seven days of paid sick leave the unions were demanding 14 the second resolution died in the senate as they knew it would leaving workers with a woefully inadequate pro management deal that over half of them had already rejected to his credit bernie sanders voted against the bill when the sick leave amendment from the house which he backed was rejected in the senate why does any legislator believe railroad workers should be forced to use what few vacation days they may have if they fall sick and request permission to be absent days in advance as if illnesses are scheduled events congress members and their staff do not work under these conditions in a statement that perfectly captured the yawning gap between democratic party rhetoric and behavior binyamin appelbaum the lead writer on economics and business for the new york times editorial board wrote in the newspaper house speaker nancy pelosi denounced railroad companies as rapacious profiteers who have been selling out to wall street to boost their bottom lines making obscene profits while demanding more and more from railroad workers then just one sentence later she announced that house democrats would stand with the profiteers what are we to make of a congress that refuses to support a single day of paid sick leave for 115 000 freight railroad workers while the combined net income of the railroad industry is 27 billion double what it was in 2013 what are we to make of a congress that in its latest military policy legislation sets the appropriation at 45 billion above the pentagon s request what are we to make of a congress that refuses to pass gun control legislation despite 600 mass shootings this year more than one per day what are we to make of a congress that defunds the internal revenue service making it only practical to investigate those earning middle and lower incomes and near impossible to investigate tens of billions of dollars in tax evasion by corporations and the rich what are we to make of a congress that rewrites the tax code on behalf of lobbyists so 55 of the largest corporations that collectively made over 40 billion in pre tax income in 2020 paid no federal income tax and received 3 5 billion in tax rebates what are we to make of a congress more than half of whose members are millionaires who flagrantly use their committee assignments inside knowledge of proposed legislation and classified intelligence reports to carry out insider trading to increase their wealth house speaker nancy pelosi s husband invested millions of dollars in computer chip stocks as the democratic leadership was formulating a plan to subsidize the chip manufacturing industry a natural antagonism most political theorists including aristotle niccolò machiavelli alexis de tocqueville adam smith karl marx karl polanyi and max weber started from the premise that there is a natural antagonism between owners and workers they understood that if the oligarchs shook off all restraints to the accumulation of wealth it would destroy the political order the ruling class masks its greed behind ideologies in our nation s case free market capitalism and neoliberal globalization neoliberalism never made any economic sense but it was disseminated by compliant academics the media and political theorists because to quote marx it allowed the dominant material relationships to be grasped as ideas we americans are not usually thought to be a submissive people but of course we are wendell berry wrote why else would we allow our country to be destroyed why else would we be rewarding its destroyers why else would we all by proxies we have given to greedy corporations and corrupt politicians be participating in its destruction most of us are still too sane to piss in our own cistern but we allow others to do so and we reward them for it we reward them so well in fact that those who piss in our cistern are wealthier than the rest of us how do we submit by not being radical enough or by not being thorough enough which is the same thing all the advances we made in the early 20th century through union strikes government regulation the new deal a fair tax code the courts an alternative press and mass movements have been reversed the oligarchs are turning american workers as they did in the 19th century steel and textile factories into serfs kept in check by onerous anti union laws militarized police the world s largest prison system an electoral system dominated by corporate money and the most pervasive security and surveillance apparatus in human history the rich throughout history have subjugated and re subjugated the populations they control and the public throughout history has awakened to the class war waged by the oligarchs and plutocrats and revolted let us hope that defying congress freight railroad workers carry out a strike a strike will at least expose the fangs of the ruling class the courts law enforcement and the national guard much as they did during labor unrest in the 20th century and broadcast a very public message about whose interests they serve besides a strike might work nothing

veteran potato salesman ken gad of cambridge farms which is based in south easton ma admits that the current potato marketing situation is very difficult to judge i m going right down the middle he said i usually have a strong opinion about what is happening and what is going to happen but this year i just can t put my finger on it speaking to the produce news the week before thanksgiving gad revealed the seemingly contradictory situations that were taking place here it is the friday before thanksgiving and i can buy all the potatoes i want he said usually its very difficult to get a load on this day but this year it s different i have talked to a number of sheds that aren t even packing today but what makes the situation so perplexing is that even though the demand appears to be down the price of potatoes keeps going up a month ago on oct 14 i paid a net price of 9 75 fob on a load of 100 count he recalled this week exactly 30 days later i paid 17 75 for that same pack history tells gad the price can t continue to rise it has to back down a little bit but he is not willing to stick on that prediction for very long i m not an economist and i m not a scholar but i am scratching my head to try to figure this thing out gad who is the owner of cambridge farms noted that the company started 39 years ago as a buying broker and consolidator his business model involved buying potatoes in bulk from maine and other districts including throughout eastern canada shipping those potatoes to his facility in massachusetts and selling them to retailers and repackers on the east coast we were a day closer and because i bought in bulk i could beat the freight rates coming from the point of origin he would partner with repackers and was able to sell retailers exactly what they wanted and get it to them quickly over the years gad said the model changed as packing sheds began offering more options and more packs to retailers about a dozen years ago we closed down our facility here in massachusetts it was no longer economically rational it s better to be a straight buying broker he still has connections with potato farms all over the country that he talks to on a regular basis that gives gad the knowledge to be an authority on potatoes and have his finger on the pulse of the industry all the time but not this year things are different the number one factor causing an unsettled situation is the economy and inflation gad stays away from the politics of it and is not willing to blame one political party or the other or the legislators across the country he notes that it is a fact that there are rising prices on everything and that needs to settle out before things settle down on the one hand he said it is a good thing that wages are going up and the people at the bottom end of the wage continuum are getting more money and can feed their families but on the other hand he wonders what they ve gained if the cost of everything they buy is also higher but he admits the cost of food has to be higher because the cost of inputs has gone through the roof the cost of seed is 10 to 25 percent more than last year fertilizer is three times more than it was a year ago and labor costs are off the charts those costs aren t coming down he said he estimated that the cost of growing an acre of potatoes has gone up 30 to 50 percent over the past two years you can t expect to buy those potatoes for the savme price you were paying he quipped in that regard gad does know the direction the market is going while current prices are historically high he said the overall potato situation points to a continuation of that trend reports are that idaho is down about 35 000 acres which they say is about 8 percent you can t do that and not feel it he said noting that processing stocks are way down which creates a demand for table stock potatoes and a further increase in the market price maine he said has a good crop this year and growers should expect good returns even if they come down a bit gad said pound for pound potatoes are about the most economical purchase a consumer can buy in the grocery store in times of economic downturns he said potatoes typically do well

electricity costs for residential customers of we energies will increase by 11 in january after the state public service commission approved a rate increase that kept the utility s profit rate well above the national average the psc on thursday voted to approve the rate increase for we energies customers the increase for residential customers is higher than it needed to be and came despite a wave of customer outcry voiced at public hearings this fall and in comments filed with the psc the psc commissioners had a chance to bring down the size of this increase even further and missed an opportunity to limit this to a single digit increase for residential customers said tom content executive director of the citizens utility board of wisconsin it s disappointing because customers were so vocal in coming out to oppose a double digit rate hike at the hearings more than 1 100 we energies customers filed online comments objecting to the rate hike and scores of people spoke out at public hearings in milwaukee in october the psc also failed to significantly reduce the utility s return on equity or profit rate the psc which regulates monopoly utilities hadn t had an opportunity to analyze the we energies profit rate in more than a decade cub s experts in the case concluded that the current we energies profit rate of 10 is far higher than what is needed to attract capital from investors and it s also well above the national average cub called for the profit rate to drop to 9 in order to provide more balance between shareholders investing in the company s stock and the customers who have to foot the bill to sustain these profits the psc ultimately decided in a 2 to 1 vote to reduce the we energies and wisconsin gas profit rates to 9 8 percent that will produce savings of nearly 15 million for customers over the next two years but it didn t go far enough regulators seem more interested in keeping wisconsin s gold plated rating as a friendly place for utility investors than they are in keeping costs affordable for the customers paying the bills said tom content cub executive director utility customers across the country are over paying for energy services to the tune of billions of dollars every year and unfortunately this decision keeps that inequity in place from cub s point of view content added a big takeaway from this case is that we need more balance and more attention paid to concerns of customers and their challenges at this time of rising costs some of the increases that we energies sought couldn t be avoided including spiraling natural gas and surging coal costs as well as money the utility is investing in new power plants but the psc did find other ways to trim the utility s overall request unfortunately the psc sided with big business in requiring residential and small business customers to shoulder a much bigger share of the looming increase during a lengthy hearing on thursday the psc took a different approach than cub expected by not approving a settlement that cub and other groups had reached with the utility walnut way conservation corp in milwaukee s lindsay heights neighborhood and clean wisconsin had objected to the settlement the commission ultimately approved some elements of the settlement some highlights write offs utility shareholders rather than customers will have to foot the bill for millions of dollars of customer late fees and overdue bills that resulted from the state canceling customer shutoffs during the covid 19 public health emergency customer charge the fixed charge for we energies customers will drop from 16 a month to 15 a month in line with most other big utilities in the state high fixed charges penalize customers who don t use much energy and those who take steps to pare back their energy use through energy efficiency measures or by adding solar panels low income help the psc agreed to extend a forgiveness program for low income customers who are behind on their bills the agency will evaluate changes to that program which cub helped we energies design during 2023 the psc also opened the door for we energies to create a low income discount pilot program for low income customers incentives for savings on hot summer days we energies will create a new program to control participating customers energy use on hot summer days customers who participate will receive a discount from the utility but the psc removed a provision that would have refinanced a portion of the expenses linked to the oak creek coal fired power plant that is poised to retire in the coming years cub views refinancing these costs as fundamental step to make the ongoing energy transition affordable for customers cub continues to believe that making customers continue to shoulder costs for coal plants long after they shut down is not the right approach for wisconsin said content with that in mind it s time for the legislature to give state energy regulators more tools to bring down these costs overall the psc s decision on thursday signaled that the agency and its auditors will be looking to scrutinize utility expenses carefully especially during this period of escalating cost pressures this is particularly important for customers of we energies which had the highest residential bills for any wisconsin investor owned utility at the end of 2021 we energies and all utilities are on notice they will need to sharpen their pencils and look for ways to cut costs wherever they can to offset increases in other areas content said

well ben doctors tell me hospitals aren t being overrun with cases but the spike is making it difficult to find certain medications the flu rsv and other resparitory illnesses skyrocketing after a two year hiatus doctors saying covid restrictions are largely the reason for the two year case slump flu disappeared right off the map completely this year those illneses are making up for lost time we expect flu for example to really ramp up in january february and we now see it ramping up in november and now being kind of full force in december with high rates massachusetts is no different showing a spike in cases one month earlier than in 2019 the cdc now considered the state to have high flu activity all those cases making some medicines particularly ones for kids hard to come by we ve seen a shortage in kids antibiotics especially buhran patel is the ceo and president of pelmeds pharmacy he says pharmacists have noticed the shortage for about a month and says it could get worse a lot of folks are going to travel during christmas who knows what s going to happen with all the travel and flu season hasn t really even hit its mark yet doctors say it s essential to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the flu given the spike in resparitory illnesse advertisement here s what to do if you can t find children s tylenol or motrin right now share copy link copy as fears of a tripledemic are realized and cases of rsv flu and covid 19 soar across the country many parents are reporting trouble finding children s tylenol motrin and other fever reducing medications in stores and online amazon has limited stock while walgreens and cvs websites are continuously out of stock but is there a shortage of children s tylenol motrin and similar medications if you re having difficulty finding children s over the counter fever reducers you re not alone but as far as a shortage is concerned the answer is actually a little complicated here s what you need to know is there a shortage of children s tylenol and motrin it depends on who you ask the food and drug administration shares information online about drug shortages that have been reported to the agency currently the fda is not reporting any shortages of children s tylenol or its generic name acetaminophen and there are also no reports of shortages of children s motrin or its generic name ibuprofen but the american society of health system pharmacists which analyzes information from manufacturers and other sources notes that some forms of oral ibuprofen are in shortage the organization also lists acetaminophen suppositories as being in shortage but it s important to note most children take the medication orally ashp tends to be slightly ahead of the fda reporting on shortages says stephanie field m b a director of pharmacy business operations at corewell health west if ashp shares it then it will soon be on the fda list doctors have witnessed the shortage as well ibuprofen liquid and chewable tablets have been difficult to obtain says joanna young pharm d clinical pharmacy specialist at connecticut children s medical center acetaminophen suppositories and liquid have also been difficult to obtain michael bauer m d medical director and pediatrician at northwestern medicine lake forest hospital agrees despite no official shortage of these medications there are some local shortages of these medications reported by our clinicians and families seeking them he says as a result young says we have taken several measures to try to ensure we can still supply to all of our patients for example we have recommended that providers use chewable tablets when able to reserve the liquid for patients that are not able to use tablets such as infants why is it hard to find children s tylenol and motrin right now since there s no official shortage it s hard to know for sure however there are a few theories tylenol is used regularly to treat fevers in pediatrics and there is an increase in pediatric illness as we have seen with rsv field says people may also be buying more of these medications to be prepared in case their child becomes sick says danelle fisher m d a pediatrician and chair of pediatrics at providence saint john s health center in santa monica ca people are buying it because they re nervous and seeing more respiratory illness in other kids she says when there are times when you know things could get bad people tend to stock up is it ok to use adult tylenol and motrin for kids experts advise against this adult medications should not be used as an alternative field says why the dosage is different and it s easy to get it wrong when shifting from an adult dose to a pediatric dose fisher points out this makes me nervous because there can be an overdosage of acetaminophen which can affect the liver she says you want to be very careful with what you re doing fisher also notes this when we talk about adult doses it s not necessarily one to one with children s medications what should you do if you can t find children s tylenol or motrin fisher stresses that if your child has a fever you don t necessarily need to give them medication fever is not a bad thing it s a good thing dr fisher says it s an adaptive way of the body getting rid of whatever germs it has instead she recommends that you treat discomfort like if your child has a headache or feels achy tied to a fever that is worth treating fisher says but if your child is happy eating well and drinking well i don t care what the number is on the thermometer you don t have to treat it it s important to note that not all doctors share this outlook and not every child s health is the same be sure to consult your physician before making treatment decisions still there are a few other options for medication king suggests looking into pediatric chewable and oral dissolving tablets provided your child is old enough for these usually these are recommended for children ages two and up suppositories are also typically an option fisher says but some acetaminophen suppositories are currently in shortage per the ashp it s also possible to crush chewable tablets and give them in pudding apple juice or applesauce says jamie alan ph d associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at michigan state university she just recommends that you consult your pediatrician before going this route fisher recommends considering generic versions of your go to medications as well if they re available you do not have to have brand names you can have generic she says it s exactly the same active ingredients and if larger stores around you don t have the medication you need fisher recommends visiting smaller shops in your area sometimes the neighborhood stores don t have the shortages that the bigger stores do she says finally you can talk to your pediatrician or local pharmacist for advice field says they may be able to direct you to a store that has your medication in stock

electricity costs for customers of wisconsin public service will increase in january after the state public service commission approved a rate increase that kept the utility s profit rate well above the national average the psc on thursday voted to approve the rate increase for wps customers the increase for residential customers will be smaller than the 14 15 hike floated during public hearings held in downtown green bay in october based on the psc decision residential electricity costs will go up about 8 6 in january but the psc missed a big opportunity to find additional savings when it failed to significantly reduce the utility s return on equity or profit rate the state psc which regulates monopoly utilities hasn t analyzed the wps profit rate in nearly a decade cub s experts in the case concluded that the current wps profit rate of 10 is far higher than what is needed to attract capital from investors and it s also well above the national average cub called for the profit rate to drop to 9 1 in order to provide more balance between shareholders investing in the company s stock and the customers footing the bill to sustain these profits the psc ultimately decided to reduce the wps profit rate to 9 8 in a 2 to 1 vote regulators seem more interested in keeping wisconsin s gold plated rating as a friendly place for utility investors than they are in keeping costs affordable for the customers paying the bills said tom content cub executive director utility customers across the country are over paying for energy services to the tune of billions of dollars every year and unfortunately this decision keeps that inequity in place from cub s point of view content added a big takeaway from this case is that we need more balance and more attention paid to the customers and their challenges at this time of rising costs some of the increases that wps sought couldn t be avoided including spiraling natural gas and surging coal costs as well as money the utility is investing in new power plants but the psc did find other ways to trim the utility s overall request and it chose not to penalize residential and small business utility customers with an unfair cost burden as compared with big business no increase is easy to swallow but the fact that this is a single digit increase is significant after the outcry and comments made at the public hearings about the potential for an increase as high as 15 content said during a lengthy hearing on thursday the psc took a different approach than cub expected by not approving a settlement that customer groups had reached with the utility however the agency then approved several key elements of that settlement some highlights write offs utility shareholders rather than customers will foot the bill for millions of dollars of customer late fees and overdue bills that resulted from the state canceling customer shutoffs during the covid 19 public health emergency customer charge the fixed charge for wps customers will drop from 21 a month to 17 92 a month wps has had the highest fixed charge in the state for more than five years and cub has heard complaints from customers about this issue high fixed charges penalize customers who don t use much energy and those who take steps to pare back their energy use through energy efficiency measures or by adding solar panels low income help the psc agreed to extend a forgiveness program for low income customers who are behind on their bills the agency will evaluate changes to that program which cub helped wps design during 2023 the psc also opened the door for wps to create a low income discount pilot program for low income customers incentives for savings on hot summer days wps will create a new program to control participating customers energy use on hot summer days customers who participate will receive a discount from the utility residential customers complained at the public hearing about the discontinuance of a similar program several years ago and cub worked to bring this back the psc sent a strong signal to wps and all utilities with this decision during this escalating cost environment the commission s auditors and staff will be giving more scrutiny to utility costs and expenses and requests to increase prices content said all utilities will need to sharpen their pencils and look for ways to cut costs wherever they can to offset increases in other areas
some commenters have concluded that a town hall by disney ceo bob iger shows the company has rejected left wing lgbt politics but disney employees disagree in the town hall iger who returned to run the media empire told employees he didn t like the company being embroiled in controversy he answered several employee submitted questions about disney s political future it can be distracting and it can have a negative impact on the company and to the extent that i can work to quiet things down i m going to do that said iger iger replaced bob chapek disney s ceo from 2020 to 2022 before that iger served as disney s ceo from 2005 to 2020 but iger also reaffirmed his commitment to the left wing social agenda and the company s core values of inclusion and acceptance and tolerance we re certainly not going to lessen our core values in order to make everybody happy all the time he said at the town hall but iger s leadership decisions led to the company s fight with florida a longtime disney cast member as employees are called told the epoch times disney employee nick caturano poses with fellow cast members at walt disney world in orlando in an undated photo courtesy of nick caturano he himself chose to go political nick caturano said he himself steered the company in that direction and bob chapek just went the natural course of it since the shift in disney s company values disney has also seen a shift in stock value in the last year disney s stock price dropped from a high of 157 per share to 99 43 per share as of today according to the nasdaq a tale of two bobs of disney s 17 movies and shows with lgbt characters disney released eight during iger s tenure an additional film was planned for release in 2019 but got delayed iger attempted to please parents as well as activists by keeping a foot in both worlds caturano said they were offering or presenting themselves as a family friendly safe option at the same time while they were appeasing the wokeness and the activists by injecting things into its entertainment caturano said of his employer the number of lgbt films disney released doubled under chapek and company leaders announced they would push for the gay agenda in their film production as previously reported in two years under chapek disney released nine films with lgbt characters caturano noted that the company hasn t gone all in on lgbt film plot lines instead it started with tiny lgbt moments among extras then expanded to plot lines that put lgbt characters closer to center stage disney s latest animated feature film strange world bombed at the box office as previously reported the movie made under 20 million in its first five days in theater and cost disney between 180 million to 135 million to make caturano told the epoch times that disney designed this strategy to push the limits of what audiences would accept protesters rally in opposition to the walt disney company s stance against a recently passed florida law outside of the company s headquarters in burbank calif on april 6 2022 jill mclaughlin the epoch times a groomer doesn t come right out and do it they test the waters and if they test the waters and they get the response they re looking for then they wait for the next opportunity said caturano as i understand it that s how grooming works and that s what they appear to be doing he added that this grooming attempts to change the moral boundaries of not only children but also parents and society with strange world s failure disney may have momentarily received a hard no from audiences caturano said the company will probably push lgbt ideology later he said whatever the case caturano said he doesn t know if economic pressure will get disney to give up its social agenda they always push the envelope to shock people and they back down a little bit when the pushback is too much he said under iger s leadership disney threatened to cease its work in georgia if the state passed an abortion ban i don t see how it s practical for us to continue to shoot there iger told reuters in 2019 disney executive chairman bob iger attends the exclusive 100 minute sneak peek of peter jackson s the beatles get

times former disney employee stephen cribb one of several employees fired over conflicts about the covid 19 vaccine courtesy of stephen cribb disney employees who refused covid 19 vaccinations on religious grounds faced intense pressure he said cribb worked for disney for 19 years before the company fired him for refusing the vaccine when i wouldn t let them treat me differently they fired me

mackedon joined the company she said disney employees had to avoid tattoos wear makeup a certain way cut their fingernails short and obey restrictions on how they could cut their hair it was very professional and families appreciated that and they felt good bringing kids you go to the parks now and it s a crazy show it s incredible how much it s changed she said an anonymous disney employee provided the epoch times with a picture of a bearded man wearing a dress serving children the change in disney comes from both rank and file employees and executives mackedon said in some ways disney has changed to meet corporate demand for left wing entertainment but it has also changed because employees want to go woke she added this wokeness is partially business oriented but at the same time it s just in the spirit in the hearts of many people she said they truly support this stuff

well ben doctors tell me hospitals aren t being overrun with cases but the spike is making it difficult to find certain medications the flu rsv and other resparitory illnesses skyrocketing after a two year hiatus doctors saying covid restrictions are largely the reason for the two year case slump flu disappeared right off the map completely this year those illneses are making up for lost time we expect flu for example to really ramp up in january february and we now see it ramping up in november and now being kind of full force in december with high rates massachusetts is no different showing a spike in cases one month earlier than in 2019 the cdc now considered the state to have high flu activity all those cases making some medicines particularly ones for kids hard to come by we ve seen a shortage in kids antibiotics especially buhran patel is the ceo and president of pelmeds pharmacy he says pharmacists have noticed the shortage for about a month and says it could get worse a lot of folks are going to travel during christmas who knows what s going to happen with all the travel and flu season hasn t really even hit its mark yet doctors say it s essential to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the flu given the spike in resparitory illnesse advertisement here s what to do if you can t find children s tylenol or motrin right now share copy link copy as fears of a tripledemic are realized and cases of rsv flu and covid 19 soar across the country many parents are reporting trouble finding children s tylenol motrin and other fever reducing medications in stores and online amazon has limited stock while walgreens and cvs websites are continuously out of stock but is there a shortage of children s tylenol motrin and similar medications if you re having difficulty finding children s over the counter fever reducers you re not alone but as far as a shortage is concerned the answer is actually a little complicated here s what you need to know is there a shortage of children s tylenol and motrin it depends on who you ask the food and drug administration shares information online about drug shortages that have been reported to the agency currently the fda is not reporting any shortages of children s tylenol or its generic name acetaminophen and there are also no reports of shortages of children s motrin or its generic name ibuprofen but the american society of health system pharmacists which analyzes information from manufacturers and other sources notes that some forms of oral ibuprofen are in shortage the organization also lists acetaminophen suppositories as being in shortage but it s important to note most children take the medication orally ashp tends to be slightly ahead of the fda reporting on shortages says stephanie field m b a director of pharmacy business operations at corewell health west if ashp shares it then it will soon be on the fda list doctors have witnessed the shortage as well ibuprofen liquid and chewable tablets have been difficult to obtain says joanna young pharm d clinical pharmacy specialist at connecticut children s medical center acetaminophen suppositories and liquid have also been difficult to obtain michael bauer m d medical director and pediatrician at northwestern medicine lake forest hospital agrees despite no official shortage of these medications there are some local shortages of these medications reported by our clinicians and families seeking them he says as a result young says we have taken several measures to try to ensure we can still supply to all of our patients for example we have recommended that providers use chewable tablets when able to reserve the liquid for patients that are not able to use tablets such as infants why is it hard to find children s tylenol and motrin right now since there s no official shortage it s hard to know for sure however there are a few theories tylenol is used regularly to treat fevers in pediatrics and there is an increase in pediatric illness as we have seen with rsv field says people may also be buying more of these medications to be prepared in case their child becomes sick says danelle fisher m d a pediatrician and chair of pediatrics at providence saint john s health center in santa monica ca people are buying it because they re nervous and seeing more respiratory illness in other kids she says when there are times when you know things could get bad people tend to stock up is it ok to use adult tylenol and motrin for kids experts advise against this adult medications should not be used as an alternative field says why the dosage is different and it s easy to get it wrong when shifting from an adult dose to a pediatric dose fisher points out this makes me nervous because there can be an overdosage of acetaminophen which can affect the liver she says you want to be very careful with what you re doing fisher also notes this when we talk about adult doses it s not necessarily one to one with children s medications what should you do if you can t find children s tylenol or motrin fisher stresses that if your child has a fever you don t necessarily need to give them medication fever is not a bad thing it s a good thing dr fisher says it s an adaptive way of the body getting rid of whatever germs it has instead she recommends that you treat discomfort like if your child has a headache or feels achy tied to a fever that is worth treating fisher says but if your child is happy eating well and drinking well i don t care what the number is on the thermometer you don t have to treat it it s important to note that not all doctors share this outlook and not every child s health is the same be sure to consult your physician before making treatment decisions still there are a few other options for medication king suggests looking into pediatric chewable and oral dissolving tablets provided your child is old enough for these usually these are recommended for children ages two and up suppositories are also typically an option fisher says but some acetaminophen suppositories are currently in shortage per the ashp it s also possible to crush chewable tablets and give them in pudding apple juice or applesauce says jamie alan ph d associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at michigan state university she just recommends that you consult your pediatrician before going this route fisher recommends considering generic versions of your go to medications as well if they re available you do not have to have brand names you can have generic she says it s exactly the same active ingredients and if larger stores around you don t have the medication you need fisher recommends visiting smaller shops in your area sometimes the neighborhood stores don t have the shortages that the bigger stores do she says finally you can talk to your pediatrician or local pharmacist for advice field says they may be able to direct you to a store that has your medication in stock

us contract chipmaker globalfoundries plans to lay off as many as 800 employees proving that job security is not a foregone conclusion for a company that just reported record profits the new york based foundry business confirmed the intention to the register on monday citing a shaky economy despite its expectation that 2022 will be a banner year for the company and its hope to receive chip subsidies from uncle sam as part of a recent all employee meeting we shared the cost saving actions we are taking across our business in response to the current macroeconomic environment including reducing corporate and manufacturing overhead costs as well as selectively reducing our workforce by less than 800 employees globally before the end of the year globalfoundries said in a statement the planned job cuts amount to 5 7 percent of the company s 14 000 employees worldwide according to vermont publication vtdigger which first reported the news the layoffs comes after globalfoundries ceo thomas caufield told investors in early november that the company was planning to reduce operating expenses in response to macroeconomic uncertainty in addition to signals of lower demand from some customers in 2023 though it is difficult to take these actions during a year of record output we believe that taking these actions now enables us to continue to outperform the market regardless of the economic environment he said in last month s earnings call in other words to keep wall street pleased globalfoundries needs to sacrifice a good chunk of jobs caufield delivered these remarks as the chipmaker reported record profits and revenue in the third quarter which ended on september 30 our revenue grew 22 percent year over year and we delivered record gross operating and net profits making significant progress towards our long term financial model we remain on track to deliver a strong year of growth and profitability caufield said in a canned statement according to vtdigger globalfoundries executives were silent at the recent all hands meeting in response to multiple questions about why the company couldn t prevent layoffs with its recent profits the layoffs are expected to mostly impact non manufacturing positions such as executives caufield told employees at the meeting vtdigger reported globalfoundries has been performing so well recently that in september it joined the philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index which ranks the 30 largest semiconductor companies listed in the us by market capitalization the chipmaker which spun off from amd in 2009 is also making the cuts as it receives 30 million in federal funding to develop next generation gallium nitride on silicon technology for a range of applications including 5g smartphones rf wireless infrastructure electric vehicles and power grids the company is hoping too that it can get a share of the 52 billion in manufacturing subsidies that were approved by congress as part of the chips and science act globalfoundries shares the same concerns as many other semiconductor companies about how a withering economy beset by the covid 19 pandemic military conflict and the us china trade war will lower demand but it gives us great pause when squaring the company s layoff plans with its recent strong performance combined with it receiving tens of millions in taxpayer money plus potentially more it s also worth noting that the company s situation runs in contrast to intel which announced an intent in late october to make layoffs and cut spending by billions of dollars after reporting a 20 percent year over year decline in revenue and an 85 percent dip in profits for the third quarter

well ben doctors tell me hospitals aren t being overrun with cases but the spike is making it difficult to find certain medications the flu rsv and other resparitory illnesses skyrocketing after a two year hiatus doctors saying covid restrictions are largely the reason for the two year case slump flu disappeared right off the map completely this year those illneses are making up for lost time we expect flu for example to really ramp up in january february and we now see it ramping up in november and now being kind of full force in december with high rates massachusetts is no different showing a spike in cases one month earlier than in 2019 the cdc now considered the state to have high flu activity all those cases making some medicines particularly ones for kids hard to come by we ve seen a shortage in kids antibiotics especially buhran patel is the ceo and president of pelmeds pharmacy he says pharmacists have noticed the shortage for about a month and says it could get worse a lot of folks are going to travel during christmas who knows what s going to happen with all the travel and flu season hasn t really even hit its mark yet doctors say it s essential to get vaccinated against covid 19 in the flu given the spike in resparitory illnesse advertisement here s what to do if you can t find children s tylenol or motrin right now share copy link copy as fears of a tripledemic are realized and cases of rsv flu and covid 19 soar across the country many parents are reporting trouble finding children s tylenol motrin and other fever reducing medications in stores and online amazon has limited stock while walgreens and cvs websites are continuously out of stock but is there a shortage of children s tylenol motrin and similar medications if you re having difficulty finding children s over the counter fever reducers you re not alone but as far as a shortage is concerned the answer is actually a little complicated here s what you need to know is there a shortage of children s tylenol and motrin it depends on who you ask the food and drug administration shares information online about drug shortages that have been reported to the agency currently the fda is not reporting any shortages of children s tylenol or its generic name acetaminophen and there are also no reports of shortages of children s motrin or its generic name ibuprofen but the american society of health system pharmacists which analyzes information from manufacturers and other sources notes that some forms of oral ibuprofen are in shortage the organization also lists acetaminophen suppositories as being in shortage but it s important to note most children take the medication orally ashp tends to be slightly ahead of the fda reporting on shortages says stephanie field m b a director of pharmacy business operations at corewell health west if ashp shares it then it will soon be on the fda list doctors have witnessed the shortage as well ibuprofen liquid and chewable tablets have been difficult to obtain says joanna young pharm d clinical pharmacy specialist at connecticut children s medical center acetaminophen suppositories and liquid have also been difficult to obtain michael bauer m d medical director and pediatrician at northwestern medicine lake forest hospital agrees despite no official shortage of these medications there are some local shortages of these medications reported by our clinicians and families seeking them he says as a result young says we have taken several measures to try to ensure we can still supply to all of our patients for example we have recommended that providers use chewable tablets when able to reserve the liquid for patients that are not able to use tablets such as infants why is it hard to find children s tylenol and motrin right now since there s no official shortage it s hard to know for sure however there are a few theories tylenol is used regularly to treat fevers in pediatrics and there is an increase in pediatric illness as we have seen with rsv field says people may also be buying more of these medications to be prepared in case their child becomes sick says danelle fisher m d a pediatrician and chair of pediatrics at providence saint john s health center in santa monica ca people are buying it because they re nervous and seeing more respiratory illness in other kids she says when there are times when you know things could get bad people tend to stock up is it ok to use adult tylenol and motrin for kids experts advise against this adult medications should not be used as an alternative field says why the dosage is different and it s easy to get it wrong when shifting from an adult dose to a pediatric dose fisher points out this makes me nervous because there can be an overdosage of acetaminophen which can affect the liver she says you want to be very careful with what you re doing fisher also notes this when we talk about adult doses it s not necessarily one to one with children s medications what should you do if you can t find children s tylenol or motrin fisher stresses that if your child has a fever you don t necessarily need to give them medication fever is not a bad thing it s a good thing dr fisher says it s an adaptive way of the body getting rid of whatever germs it has instead she recommends that you treat discomfort like if your child has a headache or feels achy tied to a fever that is worth treating fisher says but if your child is happy eating well and drinking well i don t care what the number is on the thermometer you don t have to treat it it s important to note that not all doctors share this outlook and not every child s health is the same be sure to consult your physician before making treatment decisions still there are a few other options for medication king suggests looking into pediatric chewable and oral dissolving tablets provided your child is old enough for these usually these are recommended for children ages two and up suppositories are also typically an option fisher says but some acetaminophen suppositories are currently in shortage per the ashp it s also possible to crush chewable tablets and give them in pudding apple juice or applesauce says jamie alan ph d associate professor of pharmacology and toxicology at michigan state university she just recommends that you consult your pediatrician before going this route fisher recommends considering generic versions of your go to medications as well if they re available you do not have to have brand names you can have generic she says it s exactly the same active ingredients and if larger stores around you don t have the medication you need fisher recommends visiting smaller shops in your area sometimes the neighborhood stores don t have the shortages that the bigger stores do she says finally you can talk to your pediatrician or local pharmacist for advice field says they may be able to direct you to a store that has your medication in stock

pricing power and healthy balance sheet alongside recovering margins and accelerating eps growth into 2023 and 2024 another top pick of william blair for 2023 is bj s wholesale whose warehouse model is well situated in a murky macro environment and the ongoing consumer search for value bj s value proposition has driven strong momentum in 2022 with healthy top line growth led by traffic units and

by matt egan cnn business republicans and democrats are likely to clash next year over the debt ceiling a fight that could rock financial markets unnerve consumers and threaten the economy with the specter of a calamitous default the looming debt limit battle in washington could spark the most uncertainty since the 2011 brinksmanship that cost america its perfect aaa credit score and caused chaos on wall street goldman sachs warned clients in a note monday to raise the debt limit next year bipartisan support will be necessary but hard to achieve goldman sachs economists wrote in the report what s this all about the debt ceiling is exactly what it sounds like the maximum that the federal government is allowed to borrow after congress set a level more than a century ago to curtail government borrowing but when push comes to shove congress has in the past raised the debt limit to avoid a default on us debt that economists have warned would be financial armageddon that s what lawmakers did in late 2021 following the last standoff over the debt ceiling goldman sachs notes there have been more false alarms over the last decade than truly close calls washington also came together just last week to reach an agreement that averted what would have been a catastrophic rail strike but republicans have signaled a brewing fight over the debt ceiling house gop leader kevin mccarthy who is vying to become house speaker told cnn before the midterm election that republicans will demand spending cuts in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling republican senator john thune of south dakota told bloomberg last week the debt ceiling could be a way to push through budget cuts another disruptive debate that sets the stage for a dangerous fiscal showdown that risks a default on us debt or at least a close call we remain concerned that the governing dynamic will lead to fiscal fights that could include debt ceiling brinksmanship in mid 2023 isaac boltansky director of policy research at btig wrote in a note to clients this weekend goldman sachs noted that the political environment next year will have echoes of 1995 and 2011 the two most tense standoffs over the debt limit in recent history the report said most though not all of those standoffs occurred when republicans controlled at least one chamber of congress during a democratic presidency next year will provide the political and fiscal conditions for another disruptive debate and razor thin majorities in both chambers and elevated inflation could further increase uncertainty goldman sachs wrote in the report while hard to predict it seems unlikely that next year s debt limit deadline will create quite as much uncertainty as the 2011 experience but there is a good chance it will come closer than at any point since then markets and main street would be hit a close call could set off turmoil on wall street that causes losses in the retirement accounts and investment portfolios of everyday americans it seems likely that uncertainty over the debt limit in 2023 could lead to substantial volatility in financial markets goldman sachs economists wrote noting that the 2011 standoff helped cause a deep selloff in the us stock market beyond markets goldman sachs said a failure to raise the debt limit in time would pose greater risk to government spending and ultimately to economic growth than it would to treasury securities themselves that s because in order to avoid a default on us debt the federal government would shift money around to keep paying interest on treasuries that would create a massive hole that would need to be filled by delaying a host of other payments including ones that millions of americans count on such as paychecks to federal employees benefits to veterans and social security payments a failure to make timely payments would likely hit consumer confidence hard goldman sachs wrote when will a default become a real risk the good news is washington appears to have plenty of time to reach a compromise on the debt ceiling before things get dicey economists at jefferies said in a recent research report that default risk is unlikely to emerge until at least the end of september of next year even though federal debt is likely to reach the statutory limit in the next few weeks goldman sachs said the treasury department should be able to borrow as usual until late february or early march at that point the government could tap a stockpile of 500 billion in cash to finance the deficit until august beyond that there is a lot of uncertainty over precisely when default risk would emerge due to a number of moving pieces including student debt payments and tax revenue funds could run dry as soon as july and as late as october goldman sachs said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved

end of 2021 and made 45 7 billion in grants to individual charities last year said eileen r heisman president of the trust which analyzes the public tax filings of about 1 000 fund sponsors in its annual daf report these were the most dramatic increases we ve had in years said heisman who said her initial reaction to the tally was disbelief until the researchers assured her the figures had been double checked heisman said many donors were induced to donate more of their wealth in 2021 after the prolonged bull market had increased their exposure to capital gains taxes is a daf right for your charitable giving here s what you need to know about the funds what are donor advised funds dafs dafs are a way for taxpayers of any means to group charitable contributions into a single year to reap tax benefits and then to distribute the funds to their favorite charities over time what are the benefits of creating a daf dafs are a convenient method for philanthropists to donate appreciated stock shares or other assets the donor receives a tax deduction for the full value of the asset while avoiding capital gains tax on the increase in the assets value people were sitting on highly appreciated assets and a lot of advisers are telling them is a really easy tool you can make the gifts relatively easily heisman said you can have years of grant making out of a single gift in one year where you ve had an abundance of capital gain dafs became more attractive after the new federal tax law went into effect dramatically increasing the standard deduction for most taxpayers and putting limits on some itemized deductions such as state and local taxes and mortgage interest charitable contributions are still deductible and the new tax law created an incentive for taxpayers to consider batching or bundling deductible expenses in a single year so those count toward reducing your taxes for some donors who have dafs the tax benefits of the funds are of secondary importance a daf offers a convenient and easy way to manage a family s philanthropy said janet wischnia an owner and managing partner at thomaston mills a family owned wyncote firm that manufactures bedding and linens wischnia is no newcomer to dafs her father jerome zaslow set up a fund at national philanthropic trust more than 20 years ago to pay for scholarships in philadelphia for young entrepreneurs which she now manages with npt s assistance the fund now operates mostly on autopilot the people at npt are really nice and helpful said wischnia who founded an online bedding line in 2019 called american blossom linens to do it on your own would be a lot harder they really supported us what can i donate most dafs will let you donate cash as well as stock some may also accept other types of assets such as real estate private equity insurance retirement fund disbursements or even art and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to whom can i make a grant you can make grants to charitable organizations that are tax exempt under internal revenue code dafs cannot make grants to private nonoperating foundations individuals political candidates or political parties grants cannot be used for any personal benefit such as tuition dues membership fees or any goods purchased at a charitable auction grants are not allowed for table sponsorship or tickets at charity events the daf sponsor will examine and approve any grants before releasing the funds how much do i need to start a donor advised fund josh birkholtz chairman of giving usa a chicago organization that analyzes philanthropic trends for nonprofit clients chuckles at the poor man s foundation characterization since dafs still appeal largely to middle and upper income individuals indeed the average daf last year contained 183 000 in assets according to the national philanthropic trust the amount you can invest varies depending upon the sponsor some daf sponsors have no minimums national philanthropic trust has a 10 000 minimum vanguard requires a 25 000 initial investment and 5 000 minimum on subsequent investments the community foundation of new jersey requires a 25 000 initial investment but no minimum on subsequent investments there are hundreds of daf sponsors so examine their terms closely for taxpayers who itemize there are limits to the amounts they can deduct each year for gifts to public charities including donor advised funds according to schwab charitable a taxpayer can claim 30 of adjusted gross income agi for contributions of non cash assets held more than one year and 60 of adjusted gross income for cash contributions contributions in excess of these deduction limits may be carried over up to five subsequent tax years how much will a daf cost me most dafs charge annual fees based on the value of the fund vanguard s fee is 0 6 or 300 for a fund containing 50 000 the percentage fees go down for accounts with larger balances the sponsors also assess fees on the investments which vary depending upon the complexity of the investment the fees on money market funds are minuscule and the fees on index funds are less than those on actively managed funds most national daf sponsors clearly spell out their fee schedules on their websites daf sponsors also set minimums for investments and for grants vanguard requires an initial investment of 25 000 and allows charitable donations of no less than 500 t rowe price has a minimum investment of 5 000 and a minimum disbursement of 100 fidelity and charles schwab have no minimum investment and allow donors to make grants of as little as 50 some donor advised fund organizations have really focused on democratizing it said giving usa s birkholtz i believe fidelity was the first to drop the minimums is it complicated dafs can be as simple or as complex as the donor chooses many large national investment management firms vanguard fidelity and schwab have established 501 c 3 charities to sponsor dafs and provide a wide range of investment funds where donors can put the assets to work until they make grants the growth of online banking has also contributed to the growth of dafs allowing donors to conveniently create a fund online and transfer assets into it with a few keystrokes said heisman sixty large national dafs including the national philanthropic trust accounted for 70 of the 45 7 billion in grants that all dafs made to individual charities last year about 600 community foundations such as the philadelphia foundation and the foundation for delaware county also sponsor dafs and made 9 6 billion in grants another 300 single issue charities which support specific religious faiths or institutions also sponsor dafs that made 4 billion in grants last year why not set up a private foundation for charitable giving dafs still offer many advantages over setting up a private foundation which requires legal paperwork and a staff to make grants and to prepare annual tax returns to verify that 5 of the assets are disbursed each year dafs don t require a minimum payout each year a sore point for some critics who say the accounts are warehouses for capital but the national philanthropic trust says that donor advised funds on average disburse far more than 5 of their assets each year last year dafs payed out 27 of their assets in grants according to the trust if i were a billionaire i would still choose a daf over a foundation said birkholtz although elon musk didn t disclose this he probably did 5 billion plus in donations last year and we assume he dropped that in some sort of a donor advised fund _____ c 2022

in today s money morning should we be thinking more about artificial intelligence as a society will ethical issues arise too abruptly for society to have sufficient time to resolve them is the ai future already here read on to find out should we be thinking more about artificial intelligence as a society will ethical issues arise too abruptly for society to have sufficient time to resolve them maybe at the very least advancements in ai will change society to some degree especially the implications for the economy on the one hand ai can improve productivity and efficiency allowing businesses to automate many tasks and processes that were previously performed by humans this can lead to lower costs higher profits and increased competitiveness for businesses that adopt ai technologies additionally ai can enable businesses to develop new products and services that were not previously possible opening up new market opportunities and creating value for customers for example ai can be used to analyse vast amounts of data and identify patterns and trends that can help businesses make more informed decisions and gain a competitive edge but ai can also have negative implications for the economy ai technologies can replace human workers leading to job losses and potentially higher unemployment this can create social and economic challenges such as income inequality and the need for workers to retrain for new roles those last four paragraphs by the way weren t written by me but by an ai chatbot called chatgpt launched last week by openai a san francisco ai research lab chatgpt only launched last wednesday but already has more than one million users apparently that s a faster uptake than netflix twitter facebook and instagram many have made breathless declarations like chatgpt might be the most incredible tech to emerge in the last decade and one of the most disruptive technologies ever created is that true chatting to ai chatgpt chatgpt is a prototype ai chatbot capable of generating human like text i asked this chatbot to explain how it worked chatgpt is a large language model that has been trained on a massive amount of text data it uses this training to generate human like text based on the input it receives when given a prompt chatgpt uses its internal algorithms to generate text that is appropriate to the context of the prompt it does this by analyzing the input and making predictions about what words or phrases are likely to come next based on the patterns it has learned from the training data in this way chatgpt can generate text that is coherent relevant and appropriate to the given context when i prodded further curious about the prediction of what words or phrases are likely to come next chatgpt replied chatgpt uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to make predictions about what words or phrases are likely to come next it first analyzes the input text to identify patterns and structure in the language it then uses this analysis to make predictions about what words or phrases are likely to come next based on the context of the input raised on a trove of text data chatgpt see patterns and extrapolates from them the public launch will also add data in the form of user feedback responses deemed irrelevant or incoherent by readers will tweak how chatgpt predicts future words and phrases big diverse data is the grist to its mill and it can pump out some interesting stuff here is chatgpt as a maths companion it gives you the answer and explains the logic something that isn t immediate with a google search in a similar stem vein programmers took to twitter to express how well chatgpt handled coding queries the chatbot can apparently debug lines of code too using its strength in calculations some users recruited chatgpt as a dietician prompting it to create a weight loss plan with calorie targets meal plans and even a grocery list unfortunately fortunately chatgpt can t yet sustain deeper human relationships here to chat and create but no expert neither is chatgpt construed as an expert it can generate human like text from a constellation of data but cannot yet bring its data wrangling beyond the derivative when i prompted it to generate an investment idea on tech stocks chatgpt responded with this one potential investment idea for technology stocks is to focus on companies that are developing cutting edge technologies or innovative products and services these companies are likely to be at the forefront of the industry and could benefit from strong demand for their products and services as well as potential advantages over their competitors for example an investor could look for technology companies that are developing new technologies in areas such as artificial intelligence virtual reality or the internet of things these technologies have the potential to disrupt existing industries and create new market opportunities which could drive strong growth and profitability for the companies that are developing them not groundbreaking but covers the basics going further is beyond chatgpt as it explained to me i am not a human being and therefore do not have personal expertise or experience in any particular field i am a large language model trained by openai to generate human like text based on the input i receive i can provide information and answers based on the data i have been trained on but i do not have personal expertise or knowledge beyond what i have been trained to generate currently i think programs like chatgpt are best suited for solving queries with tight rules and parameters queries related to mathematics or coding problems the more open ended the query the blander the response however it does have creative ability it can generate unique responses when given creative prompts here s what chatgpt generated when i asked it to write a funny 250 word script for the tv show friends ross and joey are sitting in central park discussing their latest dating exploits ross i can t believe i went out with that woman who turned out to be a man joey dude that s rough but at least you found out before things got too serious ross yeah i guess that s true but now i m back to square one with my love life joey don t worry ross you ll find someone you just have to keep putting yourself out there ross easier said than done joey i m not getting any younger you know joey ah age is just a number my friend you re still a young virile man women can t resist you ross thanks joey you always know how to make me feel better joey of course ross that s what friends are for now let s go grab some more coffee before we have to head back to work as they get up to leave ross trips and falls landing face first on the floor joey are you okay ross ross yeah i m fine just a little embarrassed joey don t be ross we ve all been there just brush yourself off and keep on moving ross thanks joey you re a true friend joey anytime ross anytime the two friends share a laugh and head off to grab their coffee with ross still rubbing his sore nose i ll admit i laughed at how unfunny this was but i think this is an interesting vista for programs like chatgpt here s a poem chatgpt generated for me on interest rates and the reserve bank of australia in the style of wh auden in the land of australia the reserve bank holds sway over interest rates that ebb and flow each and every day a delicate balance they must keep between growth and inflation to steer the economy clear of harm and avoid a sharp deflation they raise and lower rates with care a powerful tool in their hand but with great power comes great responsibility to protect the nation s land so let us trust in the rba to make decisions sound and wise for the sake of our economy and the future of our lives let s hope when the reserve bank members meet this afternoon they heed the message what will 2032 look like for ai in the 1960s stanford computer scientist roy amara said people overestimate the impact of technology in the short term and underestimate the effect in the long run bill gates echoed that statement years later in one of his books writing that we overestimate what can be achieved in one year but underestimate what can be achieved in 10 so if this is what chatgpt can do now what will it be capable of in 10 years the more i interact with ai products like chatgpt the more i think the ai future is nearer than we think the technology is advancing rapidly what is lagging behind is use cases i don t think we have yet solidified what we can do and what we should do with ai that will take time experimentation and mass discussion firms like openai will help in application discovery too by unleashing free programs like dall e and chatgpt on a curious public chatgpt itself suggested some potential applications to me many of these suggested use cases are already a reality the wall street journal wsj ran a story last month on how much of the content we encounter on the internet is ai generated echoing chatgpt s use cases the wsj reported that most of what we read on the internet could soon be autogenerated by 2025 or 2030 90 of the content on the internet will be auto generated says nina schick author of a 2020 book about generative ai and its pitfalls it s not that nine out of every 10 things we see will be auto generated but that automatic generation will hugely increase the volume of content available she adds some of this could come in the form of personalization such as marketing messages containing synthetic video or actors tuned to our individual tastes in addition a lot of it could just be auto generated content shared on social media like text or video clips people create with no more effort than what s required to enter a text prompt into a content generation service the ai future is coming in some cases it s already here i ll leave you with a haiku chatgpt sent me on the future of ai and the fate of humanity humanity and ai two sides of the same coin drawn together bound until next week kiryll prakapenka for money morning
russia s invasion of ukraine has prompted unprecedented levels of military assistance from the west but ukraine needs more than weapons it needs a financial lifeline the inadequacy of the international response has revealed that developed countries and international financial institutions ifis including the international monetary fund imf are not prepared to deal with the financial challenges and global impacts of such an affront to international law oleksandra betliy oleksandra betliy is a leading research fellow at the institute for economic research and policy consulting in kyiv the imf and other ifis have designed their financing instruments to aid countries that have enacted bad but improvable economic and financial policies have experienced an exogenous crisis against a backdrop of a semi predictable future need a relatively small amount of support or temporarily lack a functioning government ukraine does not fit neatly into any of these categories and its situation shows that the international community urgently needs new instruments for financial assistance making progress before the invasion before february ukraine was on a largely positive economic trajectory starting in 2014 ukrainian leaders adopted a set of laws and policies supporting sound banking and financial systems ukraine s debt was sustainable and the country had a clear path to long term economic growth while many other countries had significantly increased their debt to gdp ratios during the coronavirus pandemic ukraine s ratio had fallen below 50 percent in 2021 the national bank of ukraine nbu was successfully implementing inflation targeting and after cleaning up the banking sector took steps to improve oversight in the insurance segment of the financial market ukraine overhauled its anti corruption institutions and enacted new policies to prevent corruption although there was still a lot of work to be done ukraine had made great strides since 2014 in implementing reforms aimed at preventing corruption this suite of reforms not only helped ukraine receive multiple rounds of financial assistance from the imf united states and eu but they also brought ukraine gradually closer to its long held dream of eu candidate status moreover these reforms greatly improved ukraine s national resilience the government nbu and other state institutions continued to operate effectively once russia s invasion began on february 24 making important decisions within hours that enabled the country to sustain government operations and ensured stability in the banking sector the so far inadequate response in the days after the invasion the government and the nbu began talks with international partners on the need for financing after all wars are expensive the imf was quick to provide ukraine with 1 4 billion and the eu provided a concessional loan of 600 million euros in march and the same amount in may both entities later slowed the disbursement of assistance but the united states was effective and efficient in providing financing to ukraine in the form of grants which are better for the country s debt sustainability according to the imf s april assessment ukraine requires 5 billion in monthly financial assistance from international partners including the ifis to sustain government functions but monthly aid has not reached this target moreover the assistance committed so far has been disbursed in an irregular manner hindering the government s ability to budget responsibly this then requires the nbu to continue directly financing the budget which undermines ukraine s macroeconomic sustainability in the short and long run despite the economic pressures ukraine continued to make payments to external creditors before bondholders agreed in august on a two year freeze on ukraine s eurobonds however the imf did not extend a similar deferral so ukraine was on track to pay back more than it was receiving from the imf in 2022 in october the imf provided an additional 1 3 billion under a new emergency financing instrument called the food shock window but the net effect on ukraine s fiscal situation is minimal the imf s total 2022 financing to ukraine 2 7 billion only marginally exceeds the 2 4 billion payment ukraine had to make to the imf recognizing the inadequacy of the international financial response in july the nbu governor announced talks with the imf on a new large program for ukraine aimed at generating 15 billion to 20 billion of additional support the government included the program in its budget for 2023 which was approved with an assumption that ukraine will receive 38 billion in external financing next year to finance priority spending wartime ukraine doesn t fit the ifi mold however talks on the new imf fiscal support program are slow countries seeking imf support of any significance require a debt sustainability plan which is not possible for ukraine at the moment efforts to secure g7 guarantees for this concessional loan are also hardly promising so far and the imf s long standing reticence to deploy resources in countries at war has the perverse effect of punishing ukraine for russian aggression the situation suggests that the imf is unable to react fast enough to the unexpected economic hardship that ukraine has found itself in even though it is a lender of last resort for countries with macroeconomic and balance of payments problems on the ground in kyiv and across ukraine the situation is increasingly urgent civil society organizations have added their voices to the request for international support a consortium of ukrainian ngos known as rrr4u or resilience reconstruction and relief for ukraine sent a letter to the imf with a plea to cut through the red tape and approve the new program new tools for new problems but the civil society coalition also offers another idea the imf could consider the rapid creation of a new mechanism of support for situations like ukraine s namely an external shock facility building on the template of the food shock window this mechanism could be offered when a country was implementing sound macroeconomic policies before an external shock the country was then faced with a force majeure type situation such as military aggression by a foreign power or a massive natural disaster and the government is operational effective and ready to implement the required set of policies and comply with accountability principles the program would be front loaded with money have streamlined conditionalities and have long maturity with a grace period of interest payments ukraine can serve as a pilot program for this new instrument it then could be elaborated into a standard emergency support option to address other narrowly defined situations of externally driven economic crises that would otherwise challenge the imf s formal programs and typical requirements and conditions it would help other countries in such difficult situations as the one ukraine faces the new imf program monitoring with board involvement pmb for which there is only staff level agreement is a good start toward elaborating a sound macro policy framework that has the potential to attract more support from international donors but the pmb does not guarantee additional funding no silver bullets upgrading ifis capacity to act as a backstop is not enough to keep ukraine afloat ukraine also needs much more financial assistance from the eu which has been slow inadequate and irregular in its aid especially when compared to the united states as of october ukraine had received only 3 billion of the 9 billion euro macro financial assistance program approved at the beginning of the summer the eu has promised to disburse only 3 billion more by the end of the year despite previous eu commitments to provide the full amount by then last month the european commission proposed an 18 billion euro package of support consisting of regular monthly disbursements of roughly 1 5 billion euros for 2023 the european parliament has greenlit the proposal which now goes to the european council for approval ukraine urgently needs this regular and predictable financing but if past experience is anything to go by the road between statements approval and actual disbursements will be long with many decisions and obstacles along the way if disbursements are delayed ukraine might face a fiscal gap in early 2023 which would jeopardize priority spending areas such as social welfare and pensions it s really expensive to fight a war against a larger brutal aggressor ukraine s gdp is expected to drop by about 30 percent in 2022 and tax revenues cover only half of the government expenditures ukraine appreciates all the support its international partners have provided but it needs more financing and stable and predictable disbursements at the imf world bank annual meetings in mid october ukrainian officials had many meetings with foreign counterparts and ifi representatives but so far there are no firm new commitments or planned disbursements meanwhile ukraine s military and society continue to fight for the fundamental

by malavika vyawahare medicines chemical formulations that alleviate much human suffering can also be significant pollutants with active ingredients often excreted from the human body and entering waterways however the intensity of this contamination and of its impacts has not been well researched a study published in june analyzed samples from 1 000 sites along waterways in more than 100 nations looking for 61 active pharmaceutical ingredients apis their results suggest that concentrations of at least one api breached safe levels for aquatic life at nearly 40 of sites tested globally some pharmaceuticals are endocrine disruptors edcs which mimic hormones and interfere harmfully with the endocrine system in various organisms while other drugs are linked to antimicrobial resistance amr considered one of the biggest threats to human health and well being today despite growing awareness among scientists there is no systematic reporting of waterway pollution by medicines or impacts on ecological health currently many human excreted pharmaceuticals enter directly into waterways or pass through existing wastewater treatment facilities fixing the problem will be very expensive in 2020 as the covid 19 pandemic consumed humanity s attention our species ran through 4 5 trillion doses of myriad pharmaceuticals in india alone one drug paracetamol a pain reliever used to treat some covid 19 symptoms saw sales top 3 5 billion pills through 2021 this occurred even as the pandemic pushed big pharma into overdrive with companies racing to develop and hit the market with successful vaccines dispensing more than 12 6 billion doses in record time but long before covid 19 struck new and existing medicinal drugs were being churned out at a cracking pace a trend sure to surge in the future over the next five years drugmakers could unveil 300 new drugs health research firm iqvia predicted yet medicines even life saving ones in the wrong place and in the wrong doses can be pollutants these chemical concoctions that enter the human bloodstream and alleviate much human suffering also often end up seeping into the earth s veins into rivers lakes and estuaries with scientists remaining largely in the dark regarding the ills potentially bred in this wider wild world taking stock of pharmaceutical pollution a global study published this year found that rivers everywhere including in antarctica are tainted by pharmaceuticals alistair boxall and his colleagues analyzed samples from 1 000 sites in more than 100 countries looking for 61 active pharmaceutical ingredients apis the core components that turn mundane compounds into medicines there are more than 4 000 apis in use today all are compounds designed to evoke a biological response to manipulate the functioning of living organisms that fact alone means that apis released into waterways have the potential to do environmental harm don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free initial findings by boxall s team indicated that concentrations of at least one api breached safe levels for aquatic life at a quarter of sites studied a follow up study published in june suggests this number could be higher closer to 40 if a wider range of impacts is considered these statistics point to a stunning scientific oversight says boxall a professor of environmental science at the u k s university of york he says he s irked that now decades after many medicinal drugs first came into wide use they continue to be labeled emerging pollutants only in the last 10 to 20 years have we started to recognize that pharmaceuticals can harm the environment he said the metformin example of the 61 apis evaluated some kept popping up repeatedly among the most ubiquitous in the world s waterways were carbamazepine employed to treat epilepsy as well as the everyday stimulant caffeine and metformin a first line medication for type 2 diabetes prescribed by doctors and used by patients the world over mongabay decided to look at just one of those three picking metformin not because it stands out as a particularly dangerous pollutant but because its environmental pathways and our poor understanding of its ecological impacts exemplify other highly prescribed pharmaceuticals roughly 90 of people diagnosed with diabetes suffer from type 2 diabetes where the body progressively loses its ability to use insulin a hormone produced by the pancreas insulin normally helps cells absorb sugar in the form of glucose from the blood but insulin resistance results in high blood glucose levels over time too much sugar in the blood can damage vital organs like the kidneys weaken nerves and in extreme cases lead to blindness or loss of limbs metformin hydrochloride or 1 1 dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride is the most prescribed diabetes drug today the exact mechanism by which it lowers glucose levels is unknown the latest research suggests it works by triggering enzymes in the liver that limit glucose formation and increasing glucose absorption in the intestine like many drugs it has a litany of side effects that vary from patient to patient metformin was synthesized in a lab in dublin in 1922 but it was only in 1957 when french physician jean sterne first reported its glucose lowering properties the 1940s to 60s saw a surge in its medicinal use globally corresponding with an explosion in new drugs coming on the market including the mass distribution of antibiotics while other nations approved metformin for diabetes treatment the u s didn t do so until the mid 1990s regulatory authorities moved with caution there following a debacle with another diabetes drug phenformin phenformin was linked to severe lactic acidosis or acid build up in the bloodstream leading to thousands of deaths in the u s in the 1960s and 70s concerns about human safety have understandably remained central to drug development but ecological concerns didn t feature significantly in the approval of metformin globally and environmental harm is rarely a block today to new drug approvals in most nations that reality now leaves scientists asking the question how much of any one pharmaceutical or a combination of these pollutants might result in an overdose for a river system the answer is we just don t know and data remain woefully lacking despite its global scope the original investigation by boxall s team captured the api footprint for just 471 million people without evaluating any specific harms the planet is home to nearly 8 billion humans with new drugs streaming into the market and waterways every year on the trail of pharmaceuticals in india soaring human population since world war ii has translated into higher demand for medications worldwide especially in countries where incomes rose more recently that s led to increased pharmaceutical pollution including in newly urbanized once pristine areas other common denominators of growing contamination include easy access to and broad acceptance of medicines across the planet india for example is now the world s third biggest pharmaceutical manufacturer by volume earning it the moniker the world s pharmacy in particular it serves as a hub for generic drug production versions of which replace more expensive formulations that are no longer patent protected the resulting cheaper medicines are readily available on india s domestic market while also being shipped worldwide around 40 of generic formulations sold in the u s are supplied by india according to one estimate don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free while most people link medical waste to hospitals medical facilities are not in fact the most significant source of pharmaceutical pollution though drug manufacturing plants do generate waste containing apis it s households that are by far the biggest source of pharma contaminants which brings us back to metformin india is home to the second largest number of people with diabetes after china 80 million in total greater than the entire population of france in the indian capital delhi a city of nearly 20 million an estimated 25 33 of residents have diabetes and many are certainly metformin users those taking the ubiquitous diabetes drug unwittingly pollute their vital water source the yamuna river a tributary of the ganges which irrigates much of north india s crops any change in the use of medicines by a society will influence what we see in a river boxall explained that s because many pharmaceutical compounds including metformin pass through the human body without losing their potency and aren t metabolized fully in fact more than two thirds of a metformin dose can end up in the urine or feces intact and most of it passes right through sewage treatment plants according to india s primary pollution control agency sewage is the main contaminant of india s waterways the country struggles to ensure even primary treatment of household wastewater bigger cities and towns generate about 30 billion liters 7 9 billion gallons of sewage daily only about a fifth of it gets treated delhi is an outlier in this respect with the ability to treat 80 of its waste yet according to government data 24 of the 34 capital sewage treatment plants did not meet standards for wastewater treatment as of 2021 the yamuna receives most of the mega city s wastewater despite being among india s best equipped facilities for tackling waste the capital s sewage treatment plants aren t designed for extracting pharmaceutical contaminants researchers detected a cocktail of 22 apis including metformin in river water samples collected in the capital region in the new study delhi had some of the world s highest average concentrations of apis alongside addis ababa ethiopia la paz bolivia and lahore pakistan studies like those published by boxall s team are closing an important gap the swaths of the planet that have until now received the least attention in mapping pharmaceutical pollution south america sub saharan africa and parts of southern asia turn out to be some of the most affected lagos in nigeria the most populous city in sub saharan africa is another pollution hotspot with 26 pharmaceutical compounds detected in the odo iya alaro river there are no restrictions on who can open a pharmacy explained charles obinwanne okoye an environmental biologist at the university of nigeria and people can easily buy medicines without a prescription don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free it is first and foremost a problem of waste management okoye asserted with sewage treatment systems woefully inadequate in countries where pharmaceutical use is galloping ahead early evidence for pharmaceutical environmental impacts the same properties that make medications so useful in the targeted organism humans or livestock can turn them into dangerous ecological pollutants especially in waterways where other water users are exposed to them downstream from the yamuna river in delhi people from informal settlements use the water for their everyday needs including in some cases for drinking they also use the river water to irrigate crops with pharmaceuticals potentially contaminating the food supply direct exposure can be dangerous for wildlife too in clinical studies brown trout salmo trutta display addiction like behavior to methamphetamine commonly known as meth but fish addiction to illicit drugs is not the only problem certain pharmaceuticals are a subset of a broader class of chemicals called endocrine disruptors edcs which mimic hormones and interfere with the endocrine system these chemicals are found in everything from plastic bottles to pesticides and are used in pharmaceuticals too metformin may also fall into this category although the diabetes drug does not structurally resemble classical edcs there s an increasing recognition that endocrine disruption may occur by mechanisms other than classical endocrine receptor binding according to some studies metformin is capable of producing wide and unknown changes in fish mammals and invertebrates scientists found that when the fathead minnow pimephales promelas was exposed to metformin levels equivalent to those occurring in wastewater male fish showed signs of feminization some males were abnormally small and the drug also impacted fish reproduction however other studies did not capture similar effects in the species questions regarding low dose effects some experts maintain that when it comes to edcs larger doses don t equal larger effects there is no simple one to one correlation they say between dose size and impacts hence the conventional rationale for determining safe limits for environmental pollutants may not apply to edcs in some instances lower doses can produce vastly different effects than concentrations studied in lab experiments this low dose effect also manifests in another class of pharmaceuticals linked to antimicrobial resistance amr disease causing pathogens including bacteria viruses and fungi can evolve in the human body and in the wild to resist antibiotic drugs designed to target them this chiefly happens via their exposure to medical compounds developed to kill them with a subset of the surviving pathogen population more likely to be immune to the antibiotic an evolved trait passed to offspring sulfamethoxazole is an antibiotic and growth promoter for livestock it s also a common pollutant today its efficacy is being vastly undermined with bacterial targets becoming increasingly resistant importantly toxic levels of antibiotics are not required to produce significant antimicrobial resistance even lower doses like those potentially found in waterways can give rise to resistance by allowing the microbes a chance to familiarize with and adapt to a threat this silent pandemic of super bugs is stealthily hollowing out the medical armory of antibiotics built up over decades a study commissioned by the u k government estimated the death toll from amr infections could reach 10 million annually by 2050 amr is already exacting a devastating toll in india where health care access is poor more than 50 000 newborns die every year there from drug resistant infections flying blind into our pharmacological future despite their potential for harm apis have thus far remained understudied and underregulated pharmaceutical pollutants are one example of chemicals of concern that fall outside the scope of existing international treaties that apply to chemicals and waste said mirella miettinen a specialist in environmental law at the university of eastern finland miettinen is a lead investigator for the sudden project aimed at curbing ecological risks arising across the life cycle of pharmaceuticals despite the growing awareness of scientists there is no systematic reporting about the impacts of drugs on ecological health this is especially true in countries where there is steady growth in pharmaceutical use combined with poor waste management but it is not a lapse limited to pharmerging economies as countries like china india and brazil are known in the industry lingo boxall says that of the roughly 2 000 pharmaceuticals in use in europe ecological effects data are available for less than a fifth sweden is a pioneer on this front the scandinavian nation set up an environmental classification system for pharmaceutical products in 2005 the risk benefit analysis done by eu regulatory bodies during the authorization of a new medicinal product does not consider environmental risk miettinen noted the u s fda on the other hand is empowered to refuse applicants who don t furnish sufficient information about the environmental effects of a new medicine however a plethora of approval exceptions means environmental assessments aren t the norm for new drug applications experts like miettinen argue that regulators should always consider environmental impacts when authorizing new pharmaceuticals and restrict the use of a medicine that carries with it the greatest environmental risk likewise excessive prescribing and improper pharmaceutical use needs to be checked far more research is also needed into the impacts of individual drugs and multiple drug interactions on waterways around the globe but even knowing what those impacts are won t be enough take metformin for example it s an essential front line drug consumers and health care providers can t easily substitute a greener version for it to do so a company would need to find it financially beneficial to produce one that is just as efficacious safely test it and make it available an expensive lengthy process we need various actions at different levels to tackle the problem miettinen said including creating incentives for the development of compounds with improved biodegradability once medicines enter the market and our bodies keeping track grows far more complicated regulating pollution at manufacturing sites is low hanging fruit and frameworks for controlling industrial waste often include pharmaceutical manufacturers the pharmaceutical industry is a heavily polluting industry which is under the red category said gopal krishna an environmental activist based in india these are industries which generate hazardous waste hospitals are well placed to undertake treatment of apis before they enter the public wastewater stream several api removal technologies are currently being tested at hospitals many in europe but household waste is far trickier to tackle for more industrialized countries this means wholesale upgrades to wastewater infrastructure for less industrialized nations the process would need to start with waste treatment facility construction with builders leapfrogging to install cutting edge water treatment technologies some now considered too expensive even for richer nations metformin again provides a good example of inherent problems it is already ubiquitous in the water supply even in industrialized countries like the u k and u s because conventional treatment methods can t remove it radboud university medical center in the netherlands partnered with dutch company vitalfluid to test methods to extract pharmaceutical residues from hospital wastewater they relied on an advanced oxidation process that increased reactive oxygen and nitrogen even then metformin proved to be a stubborn pollutant to extract solutions like activated carbon filters or ozone treatments will degrade a lot more pharmaceuticals boxall explained the problem is that they are costly installing such systems at scale will greatly burden taxpayers more than a decade ago an upgrade at a single canadian treatment plant to deal with organic waste and pharmaceuticals cost more than 300 million this july the delhi government approved an 18 55 billion rupee 230 million plan to clean up the yamuna river authorities envision using this money to lay down new sewer lines build 10 new sewage treatment units and upgrade six existing sewage treatment plants clearly achieving the goal of fully evaluating and effectively managing the world s pharmaceutical pollution lies far in the future mongabay reached out to pharma majors who market metformin globally including pfizer johnson

the western support for ukraine in its war against russia is unlikely to achieve a russian defeat moreover it has become an enormous burden putting at risk the west attaining its other critical strategic objectives everybody understands that the war will not end with restoring ukrainian territorial integrity as president volodymyr zelensky demands crimea and the donbas region populated by ethnic russians are unlikely to revert to ukrainian rule the staying power of russia is more substantial than ukraine s and thus despite economic difficulties and military problems russia will not likely submit to ukraine s conditions moscow will probably continue its war of attrition exacting a high price on ukraine s infrastructure and army putin is unlikely to accept defeat moreover an attempt to humiliate russia is not wise and is likely counter productive therefore the ukrainian defined victory is not attainable advertisement the wert has the strategic objective of weakening russia a soldier takes a photograph of his comrade as he poses beside a destroyed russian tank and armoured vehicles amid russia s invasion on ukraine in bucha in kyiv region credit reuters zohra bensemra in contrast the west has already attained the strategic objective of weakening russia making nato s eastern flank more secure moscow cannot swallow ukraine under the present circumstances while upholding the principles embodied in the moral support for ukraine s courageous struggle matters the continuation of the war is harming the west and endangering its battle to maintain superiority over autocracies jens stoltenberg secretary general of nato recently stated a more modest goal denial of a russian win that less clearly defined objective opens room for negotiating a compromise which should become the primary concern of american diplomacy the war in ukraine is diverting attention from the central strategic challenge facing the us and the west china pivoting to asia the strategy advocated by the last three us presidents remains an empty slogan as ukraine devours western attention and resources beijing is looking with satisfaction at the western imbroglio in eastern europe as a western alliance lacking a strategic focus serves chinese interests it weakens moscow and strengthens its alignment with beijing the ukraine war also unites iran and russia in an anti american position the fighting in ukraine is a resounding example of a high intensity war that many strategists believed was a phenomenon long past nevertheless it is here consuming considerable military assets and vast amounts of expensive munitions advertisement it is unclear how long the west can continue supplying ukrainian combat troops western ammunition stock is quickly depleting current production lines cannot promptly replenish the war material sent to ukraine so the ukrainian capacity to resist russia will dwindle moreover western involvement considerably reduces its ability to fight a war elsewhere a critical consideration for finding a diplomatic solution to end the war is the risk of nuclear escalation the west mostly adheres to the mutually assured destruction mad doctrine whose central tenet maintains that crossing the nuclear threshold leads to an all out atomic war of unimaginable destructive character this doctrine significantly inhibits the use of nuclear warheads in contrast russia s nuclear doctrine allows for a gradual use of nuclear weapons within a large scale conventional war therefore the west should take russian nuclear threats seriously especially when its conventional military fortunes take a turn for the worst moreover maintaining the war against russia amounts to further investing effort to weaken a secondary opponent while russia has an impressive nuclear arsenal its conventional army is in bad shape russia s gdp is slightly higher than brazil s not a world power but about a tenth of china s the gdp of nato nations equals 45 of the world economy around 18 times larger than russia s so any further attempt at debilitating russian military capabilities hardly impacts the european and global balance of power the longer the war the more money the west will need to reconstruct the devastated state the continuation of the war only magnifies the destruction russia brings upon ukraine particularly its economic infrastructure the longer the war lasts the more money the west will need to reconstruct the devastated state when hostilities eventually conclude a ukrainian soldier sits atop a tank passing the lysychansk oil refinery after if was hit by a missile at lysychansk luhansk region ukraine april 16 2022 credit marko djurica reuters we also have begun to see small cracks in the nato alliance due to the duration of the war there are differences of opinion about arms production policies and the desired outcome a cold winter will amplify transatlantic tensions the understandable american reluctance to put boots on the ground will become morally more questionable as the war drags on and its tragic features become even more pronounced american hesitations to fight another just war could be overturned by unforeseen events on the battleground for all these reasons a wise washington should do its best to find a formula to end the war in ukraine gentle pressure on kyiv to accept a compromise is needed as well as resisting punitive impulses against the russian aggressors western leaders should overcome the tendency to look at the sunken costs and concentrate on the risks and meager marginal profits to be achieved if the war continues the template for a compromise still needs to be clarified the finlandization of ukraine an option that should have been pursued before the war is probably the most promising alas no state can escape the constraints of geopolitics in a noble and expensive gesture the west has given ukraine some leeway being a neighbor of a giant bear such as russia carries consequences ukraine ignored its predicament and is paying heavily for this mistake the writer is the president of the jerusalem institute for strategy and security jiss

by eric carlson adam ozimek and kenan fikri eig developed a novel innovation hubs index that balances economic need with innovation potential to inform the selection of 20 regional innovation hubs authorized in the chips and science act top metropolitan area contenders on the index include greenville sc provo ut tucson az toledo oh and greensboro nc the chips and science act authorized 10 billion in federal funds over five years to invest in 20 geographically distributed regional innovation hubs across the united states this provision of the statute has two broad goals first it is meant to increase u s output of translational research research that converts basic scientific findings into industrial applications and second the legislation serves as a regional development policy intended to seed innovation ecosystems in lagging regions in speeches on the senate floor on july 27 2022 senate majority leader chuck schumer d ny and senator todd young r in described their motivations for the bill speaking on increasing research output senator young said that the bill will establish regional technology hubs across our country which will become centers for the research development entrepreneurship and manufacturing of new key technologies focusing on regional development senator schumer added that the bill will help turn cities like buffalo and indianapolis into new centers for innovation while the legislation has provided broad eligibility criteria it has not given specific guidance for selecting the location of hubs the economic development administration eda within the department of commerce is charged with implementing the program which congress still needs to fund and is in the process of drawing up the terms and timelines on which regions will compete for hubs status and funding eig developed the hubs index as a provisional data driven guide to the selection of hub locations that balances the program s dual and sometimes competing intentions we determined our criteria based on the broad goals of the statute and selected specific measures to reflect those objectives first consistent with the policy s goals of promoting translational research hubs should be located in metros that have the potential to invent new technologies and put those new technologies into practice this includes for example regions with a great deal of human capital and regions with innovative and complex industrial bases second consistent with the policy s goal of bringing new regions to the technological frontier hubs should be located in lagging regions or in areas that are otherwise undershooting their economic potential this includes for example regions far from so called superstar cities regions with low prime age employment rates and regions experiencing brain drain in short we consider both innovation potential and economic need in determining whether a given location merits selection given the logic of regional economic agglomeration and clustering on which the hubs concept rests the unit of analysis is the metropolitan statistical area msa every state contains at least one metro area and these geographies represent functional economic areas spanning the urban rural continuum that generally conform to local labor markets with populations that can run under 70 000 people some metros such as walla walla wa represent areas that are commonly considered rural we collect data on each variable normalize the measures to a scale from 0 to 100 and aggregate our variables using a weighted average of each measure our baseline model applies equal weights to each variable our normalization combined with the equal weighting scheme prevents any one indicator from driving the value of the index there is a great deal of variation in the baseline index with the top metro areas scoring 77 4 out of a possible 100 greenville anderson sc and provo orem ut and the bottom metro area scoring only 23 ocean city nj given the range of criteria we examine the top metros based on our methodology include a mix ranging from college towns to former industrial centers for example top hubs contenders include provo orem ut tucson az greenville anderson sc toledo oh and greensboro high point nc methodology eig collected data on indicators reflecting a metro area s potential to generate and commercialize innovative technologies as well as its need for economic investment a metro area s potential for innovation is assessed through its stock of human capital and through its industrial composition a metro area s need for investment is measured based on its relative inability to retain a skilled labor force the share of the prime age population that is not working and its distance from other superstar metros these measures of need also reflect opportunities for example hubs in metro areas suffering from brain drain in this context generally college towns without the economic base to absorb and retain their graduates would have ready access to a young skilled workforce coming out of local universities in addition a hub located in a place with high rates of prime age nonemployment would take root against the backdrop of considerable labor market slack which could insure against any local economic overheating and would also carry the prospective benefits of bringing workers back off the sidelines and into the productive economy alone measures of innovative potential skew towards the already high performing superstar metropolitan areas that are decidedly not the intended recipients of these federal investments similarly measures of economic need skew towards remote and chronically struggling locales where hubs would have to be built largely from scratch thus the utility of eig s hubs index lies in identifying metro areas that occupy the sweet spot between these two extremes high performance and economic need balancing the tensions at the heart of the program s mission measures of potential human capital is a key ingredient for innovation we measure a region s human capital using the number of stem graduates between the ages of 25 and 64 as well as the number of patent authors the number of stem graduates come from the 2019 5 year american community survey acs summary tables and the number of patent authors comes from patentsview org the number of authors measures patenting activity at the extensive margin the number of workers who have produced a successful patent rather than the intensive margin the total number of patents produced authors are assigned to metro areas based on the geographic information available on their latest patent innovation hubs located in regions that score high on this metric are likely to have access to a labor force of workers who know how to turn ideas into products as well as people who know how to navigate the american intellectual property space we use total values rather than population shares because innovation rests on having a critical mass of certain inputs especially human capital the top metros based on the number of stem graduates include new york ny los angeles ca and washington dc the top metros based on the number of patent authors include san jose ca san francisco ca seattle wa new york ny and boston ma in order to deploy new technologies productively hubs should be located in metros with sophisticated industrial bases we proxy this by using the industrial composition of each metro area as well as an index of each metro s economic complexity we measure industrial composition using total employment in advanced industries within a metro where advanced industries are defined as in muro et al 2015 the predecessor work to atkinson muro and whiton 2019 which incubated the very concept of these innovation hubs economic complexity is measured using the index developed in fritz and manduca 2021 top metros based on these measures are superstar cities such as new york chicago boston and seattle measures of need in their role as a pillar of federal place based policy efforts innovation hubs should build on regional assets and help regions retain their human capital hubs should therefore gravitate towards metros that produce skilled workers but lose them to more dynamic areas we identify regions that suffer from brain drain by comparing the flow of skilled graduates generated in a location to the stock of skilled workers active in the local economy flows of skilled graduates are based on 2019 college graduation data from the integrated postsecondary education data system ipeds and stocks of skilled workers are based on the number of adults between the ages of 25 and 64 with at least a bachelor s degree from the acs first we measure the ratio of all recent college graduates to the total number of college degree holders then we repeat the same flow to stock ratio but for graduates and workers with degrees in stem fields unsurprisingly top metros by these measures are in less populous college towns like state college pa penn state and blacksburg va virginia tech these areas produce very large crops of college educated and stem talent relative to the sizes and structures of their local economies hubs in metros experiencing such brain drain will therefore have easier access to a pool of young skilled workers and enjoy tremendous opportunities to capitalize on assets already present in the region and build out their local economies in addition hubs are intended to bring new employment opportunities to lagging local labor markets we measure this by the share of the prime age population those between the ages of 25 and 54 that is either unemployed or not in the labor force employment data are from the 2019 acs 5 year summary tables top metros based on this measure include pine bluff ar el centro ca hanford corcoran ca beckley wv and vineland bridgeton nj metros in which large shares of the prime age population are not working have available labor but clearly undershoot their economic potential hubs located in these communities could therefore help redeploy sidelined workers into productive employment opportunities and hubs employers could hire large numbers of workers without crowding out local labor markets finally hubs should be located in parts of the country that are not already connected to superstar cities our index rewards metro areas that are not in close proximity to dense agglomerations and have lower costs of living the latter of which serves as a proxy for congestion costs and an indicator of how far each federal dollar invested into a hub may stretch our measure of agglomeration adjacency comes from 2019 quarterly census of employment and wages qcew data on total employment by county from the bureau of labor statistics we use a non linear distance weighted average of nearby jobs based on the straight line distance between county centroids our measure of the cost of living is based on the regional price parity index from the bureau of economic analysis bea metros that are farthest from superstars include fairbanks ak great falls mt and casper wy top metros by regional price parity include muscle shoals al pine bluff ar and jackson tn constructing the index because the variables all come from different sources are denominated in different units and have different magnitudes we first normalize each measure to take on values between 0 and 100 although there are several ways to rescale our data we normalize all variables except for weighted distance from superstar metros using each metro area s percentile rank for that measure because the data are heavily right skewed on most measures the main consequence of this normalization is to flatten differences between two metros that is for a given variable the difference between any two adjacent metros is 100 n where n is the number of metros in the sample we rescale the distance from superstar metros by dividing the measure by the maximum computed distance and multiplying by 100 this rescaling preserves the distributional features of this measure that were created by the non linear distance weighting in short the distribution implies that being relatively close to agglomeration matters but once you are a given distance from agglomeration more distance does not matter going from 10 miles from a superstar city to 110 miles from one is a substantially bigger increase in geographic isolation than going from 400 miles to 500 miles to construct the index we aggregate our data using a weighted average of each measure in our baseline model each variable is given equal weight and thus contributes equally to the index value since the law is ambiguous about how to balance innovative potential against economic need we think that an even weighting method serves as a good baseline as shown below this method generates a diverse list of hubs candidates however because the choice of weights is subjective we also conduct sensitivity analyses with different weights to demonstrate how the results are affected by these choices we use the index to rank metro areas within each state in addition the statute requires at least three hubs to be located in each eda region therefore our final list in the table below shows the top five state winners from each eda region the results are presented by state and region to showcase the geographic diversity of strong contenders and to reflect the reality that no one state is likely to get two hubs for an unfiltered ranking see the appendix table or download the spreadsheet at the bottom of this post results as shown in the table below the top metros by state and eda region based on our index include a diverse mix of large and small cities for example tuscaloosa al and lynchburg va have populations under 300 000 while riverside san bernardino ontario ca has a population near 5 million within each eda region metros are arranged in descending order by index value overall the top 5 state winners are provo orem ut tucson az greenville anderson sc toledo oh and greensboro high point nc the table also includes notations for metro areas that host institutions specifically called out as priority partners in the authorizing legislation including national laboratories top tier research universities manufacturing usa institutes and historically black colleges and universities hbcus in practice the presence and involvement of such institutions may well tip the scales in the final designations because the index weights each variable equally the top metros were well rounded across measures for example tucson az and provo orem ut scored in the top one third for every measure except for regional price parity similarly mcallen edinburg mission tx scored in the top one third for every measure except for the number of patent authors the map of leading contenders from table 1 is geographically diverse as shown in the figure below in the unfiltered ranking list top scoring metros within some states are adjacent to each other and functionally form cohesive economic regions that are already considered combined statistical areas by the u s census bureau examples include provo salt lake in utah and greenville spartanburg in south carolina in the real competition to be designated a hub such regions may be advantaged by submitting joint applications additional considerations at the margins the results are relatively robust to small changes in the weighting scheme because top scoring metro areas are well rounded across measures eliminating the contribution of any single variable results in only minor changes in the ranking for instance removing the agglomeration penalty generates the same set of 30 top metros by state and region but in a slightly different order indeed the top 2 metros from each eda region remain unchanged any reordering is slight for example the adjacently ranked metros albuquerque nm and baton rouge la change places more dramatic changes to the weighting scheme can change the results significantly in the accompanying spreadsheet interested users can manipulate the weights according to their own priorities or vision for how innovation hubs could be sited at the extremes if we just focus on innovative potential and remove brain drain regional price parity prime age non employment and distance from superstars from our index the top metro areas are all big cities new york chicago san francisco boston and houston if we instead focus solely on economic need and remove human capital and innovation variables the top 5 metros are all small economically distressed cities with relatively rudimentary local economies carbondale marion il cumberland md wv terre haute in anniston oxford al and valdosta ga the bill also requires that at least one hub be in a low population state that is eligible to receive epscor funding using our baseline weighting methods the top five metros in low population epscor states are burlington south burlington vt fargo nd missoula mt grand forks nd and dover de compared to the other metros in this list burlington south burlington vt which has an index score of 61 1 has the most even mix of potential and need for the other metros in low population epscor states need played a much larger role in their overall score for example the elements of need brain drain and distance primarily constituted over 70 percent of the final index scores for missoula mt grand forks nd and dover de the top 10 metros from low population epscor states are shown in the table below conclusion the rankings presented in this report are intended to provide policymakers with an initial quantitative framework for considering how to balance competing public policy priorities in implementing a flagship new federal place based policy the innovation hubs authorized in the chips and science act the rankings provide a balanced assessment of regional economic need and innovation potential nevertheless the data alone should not be decisive in determining which 20 u s regions become innovation hubs qualitative considerations such as the strength of local leadership vibrancy of the local innovation ecosystem and depth of the network of participating organizations will be just as determinative in the ultimate success of any given hub as the quantitative exercise presented here the competitive application process that eda will run before making any awards should help further differentiate regions on these dimensions nevertheless this index offers a good initial sense of where innovation hubs are likely to be both productive and helpful advancing the public policy goals set out in the authorizing legislation we hope it provides a useful tool for policymakers and stakeholders to navigate the intent of the statute to optimize the power of these coming federal investments we look forward to feedback from the field and to iterating this model further

woman work jobs at the top of corporations have changed drastically corporations expect much more from their c level executives who constantly find themselves excelling in innovative and different skills to deal with today s business realities more so the number of women in c roles is also on the rise one of the most strikingly consistent professionals naz khan is an inspiration for all members of senior management with her remarkable technical and functional expertise that is woven with exceptional business acumen and leadership skills she has thrived in the c level position a strong communicator and a brilliant strategic thinker she brings with her 25 years of management experience traversing through financial services and industrial spheres an energetically motivated graduate of economics from mount holyoke college usa she honed her abilities to reach some of the top positions seldom enjoyed by women her diverse experience offers a road map for ambitious managers who want to know which skills they should focus on developing in order to rise up the chain of command talking about business models and developing risk management strategies on innovation for growth naz khan says global mind set is extremely important in order to think that people are innovative educating people at a younger age to see things differently is a challenge especially in pakistan the status quo is not just in the area of technology but also in business outlook as to how one can do things differently by making the most of the available resources this will enable children and then young graduates at the grassroot level to build a talent structure that will provide a competitive edge having interviewed numerous top managers about the requirements for senior leaders past present and future i have seen some clear signals about how c level jobs are evolving today members of senior management are expected not only to support the ceo on business strategies insights and key decisions but also to contribute positively to the talent of the future and how to lead them effectively she adds it can be safely said that ms khan exemplifies this role like a proverbial glove she emphasises the importance of crisis management and crisis quotient which is an additional tangent to look out for while hiring talent for innovation there is no dearth of talent there is a dearth of leadership to recognise that talent we need to focus on critical thinking even outside the education system we need to learn to accept failure it is considered extremely negative this thinking needs to change stresses ms khan we need less regulation on the governmental front the state only needs to provide an enabling environment and the private sector will innovate and bring solutions on its own she suggests typically the government is the end of the line and this requires a major shift for the industry to thrive explore new markets convene new methods and streamline processes regulatory compliance is the most challenging and important issue that needs immediate resolution most of the solutions characteristically depend on regulatory counsel which hinders growth and stifles profitability observes ms khan according to her the energy sector is one of the sectors with the most potential for innovation we have experienced varying customer preferences as people are resorting to renewables there are technological disruptions within the sector due to which the utility model is disordered globally ms khan s views across geographies and sectors cement the fact that although there are serious barriers in both leadership behaviour and capability pakistan is emerging between the business and technology functions few executives like her can straddle both worlds as a developing economy riddled with various macroeconomic issues we are less exclusively concerned with the technology itself and more attuned to how it could generate competitive advantage and more focused on leadership and organisational effectiveness meanwhile another phenomenon has replaced the old one globalisation right now business needs have shifted again we have to deal with integrating and standardising processes and platforms across multiple operating companies group functions and regions expresses ms khan for the foreseeable future we see naz khan as a sophisticated mix of skills as she is not only business savvy but also carries a body of work with analytics organisational design and infrastructure a perfect trailblazer who knows how to wire together a holistic system that can support global growth cultivating the same angle she elucidates i look at myself as a business leader and not as a cso i talk to my team about how to have different types of conversations for instance don t talk about how great the technology is talk about how it will improve delivery drive up revenue growth generate cost efficiencies and improve customer experience the c suites of the future will operate around the globe in multiple time zones and will regularly partner with areas of the business on growth initiatives and international expansion naz khan champions and endorses this phenomenon strongly both with a commercial sensibility and a global mind set sara danial is a writer with keen interest in economics and women issues
