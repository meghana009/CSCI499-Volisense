by david haggith let s look at what has continued to develop with inflation in the short time since my may articles on the subject because inflation is going to cause the fed s great recovery but burn up in its own incendiary blast a rapid spread of fiery inflationary data lit up the landscape last week the global food fight is on the un just reported that global food prices have returned to being their highest in a decade this is the twelfth straight month of rises and the cause of the price increases is what i have said will likely cause rampant inflation for twelve straight months now shortages short supply is as essential to high inflation as money printing a united nations gauge of world food costs climbed for a 12th straight month in may its longest stretch in a decade the continued advance risks accelerating broader inflation complicating central banks efforts to provide more stimulus the surge has stirred memories of 2008 and 2011 when price spikes led to food riots in more than 30 nations we have very little room for any production shock we have very little room for any unexpected surge in demand in any country abdolreza abbassian senior economist at the un s food and agriculture organization said the world s hunger problem has already reached its worst in years as the pandemic exacerbates food inequalities compounding extreme weather and political conflicts bloomberg so the causes droughts and fires and floods wars and especially pandemic shutdowns of farms and processing plants and transportation and borders all over the world it was the latter set of troubles that i said would come home to rest months down the road as freezer warehouse inventories became depleted during covid shutdowns the freaking fed the fed s beige book of economic stats has been freaking out for months over the shortages that are driving inflation here we are supposedly in what the fed says is a moderately expanding economy and yet we see a sharper and sharper rise over recent months in reported shortages how can that be an expanding economy that cannot produce what exactly is it that is expanding then the answer is that the economy global or us is not exactly expanding it is recovering from its collapse at a rapid rate but it is running well below where it was running before the pandemic that means it is less capable of providing for the needs of the expanding population of this world the us included because of this those who have money will bid up the price of available goods and services to get their piece of the smaller pie leaving those without the surplus of money lacking in goods and services that equals inflation one of the top concerns was soaring costs but nothing spooked the various fed districts quite as much as what appears to be a shortage of everything with district after district complaining about broken supply chains a lack of workers and critical commodities that just can t be procured all resulting in sharply higher prices slower delivery times and all around chaos zero hedge the fed would like to comfort you by saying it is not worried about your inflation hit because it is presumably transitory and rich people can afford a transitory hit and will easily weather through that is all that matters fed baloney oh sure inflation may be transitory as in the rate of rise will die down in a year or two but the inflation rate returning to normal still leaves you with much higher prices from the time when it was far above normal and even a year is too long it s more time than markets will weather it s more time than the masses are likely to give to politicians and the fed the tapering pressure and market worry about tapering will grow a hobby that s enjoying a new wave of popularity illustrates the inflationary pressures rippling through the wider u s economy and bringing political risks for president joe biden amid supply bottlenecks and worldwide surges in demand like their peers in many other industries bike companies are passing along higher costs driven by rising raw material prices strained factories and overloaded delivery chains they ve been able to do that without damping customer demand and executives foresee more price increases with supply expected to remain tight and demand elevated through at least next year the biden administration and the fed say inflation will likely ease later this year in the bike industry though many expect increases to last longer than that if that turns out to be the case more broadly for prices across the economy it could trigger voter discontent as biden s democrats prepare to defend their narrow control of the house and senate in next year s midterm elections republicans blame biden s stimulus spending for stirring up inflation the supply problems faced by bike companies have pre pandemic roots toward the end of 2019 major brands held off placing orders from china where most bikes and parts are made to await an exemption on 25 tariffs imposed by the trump administration said jay townley a former bike company executive who now works at consultancy human powered solutions msn as i ve said the shortages that have been greatly worsened by covid lockdowns of industry shipping and borders came at a time when the trump trade wars had already severely impacted global supply chains so it is as the above article calls it a double whammy if you do one thing that cripples the economy it leaves the economy less robust for weathering the next storm it doesn t matter what your politics are that s how troubles compound container chaos the one industry hit most directly by all the trade wars followed on by the covid border and industry lockdowns is shipping and the problems there also say inflation is not going to be transitory in the sense of ending say after the summer but will be around long enough to inflict real damage on all kinds of markets as demand for products picks back up charter rates for short employment have gone out of control said alphaliner in its new weekly report the source said that there is more and more enquiry every day with people panicking now amid unprecedented times zero hedge zh noted that inflation in shipping is already compounding rapidly a freight forwarder is reportedly paying 135 000 per day for a short term charter of the s santiago a 15 year old container ship alphaliner said that this colossal rate is substantially higher than the already whopping 70 000 90 000 per day the industry source told american shipper that the s santiago deal was concluded last week and that he wouldn t be surprised if a new record were reached this week to put the enormity of the charter deal in perspective the shipowner will earn back one sixth of the ship s value in a single voyage and one third of the vessel s value if the charterer takes the option for the second voyage remember when ships were being decommissioned during the covidcrisis and production of ships was stopped well now we pay the price for that shot term perspective demand is coming back ships take longer to come back fink is funked rich man larry fink ceo of black hole er uh blackrock is worried about inflation s not so transitional nature he is not worried however because of how inflation will eat away at your life energy he s worried because he fully agrees with my thesis though he doesn t know he does that this dawning inflation will easily grow into a monstrous bear that will tear the stock market apart according to every career economist market strategist and fed lackey inflation is transitory the most important man on wall street disagrees blackrock ceo larry fink who manages more money than the fed countered soothing talk that soaring prices are here and gone tomorrow and said that investors may be underestimating the potential for a spike in inflation most people haven t had a forty plus year career and they ve only seen declining inflation over the last 30 plus years so this is going to be a pretty big shock fink said his warning falling on deaf ears zero hedge corporate profits slump in fed s moderate growth economy another indicator that the economy is not rising in real terms but remains subpar because it is still climbing out of the covid s black hole can be seen in corporate profits an even more rare event is that corporate operating profits did not increase in the quarter when gdp growth increased double digits how can companies operating earnings be flat when nominal growth is booming zero hedge yes how does a moderately rising economy along with stellar earnings reports from corporations square with a total lack of profits the bureau of economic analysis bea reported that nominal gdp increased at an annual rate of 11 in q1 2021 rapid gains in gdp generate equally substantial increases in gross domestic income gdi gdi has two main components personal income and corporate profits bea reported that q1 gross domestic income gdi jumped 11 4 annualized in q1 with personal income jumping 59 annualized helped by record federal stimulus payments while operating profits showed no gain a decline in operating margins helps explain the weak profit performance against a backdrop of rapid nominal growth factors that squeezed q1 margins include private sector wage and salary cost increasing faster than gdp prices 4 6 versus 4 3 and a 20 jump in costs for intermediate materials and supplies there you go it s all about inflation crushing profit margins almost into non existence that will put a bear hug squeeze on stock valuations because it will become harder to profit share through dividends when there are no profits to share because business is rapidly rising but inflation in producer costs is rapidly eating all those profits up we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us declines in profits margins are more late cycle events so drop the q1 margins which comes on the heels of a drop in q4 2020 as well bears watching especially with equity markets trading at record highs with elevated price to earnings ratios corporations will of course borrow their profits from the future using the fed s cheap credit to keep paying dividends on non existing real profits the chicanery and greed continue but inflation will make it harder and harder for the fed to keep those rates down and we already saw a hat tipping move in the financial tightening direction by the fed when it announced it would be rolling off its corporate bond holdings occulted inflation is insidiously eating you alive one way companies have of dealing with producer inflation costs that they have a hard time passing along or are reluctant to pass along for fear of losing market share to companies that don t is to make everything a little smaller and hope you don t take notice do you remember the times when you were sure your x brand burger had shrunk in diameter or the patty got thinner or a little mealier or fattier well those ways of trying to hide inflation by keeping it out of the price are a trend right now consumers are paying more for a growing range of household staples in ways that don t show up on receipts thinner rolls lighter bags smaller cans as companies look to offset rising labor and materials costs without scaring off customers it s a form of retail camouflage known as shrinkflation and economists and consumer advocates who track packaging expect it to become more pronounced as inflation ratchets up consumers check the price every time they buy but they don t check the net weight said edgar dworsky a consumer advocate do we raise the price knowing consumers will see it and grumble about it or do we give them a little bit less and accomplish the same thing often it s easier to do the latter slimmed down product sizes are reflected in government inflation data to some extent according to jonathan church an economist with the consumer price index program at the bureau of labor statistics though the bureau s ability to weigh items has been limited during the pandemic because of restrictions on in person data collection he said there has been a marked shift toward smaller packages of chips and other snack foods greenwich time you might not have noticed a fairly high amount of inflation that has set in already because its been obscured as shrinkage and that might not have been factored accurately into the government cpi numbers either there probably isn t any push from either the fed or the government to get that inflation factored into cpi either as both hope to sustain the government s high deficit spending a little longer to keep driving markets up and sustaining a badly damaged economy that merely buried all of its fault zones after the great recession kicked the can down the road and because the government doesn t want to pay more in social security benefits tagged to cpi etc every raw material we re buying right now is at a materially higher cost than we planned james hagedorn chief executive of scotts miracle gro said on an earnings call last month distribution costs are higher too so we re going to do what we need to to keep our business healthy the catch for the stock market in months ahead is that companies have already been doing this clandestine re sizing so they may not have much room left to use that hidden approach to inflation as you can only trick penny wise people so far before they begin to catch on that little bit of slack may be close to used up once it is the inflation rate in prices may pick up pace even more because inflation cannot be hidden any further costco executives said last week they were paying higher prices for inventory as much as 20 percent more for beef for example and up to 10 percent more on clothing though the warehouse chain has so far shouldered most of those increases along with rising costs for freight transportation and labor chief financial officer richard galanti said it may have to raise prices on such staples as its 4 99 rotisserie chicken or 40 pack of bottled water now 2 99 to maintain profit margins inflation pressures abound he said in an earnings call tillamook county creamery association reports we ve seen costs rise before but we ve never seen it happen so rapidly and all at the same time the article just referenced gives a number of clever examples from our everyday shopping if you want to drill deeper firing up the grill it s not just the food you buy at the grocery story that is either rising in price or diminishing in size the impact when you eat out may even be greater as restaurants have struggled worse than any industry with mandated closures and then mandated partial closures when they are open social distancing restaurants nationwide raise prices amid soaring costs labor shortage there s something new on the menu bigger bills if we re getting squeezed there s only two ways to handle it either cut costs or raise prices there s no alternatives really hakan swahn the owner of midtown s aquavit told the post monday the nordic cuisine purveyor said he s spending about 15 percent more on supplies while customers checks are on average about 15 to 20 percent higher ciro casella the co owner of san matteo pizzeria on the upper east side said the price for everything even pizza boxes they raised like crazy he griped i used to pay 12 95 for a bundle now it went to 17 95 delivery fees are up olive oil went up 30 percent buffalo mozzarella went up 30 a case tomatoes went up 30 percent if the prices don t go down in a few months i m going to have to raise the menu prices during the pandemic suppliers shrunk their operations after many restaurants closed and demand plummeted but now that all of new york is reopening at the same time restaurateurs say they re facing a surge and having trouble keeping up with demand compounding the issue is a nationwide shortage of not just chicken and beef but workers it s a perfect storm said andrew rigie head of the new york city hospitality alliance trade group we have food prices going up the labor crunch pushing wage and benefit costs up and on top of that the extraordinarily trying past 15 months due to the pandemic new york post fed stimulus of course is enabling the worker shortage as an unwanted side effect by paying them more to not work and that is the kind of thing that causes diminishing returns which ultimately result in stimulus having to end because the medicine becomes more toxic than the disease you can only take so much chemotherapy in a pandemicly overstressed overstretched market that has little resilience to absorb higher costs on top of all the restaurant losses last year the one offsetting advantage from covid report some restauranteurs is that customers are drinking a lot heavier and booze has always been the area where restaurants experience their highest profit margins if life gives you a lemon make long island ice tea autobondage used car prices continued to soar since my last report ascending like a fiery rocket into the stratosphere used car prices are rising at their most rapid rate in thirty years because old cars are not being traded in on new cars because new cars are not being shipped because they cannot get essential parts because of transportation bottle necks that resulted from years of trade wars and covid closures that is how things work the counterbalance there are always countervailing forces that can bring equilibrium incomes may be about to fall if the government stimulus checks particularly those that augment and extend unemployment benefits begin to fall as scheduled available income or savings may also fall as or if government forbearance on mortgages and rent terminate in september as previously planned leaving people with less fed fat to spend personal savings built up by all the stimulus have already begun to come back down probably because its hard to save in a world with so much inflation exposed and hidden bloomberg via zero hedge half the savings buffer is now gone that may be why consumer sentiment is falling which can also curtail inflation confidence is rising for the present time but expectations for the future are declining perhaps because people are suddenly starting to see inflation everywhere and are wondering how far it is going to go if the government lets the stimuli roll off business will rapidly decline but if it kicks the can on stimulus termination down the road as it already has a couple of times then government borrowing and fed money printing will continue to roar right along driving inflation on longer if stimulus continues at the present levels util the inflated mother of all bears says you re not getting away with any of this there is no free escape from the troubles you have caused yourselves that s my thesis either the fed tightens because inflation s jaws narrow its maneuvering room killing all markets or inflation grows into the great black bear of a hole that soon eats up all the fed is doing faster than the fed can do it the jaws are closing and that s the price you pay for faking economic recovery for more than a decade rather than actually resolving the numerous and massive flaws in your economic framework it is for example the end destination for choosing endless bailouts over painful corporate restructuring which required fed and government financing it s the price of solving every problem with wider rounds of debt to kick the can down the road instead of clearing out all the dead wood which required fed and government financing it s the price of designing markets to function as speculative gambling casinos instead of as actual markets that exist just to buy and own a piece of the american pie in order to share in american profits almost all of that casino action was fueled into a conflagration by fed and government financing translate that into any country of your choosing it is the cost of ignoring economic fundamentals until the economies that all markets ultimately rest upon fail it s where the fed s entire badly designed greed based great recovery has been headed as its final destination for years i do my best to warn about it it ultimately burns up in its own inflation conflagration

just a year ago the financial future looked bleak for state governments as governors and lawmakers scrambled to cut spending amid the coronavirus recession that was projected to pummel revenue they laid off state workers threatened big cuts to schools and warned about canceling or scaling back building projects among other steps today many of those same states are flush with cash and lawmakers are passing budgets with record spending money is pouring into schools social programs and infrastructure at the same time many states are socking away billions of dollars in savings it s definitely safe to say that states are in a much better fiscal situation than they anticipated said erica mackellar a fiscal analyst with the national conference of state legislatures we re making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter the 4front sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox spending plans for the budget year that begins july 1 are up 10 or more in states spanning from florida and maryland to colorado utah and washington in oklahoma pandemic uncertainties last year prompted lawmakers to trim 1 3 billion from their anticipated general revenue that resulted in across the board cuts for public education and most state services this year the new budget is up nearly 18 that includes money to reduce class sizes in kindergarten and first grade funding for a new children s behavioral health center and new incentives for businesses to make movies in oklahoma the republican led legislature even set aside money to cut individual and corporate income tax rates and expand tax credits for a school choice program coronavirus pandemic full coverage of the covid 19 outbreak and how it impacts you and our communities marriages in the us are back to pre pandemic levels cdc says last year shaky foundation this year solid foundation said republican state sen roger thompson chairman of the chamber s budget writing committee many states experienced a similar turnaround fiscal analysts cite a variety of reasons the federal government poured billions of dollars into state coffers through a series of pandemic relief packages federal aid also sent billions more to u s households and businesses that in turn pumped money into the economy state finances also fared better than feared consumer spending rebounded to shore up sales tax revenue and state income taxes were bolstered by a strong stock market and high wage earners who kept working remotely while others were laid off the result is that states now face a very promising fiscal and economic outlook over the next couple of years said justin theal a state fiscal research officer at the pew charitable trusts a recent pew report found that after an initial sharp plunge in tax revenue 29 states recovered to take in as much or more during the peak pandemic period of march 2020 through february 2021 than they did during the same 12 months before the pandemic began idaho utah colorado and south carolina posted some of the biggest revenue gains along with south dakota which was one of the few states never to shut down the pew report also noted modest revenue gains for some states that imposed more aggressive coronavirus precautions on their economy including california massachusetts and new york the 212 billion budget enacted earlier this year in new york is up almost 10 over the previous one federal covid 19 relief provided the bulk of that growth but state spending alone still is up by 3 8 in the new budget according to democratic gov andrew cuomo s administration new york s bigger budget includes a mixture of ongoing and one time spending including a 1 4 billion boost in basic aid for schools and a 1 3 billion plan to overhaul penn station florida s record 101 5 billion budget is up roughly 11 with bonuses for teachers police and firefighters and new construction projects at schools and colleges lawmakers decided they had money to spare expanding sales tax breaks for school and hurricane supplies and creating a new tax free week to buy museum and concert tickets and recreational gear for camping fishing and surfing florida is among several states that amplified their 2021 22 budgets with at least part of their share of a 195 billion state aid package from the recent american rescue plan act signed by president joe biden shortly after that plan passed moody s investors service upgraded the outlook for states from negative to stable citing stronger state finances and continued federal aid it said the new federal aid equaled nearly 16 of states own revenue for the 2019 fiscal year many republicans in congress had criticized the biden relief plan as excessive especially in the amount of money going to state governments many states already had been seeing better than expected tax revenue even before the plan was signed into law in march some states such as colorado are waiting until later to decide how to use the latest covid 19 relief funds because they have until the end of 2024 to spend it even without the latest federal aid colorado s budget for the fiscal year starting july 1 is up more than 12 from the previous one which had been pared back because of pandemic concerns sen bob rankin a republican member of the legislature s joint budget committee said he is concerned about how that additional 3 8 billion of federal aid will be spent i m afraid that we are spending money and making commitments that we will not be able to sustain once that one time federal money goes away rankin said in many states lawmakers are devoting federal covid 19 relief money to one time purposes such as additional aid to workers expanded access to high speed internet or replenishing depleted unemployment trust funds missouri is among the states that has yet to decide what to do with the latest federal aid the general revenue portion of its budget has rebounded from a fiscal 2021 cut to exceed pre pandemic levels and missouri is on pace to shatter a record set in 1998 for its largest end of year cash balance revenues have performed much much better than i would have ever anticipated during a pandemic said state budget director dan haug he said he thinks missouri would have been able to weather the pandemic without this year s biden relief package lawmakers in maryland used words like stunning and unique to describe how federal aid helped reshape their budget situation the state s record 52 4 billion budget for its new fiscal year provides bonuses to state workers boosts payments to the poor builds parks and playgrounds in every county and still sets aside about 2 billion for savings after spending almost the entire part of last year in sleepless nights trying to figure out what in the world we were going to do to find yourselves in that position was pretty amazing said democratic state sen guy guzzone chairman of the senate budget and taxation committee
global share markets were mixed over the last week with eurozone shares up but us shares down slightly not helped by ongoing inflation and taper fears with japanese and chinese shares also down a bit despite the messy global lead australian shares pushed further into record territory helped along by strong economic growth data and ongoing rba dovishness the rise in the asx 200 was led by energy stocks on the back of the rising oil price utilities consumer staples property and industrial shares bond yields rose slightly in the us but were flat to down elsewhere oil prices continued to rise but metal and iron ore prices fell the a fell as the us rose just as the rebound in shares has surprised many so has the rebound in gdp and in australia both are now at record highs the stronger than expected 1 8 march quarter gdp growth rate in australia on top of nearly 7 growth in the second half of last year has delivered a deep v economic recovery that has taken gdp above its pre pandemic level and australia is one of only a few countries to have done so it reflects a combination of better virus control and better government support measures it also makes a nonsense of the claim that we should have just let the virus rip as countries that were far laxer in controlling it ended up with a bigger economic hit and a slower recovery this quarter will likely see slower growth as the easy reopening gains are behind us and as the victorian lockdown impacts but the lockdown locks like being relatively short and as such is only likely to detract 0 3 or less from june quarter gdp see below more broadly there are strong grounds for optimism that the economic expansion in australia will continue at a decent rate increasing vaccination will underpin reopening and eventually put an end to lockdowns global growth is strong the outlook for consumer spending home building and business investment is strong and fiscal and monetary stimulus continue the strong economic recovery is underpinning a strong rebound in profits which is being magnified by the impact of past corporate cost controls and combined with continuing low interest rates will drive a further rise in australian shares just as well we revised our year end asx 200 target from 7200 to 7400 last week but even that s now looking too cautious source oecd abs amp capital there were no surprises from the rba with the key messages remaining that rate hikes are a long way off as they are rightly determined to see 3 plus wages growth which is also a long way off but they will review some of their other easing measures in july with the stronger than expected recovery we expect the bonds they buy to enforce their 0 1 yield target to remain the april 2024 bond which will mean that the period of the 0 1 target will decline over time and bond buying to be tapered or cut back to around 2 5bn a week from september consistent with the latter they even left a hint in their post meeting statement by removing a reference to being prepared to undertake more bond buying the drumbeat towards thinking about talking about tapering in the us continued over the last week with fed speakers split between those remaining dovish and seeing risks on both sides and those repeating that the fed should start thinking about tapering another pickup in cpi inflation likely to be reported on thursday in the week ahead will further spur the taper talk however there is a long way to go yet with the formal taper talk likely to start in the next few meetings and actual tapering not likely till later this year by the time it starts it will be well and truly factored into markets so it may turn out to be a re run of the december 2013 to september october 2014 taper that saw us shares continue to rise and of course tapering is not monetary tightening and it took two years from the start of tapering in december 2013 to the first fed rate hike in december 2015 coronavirus update the good news on coronavirus is that the trend remains down in new global cases and deaths the number of new cases has more than halved in india and developed countries are seeing a continuing sharp fall as vaccines do their job in europe and the us the bad news is that various countries continue to see upswings including many countries in south america south africa malaysia vietnam and south korea with the problems in south east asia highlighting the risks for countries that have low immunity either from direct exposure of via vaccines with covid tolerance low though in asia several countries have announced new lockdowns and will likely control it pretty quickly source ourworldindata org amp capital in australia the bad news is that the snap lockdown in melbourne was extended for another seven days however the good news is that the number of new daily cases has trended down since the lockdown began despite increased testing and is relatively low as is the trend in new cases in australia in total suggesting that the lockdown is working all of which adds to confidence that the lockdown will be short source covid19data com au as a result we retain our assessment that the economic impact from the snap lockdown in victoria will be relatively minor although still horrible for those directly impacted as spending is temporarily hit but bounces back quickly once the lockdown ends as has been the case in response to other snap lockdowns across australia since late last year so we continue to see an economic cost of around 1 2bn rather than the 15 20bn or more cost of last year s july to october lockdown in victoria this would amount to a 0 3 hit to june quarter national gdp but it would likely be less than this as economic activity bounces back once the lockdown ends the announcement from the federal government that workers unable to earn an income due to lockdowns in hotspots would be eligible for weekly payments of up to 500 will help but its not clear how many will actually get it given the conditions it comes with it may not be that relevant if the lockdown ends soon but if not support will have to be increased vaccination continues to ramp up globally but only 11 of the global population has received at least one dose of vaccine with only 8 in emerging countries and 40 in developed countries the uk is now at 60 the us is at 52 europe is at 40 and australia is at 18 the success of the vaccines continues to be evident in israel the uk and the us which have seen a collapse in new cases hospitalisations and deaths source ourworldindata org amp capital our australian economic activity tracker our australian economic activity tracker fell sharply over the last week as a result of victoria s lockdown with most components falling highlighting the threat to the recovery if the lockdown is long the fall has been bigger than seen in response to the other snap lockdowns seen in australia since november as the others affected less people and were arguably associated with less fear however if the lockdown is relaxed soon we are likely to see the rising trend in economic activity quickly resume again as seen after the various other snap lockdowns ended source amp capital our us economic activity tracker is almost back to its pre coronavirus level and our european tracker is now rising rapidly as europe reopens based on weekly data for eg job ads restaurant bookings confidence mobility credit debt card transactions retail foot traffic hotel bookings source amp capital sticking with the beatles and love after last week with ringo if you put aside the silly her majesty very last lines in the end which was the last serious song on the beatles abbey road album that was their final recorded album as let it be came out later but was recorded earlier were and in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make i always thought that it was really amazing that the closing statement from the beatles were those thoughtful and inspiring words sure the philosophical concept is hardly original but that they had come to that realisation and were prepared to end what turned out to be their final album as a group with those words is pretty inspiring and got me to thinking about them earlier in life than i might otherwise have any way paul mccartney continued on with the focus on love to the point that wings had a monster hit with silly love songs inspired by john lennon

weather the storm better than many we re not a large business she notes some deliveries were affected but we don t have any physical shops so we don t have stock sitting there without being able to reach customers alexa s spring 2021 collection vertigo was conceived pre pandemic yet in an example of the oracle at work again was inspired by horror films and movies with a general sense of unease isn t it weird she says i was looking at the shining stanley kubrick and david lynch the collection before that was about a global catastrophe that forced people to live underground and grow their own vegetables you might be relieved to hear that the designs she s working on next are less apocalyptic more optimistic for spring summer 2022 the inspiration is pure saturday night fever she says it s

about her and can be drawn into replying to comments on her instagram posts i used to be worse she says if the comments are untrue i get cross i watched a video i did the other day and people were

one of my favourites of all the countries i have visited is japan tokyo is a sprawling city of 13 8 million people and yet you can walk through its leafy boulevards without having to constantly watch your back it is a clean safe and orderly place i was once invited to dinner at the home of a senior diplomat in tokyo over a sumptuous meal the couple explained to me that their only son a graduate of the london school of economics and political science had absolutely no interest in living abroad not very untypical of his generation no country offers them the comfort security and the good life that japan does japan is one of the most advanced technological nations in the world when the trains are three minutes late it makes headlines the japanese diet is one of the healthiest in the world comprising mostly of fish lentils and fruits japan has a population of 125 million people with a gross per capita income of 5 4 trillion coming just behind the usa and china it has a per capita income of 43 000 with limited natural resources and a land ever so prone to earthquakes and tsunamis they have built a life some of us can only dream of for centuries they were a closed society ruled by a feudal samurai warrior shogunate the meiji restoration of 1868 set the country on the path to industrialisation and national transformation what is remarkable about the japanese is that they pursued the path of industrialisation without necessarily succumbing to the paradigm of westernisation they became a prosperous nation while preserving the essence of their culture and civilisation many japanese are dedicated to the goddess amaterasu and the shinto religion many are also buddhists the remarkable transformation of japan after the devastation of world war ii is one of the key developments of the 20th century every schoolchild knows about the nuclear bombs that were dropped on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 by the americans on the orders of president harry truman an estimated 195 000 perished in addition to thousands of wounded including succeeding generations of children born with deformities as a genetic consequence of the nuclear fallout despite this tragedy the japanese made a remarkable come back they have faced their former enemies without any bitterness it is one of the few countries to have outlawed war in their constitution thanks to general macarthur who became the country s constitutional lawgiver japan today has an average life expectancy of 84 79 years easily one of the highest in the world indeed there are more 100 year olds on the island of okinawa than anywhere else in the world the japanese enjoy one of the highest standards of living among the advanced industrial nations with a human development index of 0 919 with 1 0 being the perfect score the japanese are known for their legendary work ethics despite the supernal prowess of china in recent years tokyo still maintains an edge over beijing in terms of the quality of its products legend has it that the japanese used to produce rather shoddy products until mit professor edward demming introduced to them the concept of total quality management they took to it with panache more so that it resonated with their own traditional philosophy of kaizen continuous improvement japan is by no means a perfect society for one thing it is a rapidly ageing society the average age is 48 4 compared to nigeria s 18 1 years within the coming decades japan is likely to experience labour shortages and pension challenges as a result of these unfavourable demographics japan also faces other social problems it is one of the highest suicide rates in the world with about 14 9 per cent per 100 000 persons the country went through what has been termed the lost decade in the 1990s following a stock market bubble that was sooner destined to obey the law of gravity they had to battle with deflation slow growth and a rising national debt which currently stands at 13 6 trillion a staggering 257 percent of gdp despite these challenges japan is a prosperous democracy a cohesive and stable nation with a highly productive and innovative knowledge economy the major philosophy underpinning japanese flourishing is known as ikagai literally meaning a reason for being it refers to having a meaning for being a direction and life purpose four fundamental components of life are embedded in the ikigai philosophy passion vocation profession and mission remarkably this philosophy emerged in okinawa an island that was the epicentre of the war between the united states and japan okinawa lost more than 200 000 people out of that immense tragedy they evolved a philosophy that gave them renewed hope for the future in a manner of speaking they had found their ikigai out of the cauldron of war and suffering they have built a sense of community anchored on kindness purpose and living in the moment it is no surprise therefore that the okinawans have such a zest for living living to be a hundred is now the norm in okinawa aided by a good climate excellent food social harmony and peace the japanese believe that every human being has an ikigai pronounced ee kee guy a path to life fulfilment the ikigai philosophy is not a quick fix happiness pill that you can swallow the japanese are not a particularly happy people either but scientific research has shown that a combination of a balanced diet exercise and life mission focus has been at the heart of japanese longevity and flourishing the german american psychiatrist viktor frankl in his famous book man s search for meaning beacon press 1992 confessed that as an inmate of a german concentration camp he found that those who perished were mostly those who lost the will to live he confessed that whenever he himself was about to give up he imagined all the great scientific works that he wanted to produce and the future that lay ahead you could say that in japanese parlance he had found his ikigai the foundation of ikigai lies in answering the key questions what gets you up in the morning what puts you in your best element during what activities do you experience flow what do you find easy to do what did you like doing as a kid the essence of finding your ikigai is when what you love and are good at meets what you can be valued and paid for because it is needed by the world once you are able to identify these key elements about yourself you should resolve to follow your own compass ikigai does not promise the elixir to eternal happiness it is not a magic lantern to making billions of dollars it is merely a key that opens the door to the resplendent mansion of hope self actualisaion and personal fulfilment a life of purpose undoubtedly contributes to the prospects of a long and happy life in a time of great stress in our country i recommend this philosophy for people who face anxiety and fear in our lawless and nihilistic country companies government and other organisations can build the ikigai philosophy into their corporate culture by making the workspace a happier experience it has been proved that workers would much prefer working in a happy organisation with lesser pay than in an unhappy organisation that pays more we face dark times rumours of war everywhere hunger and anger stare us in the face the easiest temptation is despair and give up many young people are trying desperately to flee to canada or the united states our skies are overcast with bad omens as the immortal christopher okigbo put it and the secret thing in its heaving threatens with iron mask the last lighted torch of the century i solemnly prophesy that after the storm a rainbow will appear therefore keep going no matter what discover your own ikigai keep walking the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step find your life purpose and pursue it dream big follow your vocation and star for the bloodthirsty demons that currently stalk our land with arrogant swagger will sooner or later eat the dust of their own wickedness the dawn of a new nigeria beckons copyright punch all rights reserved this material and other digital content on

a federal judge has overturned california s three decade old ban on assault weapons calling it a failed experiment that violates people s constitutional right to bear arms u s district judge roger benitez of san diego ruled on friday that the state s definition of illegal military style rifles unlawfully deprives law abiding californians of weapons commonly allowed in most other states and by the u s supreme court under no level of heightened scrutiny can the law survive benitez said he issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of the law but stayed it for 30 days to give state attorney general rob bonta time to appeal gov gavin newsom condemned the decision calling it a direct threat to public safety and the lives of innocent californians period in his 94 page ruling the judge spoke favorably of modern weapons and said they were overwhelmingly used for legal reasons like the swiss army knife the popular ar 15 rifle is a perfect combination of home defense weapon and homeland defense equipment good for both home and battle the judge said in his ruling s introduction that comparison completely undermines the credibility of this decision and is a slap in the face to the families who ve lost loved ones to this weapon newsom said in a statement we re not backing down from this fight and we ll continue pushing for common sense gun laws that will save lives bonta called the ruling flawed and said it will be appealed california first restricted assault weapons in 1989 with multiple updates to the law since then assault weapons as defined by the law are more dangerous than other firearms and are disproportionately used in crimes mass shootings and against law enforcement with more resulting casualties the state attorney general s office argued and barring them furthers the state s important public safety interests a surge in sales of more than 1 16 million other types of pistols rifles and shotguns in the last year more than a third of them to likely first time buyers show that the assault weapons ban has not prevented law abiding citizens in the state from acquiring a range of firearms for lawful purposes including self defense the state contended in a court filing in march similar assault weapon restrictions have previously been upheld by six other federal district and appeals courts the state argued overturning the ban would allow not only assault rifles but things like assault shotguns and assault pistols state officials said but benitez disagreed this case is not about extraordinary weapons lying at the outer limits of second amendment protection the banned assault weapons are not bazookas howitzers or machine guns those arms are dangerous and solely useful for military purposes his ruling said instead the firearms deemed assault weapons are fairly ordinary popular modern the judge said despite california s ban there currently are an estimated 185 569 assault weapons registered with the state they were grandfathered in before california s evolving definition of an assault weapon this is an average case about average guns used in average ways for average purposes the ruling said one is to be forgiven if one is persuaded by news media and others that the nation is awash with murderous ar 15 assault rifles the facts however do not support this hyperbole and facts matter in california murder by knife occurs seven times more often than murder by rifle he added he also called the ban a continuing failed experiment which does not achieve its objectives of preventing mass shootings or attacks on law enforcement officers in a preliminary ruling in september benitez said california s complicated legal definition of assault weapons can ensnare otherwise law abiding gun owners with criminal penalties that among other things can strip them of their second amendment right to own firearms the burden on the core second amendment right if any is minimal the state argued because the weapons can still be used just not with the modifications that turn them into assault weapons modifications like a shorter barrel or collapsible stock make them more concealable state officials said while things like a pistol grip or thumbhole grip make them more lethal by improving their accuracy as they are fired rapidly the lawsuit filed by the san diego county gun owners political action committee california gun rights foundation second amendment foundation and firearms policy coalition is among several by gun advocacy groups challenging california s firearms laws which are among the strictest in the nation it was filed on behalf of gun owners who want to use high capacity magazines in their legal rifles or pistols but said they can t because doing so would turn them into illegal assault weapons under california law unlike military weapons the semi automatic rifles fire one bullet each time the trigger is pulled and the plaintiffs say they are legal in 41 states the lawsuit said california is one of only a small handful states to ban many of the most popular semiautomatic firearms in the nation because they possess one or more common characteristics such as pistol grips and threaded barrels frequently but not exclusively along with detachable ammunition magazines brandon combs the president of the firearms policy coalition said in a statement that the ruling held what millions of americans already know to be true bans on so called assault weapons are unconstitutional and cannot stand a gun control advocacy group called the judge s ruling alarming and especially insulting because it was handed down on national gun violence awareness day too many families across the nation have lost loved ones in shootings carried out with assault weapons they can attest to the reality that these weapons are not like swiss army knives nor are mass shootings only a very small problem said robyn thomas executive director of the giffords law center to prevent gun violence a group led by gabrielle giffords the former congresswoman from arizona who was shot and wounded in a mass shooting 10 years ago the state is appealing benitez s 2017 ruling against the state s nearly two decade old ban on the sales and purchases of magazines holding more than 10 bullets that decision triggered a weeklong buying spree before the judge halted sales during the appeal it was upheld in august by a three judge appellate panel but the 9th u s circuit court of appeals said in march that an 11 member panel will rehear the case the state also is appealing benitez s decision in april 2020 blocking a 2019 california law requiring background checks for anyone buying ammunition both of those measures were championed by newsom when he was lieutenant governor and they were backed by voters in a 2016 ballot measure

just last week some of the world s largest integrated energy companies faced the wrath of furious investors and climate activism exxon mobil nyse xom lost three board seats to engine no 1 an activist hedge fund in a stunning proxy campaign while a good 61 of chevron nyse cvx shareholders voted to further cut emissions at the company s annual investor meeting a week ago engine no 1 has told the financial times that exxon will need to cut fossil fuel production for the company to position itself for long term success what we re saying is plan for a world where maybe the world doesn t need your barrels engine no 1 leader charlie penner has told ft meanwhile a dutch court has ordered royal dutch shell nyse rds a to cut its greenhouse gas emissions harder and faster than it had previously planned whereas climate change issues are the presumptive reasons behind the latest wave of investor revolts at the oil and gas giants lurking beneath the surface is a growing sense of apprehension about big oil s strategy and failure to generate adequate returns for shareholders in recent decades the naked truth is that exxon and its cohorts have severely underperformed the broader market over the last two decades in terms of total returns to shareholders implying the sector s woes are long term and strategic rather than short term and cyclical chronic underperformance source cnn money big oil s underperformance relative to the market is clearly evident whether you are looking at 2 year 5 year 10 year or even 20 year timespans for instance since 2015 exxon shares have returned a 2 5 compound annual loss based on share prices and dividends a far cry from the average annual gain of 14 4 by the s p 500 over the timeframe over the past two decades exxon s compound annual return has clocked in at 4 2 still considerably lower than the broad market benchmark s return of 7 1 related u s cities and states clash over natural gas exxon is hardly alone with none of its peers including chevron royal dutch shell nyse rds a bp inc nyse bp and total nyse tot coming close to matching the returns by the broader share market over the past decade in fact on an inflation adjusted u s dollar basis returns by exxon shell and bp have been negative over the past five years a period which coincided with the biggest bull market in the history of the stock market the renewable energy conundrum you cannot blame the oil majors for continuing to engage in a lot of hand wringing at a time when investors are demanding they pump less oil and transition to cleaner energy for the oil majors successfully transitioning to green energy companies is not going to be a walk in the park because these companies have to ride two horses that s the case because the majority are already battling dwindling cash flows which means they cannot afford to gamble with whatever little is left oil prices have been on a downtrend since 2014 a situation that has only worsened during the pandemic oil and gas firms are still grappling with the best way to presently use dwindling cash flows in effect they are still weighing whether it s worthwhile to at least partially reinvent themselves as renewables businesses while also determining which low carbon energy markets offer the most attractive future returns most renewable ventures like solar and wind projects tend to churn out cash flows akin to annuities for several decades after initial up front capital expenditure with generally low price risk as opposed to their current models with faster payback but high oil price risk with the need to generate quick shareholder returns some fossil fuel companies have actually been scaling back their clean energy investments advertisement energy companies are also faced with another conundrum diminishing returns from their clean energy investments related we ll see 200 oil russia opec ministers blast iea s net zero plan a paper published in science direct last august says that dramatic reductions in the cost of wind and solar have been leading to an even bigger reduction in revenue inflows leading to falling profits this is particularly true for wind energy as later deployments of wind usually have lower market value than earlier ones due to wind energy revenue declining more rapidly than cost reductions solar is more resilient with technological progress approximately balancing out the revenue degradation which perhaps explains why solar stocks have gone ballistic adding wind and solar to our grid tends to reduce electricity prices during peak generation times indeed electricity prices in california can come down to zero during long sunny durations this was not a problem for early deployments but is becoming a major concern as renewables increasingly play a bigger part in our electricity generation mix but ultimately big oil will have to take the plunge and engage in drastic internal restructuring and product cycle transitions even as activists like engine no 1 promise to continue turning the screw as charlie penner of engine no 1 has told ft the energy transition is happening faster than expected and has undermined big oil s assumptions about long term demand for its oil by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com
i move that a sum not exceeding 1 522 000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of march 1951 for the salaries and expenses of the office of the minister for industry and commerce including certain services administered by that office and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants in aid the estimate for the department of industry and commerce for 1950 1951 shows a net decrease of 1 064 414 as compared with 1949 1950 after excluding from the 1949 1950 column a sum of 74 096 in respect of the central statistics office which is now provided for in a separate vote there are decreases on several sub heads of the vote but the principal decreases are in the provisions for food subsidies sub head j 1 county councils turf production sub head o 2 provision for repayment of advances for rural electrification sub head r and salaries wages and allowances sub head a the figures shown in the 1949 1950 column for these sub heads with the exception of r are the adjusted figures after account was taken of estimated savings for purposes of a token supplementary estimate last year compared with the provisions actually made in last year s estimate the reductions are approximately 489 000 on sub head j 1 384 000 on sub head o 2 300 000 on sub head r and 105 000 on sub head a the decrease of almost 105 000 in the provision for salaries etc in sub head a is due in part to a further curtailment of emergency controls and in part to a special effort that has been made in my department to reduce administrative costs it will be of interest to deputies to know that in the period from 1st january 1948 to 31st march 1950 there was a reduction of 408 posts representing 125 000 per annum in the sections of the department provided for in this sub head these are net reductions after excluding the staff of the former statistics branch and the staff assigned to the industrial development authority and now shown in sub head s 2 the supply position of commodities was reviewed in the dáil quite recently on the passage of the supplies and services act in december 1949 i am glad to say that the supply position generally continues to be fairly satisfactory during the past year distribution controls were removed from a number of commodities and there were substantial easements in other controls some rationing schemes continue to be necessary however either because there is some element of uncertainty in the supply position of the commodity concerned or because they are complementary to arrangements for restricting the cost of living the provision which is made for food subsidies this year in the estimate for my department is intended to relate to tea the tea supply position is safeguarded for more than a year ahead and purchases continue to be made in the countries of origin in order to avoid unnecessary expenditure of subsidy i introduced revised rationing arrangements from 1st august last these revised arrangements have worked satisfactorily and as a result the provision expected to be required for tea subsidy in 1950 1951 is reduced to 1 790 000 as compared with 2 000 000 in the estimate for 1949 1950 sales of unrationed sugar at the special price to manufacturers caterers and general consumers have been and are expected to continue to be at such a high rate that it has been found practicable to dispense with a subsidy from the exchequer this year for sugar it continues to be necessary to retain rationing however because without it the dual price arrangement which enables the price of rationed sugar to be maintained at 4d a lb could not be operated the sugar supply position continues to be satisfactory the supply position of petrol also continues to be satisfactory but as deputies are aware the purchase of petrol involves a substantial drain on our dollar resources and because of the uncertainty which naturally attends the dollar outlook for the future i have been hesitant to abolish petrol rationing i am keeping the position under very close review however and deputies may be satisfied that as soon as it can safely be done the rationing will be abolished the new system which has been in operation since the 1st january has not only removed inconveniences for users but has enabled administrative costs to be severely curtailed in pursuance of the policy of shedding as many controls as possible controls on prices are removed at the earliest suitable opportunity and during the past year the number of price control orders was reduced from 141 to 9 about half the orders at present in force relate to the maximum prices which may be charged for foodstuffs for human consumption sufficiency of supplies and resultant competition coupled with consumer resistance to attempts at excessive price charging have in many cases succeeded in reducing prices or in preventing increases it is clear however that in the conditions obtaining in the importation manufacture and distribution of many commodities in plentiful supply it would be unsafe to place reliance on the laws of supply and demand and my experience is that judicious price control offers one of the most effective methods of keeping the cost of living in check in addition to formal controls by price control order prices are kept in check by arrangements between my department and individual concerns under which the profits of the businesses affected are kept from exceeding a figure fixed for each concern after an examination of accounts in the department the cost of living index figures provide a pointer to the efficacy of those controls and arrangements which are still being retained taking 100 as the basis for august 1947 the figure in february 1948 and in february 1949 was 99 while in february 1950 it was 100 when deputies reflect on the improvement in the prices of agricultural produce in the last two years on the extension of protective measures affecting essential articles of clothing and footwear the increases in wages and salaries consequent on the national agreement between organisations of employers and of trade unions and the effects of devaluation which have been felt keenly in the clothing group they must i submit agree that the present retail prices situation while deserving of the close attention and concern it receives from the government gives cause for a high degree of satisfaction i can assure the house that the trend of prices will continue to be watched carefully and that where the public interest so demands appropriate action will be speedily taken it will be noted that a token sum only has been inserted in sub head o 2 which provides for the cost of the turf production scheme formerly undertaken by the county councils and now operated by bord na móna in february last it was decided not to proceed with production under the scheme in the present season for the reason that operations in previous seasons have proved wholly uneconomic and in many districts difficulty has been experienced in disposing of the turf produced bord na móna had at the time 83 000 tons of turf unsold out of a total production of 176 000 tons in the years 1948 and 1949 it will be necessary to dispose of a quantity of this turf at prices much below the actual cost of production excluding overheads and capital charges it has since been decided to continue production under the scheme in a modified form in the present season and work is proceeding on that basis operations are confined to certain bogs in counties roscommon westmeath meath galway tipperary clare kerry and limerick where it is anticipated no serious difficulty will arise in the disposal of the turf produced and at a price which will cover the actual cost of production with a small contribution towards overheads excluding capital charges the expenditure on the scheme is estimated at 94 000 in the current year and it will be necessary to provide for that sum by way of a supplementary estimate on this vote later in the year receipts from the sale of turf in the year and the value of the turf remaining unsold at 31st march 1951 are estimated to total 80 000 consequently it is anticipated that the net loss on the operations will be about 14 000 employment will however be given to 850 men at the peak period a sum of 25 375 only appears in the estimates for rural electrification subsidy as against a provision of 325 000 last year but i must explain that this does not mean that there is any curtailment of the development programme on the contrary the subsidy to be met this year amounts to 625 000 which is 300 000 more than last year all the capital for rural electrification is provided in the first instance in the form of advances from the central fund under the 1945 act the electricity supply board is liable for the repayment with interest of one half of the advances the act provides for the repayment of the other half to the central fund out of voted moneys the purpose being to secure that the initial borrowings to cover the subsidy moiety of the advances will be repaid out of revenue in 1949 50 the amount voted covered the repayment of one half of the advances made in the calendar year 1948 this year it was decided that the requirement of the 1945 act would be satisfied by charging to voted moneys an annuity designed to repay the subsidy moiety of the advances over the same term of years 50 as the electricity supply board is given to repay the moiety for which it is liable the effect is to reduce the immediate charge to voted moneys and to secure a fairer distribution over time of the burden on the taxpayer which the subsity for rural electrification entails a further justification for the course adopted is that while the capital for rural electrification will be provided over a relatively short terms of years the benefits of the scheme will be of a lasting character it has been suggested in some quarters that there is a slowing down in the rate of progress of development and in order to dispel this misapprehension and clarify the position i may say that in 1947 432 miles of line were erected and 1 286 consumers connected in 1948 the mileage was 1 480 and the number of consumers connected 7 287 while in 1949 the mileage of lines was 1 997 and the consumers connected 13 087 in the present year it is hoped to erect 2 250 miles of line and to connect 15 000 consumers it will be seen from these figures that the rate of progress since development commenced has been progressively accelerated and as the board s organisation becomes perfected and experienced it is reasonable to assume that there will be further progressive acceleration in the rate of expansion so far as employment is concerned the number of men at present engaged on the work is about 950 the government and the electricity supply board are anxious that the work should proceed as rapidly as possible a difficulty which the board has had to cope with in its early stages was a shortage of skilled and semi skilled workers but this has been largely overcome the difficulty is and has been to obtain sufficient electrical engineers and the board has absorbed most of the students qualified in recent years from our electrical engineering schools the industrial development authority is provided for under sub heads s 1 and s 2 in the course of the recent debates in the dáil on the industrial development authority bill i dealt at length with the activities of the authority and do not propose therefore to do any more at this stage than to refer in the broadest terms to the authority s functions and activities the authority has carried out much preliminary work in connection with the development of export trade export credit arrangements methods of increasing efficiency or production and reducing production costs the range and quality of industrial products alternative activities for industrial concerns already established here which for reasons beyond their control have not proved successful the arranging of financial assistance for new industrial projects and the counteracting of devices adopted by outside firms to evade tariffs since its inception the authority has had before it over 200 industrial proposals of these many relate to things not hitherto made here many of the projects are in an advanced stage of development and the erection of factory premises is actually in progress in several cases in a large number of other cases the authority has been engaged in discussions with a view to bringing about an expansion of the activities of existing concerns mostly outside the dublin area the authority is in direct and continuing touch with a number of local development associations and has made contacts for some of them with persons both within and without the country anxious to establish industries here members of the authority have visited over 60 factories including some in england scotland and northern ireland as well as at home this is a new departure in the investigation of tariff applications or new industrial proposals and is regarded as particularly important because it reveals a type of information and gives a background knowledge that could not be obtained from a mere examination of documents in the last year new industrial projects went into production in the counties of carlow cavan cork dublin galway kildare laoighis leitrim longford louth meath offaly tipperary waterford westmeath wexford wicklow in all over 60 factories were opened during the year and in addition many existing factories extended their activities i do not want to burden deputies with statistics but perhaps i shall be pardoned if i mention just a few figures which will illustrate the extent of our progress on the industrial side in the last 12 months the provisional estimates of the numbers engaged in industrial production show an increase from 184 000 in 1948 to 206 000 in 1949 an increase of 12 per cent i might add that the comparable figure for 1938 was 166 000 in the year 1949 the volume of production in the industries producing transportable goods was 7 per cent above the volume for the year 1948 and 43 per cent above the volume for the year 1938 for the last quarter of 1949 the volume of production in these industries showed an increase of 10 per cent over the volume in the last quarter of 1948 in industry as a whole i e including building and construction public works of the state and local authorities transport and public utilities the provisional figure of production show a volume increase in 1949 of 9 per cent over 1948 and of 39 per cent over 1938 in 1949 as compared with 1948 the most notable increases in output of industrial goods occurred in the production of tobacco bricks pottery glass cement metals timber textiles and clothing fellmongery and leather and paper making and manufactured stationery these figures speak for themselves they tell a story of steady progress and i suggest clearly reflect the confidence of the public in the government s industrial policy it is important that our industries should be as efficient as possible and i would most strongly and earnestly urge on everyone connected with industrial activity how essential it is to cut out wasteful and out dated methods and processes so that quality goods can be produced at competitive prices reports from different undertakings disclose discrepancies in productivity which show that there is substantial room for improvement in the rate of output by certain concerns some businesses have found it very useful to take advice from an industrial consultant others have effected improvements by modernising their methods and installing the latest machinery the services of the institute for industrial research and standards which is financed by an annual grant chargeable to the vote for industry and commerce are available to all industries wishing to take advantage of them i hope that our manufacturers either by contacting the institute or through some other means will do their best to bring their undertakings to the highest pitch of efficiency so that irish made goods will command sale at home and abroad on their merits a new 25 000 laboratory for the institute is nearing completion at ballymun road glasnevin of the sum of 11 800 provided in the sub head q 3 4 600 will be required to defray the balance of the cost of the erection of the laboratory and the remainder will be spent on apparatus furniture and library acquisitions when this laboratory is completed later in the year i hope that the institute will become a really effective force in irish industrialisation last year in furtherance of a campaign to foster the sale of irish made goods and overcome the preference for imported products which appeared to me to be retarding irish industrial progress i allocated 3 000 from the advertising and publicity sub head for advertising to publicise irish manufactures in the coming year it is proposed to devote 2 500 from sub head e for this purpose advertisements to date have been confined to newspapers but the question of utilising other media this year is being considered deputies will recollect that i made an appeal in the house 12 months ago for support for this campaign it is unfortunate that despite all the measures taken to promote the development of irish industry there should exist to day such a strong trade and consumer resistance to the produce of our own factories i estimated that last year up to 60 000 000 worth of goods of categories which were being made here or which could be produced in the country were imported i regret to have to inform the house that the buy irish campaign has not yet succeeded in making any noticeable impression on this huge figure for my part i can assure the house that no effort will be spared to secure the manufacture in the county of saleable goods in adequate quantity i am satisfied however that a sustained effort is needed if this resistance to irish goods is to be overcome i want to repeat here to day my appeal for the support of all deputies for this campaign i have mentioned building work so far as the building control is concerned all i need say is that until we have worked off arrears of urgent essential work i e housing hospitals schools factories etc the building of cinemas dance halls etc will have to continue to be postponed i may mention that rough estimates give a total of 21 000 000 for the value of building work executed in 1949 and a probable total of 25 000 000 for 1950 it has been obvious for some time that our cement manufacturing capacity is quite inadequate to meet the present and prospective needs of the country one of the problems which we had to face was whether the necessary additional capacity should be provided by way of extending the existing factories or by the erection of a new factory i am advised that the capital cost for a new factory with a rated output of 250 000 tons would be 2 700 000 while the cost of extensions at drogheda and limerick with a similar rated output is estimated at 1 900 000 in the case of a new factory in addition to the extra capital cost there would be a heavier burden of overhead expense i am advised that the erection of a new factory would involve an additional cost of 10 per ton on cement produced as compared with the cost of cement produced from extensions to the existing factories there would be some saving in freight by having a third factory but nothing like enough to counterbalance such a heavy increase in these circumstances the government have signified their approval of proposals for extensions to the existing factories at limerick and drogheda these extensions will provide additional rated capacity of 250 000 tons making with the existing factories a total rated capacity of 625 000 tons per annum the factories would have a potential output during peak periods of more than the rated capacity and should be capable of meeting the needs of the home market at the present rate of consumption one of the extensions should be completed in about 18 months and the other in about two years the additional employment which would be provided by the two extensions is estimated at 180 external trade continued to improve imports in 1949 fell to 129 000 000 as compared with 136 000 000 in 1948 exports rose by 11 000 000 to 60 500 000 as compared with 49 000 000 in 1948 as a result of these favourable factors our adverse balance of visible trade declined to 69 000 000 in 1949 as compared with 87 000 000 in the previous year of our total imports in 1949 amounting to 129 000 000 74 000 000 were imported from britain and the six counties and 55 000 000 from other countries of our total exports amounting to 60 500 000 54 500 000 went to great britain and the six counties and 6 000 000 to other countries during the year officers of the department of industry and commerce travelled to london frankfort paris and the hague for trade negotiations so far as industry is concerned the results of these negotiations were to provide increased facilities under trade agreements for the marketing of our industrial products abroad the overall increase in our exports in 1949 was accompanied by an encouraging increase in non agricultural exports as compared with 1948 if we disregard exceptional non recurring items such as 2 500 000 for exports of aeroplanes in 1948 and the abnormal parcel post exports in 1949 the nett normal non agricultural exports in 1949 were 12 6 million as compared with 10 2 million in 1948 representing an increase of 24 3 per cent the main increases took place in food drink and textiles the bulk of which were exported to great britain during 1949 the o e e c as part of a general scheme to liberalise trade required each participating country to free from import and currency restrictions at least 60 per cent of its trade on private account for other participating countries considerably more than 60 per cent of ireland s imports are free from import restrictions and o e e c acknowledge that ireland operates one of the most liberal import régimes in europe nevertheless o e e c requested that a list of goods be announced for which authority to import and currency facilities would be granted automatically and without limitation such a list covering about 63 per cent of ireland s imports from o e e c countries has been sent to that organisation and the necessary modifications in the exchange control orders have been made by the minister for finance belgium luxembourg western germany and switzerland have been excluded from the scope of the currency relaxations because they are hard currency areas o e e c decided in november 1949 to arrange a joint exhibition of european goods in the international trade fair to be held in chicago in august 1950 the government decided that ireland should participate jointly with other european countries and undertook to assist irish exhibitors by defraying the cost of renting space and equipping display booths to a limit of 650 per booth measuring ten feet by ten feet this decision of the government was given press and radio publicity and all firms interested in the export trade were invited to a series of meetings held in my department for the purpose of encouraging participation in the fair seven irish firms have agreed to exhibit at the fair and i have booked the necessary booths on their behalf there has been some criticism in the past year of the extent to which the factory acts and those later acts which have replaced a great part of them the conditions of employment act and the holidays employees act are being enforced by the factory inspectorate in particular the complaint has been made that the inspectors are not visiting all the premises concerned at least once a year it is true that in recent years there was a falling off in the number of visits paid this was due to a shortage of staff which was a direct result of the war the staff of the inspectorate is now being built up again though much difficulty is being experienced in finding suitable personnel to act as inspectors the results of this increase in the factory inspectorate staff are now beginning to be seen in the first quarter of this year for example the total number of visits of inspection was 1 747 as compared with 1 092 in the first quarter of 1949 provision is again made for minerals development the oireachtas passed a bill this year providing for further advances to be made to mianraí teoranta for exploration and development work in the slievardagh coalfield and the sum of 20 000 which is provided in sub head n 1 represents the share of the additional funds so authorised that is expected to be required in the current financial year provision is made in sub head n 2 of the estimate for payments to the company for prospecting work in avoca where the government authorised a scheme to be undertaken within a total cost of 120 000 there are indications that because of unexpected difficulties that have been encountered in the exploration the sum of 120 000 may not be enough to enable the exploration to be completed but the company have reported to me that it is too early for them to be able to furnish a revised estimate provision is also made in sub head n 4 for expenditure required to complete a special survey and analysis of gypsum and an hydrite deposits in the carrickmacross kingscourt area this exploration is designed to get information about the size of the deposits and the relative occurrence of the minerals i have also secured the approval of the e c a for special technical assistance so that i may be advised as to the best means of developing these deposits in the national interest the expert assigned by e c a has arrived here and is engaged on the investigations necessary to enable him to make a comprehensive report to me apart from the operations of the state sponsored company it can be said that there is greater activity than ever before since the state was established in regard to minerals on the part of private interests which are now operating on mineral deposits in a number of areas i have also sought the approval of e c a for a technical assistance scheme under which a geophysical survey would be made here by specialists from the united states of america but i have not yet been advised of the decision of e c a on this application the great importance of tourism in the national economy is evidenced by the fact that the income from it has been estimated at as much as 28 000 000 in 1949 but in present conditions its real importance lies in its dollar earning potentialities the dollar income from tourism last year amounted to 12 000 000 out of a total income from all sources of 30 000 000 the government are fully conscious of the importance of the industry and have been at pains to ensure that a plan for its development which is likely to succeed in its object will be worked out i want to make it clear that the government are not reluctant to spend money for the further development of this great national industry but they want to be assured before spending money that they are spending it on purposes likely to secure the advancement of the industry i anticipate that in the course of some months i will be able to put forward proposals which will satisfy this requirement and which will i hope secure the approval of the dáil the maximum provision which existing legislation permits to be made for the grant in aid of the irish tourist board has been made in the original estimate of 30 000 and the supplementary estimate of 15 000 for vote 14 while the determination of the broad plan for tourist development must necessarily take some time the government have in the meantime taken certain important steps towards increasing the flow of american visitors to this country the question of joint publicity in the united states to promote off season travel to europe was considered by the tourism committee of the o e e c on which this country is represented and it was decided that a campaign should be undertaken as an o e e c project the government decided that this country should participate in this joint publicity campaign during 1950 and agreed to make a contribution to o e e c for this purpose which has been fixed at 15 000 for the year provision for this contribution is made in sub head h of the estimate during the year there were discussions with the e c a mission to this country on the question of securing american technical assistance and advice as to the manner in which irish hotels should be developed and improved to enable the country to obtain a fair share of the american tourist traffic this matter was also discussed at the tourism committee of o e e c and that organisation approved of a scheme under which missions from european countries were dispatched to study american hotel methods and allied subjects four representatives of this country were included in the first party which went to the u s a on the 16th january 1950 their reports are at present being considered the approval of e c a has now been sought for securing the services of a group of american technicians to survey and report on the hotel position here and on other matters affecting the development of tourist traffic from the u s a in addition there have been discussions with e c a and irish hotel organisations about a proposal to send a party of hoteliers to the u s a the approval of e c a has been obtained and it is intended that the visit will take place in september it will afford to members of the irish hotel trade an opportunity to study american hotel methods and on their return they will be expected to make available for the benefit of the hotel trade in general the information and experience they have acquired other steps taken to foster dollar tourism were the visa requirements for american visitors the modification of import regulations relating to the quantity of goods which american tourists might bring into this country without payment of duty and of the export licensing requirements american visitors are also provided with liberal allowances of petrol for their cars an important decision taken by the government during the past year was that state aid should be provided for improvement of the passenger handling facilities at cobh a new customs shed and waiting room will be provided with adequate heating lighting and sanitary arrangements and furnishings a preliminary estimate of the cost of the work is 75 000 but reclamation and quay wall extension is necessary and trial borings have had to be undertaken on the site to verify this estimate these borings are expected to be completed shortly the execution of the proposed scheme has been entrusted to the cork harbour commissioners who will contribute 10 000 or 10 per cent of the cost of the work whichever is the less the state contribution will be made from the vote for transport and marine services part of the funds provided for the irish tourist board will be devoted to a scheme for the booking of accommodation here on a block basis by the board and for the sale of that accommodation to american travel agencies it is hoped through the medium of such a scheme to mitigate to some extent the adverse effect which shortage of suitable accommodation might have on the tourist traffic from the u s a provision has as usual been made for a substantial grant to the irish tourist association to supplement the contributions made to the association by local authorities the estimate for the industrial and commercial property registration office shows a small increase of 780 mainly in the provision for staff but on the other hand there is an increase of 5 000 under the head of extra receipts payable to the exchequer in the expected income from fees provision is made in a separate estimate no 51 for the transport and marine services administered by the department of industry and commerce the sum provided in this estimate for the current year is 370 040 this compares with an original estimate of 262 600 for last year as deputies are aware it was necessary to ask the dáil last november to pass a supplementary estimate for 4 091 000 under this vote to enable córas iompair éireann to carry on the affairs of our main transport system and in particular its financial difficulties have been considered by the dáil in the course of the debates on the transport bill and the supplementary estimate i am sure deputies will not wish me to deal again with the ground covered in those discussions the bill is now law and the board will be established on the 1st june perhaps i should take this opportunity to announce the personnel of the new transport board the chairman of the new board will be mr t c courtney m e who has been chairman of the board from february 1949 mr courtney was formerly chief engineering adviser to the department of local government since 1934 and railway inspecting officer to the department of industry and commerce mr john bruton chairman of the dublin port and docks board since 1948 ex chairman and present vicechairman of the irish cattle traders association and the cattle traders insurance board chairman of the standing committee of the irish coursing club and director of the irish public bodies mutual insurances limited mr dominick leo daly director m d daly and sons ltd irish dunlop company limited managing director carrigaline pottery company limited mr patrick joseph floyd traffic manager of the great southern railways company from 1928 to 1942 mr edward h murphy director and secretary murphy brothers limited ballina director of ballina flour mills member of four associated committees of the irish flour millers association mr william murphy official of the irish transport and general workers union senator john thomas o farrell member of seanad éireann from 1948 and from 1922 to 1936 irish secretary of the railway clerks association 1918 1948 this board will have an onerous and responsible task i am sure that deputies on all sides of the house will be anxious to give them every assistance in establishing an efficient and economic transport system which is so vital to the convenience of the public and to the development of agriculture and industry and commerce deputies will have observed that no provision is made in the vote for the current year for payments to córas iompair éireann i have already indicated my view that for some years to come it may not be possible to avoid calls on the exchequer as the new board will be established on 1st june it is only reasonable to await a report from them when they have had an opportunity of considering the matter and reporting to me what they anticipate the financial position of the company will be in his budget statement on 3rd may the minister for finance indicated that provision would be made for financial assistance to córas iompair éireann during the present financial year the entire debenture interest for which the company will be liable during that year including interest payable in respect of transport stock substituted for the common stock of córas iompair éireann and the grand canal company amounts to 450 000 the minister for finance has made provision so that he can meet these payments from the central fund under the state guarantee contained in the new transport act these moneys must be met from the central fund if the board is unable to meet them payments of interest are normally met from revenue and are deducted in arriving at the profit or loss in the annual accounts as the house is aware the new bill provides for the setting up of a transport tribunal to deal with the branch railway lines branch canals and any other matters which the minister for industry and commerce may refer to it when the board has been established the government will proceed to appoint the tribunal the entire expenditure of the tribunal will fall to be borne by the state when the estimates were being framed it was not possible to estimate what expenditure was likely to arise during the present year a token sum of 5 has been included in the estimate under this head provision is made under the heading of steamer services in respect of the subsidy to the galway bay steamboat company the cost of this subsidy has been increasing and there have been continuing difficulties in connection with the operation of the service last year i informed the company that the government were prepared to provide the additional subsidy required to enable the service to be increased from one round trip per week to two per week to facilitate the islanders owing to labour difficulties the company have been unable to introduce the improved service now that the main rail and road transport system is being entrusted to a state sponsored board i feel that it would be more appropriate if the steamer service for the aran islands were undertaken by córas iompair éireann discussions are proceeding with a view to the future operation of the aran service by the new board the principal item covered by this particular vote relates to grants for harbours a sum of 340 000 is provided this year compared with 235 010 last year 250 000 of the proposed expenditure in 1950 51 may be classed as capital expenditure the house will be aware that my predecessor took the initiative in providing assistance from the exchequer to enable harbour authorities to carry out improvements or to make good arrears of maintenance and repairs resulting from the years of the emergency as a number of government departments are concerned he set up an inter departmental committee to examine applications received for assistance this inter departmental committee has been continued by me and is at present examining applications made by a number of harbour authorities in some cases it is necessary to have a survey carried out before a decision can be taken as to the soundness of a scheme of improvement put forward i must express my appreciation of the good work being done by harbour authorities in maintaining and improving their harbours i know that in some cases there is a feeling that the time being taken before a decision is reached on applications for state grants is too long i can appreciate the anxiety of harbour boards to get ahead with their schemes but they may not realise that it is essential that there should be a thorough examination of these works before they are undertaken the term of office of the harbour authorities newly constituted under the harbours act 1946 will expire this year i have notified harbour authorities that arrangements must be made to have the new boards elected in the autumn provision for aviation and meteorological services is made in a separate estimate no 52 the total sum provided is 702 610 compared with 1 142 310 for last year this shows a decrease of 439 700 during the past year there have been no outstanding developments in civil aviation but steady progress has been made in providing first class airports at shannon and dublin and developing our air services through aer lingus the principal buildings and works required at the two airports have already been completed the works in progress at shannon include the building of a new control tower to replace the one destroyed by fire some time ago the erection of a new fire station the improvement of the facilities for customs health and immigration services and the extension of the airport shop there has been a shop at shannon from the beginning but it was little more than a kiosk there is much more space in the new shop and it provides a good opportunity for the display of tweeds and other goods of irish manufacture it sells also other articles of a kind usually sought by tourists there have been a number of favourable comments on the new shop and it is proving a progressively expanding source of dollars at dublin airport the principal new work is the erection of a hangar required by aer lingus for the overhaul and maintenance of their aircraft work on this hangar is proceeding rapidly and its construction will probably be completed by the autumn the sum provided in the estimate for subsidy in respect of air services is 50 000 the figure for last year was 300 000 i explained when introducing the estimate last year that the figure included provision for arrears because the payment of subsidy had been held up pending the passing of a bill to extend the subsidy limit contained in the air navigation and transport acts 1936 to 1946 this measure was introduced during the year and was passed by the oireachtas all outstanding subsidy was paid to the air companies before the end of the last financial year aer lingus had expected to have a loss of 125 000 for the year ended 31st march last the accounts of the company for that year have not yet been audited but i understand that the loss will be in the neighbourhood of 60 000 i e about half of the original estimate i think that the company deserve congratulation for this substantial improvement compared with the previous year when the loss shown by the accounts was 162 000 the number of staff employed by the air companies on the 31st march 1950 was about 1 500 during the year the companies introduced provident funds for their staffs these funds are contributory but they involve heavy contributions by the companies particularly in the case of pilots who normally retire between the ages of 40 and 45 i think this was as desirable development after allowing for the additional payments to these funds aer lingus estimate their loss for the current year at 100 000 deputies are aware that half the losses of aer lingus are borne by the british corporations which participate in the company the provision of 50 000 in the current year s estimate therefore represents the balance of the expected losses aer lingus continue to maintain their excellent record as an airline and their traffic continues to grow during the year ended 31st march last they carried 199 023 passengers compared with 167 349 in the preceding year the freight carried was 2 029 tons which was an increase of 90 per cent over the previous year last year the company opened a new service between dublin and birmingham and a summer service between dublin and jersey both of these services have proved to be a success the company are continuing to concentrate on the development of the existing routes and i think this policy has been fully justified they expect to have still heavier traffic during the present year at the peak in july and august they will be operating up to 18 services each day from dublin to london and the same number in the reverse direction in order to cope with the heavy traffic and to make more use of their aircraft they have decided to introduce night services between dublin and london commencing early in june this will involve opening dublin airport on a 24 hour basis for the summer months the night services will be operated at reduced fares such services have already been introduced between london and paris and on other continental routes and it seems to be an experiment which is worth trying between dublin and london last autumn there was an approach from the united states government with a view to the amendment of the 1945 air agreement that agreement gave all the five freedoms to the united states airlines at shannon airport subject to the one condition that aircraft are required to make a landing there if flying over irish territory the representations made by the united states government are still under consideration and i hope that the house will agree that in the circumstances it would be preferable not to enter into debate on the merits of these proposals at this stage air agreements have been concluded with the countries from which air services are being operated to and through ireland during the past year royal dutch airlines klm commenced services through shannon airport to america bringing the number of regular airlines using the airport up to ten an italian airline is expected to commence services through the airport to america during the present summer during the year ended 31st march 1950 the number of aircraft landing at shannon was 6 115 compared with 6 439 for the previous year the number of passengers was 164 777 compared with 157 666 in the previous year of the 164 777 passengers 132 230 were in transit and the remaining 32 547 were embarking or disembarking at shannon these figures confirm that shannon airport plays an important role in connection with our tourist trade it is expected that traffic will be particularly heavy at the airport this year with the extra services bringing pilgrims to rome from north america this is already reflected in the traffic figures the number of aircraft landing at the airport in march was 18 per cent higher than the figure for the corresponding month last year we have continued to play our part in the work of the international civil aviation organisation the organisation is governed by a council of 21 states which meets in montreal we were elected to the council in 1946 and the government propose to seek reelection this year when the council is being appointed for a further term of three years i hope that i have given sufficient information to justify to the house the expenditure proposed for the services for which i have responsibility if however there are any matters which have been omitted and on which deputies may require information i shall be glad to supply it when i am replying to the debate the outline which i have given of the main items within the purview of the estimate gives i think every reason for optimism particularly gratifying are the continuing upward trends in industrial production and industrial employment and the improvements in the supply position i am satisfied that the operation of the services for which i am answerable to the house has contributed appreciably to economic progress during the year to finance the administration of these services i come to the dáil for the necessary funds
here s what you need to remember modern warfare has seen breathtaking advances in the last hundred years as mortal competition between nations spawns successively deadlier weapons aircraft missiles tanks submarines and other inventions many of which did not exist in practical terms in 1914 have quickly earned key positions in the militaries of the world yet there is still one invention that although conceived more than five hundred years ago still has a vital place on today s battlefield the infantry weapon and supporting arms no matter how high tech the armed forces of the world have become warfare since the end of the second world war has consistently involved some form of infantry combat in his seminal work on the korean war this kind of war historian t r fehrenbach wrote you may fly over a land forever you may bomb it atomize it pulverize it and wipe it clean of life but if you desire to defend it protect it and keep it for civilization you must do this on the ground the way the roman legions did by putting your young men in the mud with that in mind here are five of the most deadly guns of modern war ak 47 the undisputed king of the modern battlefield is the avtomat kalashnikova model 47 or ak 47 extremely reliable the ak 47 is plentiful on third world battlefields from american rap music to zimbabwe the ak 47 has achieved icon status and is one of the most recognizable symbols of any kind in the world the ak series of rifles is currently carried by fighters of the islamic state taliban fighters in afghanistan various factions in libya and both sides in the ukraine conflict the ak 47 as the story goes was the brainchild of the late mikhail t kalashnikov a red army draftee kalashnikov showed a talent for small arms design while convalescing from battlefield injuries and had assembled a prototype assault rifle by 1947 there is some circumstantial evidence however that the ak 47 was at least partially designed by the german designer hugo schmeisser who had created the similar stg44 in 1942 the ak 47 was the world s first standard issue assault rifle the rifle used a new 7 62 millimeter cartridge that generated less recoil and was lighter than rounds used in traditional infantry rifles in return the 7 62x39 round offered more controllability when fired in full automatic and allowed the infantryman to carry more rounds into battle the ak 47 has endured because it is a weapon for the lowest common denominator it requires little training to learn how to shoot and as a result large armies or militias can be raised by simply handing out ak 47s it is dead simple to use and requires little maintenance disassembly is quick and the weapon can run virtually without lubrication all of these are important considerations when your soldiers or militiamen are often illiterate untrained draftees an estimated one hundred million ak 47s of all varieties have been manufactured by countries including the soviet union china north korea egypt yugoslavia and most of the former warsaw pact as the independent pointed out that could be one ak for every seventy people on earth even finland and israel neither soviet allies nor client states built variants the most recent version issued to the russian army is the ak 74m chambered in the lighter 5 45 millimeter the m16 family of weapons the modern m16 rifle got its start in 1956 when inventor eugene stoner tested its predecessor the ar 15 at the infantry school at fort benning the rifle would not enter u s service for another four years and then with the u s air force the u s army would jump on the m16 bandwagon in 1965 with the u s marines following in 1966 the original ar 15 was a reliable innovative rifle but a last minute change of gunpowder and misconceptions about the rifle s need to be cleaned contributed to a poor reliability rate in vietnam exacerbating the problem was the m16 s direct impingement self loading system in which gasses and carbon residue created when gunpowder is burned are cycled back into the weapon s internal mechanism the most recent version the m16a4 weighs 8 79 pounds loaded with a 30 round magazine the rifle is effective to 550 meters with a sustained rate of fire of 12 15 rounds per minute the 5 56 millimeter ss109 m855 bullet which emphasized armor piercing capability over lethality on nato battlefields is being phased out in favor of the m855a1 round the original m16 led to the improved m16a1 by 1967 and the m16a2 by 1986 the m16a3 was a short run rifle built for navy seals while the m16a4 has become a standard issue in the u s marine corps the m4a1 carbine currently the standard issue infantry weapon for the u s army is identical except for a shorter barrel collapsible stock and the ability to be fired fully automatic the m16 has evolved into a reliable rifle modular and highly adaptable variants have fulfilled roles from carbine to infantry rifle squad automatic weapon and designated marksman rifle the civilian version again dubbed ar 15 has enjoyed explosive growth in the last ten years with the sunset of the federal assault weapons ban the author owns two m240 machine gun the m240 machine gun is the current medium machine gun for the u s army and u s marine corps the m240 is in service with another sixty eight countries and has served long enough that at least one adopter rhodesia is no longer in existence the m240 is the american version of the fn mag designed in the 1950s by the belgian arms maker fabrique nationale fn utilizing features from both axis and allied infantry weapons the mag as it was known became wildly popular and standard issue with many nato countries in the years since its introduction the mag has served from south africa to the falklands to afghanistan and iraq the m240 can be used to engage point targets such as individual enemy troops and light vehicles or provide suppressive fire the m240 s heavier 7 62 millimeter bullet gives it a maximum effective range of up to 1 800 meters the m240 weighs 27 pounds and with spare barrel tripod and other accessories and spare parts can weigh in at up to 47 pounds the m240 can fire 100 rounds per minute sustained fire meaning the weapon will not overheat it can fire up to 650 rounds per minute but overheating is imminent obviously too many countries use the m240 to run down its use in every case but the state of issue in the u s military is typical of use worldwide in the u s army m240 machine guns are found on armored vehicles and issued at a rate of two per infantry platoon in the u s marine corps six guns are issued to an infantry company allowing the company commander flexibility in their deployment pk machine gun the pk pulemyot kalashnikova or kalashnikov s machine gun light machine gun was the soviet union s solution to high firepower at the squad level like the ak 47 the pk has seen extensive use around the world where one finds an ak a pk is never far behind the pk was also invented by mikhail kalashnikov although it resembles the m240 it is in the same class as the u s marine corps m 27 infantry automatic rifle or the nato minimi m 249 squad automatic weapon the pk fills an important role as a squad automatic weapon saw although most infantrymen throughout the world carry weapons capable of fully automatic or burst fire trained soldiers rarely fire full auto full auto fire from lightweight assault rifles is generally inaccurate and rapidly consumes ammunition instead a single gun like the pk is designated as the squad automatic weapon the pk is equipped with a heavier barrel and frame to absorb heat and recoil from sustained fire accuracy particularly mounted on a tripod is reported to be excellent out to 800 meters the pk uses the same sights as the ak 47 to ease training the pk uses a heavier hitting round than the ak 47 the 7 64x54r round originally used in the moisin nagant infantry rifle and degtyaryov machine gun in world war ii the pk has some anti aircraft capability while the gun is mounted to a bipod or tripod although realistically that is limited to low flying helicopters and perhaps drones qbz 95 assault rifle the qbz 95 or type 95 automatic rifle is the standard issue assault rifle of china designed to replace the chinese copy of the ak 47 the qbz 95 is unlike any other chinese rifle the rifle is issued to all arms of the people s liberation army as well as the people s armed police the qbz 95 is a bullpup design with the magazine inserted behind the trigger like other bullpup rifles this shortens the overall length of the rifle the result is a rifle with a barrel 3 5 longer than the m4 carbine but shorter in overall length the rifle features a built in carrying handle although the use of such a handle creates issues when attaching scopes and other optics

does adventism have anything interesting to say recently i sat with a friend who lost two close friends this year and listened as he told me how he has been reengaging with the adventist doctrine of the soul specifically what is called psychopannychism or soul sleep do we really expect to throw a few verses at people and expect them to happily accept that mom and dad aren t in heaven playing golf with jesus my friend wasn t abandoning the church s teaching but asking is this all we have to say about death it seems so amazing facts popular storacles of prophecy bible study series approaches the subject of death from the story of king saul at endor in 1 samuel 28 the first substantial question the study asks is do the dead come back to converse with or to haunt the living of course the student cannot be trusted to answer that question without a little steering no the bible is clear a dead person does nothing and knows nothing about what is happening on earth the author seems more interested in slamming doors than opening them to anyone grieving or laboring under the screaming shadow of death this is cold counsel adventists do offer the full palliative line of christian hopes on tap during times of duress but when it comes to the inner city of our theology those distinctive doctrines which define us we have become remarkably incurious that storacles lesson is typical of a legion of popular adventist studies which are entirely concerned with debunking spiritualism and not about exploring what the bible has to say on the subject of death or the soul this concern about spiritualism stems from the millerite movement of the 1840s and waves of spirit interest that waxed and waned over the american public in subsequent decades by exploring the nature of the soul those early adventists were addressing a question of general interest in america they were joining an ongoing cultural conversation we ve never stopped to ask if the conversation has changed our obliviousness to the ultimate questions being asked by our present culture is why i question whether adventism has anything interesting to say we simply haven t kept up with the conversation mark finley s 2008 discoveries in revelation sermon on death generally makes the same points from the same texts as ellen white s chapter on death in the spirit of prophecy vol 4 published in 1884 the same could be said for adventist thought on sabbath and the second coming of jesus even our social critiques which once included blistering indictments of abraham lincoln s slavery policy have largely devolved into a rather damp whining about hollywood and immodesty the popular teachers in adventism have for a hundred years largely contented themselves to offer the same answers to the same questions which is incredible considering how much our world has changed in the past century every year new books on the sanctuary or sabbath roll off denominational presses often enough the only new thing about these books is the paper they are printed on the once great adventist book center has long since ceased to be a place where interesting things were being said let me pause and say that we are all well aware of individual adventists who are saying interesting things who are trying to deepen our understanding of the scriptures who are wanting to keep adventism engaged in conversation with the world but i am taking the drones eye view of adventism here and the story of the past hundred plus years is one of a lack of popular interest both in our own theological development and in our desire to listen to the world around us given the rate of growth in the twentieth century 164 per decade this liturgy of repetition seems to have served the church just fine don t fix what isn t broken right but i suspect the denomination s success in the twentieth century has only masked something of a hollowing out of adventism in america where members continue to pay lip service to a theology they no longer bother to understand i would wager my rookie ellen white trading card that most members of a typical adventist church couldn t tell you what the sanctuary doctrine is but they d still tie the noose for anyone who dares challenge it conservative adventists believe this theological disability is due to an infection of worldliness and that the solution is simply to recommit ourselves to these traditional beliefs and their attendant practices while it is true that we are all secular now i believe that adventists have been hollowed out because the theological questions we ask no longer meet many minds at this moment i ll make up an example here by pretending i have a normal job at work few of my agnostic friends are bothered by the question of whether or not the dead can speak to us they don t believe in an afterlife after all let alone an immortal soul but then i get to church and the pastor talks about the immense importance of this truth of soul sleep i am convinced but i feel like i live in two worlds one where this theological question feels incredibly relevant and one where it doesn t and so adventists like many other christians maintain an intellectual friendship to doctrines which have very shallow roots in their lived experience i should probably pause again to forestall my heresy trial and say that i am not arguing that these doctrines are necessarily untrue only irrelevant you know in case that makes you feel better adventist doctrine becomes irrelevant when the problems it aims to solve are not the problems of the people it serves what we preach might still be true but only in a technical sense like blurting out at dinner that pogonophobia is the fear of beards it may be true that methuselah lived to be 969 years old but it s not a truth we insist everyone must believe right now relevance matters not the trendy we need to look twenty when we re forty cosmetic type of mere relevance but the more meaningful relevance of taking peoples deepest questions seriously and offering a heartfelt theological response without this kind of relevance we might as well be prattling on about the age of methuselah our typical explanation of the sabbath remains focused on sunday laws and the papacy despite the fact that americans have arguably never been in less danger of oppressive sunday laws because adventists formulated their understanding of the sabbath at a time when sunday was widely called sabbath adventist evangelists focus their apologetic on which is the right day despite the fact that very few christians consider sunday the sabbath anymore the questions we used to set up our understanding of the sabbath are no longer questions people are asking and it has become difficult for us to imagine other ways of looking at these doctrines if adventism were born today our teaching about the sabbath would address the issues of how the sabbath contributes to social justice the environment and human well being and sunday laws would probably seem like a silly thing to focus on in the words of jesus surely we can learn to do one without leaving the other undone that is we can teach the sabbath in terms of human well being without dropping the traditional concern for religious liberty adventist thought on these distinctive doctrines has stagnated because we have lost our interest in the world around us and as a result have stopped allowing ourselves to be challenged by the world s questions those questions once propelled the pioneering generation of adventism to dive deeply into history and theology and i believe the church as a whole was better off for it when we had no intellectual property to protect we had everything to learn recently the sleeping dog of theological curiosity was roused to resolute interest over women s ordination even if that conversation more naturally fit the context of the 1920s and 30s better than 2015 better late than never besides it was largely an exercise in theological theater papers were presented the stakes were raised and the dog rolled over and went back to sleep i believe adventism has important things to say to our world the second coming s emphasis on transcendence is a welcome corrective to a culture consumed by the immanent frame i believe sabbath keeping is still one of the most meaning generating disciplines a human being can take on i believe we have more to say about death than we ve been saying but to channel my secularness if you present the sabbath merely as the anti sunday and the second coming as the reason why i shouldn t try to make the world a better place then i m not interested i don t want to become part of an adventist answer dispensing machine i want to see adventism come alive again as a responsive social creature to a part of our world again listening and considering before answering i believe our problem is not ultimately an ear problem but a heart problem do we care enough to carry on a conversation with the world i had a family member who was obsessed with the stock market i m sure we talked about other things but all i can remember are those soul crushing conversations about corn futures he was so caught up in his own interests that he never stopped to consider whether i a teenage boy he seldom saw would share that interest it isn t that he didn t have anything to say it s just that he didn t have anything interesting to say that is a shared interest in a topic he didn t want to hear from me only to be heard and who has time for people like that so i wonder does adventism have anything interesting to say matthew j lucio is husband to a formidable wife laura and together they parent two amazing girls aerith and arwen matthew pastors in peoria illinois where he

fusion positive non small cell lung cancer nsclc which summarizes initial data from its ongoing trial of taletrectinib nct04395677 at the american society of clinical oncology asco 2021 annual meeting as of the data cut off date of april 8 2021 there were 15 crizotinib treatment naïve patients and 5 crizotinib pre treated patients who had been confirmed to be ros1 fusion positive and assessed at least twice by investigators the results were as follows in the crizotinib treatment naïve patients n 15 the overall response rate orr was 93 14 15 and the disease control rate dcr was 93 14 15 in the crizotinib pre treated patients n 5 the orr was 60 3 5 and the dcr was 100 5 5 ros1 g2032r resistant mutations were identified in three of the five patients and all three patients experienced tumor regressions and taletrectinib has shown a manageable safety profile characterized primarily by gastrointestinal adverse events with reversible increases of aspartate aminotransferase ast and alanine aminotransferase alt these safety and efficacy data for taletrectinib are very promising for ros1 fusion positive lung cancer patients said dr caicun zhou director of the department of oncology shanghai pulmonary hospital responses appear particularly impressive in crizotinib treatment naïve patients and while the number of crizotinib pre treated patients is limited thus far all five

the tolerability safety and preliminary efficacy of sintilimab plus fruquintinib and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose rp2d 44 crc patients that had failed at least 2 previous lines of therapy containing fluoropyrimidine oxaliplatin or irinotecan were enrolled they received either 5mg intermittent or 3mg continous dosage n 22 each the objective response rate orr was 22 7 10 44 95 ci 11 5 37

continuous group the safety for this combination therapy was controllable dr hui zhou senior vice president of clinical development innovent biologics said the preliminary results were very encouraging which have given us a very promising efficacy signal that tyvyt sintilimab injection in combination with elunate fruquintinib could be used as a third line treatment for advanced crc with microsatellite stability these results would warrant further investigation in a larger population this study also underscores our commitment to provide innovative treatment options to patients with cancer dr weiguo su chief scientific officer of hutchmed said fruquintinib s clean profile led us to evaluate this sintilimab combination in many different tumor types with this favorable safety profile further highlighted by the combination s rp2ds similarity to their monotherapy rp2d this crc data at rp2d is promising showing median pfs at nearly double what was demonstrated under monotherapy we are exploring next steps in bringing this novel therapy to cancer patients about colorectal cancer colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world with relatively high morbidity and mortality with the improvement of living conditions the incidence of crc in china has been increasing in recent years surgery is the major treatment for early stage crc but a large

elunate fruquintinib fruquintinib is a highly selective and potent oral inhibitor of vegfrs 1 2 and 3 vegfr inhibitors play a pivotal role in blocking tumor angiogenesis fruquintinib was designed to improve kinase selectivity to minimize off target toxicities improve tolerability and provide more consistent target coverage the generally good tolerability in patients to date along with fruquintinib s low potential for drug drug interaction based on preclinical assessment suggests that it may also be highly suitable for combinations with other anti cancer therapies fruquintinib was

article was originally published on fool com all figures quoted in us dollars unless otherwise stated derided by many pundits as a joke digital coin with no real path to gaining stable value yet defended stoutly by its legion of retail investor fans dogecoin crypto doge has followed a roller coaster pattern of massive price surges and dizzying plunges over the past few months the coin with its shiba inu mascot image however has slowly gained some traction as a medium of exchange recently jenny ta founder of crypto commerce site coinlinked asserted that its market cap could reach 1 trillion indicating dogecoin might eventually trade for 7 to 8 there are indeed some positive signs for the formerly long dormant dog themed cryptocurrency but the level of risk for its buyers remains high how dogecoin got here after its launch in late 2013 dogecoin s value remained at fractions of a cent for the next seven years while bitcoin crypto btc grew to dominate the cryptocurrency market in 2021 however dogecoin has gained explosively in price with rises that included a more than 500 one day jump on jan 29 its rise was triggered by a group of crypto enthusiasts on reddit looking to repeat in the digital currency arena what the wallstreetbets subreddit did to the share price of gamestop those stock traders ignited a short squeeze in which some small investors profited by pumping up the value of gamestop which forced institutional short sellers to push it even higher as they covered and closed their money losing short positions according to many involved a sizable number of redditors viewed the short sellers behavior as artificially depressing the share prices of gamestop and other heavily shorted companies far below their objectively reasonable valuations their desire to punish what they perceived as an example of vulture capitalism gave them additional motivation to buy and hold the stock dogecoin s surge was aided by tweets from maverick electric vehicle ceo and space pioneer elon musk and it was dubbed the people s coin or the people s crypto by its enthusiasts this sparked the rapid growth of the r dogecoin subreddit which reached 1 9 million members by may 20 large holders also played significant roles in the coin s rise as well as its subsequent drops as those whales pumped and dumped the coin where does doge go from here the broader cryptocurrency market remains extremely volatile with intensely held views on both sides of the argument around the real value of such assets powerful unpredictable price movements mean long term investments in a well chosen portfolio of traditional stocks are likely to deliver better returns for many investors based on the standard analytical view however in the process of being bought and traded dogecoin has acquired value and characteristics absent from its original meme coin incarnation here are some potential signs of this shift from low value meme to potential medium of exchange 1 it is retaining value despite the crypto roller coaster cryptocurrencies in general have taken a pummeling over the past several weeks and dogecoin has not been immune from that trend its value often moved independently from bitcoin or even the crypto market as a whole during its ascent and its price has hovered in the 0 30 to 0 40 range for nearly a week this stability has come despite the average size of trades and the overall trading volume dropping sharply the average transaction value which shot upward starting in mid april peaked at 1 16 million on may 23 then fell back to less than 240 000 by may 26 according to data supplied by bitinfocharts that dogecoin continues to trade far above its early 2021 price range of 0 02 or less suggests that market forces have established a floor at current levels at least for the time being the coin s worth never fell far below 0 30 during the past month despite china s push to ban cryptocurrency mining that decision came as a blow to bitcoin miners in particular since 65 of them are believed to operate in china but the decision exerted downward pressure on the whole crypto market 2 it has some everyday advantages over bitcoin among the younger demographic that makes up the bulk of cryptocurrency enthusiasts preserving the environment is commonly seen as a high priority in light of that the vastly lower amount of electricity required to mine and use dogecoin compared to bitcoin could boost its attractiveness as a crypto alternative dogecoin uses just 0 12 kilowatt hours of electricity per transaction compared to bitcoin s 707 kilowatt hours though the concept is currently little more than an upbeat prospectus the nonprofit veriblock foundation says it is working on a proof of proof blockchain technology that would reuse bitcoin s proof of work security for other cryptocurrencies including dogecoin if successfully deployed the technology could greatly lower bitcoin s relative environmental costs while providing improved security for other cryptocurrencies potentially helping bitcoin and dogecoin develop a type of symbiosis rather than a direct rivalry benefiting holders of both while some view with concern the fact that there is no limit on the total number of dogecoin that could eventually be mined in contrast to bitcoin which does have a hard cap a maximum of 5 26 billion additional dogecoin tokens can be mined per year with over 129 billion coins already in circulation this capped mining rate ensures dogecoin s inflation rate will decline steadily over time while still providing an incentive to continue mining it the total number of dogecoin in circulation will rise by 4 1 in 2021 but only 3 9 in 2022 dogecoin inflation will be 3 5 in 2025 3 0 by 2030 2 3 by 2040 and 1 9 by 2048 given the attrition from lost dogecoin wallets a factor in the supply of all cryptocurrencies the coin could theoretically become deflationary at some point if those losses exceed the ever shrinking inflation provided via mining in short while dogecoin is theoretically infinitely inflationary its predictably declining mathematically inevitable inflation rate potentially gives it more a stable value than national currencies 3 it s gradually winning wider acceptance like any currency dogecoin gains value as it becomes more widely accepted as a medium of exchange while dozens of small businesses now accept dogecoin as a form of payment their economic impact is effectively zero however some larger entities are also accepting doge including the nba s dallas mavericks which will let customers use it to buy both tickets and merchandise through bitpay as team owner mark cuban stated the mavericks have decided to accept dogecoin as payment for mavs tickets and merchandise for one very important earth shattering reason because we can the team s press release offered some more practical reasons for the decision noting that the ability to accept crypto expands a business sales opportunity into international markets where accepting credit cards is not practical while reducing high fees and increasing payment transparency and efficiency the houston rockets are also accepting dogecoin among other cryptocurrencies it is now also possible to purchase the hardest of hard assets precious metals using dogecoin the largest u s silver and gold e commerce site jm bullion added it to the list of seven cryptocurrencies it accepts as payment under jm bullion s policy buyers using cryptocurrencies receive a 3 discount on their transactions compared to credit card purchases close to the 4 discount it offers to purchasers who pay via personal check rumors also continue to swirl that so called dogefather elon musk might start accepting the cryptocurrency for purchases of tesla vehicles the electric car manufacturer has stopped accepting bitcoin payments due to the coin s adverse environmental impact but musk continues to offer verbal support for dogecoin however with musk now signaling that he d be willing to reverse his bitcoin rejection if miners commit to going green tesla s future stance on dogecoin remains cloudy choosing a diamond hands or paper hands strategy though it was born as a joke coin dogecoin now enjoys a number of potentially bullish factors making it less simple to dismiss as an asset the risk to investors remains high as it does with all altcoins but dogecoin s low energy costs a potential for a shared security protocol with bitcoin the willingness of a few larger companies to accept it for purchases and the possibility that more will join them and a measure of price stability are positive signs overall though not directly measurable dogecoin also may benefit from the considerable good will of its two million strong retail investor fan base fools investing in cryptocurrencies should not put any money into dogecoin that they are not prepared to lose those who already have positions in it may want to get out if they aren t comfortable with volatile high risk investments be paper hands in the parlance of reddit retail investors but if you are prepared to hold cryptocurrencies through dips and fluctuations adopting the unshakable diamond hands strategy then over the medium to longer term joke currency dogecoin has at least some potential to leave you laughing all the way to the bank this article was originally published on fool com

switching on the light or heating water for your morning coffee may seem like something you don t even think twice about but imagine doing it without electricity click start to play today s word search it s all about objects that run on electric power making our lives and chores much easier for me electricity ranks right at the top of the list of the most important discoveries by man because it led to thousands of life altering inventions although american inventor benjamin franklin is often credited with its discovery thanks to his famous kite flying experiments in 1752 there is evidence of people using forms of electricity as far back as 600bc that s when the ancient greeks discovered that rubbing fur on amber caused an attraction between the two materials this later came to be known as static electricity even more fascinating is the 1936 discovery of the baghdad battery which is estimated to be roughly 2 000 years old found in khujut rabu just outside baghdad in iraq the battery is essentially a clay jar with a stopper made of asphalt poking through the asphalt is an iron rod encased in a copper cylinder when the jar is filled with vinegar an electrolytic solution the jar produces 1 1 volts according to us based smith college s museum of ancient inventions website there is no written record about the exact function of the jar but considering the way the jar was constructed it was most likely a battery used for electroplating overlaying a layer of one metal like gold onto the surface of another like silver here s another interesting fact about electricity have you ever wondered why birds don t get electrocuted when they perch on a power line technically they can if the bird just sits on the line it s safe but if it touches another line with a wing or a foot it will create a circuit causing the electricity to flow through the bird s body electrocution it s a good thing most birds seem to have figured this out

here s what you need to know sniper rifles are useful not just against human targets but are used to destroy communications equipment vulnerable supply targets and even disable armored vehicles the barrett m82 s big 50 caliber round is particularly useful in this regard as it only drops below supersonic speeds at 1 700 yards while still hitting with the force of 1 800 foot pounds the sniper a soldier trained in precision long range fire is one of the most feared opponents on the battlefield snipers can make their presence felt far beyond a typical soldier s assault rifle cutting down enemy leaders radio and heavy weapons operators and damaging enemy equipment at considerable distances this requires a weapon and optic capable of extreme accuracy typically no more than half an inch of deviation per 100 yards here are five of the most common and effective sniper rifles m40a5 sniper rifle the m40a5 is the latest in a long line of m40 sniper rifles used by the u s marine corps the m40 series is a highly modified remington 700 hunting rifle chambered in 308 winchester 7 62x51mm nato the a5 model comes equipped with a custom 1 12 twist twenty five inch schneider barrel the action and barrel are mated to a mcmillan a4 stock the rifle is topped off with a schmidt and bender police marksman ii 4 16x50mm rifle scope on a thirty minute of angle base designed to stretch the legs of the 308 round to a maximum 1 000 yards a sniper rifle is commonly defined as semi automatic or bolt action long gun equipped with a scope that is accurate to within a minute of angle one minute of angle represents one inch at one hundred yards two inches at two hundred yards and so on the m40a5 is accurate to within one half inch minute of angle meaning that under perfect conditions shots taken at eight hundred yards should land within a four inch circle m24 sniper weapons system the u s army s m24 sniper weapons system sws dates back to 1988 when it replaced the older m21 sniper rifle like the m40 series the m24 is based on the commercial remington 700 hunting rifle and chambered in 308 winchester 7 62x51mm nato the m24 features a custom made twenty four inch remington barrel and uses a leupold mark iv m3 fixed 10x scope another common feature of a sniper rifle is a so called free floating barrel a free floating barrel is a barrel that with the exception of where the barrel mates up to the rifle action does not make any other contact with the stock this prevents unwanted pressure which may affect accuracy from being put on the rifle the m24 s barrel is fully free floated and minimally touches the hs precision stock l115a3 sniper rifle the sniper rifle of the uk armed forces the l115a3 sniper rifle in use by the british army royal air force and royal marines the l115a3 is an adaptation of the accuracy international arctic warfare super magnum rifle like the m40 and m24 the l115a3 is a bolt action rifle but unlike the american rifles it is chambered in 338 lapua with a five round box magazine the rifle optic is a schmidt and bender 5 25x56mm scope sniper rifles need to shoot great distances to kill targets that believe themselves invulnerable to enemy fire the heavier 338 lapua round gives the l115a3 a maximum range of 1 600 yards 60 percent greater than the 308 round of the m24 and m40a5 this was used to great effect in 2009 when a british army sniper serving with the household cavalry regiment neutralized a taliban machine gun position at 2 700 yards with his l115a3 cpl craig harrison took three shots fatally wounding two taliban fighters and destroying their pkm machine gun barrett m82 sniper rifle although the idea of a 50 caliber sniper rifle is not new legendary marine corps sniper carlos hathcock famously made a long range shot from a scoped m2 browning machine gun in the vietnam war purpose built 50 caliber sniper rifles were unheard of until the 1980s barrett firearms invented the m82 anti material rifle which fires the exact same 50 bmg cartridge used in the heavy machine gun today the m82 is used by armies worldwide from the united states to ukraine the m82 is equipped with a twenty inch barrel and weighs a hefty 29 7 pounds while powerful and capable of hitting targets at considerable distances the 50 bmg round tends to rapidly lose accuracy after 900 yards sniper rifles are useful not just against human targets but are used to destroy communications equipment vulnerable supply targets and even disable armored vehicles the barrett m82 s big 50 caliber round is particularly useful in this regard as it only drops below supersonic speeds at 1 700 yards while still hitting with the force of 1 800 foot pounds zijiang m99 sniper rifle the standard heavy sniper rifle of the people s liberation army the zijiang m99 is a semi automatic rifle similar to the barrett m82 the m99 differs in being chambered for the 12 7x108mm soviet cartridge and using a gas impingement operating system similar to that used by the m16 and m4 carbine family of weapons the twenty six pound rifle takes a ten round magazine and is reportedly capable of accuracy to within 1 6 minutes of angle sniper rifles are a choice weapon for insurgents and guerrillas as they are a natural asymmetric weapon against conventional forces the m99 sniper rifle has mysteriously showed up in the hands of rebels in the syrian civil war where it has proven effective against syrian arab army forces the weapons are thought to have come from sudan by way of qatar kyle mizokami is a writer based in san francisco who has appeared in the

the disruptive lending platform had knockout earnings and raised revenue guidance for 2021 what happened upstart holdings upst 7 00 stock rose 36 in may according to data provided by s p global market intelligence these rapid gains came because the company beat analyst earnings estimates in the first quarter and significantly raised its outlook for the 2021 fiscal year so what based in san mateo california and founded by ex employees of alphabet s google goog 0 30 googl 0 29 upstart is a lending platform that uses artificial intelligence to estimate what it calls true risk for anyone taking out a consumer loan it works with financial institutions essentially acting as the technology middleman between people buying and selling loans to one another on may 11 upstart released its financial results for the first quarter of 2021 revenue grew 90 in q1 to 121 million while non gaap adjusted earnings per share eps were 0 22 for the quarter beating the 0 15 consensus analyst estimates management also provided its second quarter 2021 financial outlook guiding for 150 million to 160 million lastly it raised its full year revenue guidance from 500 million to 600 million this big step up in 2021 revenue expectations was likely the main reason upstart stock soared after the earnings report it also caused analysts at citigroup jefferies and piper sandler to all raise their price targets on the stock this torrid revenue growth shows the strong value proposition upstart s platform has for its financial partners and individual consumers as it tries to take market share from the 1 5 trillion consumer loan market now what investors in upstart have done well since its ipo late last year with shares up over 450 in that short time frame however with those gains comes an increasingly high valuation the stock trades at a forward price to sales ratio p s of around 18 8 and a forward price to earnings ratio p e of 238 based on analyst estimates for 2021 upstart is growing quickly and continues to blow all expectations out of the water so this high valuation should come down quickly but there s no getting around how expensive the stock is right now there s seems to be no reason to sell your shares in upstart the business is firing on all cylinders and continues to impress but if you re planning on starting a position after this latest earnings report it could be smart to be patient and slowly buy shares over time reducing the impact short term volatility could have on your investment
one of my favourites of all the countries i have visited is japan tokyo is a sprawling city of 13 8 million and yet you can walk through its leafy boulevards without having to constantly watch your back it is a clean safe and orderly place i was once invited to dinner at the home of a senior diplomat in tokyo over a sumptuous meal the couple explained to me that their only son a graduate of the london school of economics and political science has absolutely no interest in living abroad not very untypical of his generation no country offers them the comfort security and the good life that japan does japan is one of the most advanced technological nations in the world when the trains are three minutes late it makes headlines the japanese diet is one of the healthiest in the world comprising mostly of fish lentils and fruits japan has a population of 125 million people with a gross per capita income of 5 4 trillion coming just behind usa and china it has a per capita income of 43 000 with limited natural resources and a land ever so prone to earthquakes and tsunamis they have built a life some of us can only dream of for centuries they were a closed society ruled by a feudal samurai warrior shogunate the meiji restoration of 1868 set the country on the path to industrialisation and national transformation what is remarkable about the japanese is that they pursued the path of industrialisation without necessarily succumbing to the paradigm of westernisation they became a prosperous nation while preserving the essence of their culture and civilisation many japanese are dedicated to the goddess amaterasu and the shinto religion many are also buddhists the remarkable transformation of japan after the devastation of world war ii is one of the key developments of the 20th century every schoolchild knows about the nuclear bombs that were dropped on the cities of hiroshima and nagasaki in august 1945 by the americans on the orders of president harriman truman an estimated 195 000 perished in addition to thousands of wounded including succeeding generations of children born with deformities as a genetic consequence of the nuclear fallout despite this tragedy the japanese made a remarkable come back they have faced their former enemies without any bitterness it is one of the few countries to have outlawed war in their constitution thanks to general macarthur who became the country s constitutional lawgiver japan today has an average life expectancy of 84 79 years easily one of the highest in the world indeed there are more 100 year olds on the island of okinawa than anywhere else in the world the japanese enjoy one of the highest standards of living among the advanced industrial nations with a human development index hdi of 0 919 with 1 0 being the perfect score the japanese are known for their legendary work ethic despite the supernal prowess of china in recent years tokyo still maintains an edge over beijing in terms of the quality of its products legend has it that the japanese used to produce rather shoddy products until mit professor edward demming introduced to them the concept of total quality management tqm they took to it with panache more so that it resonated with their own traditional philosophy of kaizen continuous improvement japan is by no means a perfect society for one thing it is a rapidly ageing society the average age is 48 4 compared to nigeria s 18 1 years within the coming decades japan is likely to experience labour shortages and pension challenges as a result of these unfavourable demographics japan also faces other social problems it is one of the highest suicide rates in the world with about 14 9 percent per 100 000 persons the country went through what has been termed the lost decade in the 1990s following a stock market bubble that was sooner destined to obey the law of gravity they had to battle with deflation slow growth and a rising national debt which currently stands at 13 6 trillion a staggering 257 percent of gdp despite these challenges japan is a prosperous democracy a cohesive and stable nation with a highly productive and innovative knowledge economy the major philosophy underpinning japanese flourishing is known as ikagai literally meaning a reason for being it refers to having a meaning for being a direction and life purpose four fundamental components of life are embedded in the ikigai philosophy passion vocation profession and mission remarkably this philosophy emerged in okinawa an island that was the epicentre of the war between the united states and japan okinawa lost more than 200 000 people out of that immense tragedy they evolved a philosophy that gave them renewed hope for the future in a manner of speaking they had found their ikigai out of the cauldron of war and suffering they have built a sense of community anchored on kindness purpose and living in the moment it is no surprise therefore that the okinawans have such a zest for living living to be a hundred is now the norm in okinawa aided by a good climate excellent food social harmony and peace the japanese believe that every human being has an ikigai pronounced ee kee guy a path to life fulfilment the ikigai philosophy is not a quick fix happiness pill that you can swallow the japanese are not a particularly happy people either but scientific research has shown that a combination of a balanced diet exercise and life mission focus have been at the heart of japanese longevity and flourishing the german american psychiatrist viktor frankl in his famous book man s search for meaning beacon press 1992 confessed that as an inmate of a german concentration camp he found that those who perished were mostly those who lost the will to live he confessed that whenever he himself was about to give up he imagined all the great scientific works that he wanted to produce and the future that lay ahead you could say that in japanese parlance he had found his ikigai the foundation of ikigai lies in answering the key questions what gets you up in the morning what puts you in your best element during what activities do you experience flow what do you find easy to do what did you like doing as a kid the essence of finding your ikigai is when what you love and are good at meets what you can be valued and paid for because it is needed by the world once you are able to identify these key elements about yourself you should resolve to follow your own compass ikigai does not promise the elixir to eternal happiness it is not a magic lantern to making billions of dollars it is merely a key that opens the door to the resplendent mansion of hope self actualisation and personal fulfillment a life of purpose undoubtedly contributes to the prospects of a long and happy life in a time of great stress in our country i recommend this philosophy for people who face anxiety and fear in our lawless and nihilistic country companies government and other organisations can build the ikigai philosophy into their corporate culture by making the workspace a happier experience it has been proven that workers would much prefer working in a happy organisation with lesser pay than in an unhappy organisation that pays more we face dark times rumours of war everywhere hunger and anger stare us in the face the easiest temptation is despair and give up many young people are trying desperately to flee to canada or the united states our skies are overcast with bad omens as the immortal chirstopher okigbo put it and the secret thing in its heaving threatens with iron mask the last lighted torch of the century i solemnly prophesy that after the storm a rainbow will appear therefore keep going no matter what discover your own ikigai keep walking the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step find your life purpose and pursue it dream big follow your vocation and star for the bloodthirsty demons that currently stalk our land with arrogant swagger will sooner or later eat the dust of their own wickedness the dawn of a new nigeria beckons you should not miss these headlines from nigerian tribune we have not

an agreement by wealthy countries to impose minimum taxes on multinational companies faces a rocky path to implementation with many governments likely to wait and see what others especially a divided u s congress will do treasury secretary janet yellen hailed the deal reached by finance ministers of the group of seven leading nations over the weekend in london she called it a return to multilateralism and a sign that countries can tighten the tax net on profitable firms to fund their governments the agreement represents a turning point in long running negotiations over where and how corporate profits should be taxed the deal would impose a minimum tax of at least 15 and give countries more authority to tax the profits of digital companies like apple inc and facebook inc that dominate global markets but pay relatively little tax in many countries where they operate g7 nations reach historic deal to tax big multinationals while the impact on tech companies remains uncertain some welcomed the prospect of a more uniform global regime nick clegg facebook inc s vice president of global affairs said on twitter that the deal is a step toward certainty for businesses when it comes to taxes new tests come in the months ahead as details get hashed out and governments see which country goes first those that move ahead before others could damage their revenue bases and companies according to tax experts and those lagging behind a global consensus could be hurt too while we may see a deal it s then potentially 18 months or more to push it into the domestic law of each of the countries said monika loving national practice leader for international tax services at advisory firm bdo in terms of revenue impact we re maybe two years off seeing tax administrations collecting any additional revenue at the center of attention some tax specialists lawyers and officials said is the u s congress in countries with parliamentary systems governments can quickly deliver on pledges turning them into local laws and regulations in the u s however a slim democratic majority in the house an evenly split senate antitax republicans and procedural hurdles complicate passage other countries may be reluctant to change their laws or remove taxes that hit u s based tech companies without seeing congress move first u s lawmakers may take the reverse view wary of raising taxes or ceding tax authority to other nations without assurances of a complete global accord if the u s raises taxes and others don t disadvantages could arise from having a u s corporate headquarters big tech reacts to g7 minimum tax rate deal significant first step democrats can pass some changes on their own but have differences among themselves over tax policy the biden administration has also called for raising the corporate tax rate to 28 from 21 and setting the minimum tax on u s based companies at 21 to fund other initiatives and some democrats have balked at those higher rates republican votes may be needed if countries minimum tax changes necessitate renegotiating tax treaties which require a two thirds vote in the senate for ratification the top tax writing republicans in congress rep kevin brady of texas and sen mike crapo of idaho noted that the u s already imposed a form of minimum tax at 10 5 in 2017 and that other countries haven t followed we continue to caution against moving forward in a way that could adversely affect u s businesses and ultimately harm american workers and jobs at a critical time in our country s economic recovery they said the g 7 which comprises canada france germany italy japan the u k and the u s agreed that businesses should pay a minimum tax rate of at least 15 in each of the countries in which they operate they also agreed to new rules that change which countries can tax which income in the increasingly digital economy those new rules will focus on large global businesses that have a profit margin of at least 10 the right to tax 20 of profits above that threshold would be shared among governments get fox business on the go by clicking here the deal faces an early test in the group of 20 leading economies which includes all of the g 7 and a number of large developing countries such as china india brazil and south africa finance ministers from the g 20 meet in venice in early july and an overhaul of global tax rules is on the agenda buy in will also have to come from a broader group of 135 countries in what is known as the inclusive framework some countries with very low tax rates such as ireland with a 12 5 charge on profits are reluctant to sign up the u s has proposed tax changes that would penalize companies from countries that don t impose the minimum taxes we ll have to convince the other great powers especially the asian ones i am thinking in particular of china france s finance minister bruno le maire said in a television interview this weekend let s face it it s going to be a tough fight i am optimistic that we will win it because the g 7 is giving us extremely powerful political momentum while g 7 members agreed on the outlines of a new rulebook they also left some unfinished business a number of countries from europe raised the stakes in the long running talks by announcing separate national levies on digital businesses hoping those would pressure the u s into an international deal in retaliation for what it saw as discrimination against u s companies the u s announced punitive tariffs on imports from those countries although it suspended those tariffs until the end of this year the g 7 didn t agree on a schedule for removing those levies a sign that decision makers aren t sure exactly when new tax rules might come into play in their final statement saturday after two days of meetings g 7 ministers said they would work on a path to removing the levies that will be tied to the new rules coming into force the broader changes if enacted would affect many of the world s largest and most profitable companies particularly in the tech sector but the removal of the digital services taxes would be a silver lining for tech companies they have long said they would prefer an international resolution on taxes that result in higher bills to a patchwork of national levies some tech executives have expressed worry that countries will attempt to hang onto their digital services taxes even with a global deal on corporate taxes matthew schruers president of the computer communications industry association which represents companies including alphabet inc s google and facebook inc applauded the g 7 agreement saturday however he cautioned the work is not finished until the digital taxes that unfairly target u s businesses have been removed he said many big tech companies including apple inc alphabet and facebook have in recent years already reported effective tax rates roughly around the 15 minimum rate proposed by the g 7 according to securities filings companies that are below the rate such as apple could see a potential increase in its tax bill under the proposed deal in some years click here to read more on fox business the tech company reported an effective global tax rate of 14 4 for the year ended sept 26 2020 citing lower tax rates on foreign earnings a spokesman for apple declined to comment

markets and economists are debating the implications of another surge in us inflation to levels last seen a quarter of a century ago but the dilemma confronting investors and policymakers is whether that has any relevance within economic settings that are unprecedented in the post war period when the us cpi is released on thursday it is expected to reveal that headline inflation has spiked from 4 2 per cent in april already the highest number since 2008 to 4 7 per cent in may core inflation excluding food and energy prices is expected to rise from 3 per cent the highest since 1995 to 3 4 per cent the highest level recorded since 1993 inflation fears have global sharemarkets on edge credit ap would that matter the us federal reserve board and other policymakers say it doesn t they argue that the spike in inflation is transitory a response to the disruption generated by the worst of the pandemic impacts last year it will pass they say as supply chain bottlenecks school closures and pandemic induced caution among the unemployed gradually resolve themselves as the vaccination rates increase and businesses gradually return to normal operations

the company is focused on aggressive exploration in the near term as it aims to expand the project s resource qmines ltd asx qml fra 81v is well placed to benefit from the expected uptick in copper demand over the next decade driven by electric vehicle makers and green environmental policies particularly in europe the newly listed company which aims to be queensland s next copper and gold developer has an extensive drilling program planned at the mt chalmers copper project funded by its recent ipo which raised 11 5 million its exploration goal is to establish a strong copper development story over the next 18 24 months and to demonstrate that there is more copper and gold mineralisation underneath and around the historical high grade mine and qmines looks on track to achieve this with its maiden diamond drilling results from seven out of 11 diamond holes returning grades of up to 13 4 copper and 6 11 g t gold and a 3 000 metre reverse circulation rc drilling campaign now underway at the project copper a critical mineral the company is building a european investor base having listed on the frankfurt stock exchange and securing three large european investors that took up around 40 or 4 5 million of the ipo qmines is also focused on becoming australia s first zero carbon copper and gold explorer with many german and european investors having a deep understanding of the green decarbonisation trends and transitions occurring in the energy space copper is expected to be a major beneficiary of these green policies as the energy transition will require significant additional supply over and above the current baseload requirements the amount of copper used inside an electric vehicle is several orders of magnitude great than it is in a standard petrol gasoline power car with the uptake in electric vehicles automakers are going to be demanding more and more copper from their suppliers and not just for the vehicles the metal will also be required in the associated infrastructure particularly in connecting all the charging points that will need to be built demand drives price the environmental addenda globally and the proliferation of electric vehicles the increased use of renewable energy sources energy efficiency and increased consumption of electronics are all driving the copper price last month it peaked at us 10 724 tonne and the only other time in history copper peaked above us 10 000 tonne was in 2011 on the back of chinese economic stimulus and a 2000s commodities boom this demand is also being driven by the world s two economic giants the usa and china the chinese economy is using huge amounts of copper as infrastructure growth continues and copper wiring for new homes and offices remains a high priority in the us president biden s us 1 9 billion infrastructure program has lifted metals markets as a whole with copper a major beneficiary goldman sachs stated that the green revolution is likely to create a record wide supply gap by 2030 while on the supply side not many big new projects are coming on stream it was only december last year that goldman predicted copper could hit five figures by the first half of 2022 and it now believes it could reach as high as us 15 000 tonne by 2025 today copper is fetching us 9 852 tonne locations of qmines projects and other major mines mt chalmers development potential this anticipated surge in demand comes at a time when supply is likely to be constrained due to prolonged underinvestment in exploration and new mine development and qmines could be perfectly placed with the company confident that mt chalmers has the potential to become a mine it was last mined between 1908 and 1982 with two large open pits around which the company believes there are several additional deposits that have not been mined the company has one deposit of vms cluster at the mt chalmers pit but has also identified three exploration targets which it believes are individually separate deposits as well all within a kilometre of the pits qmines has delivered a jorc inferred resource for mt chalmers and its three other copper gold projects silverwood warroo and herries range of 3 9 million tonnes at 1 15 copper 0 81 g t gold and 8 4 g t silver the company believes the deposit has a lot more growth potential and could generate a lot of value for investors over time with a strong chance of adding to that resource through exploration long term outlook qmines believes that the strong results from its maiden diamond drilling clearly validate the mines development potential and is now undertaking a 3 000 metre rc drilling program with the aim of releasing a resource update in the near future its long term goal to establish a strong copper development story and to demonstrate that there is more copper and gold mineralisation underneath and around the historical high grade mine if the company can grow the resource over the next 18 24 months it will be in a fantastic position to solidify its position as an australian copper developer and capitalise on the forecast demand for the highly sought after metal

americans workers such reactionary agitation laid the basis for the forced internment of japanese americans the majority who were us citizens during world war ii by the roosevelt administration among the worst offenders in recent decades has been the united auto workers union whose anti japanese campaigns of the 1980s boiled over into violence now however the uaw is trying to cover up its tracks by recently endorsing along with other us unions the asian pacific american labor alliance s pledge to end anti asian racism the pledge supposedly commits unions to take concrete actions including addressing racism and xenophobia in the workplace in signing on to this pledge the united auto workers makes no effort to account for its record in promoting anti foreigner and anti asian sentiment but the targeting of foreign workers which began in earnest in the 1980s went hand in hand with the uaw s imposition of concessions and the union s embrace of corporatist union management collaboration anti foreigner scapegoating has been central to the narrative advanced by the uaw ever since endless concessions are presented as necessary to ensure the competitiveness of the us based auto companies against overseas rivals this fratricidal logic leads to pitting us workers against their counterparts in asia europe and latin america in a continuing competition to undermine wages and working conditions in an endless downward spiral over the same period the unions have amassed billions of dollars in cash even as their dues base has collapsed the uaw employs a small army of officials earning six figure salaries which are financed through direct infusions of corporate cash through joint labor management training centers the union s control of corporate stock and overt bribes of the type that have landed over a dozen union officials including the last two union presidents gary jones and dennis williams in prison the uaw has never taken responsibility for its role in the brutal 1982 murder of chinese american draftsman vincent chin who was beaten to death with a baseball bat in highland park michigan the attack was carried out by a chrysler foreman ronald ebens and his unemployed stepson michael nitz who mistook chin for japanese one of the attackers yelled it s because of you little expletives that we re out of work the murder of chin took place in the midst of a vicious anti japanese campaign conducted by the uaw over mass layoffs uaw officials declared remember pearl harbor and invited autoworkers to smash japanese built cars with a sledgehammer to this day foreign built vehicles primarily japanese are banned from uaw parking lots ebens and nitz never spent a day in prison for their crime a plea bargain reduced their sentence to three years probation for manslaughter and a token 3 000 fine after public outcry a federal civil rights prosecution followed however ebens conviction was overturned on appeal in an interview with this reporter conducted in 2012 james shimoura a michigan attorney who provided legal advice to the mother of vincent chin described the climate at the time of the killing the rhetoric at the time was virulent there were union leaders smashing japanese cars with hammers and bats and there were public pronouncements by politicians and people in the corporate area targeting japanese car manufacturers as being the cause of the recession it was a campaign of disinformation to deflect public opinion away from the real cause which was quite complex at a time of a very hostile public reaction you try to find scapegoats to deflect the anger under conditions of mounting trade war deepening economic crisis intensified by the covid 19 pandemic and war preparations the ruling class with the support of the unions is ramping up all forms of racism and chauvinism the uaw has been in the lead on this giving its full support to the trump administration s trade war policies and america first demagogy and now embracing the biden administration s buy american campaign which targets china as well as mexico the biden administration is directly enlisting the support of the uaw in prosecuting its anti china campaign at an appearance at the ford river electric vehicle center at the rouge complex outside detroit on may 18 biden promoted his nationalist american jobs plan he praised uaw president rory gamble by name while touting the role the unions must play in prosecuting economic warfare against china which he accused of cornering the market on raw materials and supplies for electric vehicle batteries referring again to china he declared i got news for them they will not win this race he also urged american automakers to deepen your partnership with the uaw in plain language this means to deepen the incestuous financial ties between the union and the company in order to clamp down on mounting opposition among autoworkers and divert them along nationalist lines whatever the pretensions of the uaw the upsurge in anti asian hate crimes is a completely foreseeable and indeed inevitable outgrowth of its promotion of america first nationalism attacks on asians can only increase in the period ahead after the embrace by the democratic party with which the uaw is aligned of the wuhan lab conspiracy theory that claims china is to blame for the covid 19 pandemic and therefore the loss of millions of lives in reality workers face a common global fight this has been made crystal clear by the covid 19 pandemic which has confronted workers all over the world with the fact that corporations have demanded that workers health and safety be sacrificed for the sake of profit recently indian autoworkers have carried out strikes against unsafe working conditions as the covid 19 pandemic rages in south asia their courageous action underscores the fact that the fight to save workers lives is a global fight against capitalism which values profit above health and safety the struggle against nationalism is essential to the defense of even the most elementary rights of the working class workers after all confront transnational corporations that include workers all over the world in a single production process the most conscious expression of this is the rapid growth of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees the iwa rfc is a new form of workers organization independent of the corrupt pro corporate unions based on an international strategy and perspective it has representatives from workplaces all over the world and is seeking to unite workers globally to fight for their common interests in response to blackmail from the uaw to accept a concessions contract or be starved out on the picket line in a long a fruitless strike workers in the rank and file committee at volvo truck s new river valley plant in dublin virginia declared in a statement workers want to unite if the enemy wants to wage war on us we must be prepared to open up new fronts in their rear including at volvo s operations in sweden france belgium the uk and poland to join the iwa rfc and for help setting up a committee at your workplace contact us at wsws org

fugitive entrepreneur mehul choksi has told the dominican high court that he is a law abiding citizen who had left india only for medical treatment the times of india reported on sunday choksi 62 who is wanted by the central bureau of investigation and the enforcement directorate in india in connection with the rs 13 000 crore punjab national bank fraud case was caught in dominica on may 26 after he allegedly fled antigua and barbuda he was allegedly trying to flee to cuba he moved the dominican high court after a lower court rejected his bail plea in relation to his illegal entry into the country i have extended an invitation to indian authorities to interview me and ask any questions that they may have of me in relation to any investigation that they are conducting against me choksi claimed in an eight page affidavit filed on june 3 i did not evade law enforcement in india there was no warrant against me by the law enforcement authorities in india when i left india to seek medical treatment in the united states of america the fugitive businessman added that he would not abscond from dominica and added that the presence of a red corner interpol notice against him did not make him a flight risk the red notice is not an international arrest warrant he told the court in his submission it is merely a request by interpol on behalf of india to locate and take steps to facilitate my surrender to india through extradition proceedings the proceedings have already commenced in antigua and barbuda therefore i do not intend to leave dominica unless to travel to antigua with the permission of the court there are two pending cases both filed by me before the eastern caribbean supreme court in antigua and barbuda to determine whether i should be extradited to india choksi added according to the times of india i have diligently attended every one of my court sessions in antigua i am a law abiding citizen and have no previous convictions his plea added i fear that my health may drastically decline if i am kept in police custody i am 62 years old and have serious health problems i am a diabetic have a brain clot have heart problems and other medical issues if required i am willing to provide cash bail in a reasonable sum i am able to afford living accommodation in dominica until the hearing and determination of this charge of illegal entry i am also able to afford my own security and so do not need any security from the state mehul choksi s affidavit in the dominican high court the fugitive businessman had been living in antigua where he had secured a passport since he left india in 2018 just weeks before the punjab national bank fraud came to light following choksi s detention on the night of may 26 antigua refused to take him back and prime minister gaston browne had said the country was in talks with the dominican as well as indian governments for his repatriation to india last week the dominican government had told the magistrate court hearing choksi s bail plea that he should be deported to india the dominican public prosecution service told the court that the businessman s plea was not maintainable and should not be taken up on may 28 a dominican court had extended the stay on choksi s deportation from the caribbean island country till june 2 choksi s lawyers had argued that he was no longer a citizen of india and so he could not be sent there however an indian government official told ndtv that the administration would push for choksi s early deportation as he was still an indian citizen an official of india s home ministry told the channel that choksi may have acquired the citizenship in antigua through false declarations and we have been opposing it but choksi s counsel cited article 9 of the indian constitution that said any person who obtains citizenship of another country automatically is not a citizen of india the pnb fraud case the punjab national bank fraud came to light in february 2018 when the bank informed the bombay stock exchange that it had detected fraudulent and unauthorised transactions worth rs 11 380 crore at a branch in south mumbai some officials of the public sector bank had allegedly issued fraudulent letters of undertaking to companies belonging to choksi s nephew nirav modi a diamond businessman the bank later raised its estimate of the value of the fraud to over rs 13 000 crore in april united kingdom s home minister priti patel had approved the extradition of modi to india where he will face trial he was arrested on march 19 2019 and has been lodged in london s wandsworth jail
ford mustang mach e production outpaces mustang ford has just reached a new milestone according to a bloomberg report production of the mustang mach e has surpassed the iconic mustang pony car for the first time at the blue oval s mexico plant so far this year ford has built 27 816 units of the mustang mach e compared to 26 089 units of the sixth generation mustang it s a popular model in europe and in may was the best selling vehicle in norway in the united states however the regular mustang outsells the mach e by a ratio of three to one ford chief executive officer jim farley said the demand for mach e has been much stronger than we expected so we ve totally run out of stock mach e is going global as we speak but in the us the wait is months one reason as to the mach e is produced at a higher rate is because of how ford is prioritising resource allocation for its model line up as you know the global semi conductor shortage has forced several automakers to revisit their production strategy with ford funneling more chips to produce newer models such as the mustang mach e and bronco suv we have purposely protected our launches bronco bronco sport mach e f 150 he said if we can switch a module over to one of those launch vehicles we have we re very protective of the launches because they are so important for our business farley said ford s flat rock plant in michigan produced zero petrol mustangs last month because of the shortage company sales analyst erich merkl said in an email we are really excited about the success that we are having with our launch of the all new mustang mach e not just here in america but globally too to be fair please keep in mind that mustang and flat rock have been impacted by outside factors which has been the semiconductor chip shortage
despite their name rare earth elements are not hard to find these 17 heavy metals are dispersed in small amounts throughout the earth s crust with some even more abundant than copper what is rare however are the means to recover them economically efficiently and safely rare earths are critical components in cell phones aircraft and many advanced electronics and they re becoming particularly important in emerging green energy technologies such as electric and hybrid vehicles as well as wind energy however with little to no domestic production the united states has historically relied on china for over 80 percent of its rare earths and is vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain that vulnerability led to a white house executive order last fall declaring a national emergency on their supply which prioritized the development of domestic sources in a trio of projects focused on developing new domestic resource streams for these critical materials virginia tech mining and minerals engineering assistant professor wencai zhang is looking at waste byproducts as a potential source of rare earths which he aims to recover using processes that are more cost effective and environmentally safer than traditional methods waste handling and rare earth production are two of the biggest issues facing modern society said zhang our projects have great potential to reduce the high costs and environmental impacts associated with waste treatment while also promoting the establishment of secure domestic rare earth supply chains rare earths locked in ash in one project zhang is examining the potential of recovering rare earths from residual ash a byproduct of incinerated municipal solid waste each year over 2 million tons of municipal solid waste ranging from food to plastics and electronic devices are incinerated in the united states incineration reduces a majority of the waste but leaves behind a small amount of residual ash normally the residual ash from municipal solid waste must be treated in disposal facilities because it contains significant amounts of dangerous heavy metals and pollutants explained zhang treating the ash is expensive and accompanied by environmental risks currently one of the only ways to use residual ash is to sequester it in products like concrete or cinder but if we can find a way to recover the rare earths from the ash first it would render the ash more environmentally benign while adding value through the development of a domestic rare earth supply stream with project funding from the department of energy s advanced research projects agency energy zhang seeks to understand the conversion mechanisms or how critical materials change during incineration to do this zhang and his team have created a synthesized waste formed by combining electronic waste such as cell phones and computer components with samples of incinerated ash the combined waste will be incinerated under laboratory conditions then ground and chemically treated to selectively extract the rare earths cobalt and neodymium these elements are the raw materials for batteries and permanent magnets and are critical to many clean energy technologies such as the turbines used in wind energy zhang said sourcing green energy from red mud in a second project zhang is trying to recover rare earths from bauxite residue or red mud a waste byproduct of aluminum mining operations extracting aluminum from bauxite generates about one to two and half tons of bauxite residue for each ton of aluminum produced this residue often ends up in stockpiles at mining sites or in tailings ponds large man made reservoirs that allow the waterborne waste to settle over time with 16 million tons of aluminum produced in the u s between 2009 and 2019 there are an estimated 16 million tons of bauxite residue locked up in stockpiles and tailings ponds bauxite residue consists of up to 1 percent rare earths such as neodymium lanthanide and cerium said zhang so there are an expected 16 000 tons of rare earths currently sitting in waste stockpiles one of these rare earths neodymium in particular is essential for the production of the strong magnets needed in a variety of growing green energy technologies yet it continues to be in short supply and has been deemed critical in the u s due to supply risks the aim of this project is to develop new technologies and processes that will recover the rare earths from the bauxite residue with a purity of 95 percent or greater by producing high purity rare earths from the bauxite residue we can establish a domestic rare earth supply chain thereby reducing the criticality of these important materials said zhang using food waste to unlock the rare earths in waste in both of zhang s projects the waste is first processed through physical methods such as grinding to make the critical materials easier to recover normally recovery is carried out through a chemical process whereby the rare earths are leached out of the waste through the addition of mineral acids such as sulphuric acid which can be toxic and carry known environmental risks but in a third project zhang and his team are attempting to replace the more harmful mineral acids with safer organic acids that have been derived and microbially converted from food waste in this research funded by a grant from the u s environmental protection agency s people prosperity and the planet p3 program the novel organic acids specifically succinic and lactic acid will be used to leach out the rare earths from both the incinerated ash and bauxite residue waste using organic acids has the potential to greatly reduce the high costs and environmental impacts of traditional food waste treatment said zhang as nearly 40 percent of food in the u s the equivalent of 133 million metric tons normally ends up in landfills leading to air and water pollution we are very excited to be working on these important projects that address real problems surrounding our nation s supply of critical materials said zhang the work also allows us to train our undergraduate and graduate students to be the next generation of experts who can continue the development of domestic critical elements the organic acids used in the people prosperity and the planet p3 project have been derived from a fermentation process conducted by haibo

meatpacking workers at a smithfield foods pork plant in sioux falls south dakota rejected a proposed contract by a 99 percent margin on june 3 setting up a potential strike at a facility that provides five percent of the country s pork production a strike vote is being conducted by the united food and commercial workers union on monday the contract rejection is a further demonstration of the enormous pent up anger and opposition among workers after a year of social murder by the world s governments and major corporations over the course of the pandemic in country after country miners health care workers teachers and educators autoworkers and other key sections of the working class are conducting strikes and protests increasingly corporate demands for more sacrifice which have been supported by the trade unions are being met with militant refusal by workers on sunday volvo truck workers in southwestern virginia voted down a second contract proposal by an overwhelming 90 percent and in april miners at warrior met coal in alabama rejected an agreement by 1 006 to 45 the deals had been backed by the united auto workers and united mine workers of america unions respectively employees and family members protest outside a smithfield foods processing plant in sioux falls south dakota on april 9 2020 ap photo stephen groves the meatpacking industry was already among the most unsafe in the united states before the pandemic with one of the highest rates of industrial accidents primarily repetitive motion injuries notoriously it has also been among the worst hit by the coronavirus nearly 30 percent of the 194 000 meatpacking workers in the united states have tested positive over the past year and at least 296 have died according to the food and environment reporting network unsanitary and cramped conditions on the line where proper cleaning and social distancing protocols are impossible have made such figures inevitable meatpacking plants have also been major transmission vectors into the wider community particularly in rural areas according to researchers from university of california davis counties with large beef or pork packing facilities had infection rates more than double that of similar counties during the first 150 days of the pandemic another study by researchers from columbia and the university of chicago linked as many as 310 000 infections and 5 200 deaths to outbreaks at nearby meatpacking plants the sioux falls plant was the site of one of the earliest major outbreaks in the industry out of a workforce of 3 700 1 294 have been infected and four have died according to osha at one point last april the plant accounted for the large majority of coronavirus infections in the state of south dakota following protests by workers the plant was temporarily idled opposition is mounting inside the plant expressed indirectly by huge rates of absenteeism with hundreds of workers out on long term medical leave forty nine people quit over the previous week alone according to ufcw local 304a president b j motley in spite of the public health disaster centered on the plant smithfield is arrogantly demanding increases of roughly 200 per year to workers out of pocket healthcare expenses workers at the plant already make below the area average for the industry with a starting wage of 17 per hour compared to 19 at a nearby jbs plant the ufcw has said it is asking the company to back off on its health care demands and increase starting wages to the level of jbs we re not heroes anymore are we a worker with nine years at the plant anthony yesker told the associated press they should at least look that we all put our lives on the line to keep the company going while the constant refrain in every contract negotiation is that there is simply not enough money to pay workers livable wages provide fully paid health care and retirement and ensure safe working conditions this is belied by the huge sums handed over to corporate executives and shareholders throughout the social and economic crisis triggered by the pandemic in smithfield s case its parent company hong kong s wh group the biggest pork processor in the world announced over the weekend that it will spend up to 1 9 billion in a new share repurchase program in order to drive up its stock price a move that will primarily benefit the company s largest investors the ufcw has felt compelled to hold a strike vote due to the provocative demands by management and widespread anger among workers however throughout the pandemic the union has played the main role in ensuring the continuation of production in order to maintain the company s flow of profits the ufcw thus bears direct responsibility for the deaths at smithfield and other facilities throughout the country while motley is now posturing as an opponent of management smithfield for its own reasons was able to cite a statement by motley from last may praising the limited safety measures introduced by the company during its shutdown smithfield is doing everything they can for the employees and their safety motley said at the time we stand with smithfield to get this plant back open similar statements were made last year by local ufcw officials at plants throughout the country the most egregious example was at tyson s pork plant in waterloo iowa where the local even worked with management to introduce a perfect attendance bonus as hundreds were falling sick in the facility and as management was taking bets on the number of workers who would catch the virus when a scandal broke out over the betting scheme last fall the ufcw hid behind its lawyers in response to local press inquiries the response prompted even local sheriff tony thompson head of the county s emergency response team to observe that the union was very comfortable with tyson supervisors and far less representative of the workers who were getting sick the first thought i had was shame on tyson corporate thompson said but that was very closely followed by doesn t tyson have a union that should be protecting these people and if they don t why don t they and if they do where the hell are they there is little reason to doubt that the sioux falls workers will vote to authorize a strike however a victorious struggle requires that they take the initiative into their own hands as workers at volvo truck are doing in virginia by forming a rank and file committee to wage a direct struggle against both management and their lackeys in the union for more information about forming a rank and

if we d known the pandemic would trigger the most reckless monetary blowout in history could anyone have imagined that the u s dollar a year later would have fallen by just 14 that doesn t even qualify as a bear market just a middling correction of a powerful bull run begun in 2008 a year ahead of the historic rally in stocks the dollar index was trading around 70 at the time about to embark on a nine year climb to 104 early in 2017 it subsequently swooned as low as 88 early in 2018 but hasn t traded any lower since it s currently at 90 12 that s with the fed showering trillions of dollars in helicopter money on america a feat that achieved a dubious milestone recently when central bank purchases of treasury debt exceeded purchases by foreigners biden for his part has been ramping up outlandish spending proposals promoting the timeless democratic canard that the rich will pay for it all the proposals are likely to grow even more outlandish since biden fears that a republican congressional victory in 2022 could close the window of opportunity for a fiscal expansion dwarfing fdr s new deal stimulus a drop in the bucket so why do i continue to insist nonetheless that we are headed into a catastrophic deflation the short answer is that even tens of trillions of stimulus dollars is just a drop in the bucket compared to a deflationary juggernaut poised to suck inflation into a black hole when the bubble finally pops here s a list of things that will deflate almost to nothing before the central bank has a chance to even attempt a resuscitation a hyperleveraged derivatives market valued notionally at 2 quadrillion the public pension systems of two dozen states residential and commercial real estate currently valued at around 55 trillion money market instruments worth 3 8 trillion that lubricate the financial system short term can you see the problem not that anyone doubts the fed s determination to keep the system liquid at all costs it s just that the central bank s statutory and logistical ability to do so will be outmatched by the precipitous shrinkage that some black swan is destined to cause a powerless fed in the meantime it is a given that the dollar will continue to sink pushing the price of everything higher but don t confuse this with 1970s style inflation when wages and prices interacted to produce a steady rise in both over a period of years in contrast today s inflation is feeding off an asset bubble that could collapse overnight when this happens we ll discover that although the fed excels at ponzi schemes to fatten investable assets it is powerless to rescue agencies that spew real cash dollars continuously the public pension system for example imagine what will occur when the treasury starts sending out monthly checks totaling 30 billion or so to retired illinois workers within days two dozen more states whose pension funds are nearly as bankrupt will line up for their bailouts rescuing all of them would be tantamount to hyperinflation a self defeating exercise since by the fourth or fifth month a 2 500 check would not even buy groceries and well before then of course private pension managers would march on washington seeking handouts for their clients together these problems and sundry others will ultimately overwhelm whatever short lived nuisance inflation lies just ahead but hyperinflation that would require the mass epiphany that bogus dollars are about to be printed in such quantities as to render them absolutely worthless this seems highly unlikely given that biden s rampant stimulus proposals have stirred opposition including from a few democrats whose votes would be needed to enact his plans there is also the question of where people would stash their money in lieu of holding dollars perceived as sinking fast toward worthlessness the stock market and real estate are obvious answers but they are already in bubbles doomed to collapse any way you slice it deleveraging is how this bubble will end inflate or die policies have just about run their course and will require only a shove from a bear market to go over the cliff but if you believe that bear markets no longer happen then by all means bet the ranch on inflation
