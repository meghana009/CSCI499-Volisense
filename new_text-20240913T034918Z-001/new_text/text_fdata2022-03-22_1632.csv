iss and glass lewis are two leading independent third party proxy advisory firms who among other services provide proxy voting recommendations to pension funds investment managers mutual funds and other institutional shareholders in recommending that macro shareholders vote for the arrangement glass lewis cites certainty of value the significant premium offered for the macro common shares and liquidity as important factors and stated overall given the uncertainty surrounding energy infrastructure construction projects including pipeline construction and the fact that no major pipeline projects have recently been announced or approved in canada as well as the overall public sentiment towards pipelines and gas industry and considering that a thorough review of the company s strategic alternatives have been conducted we believe the board arrived at a reasonable conclusion and that the arrangement represents the best path to maximize value for macro shareholders at this time in our opinion iss urged macro shareholders to support the arrangement commenting the company s shares have not traded above the offer price within the last two years and shareholders must weigh the risks associated with the prospect of continuing as a standalone entity execution risk involved with reaching and exceeding the current 4 00 offer price and the immediate risk of reverting closer to prices seen before the announcement of the transaction if the deal falls apart while also noting the special committee s success in negotiating a higher offer consideration reasons to support the arrangement significant premium to market value the cash consideration represents a premium of approximately 46 to the 20 day volume weighted average price of the macro common shares on the tsxv as of february 11

advertisement with huge spikes in yields inverting the curve from three years out recession anyone yet stocks clung on advertisement westpac ash the wrap event wrap fed chair powell s comments were more hawkish than expected emphasising the need to quell inflation rather than caution due to the risks to economic growth will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability in particular if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more at a meeting or meetings we will do so if we determine that we need to tighten beyond common measures of neutral and to a more restrictive stance we will do that as well he said the fed s previous view was for inflation to peak as supply chain distortions abated but admitted that that view has fallen apart and if it continues to fall apart it might necessitate more aggressive action fomc member bostic agreed with the view on the committee that policy needs to get to neutral as quickly as possible he estimates neutral around 2 25 and expected six 25bp increases this year and two more in 2023 he also said that he is not wedded to 25bp moves and that the fed should act on the balance sheet soon the chicago fed national activity index was close to consensus at 0 51 est 0 50 prior revised from 0 69 to 0 59 the level suggests modest above trend growth german ppi in

housing market throughout the quarter us difficulties in sourcing labour remain as a headwind for manufacturing in the march richmond fed index market f c 2 the fomc s wuerffel williams and daly are all due to speak at different events jay powell was super hawkish in congress turning to price stability the inflation outlook had deteriorated significantly this year even before russia s invasion of ukraine the rise in inflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters generally expected for example at the time of our june 2021 meeting every federal open market committee fomc participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the survey of professional forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 percent inflation came in at 5 5 percent for a time moderate inflation forecasts looked plausible the one month headline and core inflation rates declined steadily from april through september but inflation moved up sharply in the fall and just since our december meeting the median fomc projection for year end 2022 jumped from 2 6 percent to 4 3 percent why have forecasts been so far off in my view an important part of the explanation is that forecasters widely underestimated the severity and persistence of supply side frictions which when combined with strong demand especially for durable goods produced surprisingly high inflation the pandemic and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused a serious upheaval in many parts of the economy snarling supply chains constraining labor supply and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in services demand the combination of the surge in goods demand with supply chain bottlenecks led to sharply rising goods prices figure 4 the most notable example here is motor vehicles prices soared across the vehicles sector as booming demand was met by a sharp decline in global production during the summer of 2021 owing to shortages of computer chips production remains below pre pandemic levels and an expected sharp decline in prices has been repeatedly postponed many forecasters including fomc participants had been expecting inflation to cool in the second half of last year as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely available 3 expectations were that the supply side damage would begin to heal schools would reopen freeing parents to return to work and labor supply would begin bouncing back kinks in supply chains would begin resolving and consumption would start rotating back to services all of which could reduce price pressures while schools are open none of the other expectations has been fully met part of the reason may be that contrary to expectations covid has not gone away with the arrival of vaccines in fact we are now headed once again into more covid related supply disruptions from china it continues to seem likely that hoped for supply side healing will come over time as the world ultimately settles into some new normal but the timing and scope of that relief are highly uncertain in the meantime as we set policy we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near term supply side relief by implication if the supply side is not going to loosen up then the fed is going crush the demand side to fit within those limitations advertisement risk markets are fighting the fed aud included it s never a good idea for long

asx200 duly opened up 56 points in the first half hour then the sellers moved in having rallied 2 6 in a week the index was apparently ready for a breather and talk on friday night on wall street was of it too getting a bit frothy sectors that rallied solidly outside of resources on friday pulled back yesterday including healthcare 1 0 and industrials 1 2 while the banks retreated 0 6 after a solid interest rate driven run technology continued to follow the nasdaq 2 5 while the resource sectors posted modest gains following friday s jumps there was reportedly some disappointment that the chinese government did not cut its corporate and household lending rates yesterday in line with all beijing s talk of stimulus but given the pboc left its rate unchanged last week upon which the government bases its rates no change was widely expected economists suggest cuts will come in the june quarter it then gets a bit weird after an initial plunge and last hour comeback last night the s p500 closed flat our futures are up 80 points or 1 1 this morning so much for a breather we can look to another 7 pop for oil prices overnight and a 3 6 gain for aluminium on the lme as positive drivers and perhaps a hint the fed might hike its rate by the full 50 points at its next meeting which is a positive sign for banks but 80 points more on all that below but for now we might note

we will do so the fed chair told the us national association for business economics last night around early afternoon new york time the six day rally on wall street had stalled in the morning but on that note the dow plunged over 400 points there was much talk heading into the march fed meeting last week that the fomc might go a full 50 points on its first hike until powell confirmed ahead of the meeting it would only be 25 but now 50 is back on the table for the next meeting in may and maybe again thereafter in each of the rally sessions leading up to last night the indices accelerated into the close last night once the shock had sunk in wall street again rallied to the close is 50bp that much of a surprise the nasdaq had been hardest hit as in response to powell the us ten year yield shot up 17 points to 2 32 to mark the highest level since 2019 the spread from the two year yield fell to under 20 basis points which recently had been a support level to imply recession indications are growing powell is nevertheless confident a currently strong us economy can cope with more aggressive tightening and on the late comeback last night wall street seems to agree the dow ended up as the underperformer last night but then about 50 of the 201 fall was contributed by high priced boeing which fell 3 6 after a chinese 737 not a max fell out of the sky wall street also took in its stride another jump up in oil prices which bumped up the energy sector by 3 8 yet only had the typical losers of consumer discretionary 0 8 and communication services 0 7 down modestly with the s p

venture with rusal in queensland aluminium ltd in a state of flux the australian government s move was enough to send aluminium up on the lme from the open with the nickel price not quite limit down

u n member states met this month in new york to hash out a treaty governing the sustainable management of the high seas resource rich international waters that span about two thirds of the ocean hopes were high that after 10 years of discussion and three previous negotiating sessions delegates to the meeting would finalize a legally binding treaty talks ended march 18 with no deal amid a failure to reach consensus on several key points including how to establish marine protected areas on the high seas a movement to protect 30 of the ocean by 2030 depends on the swift completion of a high seas treaty and observers say a deal remains within reach by the end of the year u n member states failed on march 18 to finalize a legally binding tool to sustainably manage the largest ungoverned place on the planet the high seas the lack of agreement came after almost two weeks of talks in new york three previous conferences and more than a decade of discussion almost 27 000 unique species including fish mammals reptiles birds and invertebrates have been found in these vast waters covering almost half the surface of the planet according to the ocean biodiversity information system and those are just the ones we know about these resource rich international waters span about two thirds of the ocean exclusive economic zones eezs governed by states with adjacent coastlines make up the rest however ocean life does not respect these boundaries what happens in the high seas affects eez ecosystems and fish catch profits and vice versa but the high seas come under the jurisdiction of no one and there is no comprehensive agreed framework governing resource exploitation or conservation there we can t have 95 of our global commons left as gangland without the rule of law helen clark the former prime minister of new zealand and an ocean advocate tweeted shortly before the inability of the talks to reach an agreement became public and unfortunately that s the risk you run when you don t have specific provisions in international law for those areas that are beyond national jurisdiction the intergovernmental conference aimed to unify states globally to take responsibility for international waters in an equitable way that preserves fish stocks and other shared resources for future generations this was the fourth of four diplomatic sessions planned since 2017 it marked the resumption of talks after a two year delay due to the covid 19 pandemic and hopes were high it would finalize a legally binding treaty delegates from the 193 u n member states attended the recent talks trying to iron out kinks across four key areas equitably sharing of marine genetic resources mgrs implementing area based management tools like marine protected areas mpas setting standards for environmental impact assessments for activities on the high seas and assisting developing countries to effectively meet treaty objectives by sharing knowledge and marine technology with them frankly they ran out of time liz karan project director of the high seas conservation program at washington d c based public policy group pew charitable trusts told mongabay there was no one issue that prevented final agreement but rather the pace of negotiations was slow and not all the draft text was even able to be discussed stumbling blocks to an agreement consensus remained snagged on stumbling blocks persistent throughout the three previous negotiation sessions how the treaty might interact with the many regional organizations including fisheries management bodies that are already in place when establishing mpas was a real sticking point according to karan to succeed the talks need to work out how to address the piecemeal nature of the conservation mandates of existing bodies and unify efforts holistically she said but there are those countries and sectoral interests that don t want to change the status quo views remain polarized on how to equitably manage mgrs mirella von lindenfels director of u k based marine science think tank international programme on the state of the ocean ipso who attended the negotiations in a civil society capacity told mongabay broadly defined by the convention on biological diversity as any genetic material of actual or potential value to humans that originates in the ocean mgrs cover anything from microbes to algae to whales medicines and other products derived from mgrs are valuable for having the potential to both save lives and be profitable yet many developing countries despite having equal claim on high seas mgrs don t have the resources to conduct scientific research on the high seas find genetic resources and develop commercial products delegates sought but failed to agree on how to extend access to these countries something fishy although fish are one of the main resources extracted from the high seas and subject to much illegal exploitation there several delegates were keen to exclude fisheries from the treaty altogether this is purely driven by commercial interests tom pickerell director of u k based global tuna alliance a group of seafood companies championing sustainable tuna industry standards told mongabay it is of course a silly view as better ecosystem management will ultimately benefit commercial fish stocks as well as ocean health pickerell said still he said the final treaty is unlikely to govern fisheries access or allocation the treaty negotiation comes under the auspices of the convention on the law of the sea which is not an environmental agreement delegates in the room were likely being guided by their defense agriculture fisheries and trade ministries as well as their environment ministries according to karan who attended as an ngo observer and they often have scant environmental background themselves the complexity of the elements at play means that many states rely on a treaty tracker from the high seas alliance this group of more than 40 conservation ngos including ipso and pew charitable trusts together with the international union for conservation of nature iucn help delegates understand the environmental details of what has been said in plenary sessions they represent the ocean in the room lindenfels said however this session civil society was not granted access to the talks until week two due to covid 19 restrictions so the high seas alliance monitored negotiations via webcast and ran briefing sessions for delegates from a meeting room in a nearby hotel pressure to finalize the treaty in 2022 a legal process to establish a network of marine protected areas on the high seas would be the single most important outcome of this treaty karan said but trying to create a network of mpas using an agreement that couldn t say anything about fish would be problematic and observers say it may be a real possibility around 1 of the high seas currently falls within mpas globally mpas cover almost 29 million square kilometers just over 11 million square miles which may sound like a lot but is actually only 7 7 of the ocean scientists agree this is not enough and say we need to protect at least 30 of the ocean to safeguard biodiversity the u n s post 2020 global biodiversity framework another draft treaty aims to facilitate just that by 2030 due to be finalized in may at the cop15 biodiversity summit in china the framework contains a goal nicknamed 30 by 30 implementation of 30 by 30 currently depends on the completion of a high seas treaty for a legal mechanism to create mpas in the high seas without this countries would need to designate almost all the eezs on the planet as mpas to reach that target and that is just not going to happen to protect that 30 by 2030 we need the high seas treaty now karan said because it takes time to ratify a treaty and until that s done the lengthy process of proposing high seas mpas can t even begin what now almost 50 countries including the entire eu joined a high ambition high seas coalition set up in january and pledged to agree on a treaty for the high seas before the year is out notable absences include china and the u s observers of the recent negotiation agreed the majority of delegates made a genuine effort to finalize the treaty they said the general mood was disappointed but hopeful as a strong agreement later in the year is possible talks are not deadlocked they said just complicated and out of time for now every day that we don t have a treaty is a day lost to ocean and climate protection lindenfels said we must complete this treaty in 2022 and states should do everything in their power to ensure that happens banner image pacific bluefin tuna thunnus orientalis a species people fish as it migrates through the high seas image by rhett a

investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips well before the shattering of the modern global order inflation represented a massive problem from pain at the pump to sticker shock at the grocery aisle prices only seemed to have one direction up with the russian invasion of ukraine the fragility of the economic recovery became cruelly exposed still if there s one sector that should survive and possibly thrive it s utility stocks underlining this market segment is its indispensability you can go without your caramel flavored double shot latte at a trendy coffee shop but you can t go without electricity when you flip on the switch you expect something to happen similarly when you push down on the handle following usage of the facilities you expect the material to go away that s the beauty of utility stocks you don t really think about them until you need to and under the current circumstances there s going to be a lot of thinking going on true utility stocks are not without risks however since we can t live without the underlying businesses they ll be the last to suffer personal budget cuts it s cynical but that s reality if you re looking for utility stocks to buy here are seven to keep on your radar nextera energy nyse nee nyse exelon nasdaq exc nasdaq duke energy nyse duk nyse sempra energy nyse sre nyse dominion energy nyse d nyse essential utilities nyse wtrg nyse waste management nyse wm utility stocks to buy nextera energy nee source madamf shutterstock com specializing in renewable energy infrastructures nextera energy has lone been relevant as the political climate started pivoting to sustainable solutions true some of the policies under former president donald trump s administration may have dragged the impetus toward climate friendly initiatives but president joe biden s white house appears at least on paper determined to bring ecologically responsible policies to the forefront but nothing gets the wheels moving like desperation which is why nextera energy may be one of the winners among utility stocks admittedly on a year to date basis nee distracts with a double digit loss at the time of writing however as a bloomberg reporter pointed out russia s dangerously destabilizing decision to invade ukraine brought heightened urgency to renewable infrastructure should projects like wind and solar power become more integrated with modern societies this could potentially lessen exposure of western countries to those with questionable profiles to put it diplomatically therefore nee might be a long term idea among utility stocks to consider for patient investors exelon exc source photosounds shutterstock com back in the spring of 2021 the chicago tribune reported that exelon lost nearly 300 million in the first quarter of that year of course the company blamed the texas cold snap a tragic event that took innocent lives and left others reeling it s a terrible circumstance that texans are not likely to forget anytime soon however the freak weather event is also a lesson in the vitality of utility stocks in another chicago tribune article the news agency laid out its case for why exelon contributed to texas power nightmare let s face it exc is not the first among utility stocks to generate controversy nor will it be the last but the overriding issue is that utility stocks are indispensable in many areas no other alternatives exist meaning that the money is going to flow in no matter what unsurprisingly then exc is positive on a ytd basis and is up 42 during the trailing year utility stocks to buy duke energy duk source jonathan weiss shutterstock com a classic go to when discussing utility stocks to buy duke energy brings a lot to like to the table acquiring shares gets you access to its 3 8 dividend yield with stability at a high premium that yield is worth much more under the context of the current market environment in addition i like that duke energy covers the eastern states namely the carolinas florida ohio kentucky and indiana as multiple agencies have covered the carolinas represent popular millennial destination spots for cost of living and other reasons most importantly duke is a stalwart among utility stocks with a proven track record in 2020 revenue understandably dipped 5 against 2019 s result but the company was back on track in 2021 with pre pandemic norms as well net income last year was 3 9 billion up 4 from 2019 s tally sempra energy sre source michael vi shutterstock com sempra energy is so fundamental to california that it s essentially a tax to those that live in the southern regions of the golden state i would know personally because i just got hit hard by sempra even though i didn t do anything differently that s because sempra energy and its subsidiaries collectively form a powerful political lobby therefore it s no stranger to controversy but the fact is there s nothing regular people can do about it when you flip the switch and nothing happens that s dangerous for society yes i m taking the narrative of sre to a rather gloomy area but here s the point we already live in gloomy times yet that s no excuse to not pay the bills which is why utility stocks are cynically viable utility stocks to buy dominion energy d source felix mizioznikov shutterstock com a solid idea for those seeking more protection than capital gains dominion energy is up around 12 over the trailing year further it provides a dividend yield of 3 3 that s a bit below the average yield for utility stocks of 3 75 still the combination of reliability and passive income may be too good for some investors to pass up what i really like about d stock though is its coverage area focusing on services in virginia and north carolina dominion is putting its eggs in a very viable basket virginia s population grew 7 9 between 2010 and 2020 a slightly faster pace than the rest of the nation we might continue to see positive growth considering the ridiculous cost of living in other trendy states as for north carolina it too is growing adding 112 000 people a gain of 1 1 between april 2020 and july 2021 with utility stocks you want to invest longer term in names that are experiencing a widening consumer base which is a major selling point for dominion essential utilities wtrg source hquality shutterstock com while many discussions on utility stocks tend to focus on power delivery it s important not to forget about our most precious resource water indeed with drought impacting many states particularly in the southwest region water resources and services will likely command a premium what s worse californians are saving less water even as drought conditions worsen per the los angeles times whether you live in california or not is besides the point broadly speaking it comes down to basic economic principles supply and demand thus i m bullish on essential utilities if only for purely cynical reasons providing drinking water and wastewater treatment essential utilities has stakes in pennsylvania ohio north carolina illinois texas new jersey indiana and virginia from an investor s perspective we have a delightful combination states that benefit from strong migration patterns and the delivery of a commodity that no one can live without utility stocks to buy waste management wm source rblfmr shutterstock com before you get ready to

a subscriber asked us recently where he should be putting his money and how to limit losses in his retirement portfolio he expressed frustration as he watched warren buffett s berkshire hathaway nyse stock going up but at the same time the stock indices going lower and many of his previously favored stocks experiencing substantial losses this conversation naturally piqued our curiosity we decided to look into this for him and share our findings berkshire hathaway stock traded at an all time record high price of 520 654 46 at a stock price of 512 991 berkshire s market capitalization is 756 23 billion last year berkshire generated a record 27 46 billion of operating profit including gains at geico car insurance the bnsf railroad and berkshire hathaway energy berkshire versus s p 500 benchmark buffett age 91 known as the sage of omaha is the chairman and ceo of berkshire hathaway he is considered by many to be the most successful stock investor in the world and according to forbes real time billionaire list has a personal net worth that exceeds 120 billion very few can compete with his long term track record since 1965 berkshire has provided 20 average annual returns almost double the 10 2 average annual returns for the stock index benchmark the 2022 year to date comparison is brk a berkshire hathaway 14 53 spdr s p 500 nyse 6 36 facebook nasdaq 35 64 however according to buffett s own humility he has endured years of underperformance and has had his share of bad stock picks when buffet was asked about drawdowns at one of berkshire s annual meetings he stated unless you can watch your stock holdings decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market according to www finance yahoo com the five biggest percentage losses for berkshire have been 1974 48 7 1990 23 1 1999 19 9 2008 31 8 2015 12 5 what can we learn from the buffett indicator the buffett indicator as dubbed by berkshire shareholders is the ratio of the total united states stock market valuations the wilshire 5000 stock index divided by the annual u s gdp the indicator peaked at the beginning of 2022 and remains near all time highs even though many stocks are well off their record levels this historical chart of the buffett indicator was created by www currentmarketvaluation com doing quantitative analysis we learn that the indicator is more than 1 6 standard deviations above the historical average which suggests the market is over valued and in time will fall back to its historical average berkshire hathaway at fibonacci resistance on march 18 berkshire hit an all time high price of 520 654 the fibonacci resistance level of 2 618 or 261 8 of the march 23 low of 239 440 is 520 196 as shown on the daily chart berkshire also met resistance at the 2 618 standard deviations of the quarterly bollinger band the benchmark s p 500 spy etf the s p 500 index is the industry standard benchmark when comparing investment returns it s worth noting that as berkshire reached the fibonacci 2 618 resistance spdr s p 500 nyse found support at the fibonacci 1 618 of the spy march 23 2020 low central banks have begun to tighten credit by raising interest rates for the first time since 2018 attempting to bring fast rising energy food and housing prices under control more time is needed to determine the full impact that rising global interest rates will have on current markets however on the chart below we can see that spy put in a major top around 480 and for the time being has found support around 420 the fibonacci 1 618 level considering the increased market volatility and that we are now entering a cycle of higher interest rates it would not surprise us to see spy eventually break below 420 it is worth noting that when a market makes a top after a prolonged bull market we usually experience distribution distribution with volatility results from large institutions beginning to liquidate their holdings while smaller retail investors are trying to buy stocks on sale in other words the retail investors are buying the dip hoping to get a bargain while the institutional investors are selling the rally hoping to be liquidated and or go short it is a battle that retail investors will eventually lose it is important to understand we are not saying the market has topped and is headed lower this article sheds some light on some interesting analyses that you should be aware of as technical traders we follow price only and when a new trend has been confirmed we will change our positions accordingly

dean a 14 year old girl has a 3 inch by 8 inch scar on her hip it s usually numb with nerve damage but when pressed it sometimes flares up with shooting pain every time the weather gets warm enough to go to the beach it makes her feel embarrassed dean made this scar one small act at a time it s not her only one i would try to stay clean and then relapse and then try to stay clean then relapse she said dean who prefers to remain anonymous has struggled with self harm in various ways since the age of 9 she told the epoch times dean said she started to self harm at a time when she felt stressed and lonely some of her friends had moved away and self harm felt like a way to exert control in a chaotic situation then it became an addiction about the time when i was 12 i started realizing it was kind of an addiction at that point dean said dean s addiction to self harm was bolstered by her time on the internet she said websites she spent time on taught her that self harm was normal i was hearing these kinds of people have done it so it s clearly not too horrible she said social media pages that publicize self harm have often inadvertently led vulnerable young people into self harm according to psychologists although many of these social media pages are officially against self harm some of the jokes stories and advice in them tend almost to celebrate it dean a girl who struggles with self harm holds a knitting row counter the counter was gifted to her by a friend and symbolizes that there is always someone who will listen to what you re saying courtesy of dean more hurt than ever recent recent statistics suggest that among young women and girls self harm is an increasingly large trend that might affect up to 30 percent of teens according to psychiatrist dr jess shatkin about 15 to 20 percent of young americans have self harmed at least once most people who self harm do it for a brief period of time and don t continue he said there s a lot of experimentation and relatively less follow through however these numbers aren t a good estimate he said most self harm isn t reported the rise in self harm follows a general trend of increasing mental illness that has been true since the 1940s shatkin said this trend isn t because of changing medical definitions or diagnostic criteria the criteria by which we diagnose symptomatically people with depression and anxiety have not changed dramatically since 1980 yet we ve seen rates go up and up he said this high number doesn t mean self harm is normal according to psychiatrist dr pamela cantor it means that young people today are in a place of terrible mental suffering i have more phone calls now than i ve ever had she said not only are there more calls about self harm but the kids making the calls are also younger cantor said she s received calls about suicidal children as young as 6 and 7 cantor said that increased self destructive behavior encompasses both social issues and psychological pain into the rabbit hole dean got deeper into self harm by going online when she was struggling with suicidal thoughts depression and anxiety she started researching these topics by looking on reddit and pinterest i was going on to more of the forums and seeing how people did it how it helped them the poetry people write about how it feels it seemed logical she said and it seemed like if i want to stave off suicide this seems like a good way to do it dean said that among friends her age people often try self harm to see if they can do it it is pretty common for people to try it and experiment with it she said but i don t know how many people latch on to it if dean s friends see her scars they tend not to tell the adults in her life she said instead they encourage her to look for support from hotlines or from people online a few have said if you promise me you re trying to get better i won t tell any adults i won t tell the counselor or i won t tell any teachers dean said but usually what they say is reach out online call a hotline if you need it dean said that if she had known about the many long term effects of self harm scars she wouldn t have hurt herself her scars itch sometimes sting and other times feel numb when people see them they raise awkward questions and difficult conversations i don t think i would have done it she said there are just the little things you don t think about according to cantor teenagers like dean are often more influenced by what their peers around them do than older adults are dr pamela cantor psychiatrist courtesy of pamela cantor their identity is not as well formed she said of young people young people wear the same shoes dress the same way and all try to fit in because they often don t know who they are yet cantor said when kids like dean enter environments where self harm is seen as normal their perception of what they should do can shift dramatically she said participating in online communities that celebrate self harm can often cause problems for young people pages dedicated to self harm can promote copycat behavior competitive behavior and one upmanship she said competing to be worse ruth 20 is a mechanical engineer judo practitioner avid reader and committed christian she has also been struggling with self harm for about two years it became the way she dealt with stress i don t remember why i initially did it the first time she said i wanted to see that i was able to do this it was like a challenge ruth s explanation for her behavior is complex with a web of feelings that tend to conflict in the moments before she hurts herself she often finds that some part of her screams at her not to do it but at the same time she wants to do it anyway even when i ve been the most into self harm it is still somewhat difficult to actually hurt yourself she said ruth said that the most difficult part of her self harm addiction is that it has made her feel distant from god my relationship with god is a holy thing that i wish i really hadn t messed with she said and i kind of i broke it all down and i have to build it back up again ruth said she has long struggled with suicidal urges and self harm but social media has made her fight against self destructive urges more difficult some of ruth s struggle with self harm comes from reddit pages she shouldn t be on the self harm page r madeofstyrofoam but she still is she said three other popular reddit pages on self harm are r selfharm_memes r selfharm and r selfharmscars many posts on these pages normalize and glorify self harm many of these reddit pages use a series of euphemisms that dehumanize the body lacerations are yeeting the white flesh just beneath the skin is styrofoam and beans are the bubbles of fat deeper underneath the skin one of the rules on the subreddit is no glorification of self harm she said of the subreddit r madeofstyrofoam but there s 100 percent glorification of self harm it s like a competition ruth said of her experience there panda is ruth s stuffed animal she is a source of comfort for me and also a constant in my life even though i m in college and technically an adult now i still sleep with her every night and i love her so much ruth said courtesy of ruth in self harm subreddits people often try to outdo each other with stories of how much they ve hurt themselves ruth said it becomes a competition we all want to have it worst it s a very human thing she said when reddit users hear someone else s story of greater suffering they often feel like it takes away their right to feel hurt ruth said to regain their feelings of justification they sometimes hurt themselves in an even worse way the hurt leading the hurt the self harm subreddits are something between a support group a joke page a hobby club and a public performance and some of the participants don t want to get well personally i don t want to get better one reddit user on r selfharm_memes said another post on r selfharm_memes joked about bandaging self harm wounds with socks rather than bandages no one advised the original poster on how to quit on r selfharm_memes users are allowed to post photographs of self harm weapons as long as they are part of a meme in one post on r madeofstyrofoam a reddit user asks the subreddit for help on a problem after harming himself at school enough for the injury to be obvious the user learned that his dad was going to meet him in the next few minutes the user asked the subreddit for advice on how to hide the injury so his dad wouldn t find out instead of advising the self harmer to tell his dad and get help reddit participants advised him on how to hide the injury maybe make a small cut on your finger and then ask for a bandaid go to the bathroom and try to cover as much as possible one commenter advised paper tissue is a bad idea since it can get stuck in the wound another commenter advised but no one told the user to open up to the people around him in his life about his self harm problem the subreddit for r madeofstyrofoam s rules say what you write is your own business the subreddit r selfharmscars shows pictures of healed or partly healed self harm scars according to studies images of self harm scars can often tempt people to harm themselves i like blooood a post on r selfharm is titled stopppp you made me laugh out loud in class omfg a comment on the post reads the rules on r selfharm prohibit glorifying self harm for someone such as ruth these jokes and images strengthen parts of herself that she wants to defeat some days i m very proud of my scars ruth said some days i m definitely not proud of my scars because i m 20 and these are going to be on my body probably my entire life the epoch times contacted reddit about its policy on pages that have people glorifying self harm but has yet to receive a response according to psychologist dr terri apter if a community with the same problem isn t working to get better they tend to make each other worse self harm therefore becomes a means of assuring them they fit into a group she said therefore they have a disincentive to learn new ways of managing their anxieties fighting to recover no matter the cause when teens develop an addiction to self harm the addiction often remains long after the original reasons disappear one sign of potential self harm is if someone always wears long sleeves no matter the temperature evan elliott amy a 19 year old from tennessee started self harming in middle school because she had a lot of friends who did it she said it later became pretty much an addiction she told the epoch times at first it was mainly just a way of trying to be cool with my friends and then i became reliant on it amy said that as a kid she often felt like her feelings of depression weren t valid but actual physical wounds gave her a reason to feel bad amy said that many of her friends who self harmed also had their addiction start after they learned about self harm from friends or online but after young people get addicted to self harm it s not easy to stop when amy stopped being friends with the person she had originally tried to impress with self harm she said she realized self harm wasn t cool it was horrible by then however she found that she couldn t stop freshman year ish would be when i was like okay this is not cool anymore stop she said and then i realized i can t stop amy stopped self harming when she got a seasonal job that was so exhausting she didn t have time to self harm she said after the job ended she chose to stay clean i was like i don t really want to throw away this progress that i ve made and it kind of just went on from there amy said today amy is proud to be at about 450 days without self harm she said to help keep herself from self harming amy has familiarized herself with the tools she once used for self harm this practice has helped her think of the objects as tools again rather than as weapons it made it a lot easier to associate it more with its intended use rather than what i would want to use it for she said how to help internet forums aren t the best way to help people who struggle with self harm psychologists say people should take self harm behavior seriously and should have the courage to ask questions if they re suspecting a loved one is self harming said dr john bradley president of the massachusetts psychiatric society people who self harm have a high risk of committing suicide he said they aren t harming themselves to get attention they re harming themselves because they don t have good coping strategies for stress self harm often worsens over time it certainly can become addictive bradley said its effects can be reinforcing in their own right and create this addictive pattern parents and friends can watch for physical signs of self harm like strange injuries or a tendency to hide a nonprivate body part bradley said but these signs of self

2 27 p m edt mr price good afternoon happy monday sorry we re starting a couple minutes late here i ll get to your questions but two items at the top today this morning as i know many of you all saw at the u s holocaust memorial museum the secretary announced that the state department has after rigorous factual and legal analysis determined that members of the burmese military committed genocide and crimes against humanity against the rohingya since the holocaust the united states has concluded only seven other times that genocide was committed this determination marks the eighth burma s military has for decades committed unspeakable atrocities against burma s population and that includes ethnic and religious minorities and pro democracy activists in 2016 and 2017 burma s military unleashed a wave of horrific violence in northern rakhine state against predominantly muslim rohingya that at the time the united states concluded constituted ethnic cleansing since 2017 the department and others have worked to investigate and document these atrocities the united states is committed to pursuing truth and justice for victims and accountability for those responsible for these atrocities and for other human rights violations and abuses across burma as the secretary made clear justice and accountability whether via international or domestic courts must be part of the pathway out of genocide in burma our commitment includes support for international mechanisms like the independent investigative mechanism for myanmar iimm for which the secretary announced a nearly 1 million contribution to support its mandate to investigate collect preserve and analyze evidence of the most egregious and serious international crimes in burma since 2011 although this determination focuses on genocide and crimes against humanity against the rohingya burma s military has committed atrocities against members of other ethnic and religious minority groups across burma for decades many of the military leaders involved in the genocidal campaign against rohingya in 2016 and 2017 including the general who led it are the same ones who overthrew burma s democratically elected government on february 1st of last year and since the coup we have seen the burmese military use many of the same tactics only now the military is targeting anyone in burma it sees as opposing or undermining its repressive rule shining a light on these atrocities is critical to ending the decades of impunity that has brought burma to the crisis it is in today we call on the international community to do more to stop the burmese military s violence including by ending the sale and transfer of arms materiel dual use equipment and technical assistance to the burmese military regime and its representatives we are working with our allies and partners to achieve this we reiterate our call for the burmese military regime to end its use of violence release all those unjustly detained and engage in constructive dialogue with all parties to restore burma s path to democracy next and finally the world continues to witness russia s unrelenting and coldblooded bombardment of ukraine causing death and destruction these strikes have destroyed civilian infrastructure including a maternity hospital apartment buildings and an art school where 400 civilians were sheltering and hundreds if not thousands of innocent men women and children have lost their lives in this needless carnage in the face of it president zelenskyy and the people of ukraine continue to show strength and courage in the country s fight against these kremlin forces as russia s forces continue to die needlessly in ukraine and the economic costs of the war mount within russia president zelenskyy has also made it very clear that he is open to a diplomatic solution that does not compromise the core principles at the heart of the kremlin s war against ukraine the effects of putin s war of choice aren t restricted to ukraine and russia however this conflict has had ripple effects around the world it calls into question security and prosperity for all of us on issues ranging from self governance to human rights to energy and food security that is why we cannot stand quiet we must all stand up for what is right we support the people of ukraine in their just cause the defense of their country and their defense of their democracy and as we have done since the beginning of this crisis we will continue to support ukraine s efforts to de escalate through diplomacy in order to secure a ceasefire and the withdrawal of russia s troops from ukraine we know that diplomacy requires both sides to genuinely engage in good faith but president putin has made no indication that he is prepared to stop the onslaught this war we know is not going according to putin s plan a quick victory has been stymied by ukraine whenever and however this war ends the united states and the international community will together with our partners in ukraine ensure that putin s war of choice is a long term strategic failure for the kremlin with that i am happy to take your questions question thanks ned i do have a question or two about burma mr price sure question but i ll let them i we need to get this russia diplomacy stuff out of the way first and that is what if anything do you take from this démarche that the kremlin or that the russian foreign ministry says that it delivered to ambassador sullivan today which according to them warned that we re on the brink of severing diplomatic relations mr price well i will leave it to ask you to question ask me laughter mr price i will leave it to you to laughter question well let me expound on mr price i know you always have you re always willing to postulate but i will leave it to you to ask the kremlin what message it was that they may have wished to relay i can tell you the message that was relayed by ambassador sullivan when he met with russian government officials as you know as a general matter we don t speak to every single diplomatic communication but i will say this ambassador sullivan took advantage of this encounter to demand that the russian government follow international law and basic human decency for that matter and allow consular access to all u s citizen detainees in russia including those in pre trial detention you ve heard from us say in recent days that we have repeatedly made this ask this request for consular access to american citizen detainees and we have consistently and improperly been denied access for months this is completely unacceptable it is in direct contravention of russia s international obligations under the vienna convention and under our bilateral agreement on consular access to detainees question okay so he did not take this opportunity to raise the situation in ukraine at all mr price matt we have a number of avenues where we can raise our concerns including here in public again i m not going to read out the entirety of that session but if you listen to the russians they had a message that they wanted to convey we too have a message that ambassador sullivan was very direct in conveying when it comes to what we ve heard from the ministry of foreign affairs as they have explained they have given their version of events i think it is worth repeating that russia is carrying out an unprovoked and an unjustified war on ukraine and we are seeing clearly evidence that they are intentionally targeting civilians and committing indiscriminate attacks president biden s comments last week the comments that were later echoed by secretary blinken and others they speak to the horror of the brutality russia has unleashed on an innocent neighbor an innocent neighbor that posed absolutely no threat or security risk to russia we warned russia before the invasion began that if they were to move forward with it they would face severe consequences and unprecedented costs unprecedented economic costs financial costs diplomatic isolation strategic weakness on the world stage and that s exactly what has happened and the united states along with our allies and partners we will continue to raise those costs until and unless president putin relents in this war of choice that he has continues to perpetrate against ukraine his economic woes will grow his financial woes will grow his diplomatic isolation will only increase and his strategic weakness on the world stage will only develop further over time we believe at the same time and this is the very reason why ambassador sullivan was there today it s the very reason why jake sullivan spoke to his counterpart mr patrushev last week it s the very reason we have deconfliction channels on a tactical level with moscow we believe it s important to maintain channels of communication with russia you ve heard us say before that open dialogue or the ability to engage in open dialogue it s crucial especially during times of tension especially during times of conflict we have sought to maintain those open lines of communication we have sought to maintain a diplomatic presence in moscow we have sought for the russians to be able to continue to maintain a diplomatic presence here in the united states now the russians at just about every turn have taken actions that call into question whether they too welcome these same open lines of communication we find them important we find them necessary but i ll leave it to the kremlin to speak to their thoughts question well except that they did call him in so i mean they re obviously interested in communicating something they say that they the foreign ministry statement said that they summoned him because they wanted to complain about president biden s comments that you just mentioned is it safe to assume that ambassador sullivan said that the u s stands by the comments of the president the war criminal comments that the president made and that the secretary then repeated mr price i think it is safe to assume that ambassador sullivan as he has consistently done has made clear to his russian interlocutors the costs that before the invasion would befall the russian federation if they went forward with this action question no no no mr price and since then the fact that the costs will continue to climb until and unless president putin relents question but specifically they said that the comments were inappropriate and not becoming of a person you know what they said so did he mr price it s awfully rich to hear a country speak about quote unquote inappropriate comments when that same country is engaged in mass slaughter including strikes and attacks that have resulted in civilian lives strikes and attacks barrages that have leveled civilian cities an invasion of a hundred plus thousand forces against a largely civilian population that s awfully rich to hear that country speak about unacceptable comments question last one just on his point you said was to talk about the treatment of the u s detainees the three of them that we know most about i don t know if there are others but has there been any change in the case of trevor reed paul whelan or brittney griner mr price there has been no change in those cases and that s part of the reason why ambassador sullivan took advantage of the encounter took advantage of the opportunity to stress russia s obligation including under international law including under its obligations under the vienna convention to allow consular access to individuals like paul whelan like trevor reed like brittney griner we have not yet been granted any consular access to brittney griner it has been some months since we have been allowed to see question are you able to say if they offered him any assurances on the detainees mr price i have nothing to relay on that question no thank you question to clarify the president called putin a war criminal as i recall the secretary says war crimes were committed did he actually call putin a war criminal the secretary of state mr price the secretary when he was addressing all of you last week from this podium question right he i recall he said that war crimes were committed mr price he said personally that he agrees with the president question so he is calling putin a war criminal mr price secretary blinken echoed the same sentiment that the president conveyed a day earlier that it is impossible as a human to witness what is transpiring what has transpired in ukraine to look at the horrific imagery a strike against a maternity hospital in mariupol not to mention attacks against civilian neighborhoods schools residential buildings apartment buildings and as a human to come away from that feeling that war crimes have been committed the president was speaking from the heart secretary blinken was doing the same echoing precisely what the president had said the day before now of course that doesn t obviate the fact that this building as it always does is conducting a rigorous analysis collecting evidence analyzing that evidence sharing that information with international partners and if to knowing that there is a legal definition of war crimes that has to be met as a matter of law and policy before this building can issue such a formal proclamation question so the question is i mean you talked about diplomacy and the need and the necessity of maintaining open channels and so on i mean when you call someone a war criminal that s really at a point of no return so to speak in terms of engaging them diplomatically and so what is the next step probably severing relations or something like that mr price said it s rare that we negotiate or conduct this type of diplomacy with friends it is this kind of diplomacy that we have supported the ukrainians are engaged in our allies and partners are engaged in for one reason and one reason alone to save lives it is a fact that the russian federation is the belligerent in this case that has invaded a country that posed no threat that continues to have its forces on sovereign ukrainian territory that continues to assault ukraine with bombs and missiles and artillery and gunfire resulting in hundreds if not thousands of civilian casualties and untold more in terms of ukrainians and russians who have already lost their lives in this needless conflict so yes as is president zelenskyy as is the ukrainian government we are committed to seeing through the diplomatic path recognizing that only through the path of diplomacy will we be able to save lives diplomacy oftentimes requires that you negotiate with those who you probably wouldn t describe as friends those who may be unsavory those who as in this case are responsible for violence and carnage but we re doing that with one goal and one goal in mind to bring this war to an end and to save innocent life paul question i got a couple questions one is i didn t really understand something you said at the top where you said president zelenskyy made it clear that he s open to a democratic diplomatic solution that and then you said that does not compromise the core principles at the heart of the kremlin s war against ukraine so i that didn t make sense that sounds like you re supporting the kremlin s principles but anyway if you could clear up what you were trying to say there mr price sure question secondly all these reports of the russians forcibly forcing people from mariupol to russia which could be considered a war crime do you have any information that would confirm those reports mr price so on your second question what remains true is that we continue to see evidence every day pointing to acts actions activities that may constitute war crimes we are taking a very close very thorough look and examination of all of the information that is available to us to determine formally as a formal matter if war crimes have been committed when it comes to the situation in mariupol we continue to call on the russian government to allow genuine safe passage so that civilians can depart cities and towns of ukraine that are besieged by russian forces and allow deliveries of humanitarian goods in short when it comes to mariupol when it comes to other cities that are under siege we want the opportunity for civilians to go out humanitarian supplies to go in that is what is important to us the reality continues to be that while humanitarian goods are gathered and en route to the areas most in need the convoys typically are not able to reach people in besieged cities this is what appears to us to be blatant excuse me blatant manipulation and exacerbation of human suffering to serve nothing more than the kremlin s political ends as the international committee of the red cross stated quote with no aid the people in mariupol are being suffocated we have seen growing reports of this type of abhorrent behavior including intentional attacks of civilians by russian forces in mariupol these reports include as i mentioned before the attack on the maternity hospital bombing a theater clearly marked as a shelter for children reports that russian forces are attempting to use hundreds of civilians at an intensive care hospital as human shields while continuing to fire on ukraine s soldiers these brutal tactics demonstrate an utter indifference to human life and they are appalling the this continues a horrific trend civilian deaths we know are multiplying as is destruction of civilian infrastructure what seems to be the case and you heard this from a number of officials including our senior intelligence officials when they testified before congress in recent days that president putin had in his mind a clear plan a plan that would have him taking cities major urban centers in a matter of days if not hours tanks rolling into kyiv shortly after they rolled across the border only to have been stymied only to have been stymied by the fierce resistance that russian forces have continued to meet and to find that those plans for a quick territorial victory have been thwarted as russia s forces now have remained stalled for more than three weeks question you mentioned mariupol so these reports that people are actually being moved from there to russia do you have any evidence of that mr price we ve seen those question that supports these reports mr price we ve seen those reports we are in the process of investigating them we are in close consultation with our ukrainian partners with others who may be able to provide firsthand accounts of what is taking place on the ground of course these reports are deeply concerning and if true they would be amount to additional evidence of what would appear to be the mistreatment of civilians question and in the first part i asked you to clarify what are you saying about your support for a negotiated settlement à la zelenskyy but on whose principles mr price so the point i was making i was trying to make at least is that this is a war that is in many ways bigger than russia it s bigger than ukraine however however important and however monumental the stakes are in this in president putin s war against ukraine the key point is that there are principles that are at stake here that have universal applicability everywhere whether in europe whether in the indo pacific anywhere in between and those are the core principles that president putin has sought to violate and flout and that our ukrainian partners backed by the international community have sought to defend the principle that each and every country has a sovereign right to determine its own foreign policy has a sovereign right to determine for itself with whom it will choose to associate in terms of its alliances its partnerships and what orientation it wishes to direct its gaze in this case ukraine has chosen a democratic path a path a western looking path and that is something that clearly president putin was not willing to countenance question but does that does that mean that if under pressure of negotiation and war that zelenskyy gives up the previous desire to join nato if he even gives up control of his military that the u s wouldn t go along with an agreement a negotiated agreement mr price we are we are there to support our ukrainian partners and this gets back precisely to those principles it is a sovereign right the sovereign responsibility of every country to determine for itself its foreign policy with whom it chooses to associate and to make decisions regarding its path forward we are there to support president zelenskyy we re there to support the ukrainian government we re there to support the ukrainian people but more than that what we are doing even while we see at the moment very little indication that the russian federation is serious about genuine diplomacy what we are doing is moving across multiple fronts to strengthen ukraine s hand at the negotiating table and we ve done that in a number of different ways as you ve heard in recent days including last week when we went into some detail we have provided an unprecedented amount of security assistance to our ukrainian partners 2 billion since the course of this administration 800 million was announced last week within the last week there s been a billion dollars total providing our ukrainian partners with precisely the systems and the capabilities and the assets that they will need and have been able to use to defend themselves effectively against this russian aggression so that s on the one hand on the other hand we are imposing costs just as we said we would on the russian federation for this egregious violation of sovereignty of ukraine s territorial integrity and you see those costs being borne by the russian economy its financial system also its strategic standing in the world it was just today that a very limited sector of the russian stock market reopened it had been closed for these three weeks now presumably in an effort to forestall capital flight you look at the value of the ruble you look at interest rates you look at the number of international companies that have decided to flee the russian marketplace not wanting to in any way be a part of president putin s war of choice against his neighbor and quite literally making clear where they stand with their feet leaving the russian marketplace behind paul peter question president biden just reiterated his warning about the danger of russian cyber attacks do you have anything to add from the state department on the nature of that threat where the intelligence for that threat comes from and has the state department or any other part of the administration issued a warning to russia against committing cyber attacks of that nature and was there a threat of consequences mr price so i understand that my colleague at the white house anne neuberger is speaking to this at the moment so i m going to largely defer to the white house to speak to it but to the second element of your question as you know we have had a number of opportunities to express in no uncertain terms to russia the our concerns regarding its use and its behavior in cyberspace this was a principal topic of discussion during president biden s meeting with president putin in june in geneva there was a lot of attention of course at the time paid to the issue of ransomware but we have made it very clear to the russians that there would be a high price to pay if they were to use their capabilities to target critical infrastructure to target sectors of strategic importance but it s not something we d want to speak to from here yeah question just related to that other than the meeting with ambassador sullivan has there been any other high level contact between the administration and the russian government mr price well last week the white house read out jake sullivan s phone conversation with his counterpart mr patrushev we do maintain channels of communication including at the tactical level and the department of defense has spoken to a channel of tactical de confliction we of course have our embassy in moscow ambassador sullivan as i just mentioned had an opportunity to convey our own message to the ministry of foreign affairs today so if we want to convey a message to russia we have multiple avenues to do so alex question thanks ned on the talks you just said that there s very little indication that the russians are taking them seriously so does that mean that you don t think any progress has been made is there any sign of progress that you have seen and if so in which of those key areas mr price well alex i will in the first instance leave it to our ukrainian partners to speak to progress or lack thereof and i think you have we have all heard statements from senior ukrainian officials including president zelenskyy that continue to cast doubt on russia s intent in taking part in discussions which have taken place at a number of different levels but heretofore have not resulted in any concrete sign of de escalation has not resulted in any diminution of the violence has not created any clear pathway out of this conflict just yet at least of course we continue to support dialogue and diplomacy between ukraine and russia ukraine with the support of the united states ukraine with the support of our partners and allies but more than sentiment and reactions coming out of the talks what we are going to continue to look for is any indication that these talks are bearing fruit in some of the most important metrics that is the diminution of violence that is a withdrawal of forces that is anything that would indicate that the russians have any genuine interest in seeing a way out of this conflict and that s not anything we ve seen yet question are they briefing you on their talks after each round mr price so as you know the secretary has spoken to his counterpart foreign minister kuleba multiple times in the past week we have been regularly apprised of the of developments from these discussions from our ukrainian partners there are several close allies and partners of ours who are supporting talks and dialogue in different ways our french allies our german allies our turkish allies our israeli partners we have also had an opportunity to hear from them directly in recent days regarding the progress or lack thereof in these various channels question can i one final question sorry do you have any confirmation that any of these top level security officials have been arrested in russia there has been a report of at least the one fsb intelligence officer in charge of ukraine mr price i m not in a position to confirm those reports what i can say though is what has been clear to everyone with access to uncensored information that is to say just about everyone outside of russia s borders we have seen signs of dissent within russian society that have been high profile and quite visible it is clear to my earlier point that president putin has made a series of miscalculations i already said before that he severely miscalculated if he thought that his forces could roll into ukraine and could take the country by force including its major cities and urban population centers within a matter of hours and not face resistance president putin miscalculated if he thought that he wouldn t face the serious economic and financial repercussions that president biden and the international community promised he would face pledged that he would face if this invasion went forward and he miscalculated if he thought that he could mount this type of large scale invasion have his forces bear the costs in terms of blood in terms of treasure and not face popular discontent back at home it s been very clear that this is not a war that the russian people are uniformly behind the russian government the kremlin has done everything it can to try to control information to control the information environment to an even greater degree than the kremlin previously did but even despite this crackdown on channels of information on protesters with the arrests of more than 15 000 peaceful demonstrators there are clear there are still very clear indications that president putin s war of choice does not have the full support of the russian people and we see that dissent even knowing that the russian people do not know the full cost of this war the russian people aren t being allowed to see that their sons brothers fathers are coming home in body bags if the russian government is bothering to bring them home at all they aren t seeing the true financial costs of this war they aren t seeing the true toll of the international community s sanctions and other economic measures of this war and surely they aren t seeing the strategic implications for russia that the country will grapple with for quite a long time to come as a result of president putin s aggression yes question ned news reports say that the u s may provide ukraine with soviet air defense systems it secretly acquired are these reports accurate and did the state department ask turkey to provide ukraine with their s 400 systems mr price so clearly i m not going to speak to news reports you ve just referenced what i will say is that question why not mr price we are working to provide our ukrainian partners with precisely the types of systems including the surface to air systems that they need to take on the threat from russia that they are enduring when it comes to systems like the s 300 we are working to get this done to help ukraine acquire long range anti aircraft systems and the munitions for those systems we are continuing to work with our partners and our allies as we ve done well before this war began to surge new assistance including soviet or post soviet russian made anti aircraft systems and the necessary ammunition to employ them these are the systems our ukrainian partners are already trained on the systems that they have used to good effect already secretary blinken has approved 14 of our partners to provide u s origin equipment to ukraine more than 30 countries around the world have provided their own forms of security assistance we are working together with the department of defense and others to do an inventory to source and ultimately to provide the equipment whether it s u s made or it is some other of some other origin to our ukrainian partners so that they can have what they need question what about turkey could you mr price when it comes to turkey we thank turkey for its commitment to ukraine s sovereignty to its territorial integrity as well as for turkey s efforts to assist in ukraine s time of need we know that our turkish allies as i mentioned before have been deeply engaged in these diplomatic efforts as well we will defer to the government of turkey to speak to the specifics of any assistance that it is providing to ukraine but every nato ally has stepped up in important ways whether that is security assistance humanitarian assistance financial assistance or economic assistance to ukraine for our part as i said before we re continuing to surge security assistance to our ukrainian partners we are helping to acquire those longer range anti aircraft systems that president zelenskyy has requested yes question thank you i have a quick question on russia and china from this podium you have said the u s china relation is not binary so when it comes to china russia relation i wonder do you view it as binary black and white because from your previous remarks it sounds like if china doesn t agree with the united states a hundred percent then china is on the wrong side mr price no look every country is going to have a unique relationship with russia and with the prc for that matter the point we ve made is that whether it s the prc or any other country around the world we aren t forcing our partners to choose between us and them what we are doing in this case is putting a spotlight on the fact that whether regardless of your partners and allies what the russian federation has done is attempt to tear asunder the principles that have been at the center of unprecedented levels of stability of security and prosperity born over the course of two world wars and a cold war and what russia is doing is violating in a blatant and unmistakable way the same principles that countries like the prc have long claimed to hold dear the principle of state sovereignty this is a refrain that we have consistently heard from the prc the importance the emphasis importance of emphasis on sovereignty of all states it is certainly a principle that we have sought to protect around the world but our point has been that when these principles come under threat countries around the world have an opportunity to demonstrate whether what they have said over the course of years or longer actually means anything whether there was actually anything behind their pronouncements and so countries around the world will have to determine for themselves where they want to be when the history books are written whether they want to be on the side of these very principles or whether they want to be on the side of naked aggression of violence of destruction and we are asking countries to speak very clearly and to show the world once and for all where they stand question the chinese ambassador to the united states qin gang yesterday told cbs that china and russia has a trusted relationship it s not a liability but asset to solve the current crisis because he said condemnation may not solve the problem but diplomacy might do you agree mr price well what we have said is that we welcome countries around the world to use the leverage that they have with russia to bring this conflict to a close it is undeniable that the people s republic of china has significant leverage with russia perhaps more so than just about any other country around the world so it stands to reason that the prc could do more than most countries around the world to bring an end to this violence this bloodshed this destruction and this war but we have not seen that yet we have heard from the prc various statements including the fact that what is happening is complicated there is nothing that is complicated about a war a needless war of aggression against a neighbor that posed absolutely no threat there is nothing complicated about a massive military campaign against a civilian population that entails missiles and bombs and artillery raining down on population centers on cities on towns maternity wards hospitals residential buildings neighborhoods there is nothing complicated about that so it is the responsibility of every country around the world to make very clear where they stand now what gives us concern is the fact that as you alluded to the partnership between the prc and russia has grown closer in recent years it is a partnership that is predicated on a vision of the world that in many ways is at odds with the free and open vision that the united states and our allies and partners around the world have sought to create and protect also the very system that has enabled much of china s economic growth in recent decades their vision as opposed to ours that is free and open their vision is one that is increasingly repressive at home and one that is increasingly aggressive beyond its borders if the prc wants to show the world that it is that it means what it says that it stands behind the principles that it has claimed to stand behind for years and decades now is an opportunity for them to do so question but last week during the phone call between the two presidents china did explain what they did like humanitarian aids and also urge for peace talk what more do you want to see from china mr price well the white house had an opportunity to speak to this on friday we will let the prc speak to their impressions of that call for us it was an opportunity for the two presidents as part of our emphasis on maintaining those open channels of communication to speak directly in a way that was substantive in a way that was detailed and was candid and president biden had an opportunity to offer a pretty detailed review of how things have developed in president putin s war against ukraine his assessment of the situation today and president biden for our part underscored that the united states continues support for a diplomatic resolution to this crisis now part of the conversation was based on the concerns we have that countries around the world including and perhaps most notably the prc may seek to provide a lifeline to russia to provide economic support financial support to help it attempt to skirt the sanctions that have been imposed on it the other economic measures that have been placed on it or to provide weaponry for the battlefield effort weapons or materiel for the battlefield effort that very clearly has not gone according to plan and for which president putin seems desperate to seek to change course and so it was an opportunity for president biden to lay out very clearly those concerns the implications of china s decisions all the while knowing that china will the people s republic of china will make its own decisions it was the task of president biden it s been the task of others in this administration to make very clear the implications of those decisions for the prc question but china said the inaudible assistance is disinformation you don t believe that mr price we are watching very closely we re watching very question lastly i m sorry this weekend you tweeted your tweet actually commemorate the 50 years anniversary of u s qatar relationship i know matt had asked it a couple of times 50 years anniversary is a big day so why u s qatar relationship deserve a shoutout from this building while u s china relationship doesn t which is considered as the most important bilateral relationship in 21st century mr price there is no doubt that the bilateral relationship between the united states and the people s republic of china is the most consequential bilateral relationship not only that we have but probably the most consequential bilateral relationship on the face of the earth that is why it is incumbent on us as responsible stewards of this relationship to do all we can to manage the competition responsibly in a way that sees to it that competition doesn t veer into conflict and we do that through a number of ways our public messaging is part of it to the fact that president biden and president xi spoke for nearly two hours on friday it is a testament to the fact that there are various channels to communicate between our governments and we ll continue to use those channels nick question thank you on iran the wall street journal is reporting that delisting the irgc as a foreign terrorist organization is the last hurdle to rejoining their rejoining the nuclear deal is that true and then a follow up on that on friday the white house and as you have said before the irgc s behavior in the region and beyond has gotten more aggressive in recent years do you expect that to change with the return to mutual compliance mr price so broadly speaking you ve heard us say this before but we are not in the practice of negotiating in public we re not going to respond to specific claims about what sanctions we may or may not be prepared to lift as part of a potential mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa i made the point last week that there are really two core issues and always have been in the course of this negotiation on the one hand you have the nuclear steps that iran would be obligated to take if it were to resume full compliance with the jcpoa those are the steps that it would need to reimplement that would see to it that iran is permanently and verifiably barred from obtaining a nuclear weapon on the other hand you have the sanctions relief that we would be prepared to undertake if we are able to achieve a mutual return to compliance what i ll say is that we are prepared to make difficult decisions to return iran s nuclear program to its jcpoa limits the fact is that while the jcpoa was in full effect while iran was in full compliance with it iran s breakout time that is to say the time it would need to acquire the fissile material necessary for a nuclear weapon if it made the decision to weaponize was significantly longer than it is today when the jcpoa went into effect it was a full year you ve heard from my colleagues that that breakout time is now measured in terms that are far less than a year we want to see to it that that breakout time is elongated and just as importantly that iran is verifiably and permanently barred from ever obtaining a nuclear weapon now when it comes to the status of the talks there has been significant progress in recent weeks but i want to be clear that an agreement is neither imminent nor is it certain and in fact we are preparing equally for scenarios with and without a mutual return to full implementation of the jcpoa president biden has made a commitment that iran under his watch will not be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon and that commitment is as true and sturdy in a world in which we have a jcpoa and one in which we don t question do you have an update on the a return to vienna mr price i don t what i can say is that rob malley and his team are here typically in the past we ve noted that iranian negotiators tend to take a break during the holiday of nowruz but i don t have any update to offer question another one on iran the iranian american uk citizen morad tahbaz i wonder if you could give us an understanding an update on your understanding of his current location because seems he s been returned to prison and it seems that he may be on hunger strike so do you have anything on that and if it s the case that he s back in prison do you have a response to what seems to be iran breaking that promise to furlough him mr price what i ll say simon is that iran as we understand it made a commitment to the uk to furlough dual u s uk citizen morad tahbaz this is someone who needs medical attention we are not as you heard us say last week a party to this arrangement but we join the uk in considering anything short of morad s immediate furlough a violation of iran s commitment we are urgently consulting with the uk on appropriate responses at the same time we continue to work night and day on what is an absolute priority for us and that is to secure the release of our wrongfully detained citizens including dual national morad tahbaz simply put iran is unjustly detaining innocent americans and others and should release them immediately securing their release is in utmost priority for us we call on iran to make urgent progress towards the release of wrongfully detained u s citizens this is something that rob malley something that roger carstens they have been regularly working on as you heard me say last week they spoke to the families of our wrongful detainees and we continue to pass along the status of our negotiations to bring their loved ones and our citizens home question one more on syrian president assad s visit to uae i wonder the department has said it s profoundly disappointed in the emiratis for inviting assad have you communicated that to the uae and to what extent do you think this invitation that they ve extended to assad is a reflection of strained relationships between you guys and the emiratis mr price we as you heard us say on friday we are profoundly disappointed we re troubled by this apparent attempt to legitimize bashar al assad he this is an individual who remains responsible and accountable for the death and suffering of countless of his fellow countrymen he is responsible for the displacement of more than half of the pre war syrian population and for the arbitrary detention and disappearance of over 150 000 syrian men syrian women and syrian children you ve heard this from the secretary you ve heard this from others in this administration but we do not support efforts to rehabilitate assad we do not support others normalizing relations with assad we have been very clear about that to your question we ve had a number of conversations with our emirati counterparts in recent days and we urge states considering engagement with the assad regime to weigh carefully the horrific atrocities this regime has visited on their own people over the last decade and just recently we celebrated another grim milestone countries should also consider the regime s continuing efforts to deny much of the country access to humanitarian aid and security we ve made clear that for our part we will not lift or waive sanctions and we do not support reconstruction of syria until and unless there is irreversible progress towards a political solution which we have not seen and in fact we will continue to use our sanctions authorities consistent with the law to hold accountable those syrians including members of the regime who have perpetrated these atrocities on their own people question just to be clear though there was a conversation with the uae after assad s visit mr price we have regular conversations with our emirati partners and i can confirm that there have been conversations in recent days question ned it may be true that assad remains responsible for what has happened in syria but you said that he remains accountable and in fact that s the problem because he isn t been held he hasn t been held accountable so that s so it s the accountability problem that i think even you are getting at right and when you say that you oppose normalization but that of any country with syria right now how do you explain the fact that you guys have at least eased sanctions or allowed syria to import energy so that it can get to lebanon mr price matt we can do two things at once we can continue to hold the assad regime accountable for the atrocities it has perpetrated against its own people for the forced displacement of much of its or a large part of its population and still account for the humanitarian needs of people in places like lebanon and those people including those inside syria who themselves have been the victims of assad s atrocities question right except that you just went through this whole thing about saying you won t you won t support reconstruction in syria which is for civilians whose homes and lives have been destroyed because of this you say you won t support that but you re willing to allow the syrians to import energy to pass on to lebanon for lebanese civilians mr price matt question so how are you mr price there question so aren t you punishing syrian excuse me aren t you punishing syrian civilians for the quote unquote crimes of their leader mr price we are punishing members of the regime by using the authorities that are available to us and many of our partners around the world have done the same to economically isolate the regime to the extent we can to impose economic pressures and economic costs just as we can continue to devise ways to account for the humanitarian needs of people in the region that don t directly benefit the regime there is nothing that we have done that directly benefits the regime what we have done is sought to account for the significant humanitarian needs and again many of these humanitarian needs result from the very actions of the assad regime many of those who are suffering have themselves been the victim of this very regime yes question thank you can i switch gears mr price sure question okay on the question sorry this question turkey mr price one final question on this question yeah are you considering any sanctions on uae based on caesar act and how do you feel that your allies in the region are taking steps against u s interests mr price look of course we don t preview sanctions our emirati partners they are a partner of ours and they will continue to be and are an important partner of the united states we share a number of interests including the security interests our shared interest in bringing to a close this conflict in yemen we have a shared interest in terms of regional stability in terms of pushing back on iran in terms of helping our emirati partners defend themselves against the attacks that have emanated from yemen from the houthis and of course we are committed to all of that question and one more on this do you have any comment on that trilateral summit that s being held in sharm el sheikh between israel egypt and uae officials mr price i don t have a specific response but if we do we ll pass it along yes question on the sanctions you sanctioned turkey turkey is a partner and you sanctioned them in the past because they bought s 400 mr price there s a law on the book question what s the mr price caatsa that imposes sanctions on those countries that trigger that authority in this case the possession of the s 400 system yes question ned on the palestinian israeli issue 50 house democrats sent a letter to secretary blinken asking him to urge or to demand whatever israel to refrain from evicting about 3 or 400 palestinians from the village of walaja are you aware of the letter and is there a response from the secretary of state mr price i have seen i was made aware of this letter only recently said you know our longstanding position when it comes to these issues it s the same position that we ve reiterated encouraging all parties to refrain from acts that move us farther away from a negotiated two state solution question but this is a specific village a specific act in the village of walaja will the secretary of state urge the israelis not to do it i mean it s imminent so we re about to see the displacement of maybe some 400 palestinians mr price said again we believe it s critical for israel and the palestinian authority to refrain from unilateral steps that exacerbate tension and that undercut efforts to negotiate a two state solution that certainly includes settlement expansion question but does mr price and evictions as we talked about question so are you saying that the israelis should not evict the people of walaja mr price said i don t have a response to offer you today to this particular letter question one more quick question on the settlement ambassador nides spoke with i guess the israeli peace now movement and so on and he said something about the settlements he said he called it stupid and he called it all kind of things and he also said that i am unable to undo a single settlement is the united states powerless to actually reverse the process of settlement not even one settlement mr price said i reviewed the ambassador s comments i don t think he actually said that what the ambassador question that settlements are not stupid i mean he called them that inaudible mr price you you editorialized a bit what i think the message that the ambassador conveyed was the very message that i conveyed here we ve continued to be clear including with our israeli partners including with our partners in the palestinian authority regarding the criticality of avoiding these steps that could inflame tensions or could move us away from a two state solution yes question i want to go back to ukraine one question on do you support zelenskyy sitting down with vladimir putin mr price with question with putin mr price with we support any diplomatic initiative that president zelenskyy determines for his government for his country that is in the their that is in their interest question i sorry a question on saudi arabia said it will not incur any responsibility regarding any shortage of oil supplies as its oil facilities are attacked by the houthis how do you comment on that this statement was today mr price so you ve heard us say before that we have held discussions with saudi arabia on a collaborative approach to managing potential market pressures this administration the president and the secretary is committed to doing everything we can to work with other countries to bring down the cost for the american people our guiding principle has been to maximize the cost for president putin and to minimize the cost for the american people and for our allies and partners but you did raise the recent attacks against the kingdom of saudi arabia you may have seen that secretary blinken just as jake sullivan did yesterday issued a statement strongly condemning these houthi attacks on saudi arabia as you noted as we ve heard from our saudi partners the attacks reportedly targeted water treatment facilities as well as oil and natural gas infrastructure it was a clear attempt it seems to disrupt global energy markets we know that saudi arabia faces significant threats from yemen and elsewhere in the region we remain committed to helping our saudi partners improve their capabilities to defend their country against these attacks there were roughly 400 cross border attacks last year launched by the houthis with iranian support there have been fatal attacks this year these attacks have also affected infrastructure schools mosques workplaces and endangered the civilian population including tens of thousands of u s citizens whose safety is a top national security for us so that s why helping to advance a durable resolution to the conflict in yemen also is a priority for us it improves the lives of yemenis and it creates a space for yemenis to collectively determine their own future and to put an end to this conflict that has only led and has only fueled additional attacks from these houthi terrorists question ned two things real quickly just one all that litany of stuff that you just ran through that you just said the houthis are doing are those not the are those not actions consistent with the actions of a foreign terrorist organization mr price matt you and i have had this conversation before including from up here question well i mr price and i ve given you the question well i mean you just mr price i ve given you the answer question went through the whole thing and you said that they are a clear attempt to disrupt the world energy markets which that s something that that s something that a terrorist organization would do mr price these matt these are terrorist attacks we have labeled them as such question well i know okay so why not label the group that s doing them as a foreign terrorist organization mr price so as you ve heard me say before there are any number of groups as we ve discussed that are that don t carry this specific designation that whose attacks and operations are no less reprehensible i think you could have said something very similar about the taliban including during the height of question well i don t remember the taliban trying to disrupt the world energy world energy markets did they mr price it is it is also incumbent question inaudible mr price it is also incumbent upon us and obviously the differences in geography between afghanistan and yemen and the uae probably make this a conversation that is uninteresting to anyone but the question mostly most people yes you re right mr price yes yes question so can i go back to your very opening statement on burma i just want to know recognizing that these kinds of designations or determinations are complex and they involve a lot of rigorous legal scrutiny and analysis still why did it take so long to it seems like this was it came this determination could have been made several years ago and that the reason that it was done now was a political decision rather than a decision based on the facts of what has happened there on the ground mr price well matt this determination is based on a rigorous review of comprehensive evidence the law and all relevant policy considerations so the secretary in his remarks this morning offered a good bit of texture regarding the inputs that went into this there was a previous study there are outside expert evaluations that have that were part of this determination the holocaust memorial museum itself has been a world leader in documenting the atrocities and the genocide that occurred in rakhine state question yeah but those aren t new mr price it is not it is not new but it is question those but those are all of those determinations from human rights groups like amnesty and human rights watch which the leaders of which the secretary spoke to i believe last week those date back years when it relates to rakhine and what s been happening mr price and this administration has been in office for just over a year question no i get that but mr price it is incumbent on each administration or at least this secretary take seriously the responsibility that he has as secretary of state to determine on behalf of the united states government when and if genocide has occurred so that is not a process that he takes lightly in fact he wanted to ensure there was rigorous analysis not only of the law not only of the evidence not only of the policy considerations but also of course taking into account that there was a coup in burma just a little over a year ago february 1st of last year in everything we do and we ve already talked about this in other contexts we want to ensure that the choices we make the policy choices we make don t have humanitarian a bearing on the humanitarian situation of people around the world question so do you think that would it had this determination been made six months or eight months or a year ago it would have had a bearing on the humanitarian situation mr price it was a process that took some time we wanted to carefully weigh all of the inputs not only the law not only the facts not only the evidence but also the policy considerations question thank you question ned can i ask a question on iraq mr price sure question okay this past weekend marked the 19th anniversary of the invasion and occupation of iraq and general mckenzie gave an interview to military times in which he says that our presence will continue to be there for years to come could you update us on the status of american presence in iraq mr price we are there and any american forces are there at the invitation of the iraqi government the department of defense has spoken to the end of the combat mission in iraq we continue to share vital interests with our iraqi partners including to see to it that groups like isis groups that pose a threat to the united states to iraq to countries in the region continue to face pressure from the global coalition to defeat isis but as the department of defense has said everything we do is in cooperation with and at the invitation of the government of iraq question is the american military presence in iraq only to support america s military presence in northern syria and aiding the kurds mr price i would leave it to my colleagues at the department of defense to speak to the specifics thank you all very much question thank you the briefing was concluded at 3 35 p m

erasing the eelam victory part 16 e pt 2 kamalika pieris in 2007 janes intelligence review issued a report on the ltte saying that the ltte had created one of the most sophisticate insurgencies in the world largely due to a complex global network of financial resources and weapons it has a financial and procurement structure well organized and strategically positioned around the globe and a profit margin that would be the envy of any multinational corporation some usd 200 to 300 million a year critics observed that the tamil separatist movement could not have generated such a complex venture on its own al jazeera said in 2008 ltte s financial infrastructure is among the most complex and most secret of any terrorist group it has investments in stocks and money markets real estate restaurants and a large number of asian grocery stores throughout the world its shipping operations carry legitimate goods and also engage in the smuggling of drugs arms gold and has been charged with human trafficking to uk and parts of europe as well the ltte is known to own and operate business enterprises in europe canada and south east asia said shanaka jayasekera some businesses were legal others were not legal business ventures include real estate supermarkets and petrol filling stations thamilini restaurant in zurich makkal kadai supermarket in paris ashley cash carry in harrow and thamilini cash carry in southall are considered to be ltte businesses funds also came in from ltte fronts which included charitable organizations it is well known that the main source of ltte funds come from illegal means such as human trafficking credit card scams illegal passports forged currency and robbery said analysts these are criminal activities thompson observed that this criminal network was for eelam there was no indication that ltte was in business for itself the speed with which tamil organized crime network became established internationally in the 1980s and early 1990s was remarkable said thompson this indicates once again that the tamil separatist movement was assisted by the west said critics organized criminal activity in any western country requires a degree of cooperation with various other criminal societies criminal enterprises have always worked closely together ltte criminal enterprises have cooperated with bikers chinese triads russian and italian mafias and a variety of other groups said thompson the ability of the ltte international network to evade detection and maintain flow of funds reflects the sophistication and robust nature of the operation commented shanaka jayasekera ltte had developed its own intelligence to get tipped off when a crackdown was planned by the authorities the ltte used legitimate channels for donations from ngos and ingos non formal channels were used for other transactions funds were stored in secret bank accounts in netherlands and uk which were controlled by the castro network said shanaka jayasekera in 2009 the ltte has developed the most sophisticated infrastructure for fundraising and money transfer operations in comparison to any other terrorist group said shanaka in 2007the intent of the ltte is to progress towards activities that can generate a stable income according to shanaka the main conduit for money transfer was the sana group it had a principal controller and 08 trust managers located in europe north america and south east asia no funds are held by the controller funds were held by the trust managers the controller maintained records received from each trust manager on the current availability of financial resources and the state of its assets the funds allocated for procurement were sent to designated trust managers and held in safe locations these transfers were done in several ways bank transfers human couriers and over invoicing import export transactions the trust managers place the funds in multiple forms of investment to avoid detection by regulatory authorities when the ltte procurement needed money the controller tells one of the managers to transfer money the money was transferred to multiple locations in non detectable blocks the persons dealing with procurement gather it all together most often in a south east asian country the best example of this process is the evidence emerging out of the fbi sting operation in guam said shanaka the ltte sent a three man team to guam island on 26 september 2006 after inspecting a consignment of weapons presented by undercover fbi agents the team made an advance payment in malaysia and transferred us 452 000 to a baltimore bank account the ltte also had another informal system ltte developed a robust informal remittance system referred to as the undi system hawala said shanaka the tamil diaspora used this to transfer money to relatives in sri lanka living in areas without banks the undi system is controlled by a small cartel of tamil jewellery shop owners in switzerland and canada they use the money to facilitate the falsely declared import of gold jewellery into europe from the gold market in singapore jewellery shops owners in switzerland provide a combined pool of funds to the ltte for the purchase of gold jewellery from singapore the ltte finance unit in switzerland facilitates the money transfer using human couriers from switzerland to singapore these couriers also carry money to ltte holding accounts in south east asia the couriers return to switzerland with receipts that have significantly overvalued the gold jewelry purchased in singapore in some cases craftsmanship value addition has been five times the value of the gold component but the ltte sometimes got caught in their criminal activities cambodian government sought the assistance of interpol to track the head of ltte procurement operation in cambodia renni lerin on charges of human smuggling tamil rehabilitation organization was globally known as a ltte organization unicef had given it around us 800 000 before it stopped following adverse reports german technical cooperation gtz also had an agreement with tro which ended in 2006 after they received adverse reports about the organization in switzerland the office of the attorney general launched a vast sting operation in several swiss cantons thirteen financiers accused of funneling more than 15 million swiss francs 15 3 million to ltte were arrested in switzerland in 2018 the accused were from switzerland germany and sri lanka they included the founder of world tamil coordinating committee wtcc his deputy and the person in charge of finances ltte had it is suspected collected the money by means of threats and by creating a regime of fear to induce them to make the payments around 80 of tamils living in switzerland had made payments the swiss funds were transported in cash by couriers to singapore and dubai further between 1999 and 2009 the wtcc presumably had created a complex fundraising structure which involved coaxing tamil diaspora to obtain loans from banks wtcc had also created fictitious companies in the name of borrowers and issued fake certificates continued

correction this post was updated march 23 to note that capone runs a nonprofit seeking to support other veterans today is monday welcome to equilibrium a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability subscribe here people in search of treatments for certain ailments are putting increasing pressure on populations of the sonoran desert toad a southwestern species whose venom is harvested for its psychedelic properties the new york times reported i saw why they call this the god molecule after i got a full central nervous system reset said former navy seal marcus capone who found relief from his intense depression and anxiety through the active ingredient in the venom 5 meo dmt that pushed capone who now runs a nonprofit that supports other vets seeking such treatments into an ethical quandary whether to turn to the toad itself for relief or the array of easy to manufacture synthetic alternatives while synthetics are effective in reducing stress according to a study from the national institutes of health many devotees refuse to use them adding to the pressures on the wild toads there s a perception of abundance but when you begin to remove large numbers of a species their numbers are going to collapse like a house of cards at some point robert villa of the tucson herpetological society told the times today we ll look at a new set of climate disclosure rules for publicly traded firms then we ll turn to a report from the united nations revealing that 500 million people on the african continent remain water insecure for equilibrium we are saul elbein and sharon udasin please send tips or comments to saul at selbein thehill com or sharon at sudasin thehill com let s get to it sec releases long awaited climate disclosure rules the securities and exchange commission sec on monday released a new set of climate disclosure rules that would require public companies to disclose both the risks they incur from warming and their own contributions to climate change what they re saying with climate change we have ample well documented warning of potentially vast and complex impacts on financial markets sec commissioner allison herren lee d told reporters what s in the rules publicly traded companies will have to disclose climate related risks they foresee and how those impact long term forecasts and business plans if a company has made climate related claims like net zero by 2040 it has to specify how it plans to meet that target it must also detail the scope of activities and emissions included in the target the defined time horizon by which the target is intended to be achieved and any interim targets sec fact sheet in a move to counter the practice of overblown sustainability claims known as greenwashing companies that make these ambitious claims would have to back them up with concrete evidence what emissions are counted after months of speculation over how far up or down the supply chain companies would have to go in calculating greenhouse emissions the sec determined that companies would have to reveal their own direct emissions indirect or purchased emissions e g those that come from buying power from a fossil fuel plan the environmental protection agency epa calls these scope 1 and scope 2 emissions respectively firms will have to also disclose scope 3 emissions those from the entire supply chain if deemed material which is likely to be an area of fierce contention the classic example of scope 3 emissions is the emissions generated when an oil company s customers use its product for example when exxon set a net zero by 2050 goal in january it didn t count these emissions a looming battle the sec s proposed rules which require a 60 day comment period are expected to draw a fierce partisan clash conservatives and progressives disagree over the extent to which publicly traded firms should have to disclose climate based risks including how their own actions might contribute to broader climate change through emissions the expected clash follows a similar battle over climate hawk sarah bloom raskin s nomination for the federal reserve s top regulatory post which was pulled last week the lone no vote hester peirce the sec s sole republican commissioner said it was certainly understandable to attempt to bring clarity in an area where there has been a lot of confusion and greenwashing however in explaining why she was voting against the rules monday peirce stated the reason mistakenly assumes that quantification can generate clarity even when the required data are in large part highly unreliable peirce warned that the rules would be the cornerstone of a new ecosystem of climate accounting firms that would neither generate greater profits for companies nor help reduce carbon emissions what s next for the next 60 days members of the public cities corporations and foreign countries will get to submit comments on the sec rules at which point the agency will pass a final rule 500m people in africa remain water insecure un some 500 million people across 19 african nations remain water insecure according to the first ever united nations assessment of water security across the world s second largest continent the assessment released monday scored countries on a scale from 0 to 100 apart from egypt all countries in africa were given water security scores below 70 while only 13 of the 54 nations reached even a modest level of security in recent years nineteen african nations had water security levels below the u n s threshold of 45 with somalia chad and niger faring the worst according to the report twenty nine african nations have made some progress on water security over the past three to five years while 25 have made no progress the authors found not a single country let alone a subregion have at present achieved a state that can be seen as model or even effective stage of water security lead author grace oluwasanya said in a statement while the authors acknowledged that the assessment is limited due to the very poor data availability on issues like drinking water and sanitation they said it provides some preliminary but obvious conclusions what is water security the u n defines water security as a population s capacity to ensure access to enough water deemed suitable for sustaining livelihoods human well being and socio economic development water security also means communities should have protection against water borne pollution and water related disasters as well as the capacity to preserve ecosystems amid a climate of peace and political stability are any countries faring well the countries identified as doing the best thus far were egypt botswana gabon mauritius and tunisia but even these nations only achieved modest absolute levels of water security the authors warned quantifying water security to draw their conclusions on water security in africa the authors of the u n study relied on 10 indicators including access to drinking water sanitation and hygiene access to drinking water egypt ranked best with a score of 99 out of 100 while the central african republican drew a score of 37 seychelles scored the best on access to sanitation at 100 percent while chad and ethiopia were most challenged with under 20 percent access each access to hygiene was greatest in the north african region while chad and the central african republic had the most diarrhea related deaths the study found per capita water availability was greatest in central africa while half of north african countries were deemed absolutely water scarce researchers also raised issues with water infrastructure and treatment governance over water resources and dependency on neighbors for water average water storage capacity rose by only 3 percent across the continent over the past five years more data needed oluwasanya the lead author stressed that data availability or the lack of it in itself may be an excellent indicator of water security action needs to be taken immediately by national governments with support from international agents to radically improve data

by jamie freed and eric m johnson reuters the deadly crash of a china eastern airlines nyse 737 800 could set back boeing nyse s efforts to regain ground in the world s biggest aircraft market and deliver more than 140 737 max jets already constructed for chinese customers the 737 800 that crashed on monday does not have the equipment that led to 737 max crashes more than three years ago but that may not make a difference to chinese passengers and a national regulator known for scrupulous safety requirements china eastern said the cause of the crash was under investigation such accidents typically involve multiple factors and experts warned it was far too early to draw any conclusions on the potential causes especially in light of the scarce information available china was the first country to ground the 737 max after fatal crashes in indonesia and ethiopia more than three years ago and it is the only major market where the max has not resumed commercial flights a 737 max built for china eastern subsidiary shanghai airlines took off from seattle bound for boeing s completion plant in zhoushan last week industry sources said in a sign the model s return to service in china was close the plane landed in guam on march 15 as part of a multi leg journey and has not moved in the week since according to flight tracking website flightradar24 the jet remains in guam due to a minor technical issue according to a boeing spokesperson who declined to provide further details our team identified the issue and is working through the logistics to address it appropriately and resume the ferry flight when ready the spokesperson added robert spingarn a managing director at melius research who focuses on the aerospace sector said the max s return in china could be delayed until authorities there had some answers on the cause of the china eastern crash china s aviation regulator is known for being very thorough on safety issues chinese airlines do not need new max planes because demand is down following the country s biggest covid 19 outbreaks in two years industry sources said but the u s manufacturer has more than 140 max jets already built for chinese customers waiting to be delivered once the jet returns to commercial service there a person familiar with the matter said boeing s shares closed 3 6 lower on monday boeing declined to comment on whether the crash could delay a business recovery in china while china s aviation regulator did not respond immediately to a request for comment the 737 800 that crashed is an earlier model with a strong safety record and there are nearly 1 200 in service in china making it the world s largest market for the plane according to aviation consulting firm iba more than 4 200 737 800s are in service globally data from aviation firm cirium shows china eastern and two of its subsidiaries on monday grounded its fleet of 737 800 planes the group has 225 of the aircraft data from british aviation consultancy iba shows other chinese carriers are continuing to fly the jets according to data from chinese aviation data provider flight master jefferies analysts said china s aviation regulator was unlikely to ground the 737 800 fleet unless it specifically suspected a technical failure as the root cause because of the operational consequences of grounding more than 1 000 planes in the world s second biggest domestic aviation market however there are concerns the chinese public could look to avoid flying on 737 800s until the cause of the crash is determined given the broader reputational issues with the 737 family caused by the max cowen analyst cai von rumohr said in a note hence isolating the cause of the crash will be critical he added noting the leading causes of commercial air transport crashes tend to be maintenance issues pilot error or sabotage rather than manufacturing or design issues boeing cancelled a meeting of its senior executives scheduled for this week in miami to focus its attention on assisting the investigation and china eastern a second person familiar with the matter told reuters we have been in close communication with our customer and regulatory authorities since the accident and have offered the full support of our technical experts to the investigation boeing ceo dave calhoun said in a memo to employees which was seen by reuters

photo credit engel ac shutterstock as the global economy continues to expand the need for energy to sustain that growth is increasing as well people and businesses depend on energy for every aspect of life from heating and cooling homes and workplaces to fueling transportation to powering appliances and other conveniences of modern life as demand increases energy producers must find ways to keep up either by increasing production or by producing more energy from existing inputs energy efficiency creates a number of benefits for the economy overall consumers and businesses that rely on energy benefit from lower prices because it is easier to meet demand with lower levels of energy production utilities and other energy producers can save on the cost of energy production and transmission infrastructure with more efficient generation and more efficient energy use also has environmental advantages efficient energy production releases lower levels of greenhouse gas and other pollutants along with requiring less water use with greater needs and these benefits in mind businesses and governments have developed more tools to promote energy efficiency in recent decades utilities have developed more efficient technologies for generating energy and moved away from less efficient fuel sources many states and localities have adopted policies like energy efficiency resource standards or more stringent building codes to ensure continued improvements in energy efficiency programs like the leed leadership in energy and environmental design certification for buildings and the government s energy star certification for consumer appliances have helped raise standards of energy efficiency for many aspects of everyday life but one of the biggest factors improving energy efficiency is a shift in the nature of the u s economy historically the u s generated a far greater share of its economic output from energy intensive industries like manufacturing over time more of the economy has shifted toward services and technology which require far less energy input and the energy intensity of the economy has declined over time according to the u s energy information administration the amount of energy consumption relative to gdp has decreased by 58 since 1950 the result of these collective shifts has contributed to improved efficiency across the u s economy from 1980 into the mid 2000s the growth in energy consumption mostly tracked population growth as the u s added more people it also consumed more energy since then however energy consumption has begun to decline while population and gdp have continued to grow the u s also has room to continue improving in the efficiency of its energy production thanks to an increasingly diverse and more efficient mix of energy sources fossil fuels including natural gas 34 quadrillion btu crude oil 23 6 and coal 10 7 constitute a sizable majority of u s energy production however energy production from fossil fuels has moved away from highly inefficient coal and toward more efficient natural gas in recent years and other alternatives including renewables like wind have become a much more significant portion of the u s mix in the meantime some states are further along than others in advancing energy efficiency goals several factors explain why many of the leading states have stronger policies and standards regulating energy efficiency in utilities buildings or products like vehicles and appliances others have sped their transitions away from more inefficient fossil fuels toward efficient renewable sources with new investments and regulations and some benefit from other economic and demographic factors like the aforementioned shift toward less energy intensive industries or densely populated urban areas which promote energy efficiency in buildings and transportation together these factors have put states like new york massachusetts and california toward the top of the list of most energy efficient locations to determine the states with the most energy efficient economies researchers at commodity com analyzed the latest data from the u s energy information administration and the bureau

climate change and loss of biodiversity are the terrible twins working together to threaten human existence unfortunately their wicked problems are accompanied by two equally important drivers of calamity population and economic growth these four horsemen gallop in unison and must be considered together climate change after several decades characterized by misinformation and then prevarication on the veracity of climate change governments are now acceding to the warnings from climate scientists and their learning experience from rapidly increasing extreme weather events however their actions remain insufficient to ensure future world temperatures allow civilization to exist indeed we need to arrest greenhouse emissions within the next two decades the positives are that the science is secure we can measure our success and failure by measuring atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane and we have the option of spending hundreds of billions of dollars to suck these gases out of the atmosphere if all else fails however much climate change mitigation is based on technological fixes some of which are problematic and many indeed create their own environmental harms biodiversity and its ecological services climate change and biodiversity crises impact each other climate change is a significant cause of biodiversity loss but even if climate change was contained today the biodiversity crisis would still proceed although more slowly for its fundamental cause is the consumption of the natural environment for economic gain by a population too large for the world s finite natural resources the 2019 warning of a climate emergency signed by over 11 000 scientists identified continued increases in human population and the world s gross domestic product as causes of ecological decline the science to explain how the loss of biodiversity and their ecological services will end civilization is poorly understood it is diffuse complex and we have no one measure to assess demise or success there are no dramatic examples such as storm flood fire and heat domes by which we experience the consequences healthy ecosystems interdependent webs of millions of living organisms and the physical environment they create are vital to all life on earth they are our life support systems that provide clean air freshwater fertile soil for food as well as many other resources and medicines we are part of this web of life but now plunder it beyond repair as recognized by scientists from australia and the u s the scale of the threats to all these forms of life including humanity is in fact so great that it is difficult to grasp even by well informed scientists awareness by public government and industry is weak which explains the universal presence of ineffective environmental protection and laws some outcomes will relate to failure of agriculture with hunger starvation and conflict in the dust bowl disaster in the early 1930s prolonged drought led to the loss of 1 2 billion tons of soil across the great plains and there were thousands of refugees as depicted in john steinbeck s 1939 novel the grapes of wrath with an average rainfall of less than 500 mm stock grazing had been replaced by wheat production and soil stability conferred by native grasses was lost as with climate change the deniers will say such episodes have always occurred and dismiss the increasing prevalence of similar disasters which are now occurring around the world there are a few hopeful developments that indicate increasing awareness by governments long overdue collaboration will now occur between the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes and the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc natural capital accounting is underway in 90 countries under the un seea system but both the u s and australia have not yet made progress as detailed in the hill an international taskforce on nature related financial disclosures tnfd launched last month will develop a framework for corporations and financial institutions to report on nature related physical and transition risks population growth philip cafaro professor of philosophy of the school of global environmental sustainability at colorado state university notes many studies show that limiting population growth is among the cheapest most effective means to limit and help societies adapt to climate change yet population growth is taboo in the current debate one of the main reasons lies with human rights concerns this needs to be balanced by the right for humanity s continued existence and indeed many other species some of which we depend upon cafaro also notes that the ipcc s 2014 report states that globally economic and population growth continue to be the most important drivers of increases in co2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion this was reiterated by one of the working groups from the 2021 ipcc report yet it was absent from the 3 676 page final report as detailed in the hill american couples are having fewer children than in the past but specific population policy is largely absent and population increases intermittently by immigration by contrast australia is encouraging population growth when introducing the baby bonus scheme in 2002 australian treasurer peter costello promoted the scheme with the encouragement to have one for mum one for dad and one for the country this philosophy still exists in our huge country despite our rapidly deteriorating environment with increasing impacts of climate change nevertheless rational views based on science are being advanced in australia for example the discussion paper population and climate change the consumer economy the fourth most terrifying horseman is the obsession with economic growth which fails to acknowledge that our planet and its biological resources are finite the leaders and representatives of nations at the un climate summit cop26 together with a huge contingent from the fossil fuel industries were set in their ideology of growth progress and prosperity they cannot conceive of economic reform toward an economy to curb consumerism and consequently it was not addressed in the 2021 ipcc report humanity urgently needs and integrated intergovernmental panel report the ipcbpe report unfortunately a fifth horseman of the apocalypse has now arrived from the russian steppes but we must not allow war to distract us from our urgent mission to stop the advance of four david shearman am ph d fracp frcpe is a professor of medicine at the

chairman gary gensler a democrat along with democratic commissioners allison lee and caroline crenshaw voted in favor of the rule while sec commissioner hester peirce the agency s sole republican voted against it the regulations are open for public comment for 60 days before the sec can finalize and enforce them which could take several weeks or months what does it mean under the proposed rules publicly traded companies will be required to explain in their regular disclosures to investors how certain climate related risks can affect their finances potential risks include the rising frequency of severe weather the potential costs of shifting away from fossil fuels and a company s own efforts to limit its carbon footprint companies will be required to calculate these potential costs from data they already compile for regular disclosures to investors companies will also be required to disclose their scope 1 emissions the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they directly produce through their own business operations such as manufacturing or mining along with their scope 2 emissions which come from the energy they purchase to keep their business running and what else companies would also be required to report their scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions which include emissions from the goods and services purchased by the firm if they have set public emissions reduction targets or if those emissions pose a direct financial risk to the business firms required to report scope 3 emissions however will not face penalties if they come forward with mistakes or miscalculations in those figures the sec has faced growing pressure from both washington and wall street to set clear climate disclosure standards democratic lawmakers and environmentalist groups have pushed financial regulators for years to pay closer attention to the risks climate change poses to the financial system some investment firms have also asked the sec to set clear guidelines for disclosing climate risks amid rapidly growing investor interest in how businesses handle environmental social and governance esg issues we have a responsibility to stay firmly focused on facts and

efforts by the biden administration to convince riyadh the middle eastern country s capital to step up its oil production which could provide some relief to consumers amid high prices exacerbated by the russian war in ukraine the u s government has been increasingly critical of the saudis since the 2018 killing of washington post journalist jamal khashoggi who was lured to and killed in the saudi consulate in istanbul what s the issue saudi arabia s human rights record and tensions over yemen s civil war which have led to bipartisan criticism from congress have added to the strife it puts the

malinowski d n j who was a top human rights official during the obama administration told reporters this week i hate that the biden administration has to figure out how to leverage our relationship with saudi arabia to get them to do that so that my constituents aren t being squeezed at the pump he added saudi arabia s control over strategic oil reserves may force the biden administration which

sleepwalking to climate catastrophe united nations secretary general antonio guterres on monday warned that time is running out to meet the international goal of keeping climate change below 1 5 degrees celsius saying that the world is sleepwalking to climate catastrophe speaking at the economist sustainability summit guterres said the goal is on life support and in intensive care due to a combination of issues such as the covid 19 pandemic the russian invasion of ukraine and a general lack of political will the world returned from with a certain naive optimism about achieving the goal guterres told attendees at the economist sustainability summit keeping 1 5 alive requires a 45 percent reduction in global emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by mid century that problem was not solved in glasgow according to present national commitments global emissions are set to increase by almost 14 percent in the 2020s he added last year alone global energy related co2 emissions grew by 6 percent to their highest levels in history coal emissions have surged to record highs we are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe guterres added that the energy crisis created by russia s invasion of ukraine and subsequent sanctions against russian energy illustrated the risks of the status quo as current events make all too clear our continued reliance on fossil fuels puts the global economy and energy security at the mercy of geopolitical shocks and crises guterres said he told attendees that there remained hope to move the 1 5 degree goal from life support to the recovery room if certain steps are taken such as increased use of renewables and decarbonization of major industrial sectors read more about his remarks here young fixture of natural resources panel dead at 88 rep don young r

to get a marijuana reform bill to president biden s desk before the november midterms fearing that a republican takeover of congress could doom its chances in an in person lobbying blitz last week more than 20 chief executives of top cannabis companies urged lawmakers in both parties to pass the safe banking act a bill to allow them to work with u s banks that the industry is confident will win enough gop support to pass the senate we re trying to be practical about how we get something passed this year curaleaf ceo joe bayern said in an interview we think the industry needs something to happen this year the industry needs to convince senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y who has blocked the bill from being included in larger packages over fears that its passage would limit future comprehensive reforms cannabis executives suggested that the banking bill could be coupled with criminal justice and social equity reforms but reiterated that safe banking needs to get done regardless we want comprehensive reform but we also recognize that with the potential for the house and senate to change hands we have an opportunity now to pass impactful legislation and if we fail

to make daylight saving time permanent has longtime backers the senate s swift passage of a proposal to make daylight saving time permanent caught members and the public off guard this week and led to plenty of cheering on social media about ending the spring ahead and fall back changes to the clock it also dovetailed with a decades long effort by some business groups who want to maximize the hours per day that american consumers spend buying things the effort to push permanent daylight saving time has been particularly advocated by golf groups who see it as a way to keep people on the greens for more of the year the bill has broad support from members of the national golf course owners association and the world golf foundation among other groups however the bill has drawn opposition from the american academy of sleep medicine and other medical groups that say permanent daylight saving time may overlook potential health risks that would be avoided under permanent standard time instead

a defense official earlier said use of the missile couldn t be verified the pentagon has been providing daily updates on the russian invasion of ukraine and ukraine s efforts to resist here are highlights of what a senior u s defense official told reporters monday on day 26 ukrainian soldiers and rescue officers search for bodies in the debris at the military school hit by russian rockets the day before in mykolaiv southern ukraine march 19 2022 bulent kilic afp via getty images russia uses hypersonic missile against ukraine biden president joe biden confirmed monday night that russia has used a hypersonic missile in ukraine saying it s the only thing that they can get through with absolute certainty it doesn t make that much difference except it s almost impossible to stop it there s a reason they re using it biden said at the business roundtable s ceo quarterly meeting in washington d c earlier on monday a senior u s defense official could not confirm russia s claims to have used hypersonic missiles in ukraine but said it s not clear why it would it s a bit of a head scratcher to be honest with you because it s not exactly clear why if it s true would you need a hypersonic missile fired from not that far away to hit a building the official said one of the major advantages of hypersonic weapons is the ability to evade radar detection from distant targets but for hitting nearby ukraine the advantages are less obvious one reason russia might have used such a weapon could be due to running low on precision guided munitions or to send a message to the west and ukraine in order to gain leverage in negotiations the defense official said adding that it is not practical from a purely military perspective people examine the damage after shelling of a shopping center in kyiv ukraine march 21 2022 efrem lukatsky ap no russian progress on the ground russian forces are no closer to kyiv than they were more than a week ago the official said they haven t achieved anything in terms of what we assessed to be their objectives which was population centers so that they could occupy and take over ukraine the official said the official added that you can count on one hand the cities russian forces have taken noting that donetsk and luhansk were already under their control before the invasion so what have they gained in now 26 days they got melitopol they got berdyansk and they got kherson that s it they don t have kharkiv they don t have mariupol the official said ukrainian forces even mounted a counter attack to try to retake kherson according to the official it s very clear that the ukrainians are showing no signs of stopping the resistance and no signs of slowing down their attacks on the russians the official said the official said most credit for the stalled russian efforts goes to the ukrainian forces and citizens and the leadership of president volodymyr zelenskyy president zelenskyy has been quite inspirational as you ve all seen and has really motivated his forces and his citizens because some average citizens are picking up arms and fighting the official said but weapons and training from the u s and others are also playing a major role it s not just about pointing and shooting the official said they re able to be nimble and creative because they were so well trained over the last eight years despite setbacks russian forces have most of their forces intact and are trying to overcome they are looking for a chance to gain some momentum not even regain momentum because they never really had it and that s what s so frustrating for them the official said the frustrated russian ground effort is leading to more missile strikes and artillery bombardment on cities which makes things ever more dangerous for civilians according to the official this is not a military known for precision the official said of the invaders pentagon press secretary john kirby told reporters monday the pentagon believes russia is in some cases deliberately targeting civilians we certainly see clear evidence that russian forces are committing war crimes kirby said and we are helping with the collecting of evidence of that but there s investigative processes that are going to go on and we re gonna let that happen we re going to contribute to that investigative process an unexploded russian rocket is seen in the ground after shelling on the northern outskirts of kharkiv march 21 2022 sergey bobok afp via getty images failure to launch the u s assesses russia has fired more than 1 100 missiles against ukraine since the beginning of the invasion and there are indications it is having inventory issues with its precision guided munitions which could be one reason we re seeing greater use of unguided dumb bombs the official said the official added that russia still has the majority of its missile stocks available but the pentagon is also seeing problems with the reliability of russia s precision weapons some russian missiles are failing to launch or they re failing to hit the target or they re failing to explode on contact the official said more russian naval action near odessa while there is still no sign of an imminent amphibious assault the u s has seen more naval activity in the northern black sea where russia has more than a dozen surface warships of varying types clearly they re using surface combatants for shelling purposes and for the long range fires in and around odessa the official said whether this is a prelude to an amphibious assault is not clear russian combat power russia s invading force has just below 90 of its combat power intact according to the official we recognize that they are taking casualties every day they are losing aircraft they are losing armor and vehicles there s no doubt about that tanks apcs artillery units helicopters fixed wing jets the official said as for ukraine the pentagon assesses it still has more than 90 of its combat power intact the official credits this to the constant arms replenishment coming in from the u s and others also keep in mind that while this estimated percentage is slightly higher for ukraine than russia russia has more total power to lose so far the u s hasn t seen any movement of additional russian troops to ukraine service members of pro russian troops are seen atop of a tank during ukraine russia conflict on the outskirts of the besieged southern port city of mariupol ukraine march 20 2022 alexander ermochenko reuters russia lacks small unit leadership the official could not confirm ukrainian claims to have killed six russian generals but said it makes sense that there would be senior officers on the ground with the invading force first this is a major operation for the russian military second they don t organize their military the way we do they don t have an equivalent to a noncommissioned officer corps and their junior officers don t have the same wherewithal flexibility they don t invest in their junior officers the kind of initiative that we do the official said while the u s military instills a sense of battlefield leadership starting at the junior nco ranks corporals and sergeants on up the russian military has no such ethos according to the official the fact that there might be senior leaders on the field perhaps involved at a more tactical level than we would have a two star or a one star it s apples to oranges in terms of how they organize themselves and how they lead the official said adding that russian forces seem to be having command and control problems 800 million weapons package from us shipping soon initial shipments of the new 800 million u s weapons package to ukraine will arrive very very soon the official said this package includes thousands of shoulder

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the fed is under pressure from widespread criticism that it has reacted too slowly to a price spike that has catapulted inflation to four decade highs washington chair jerome powell said monday that the federal reserve would raise its benchmark short term interest rate faster than expected and high enough to restrain growth and hiring if it decides this would be necessary to slow rampaging inflation powell s message was more hawkish than his comments were after last week s fed meeting when officials raised their key rate a quarter point from near zero to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 hawks typically support higher rates to stave off inflation while doves generally prefer lower rates to bolster hiring his remarks in a speech to the national association for business economics caused a sharp drop in the stock market with its implication that potentially much higher rates could be on the way for mortgages auto loans credit cards and other consumer and business borrowing u s stocks later recovered with the s p 500 index ending the day down less that 0 1 powell said that if necessary the central bank would be open to raising rates by a comparatively aggressive half point at multiple fed meetings the fed hasn t raised its benchmark rate by a half point since may 2000 he added too that the policymakers could go so far as to send rates into restrictive territory that would slow economic growth and possibly raise the unemployment rate if needed to tame high inflation we will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability the fed chair said in his speech to the nabe s annual economic policy conference in particular if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than a quarter point at a meeting or meetings we will do so the fed is under pressure from widespread criticism that it has reacted too slowly to a price spike that has catapulted inflation to four decade highs when they met last week fed officials forecast that they would raise rates six more times this year and four times in 2023 they also projected that inflation would slow to 2 7 by the end of next year powell cautioned monday that those projections of future interest rates and inflation can become outdated quickly at times like these when events are developing rapidly according to an nabe survey of its member economists 77 think the fed s interest rate policy remains too low nearly the same proportion said they believed inflation would remain above 3 next year suggesting that the fed s inflation expectations are too optimistic nabe members mostly work for large businesses consulting firms and trade associations last week the fed s policymakers projected that the economy would remain resilient enough to keep growing and that the unemployment rate would fall from its current level of 3 8 to 3 5 by year s end matching a 50 year low reached before the pandemic some economists argue that such a painless outcome what they refer to as a soft landing is unrealistic given the challenges the economy faces including the potential for deeper economic disruptions resulting from russia s invasion of ukraine the war has already raised the cost of oil wheat nickel and other vital commodities but powell asserted that the fed has achieved such soft landings before i believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism he said soft or at least soft ish landings have been relatively common in u s monetary history still the fed chair added that no one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context very little is straightforward in the current context he acknowledged that higher oil and commodity prices serve as a reminder of the oil price spikes of the 1970s which fed soaring inflation in that decade it wasn t until the early 1980s after chairman paul volcker had sent the fed s rate to nearly 20 that inflation was tamed not a happy experience powell acknowledged but he argued that the u s economy was less sensitive to oil prices now in part because it is more fuel efficient powell pointed to a near record high level of open jobs which topped 11 million in january that is equivalent to 1 7 available positions for every unemployed person he suggested that higher rates from the fed could slow consumer spending enough to reduce that outsize demand for workers which would in turn reduce wage growth to a level that wouldn t boost inflation this is a labor market that is out of balance powell said which he acknowledged was good for workers because it has meant higher pay for many but those wage gains can also lead companies to raise prices to offset their higher labor costs we need the labor market to be sustainably tight he said powell s remarks followed a flurry of comments from officials concerning fed policy since last week s meeting all pointing in a hawkish direction also on monday raphael bostic president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta said that controlling inflation is the top concern that i have for 2022 bostic also said he expects the fed to raise rates a total of six times this year and twice more in 2023 that is a more dovish approach than most of his colleagues but he emphasized that this was mostly because of the extreme uncertainty currently surrounding the economy if more rate hikes were necessary to slow inflation he would support them he said on friday christopher waller a member of the fed s influential board sounded a hawkish note in an interview on cnbc he said he could support half point rate hikes at each of the next two meetings of fed policymakers waller argued that while the economic data was basically screaming at us to raise rates by a half point at last week s meeting the economic uncertainty created by russia s invasion of ukraine led him to support a smaller increase out of caution neel kashkari president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis who is among the most dovish policymakers wrote that he fears that consumers buoyed by hiring and wage gains may keep spending at an accelerated pace even as businesses struggle to meet that demand this pattern he suggested would keep inflation high

their continued support for ukraine including by providing security assistance and humanitarian aid the white house said the talks which reportedly lasted for an hour came as biden prepared to head to

russia s defense ministry on monday said the country s kinzhal dagger hypersonic missile has proven its efficiency in destroying heavily fortified special facilities the ministry said the weapon had been used twice over the weekend and promised more such strikes in the future it s a bit of a head scratcher to be honest with you because it s not exactly clear why if it s true why would you need a hypersonic missile fired from not that far away to hit a building a senior us official told reporters adding it could be that they re trying to send a message to the west but also to ukraine and trying to gain leverage at the negotiating table other speculation is that moscow may be turning to higher end inventory because of what the us says are constraints on russia s supplies of precision guided munitions they re failing to launch or they re failing to hit the targets or they re failing to explode on contact said the official the pentagon official called moscow s decision to turn to long range missile strikes a reflection of what some people believe is a desperate attempt by them to gain some momentum to try to turn the course of the war and that s why it s getting so much more dangerous for civilians because the more you use long range fires the more you re going to hit civilian targets ukraine accuses russia of seizing grain shipments ukrainian prosecutors on monday announced they have opened an investigation into allegations of the forceful russian seizure of five ships carrying ukrainian grain at the southeastern port of berdiansk on the sea of azov ukraine the world s fifth largest producer of grain also faces billions of dollars in lost revenue for wheat and corn slated for export as russia continues to block its ports moreover authorities are concerned

i think that investors were heartened by what fed chair powell said yesterday that they re really not going to remain behind the curve sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra said on bloomberg s quicktake stock stream what you re seeing with the selloff in bonds is that investors are looking to go elsewhere they certainly don t want to be in an asset classes like a seesaw if the yield goes up their price will be going down so they re gravitating toward that area that most likely has better upside potential and that s equities right now
federal reserve board chair jerome powell speaks during a luncheon at the 2022 nabe economic policy conference at the ritz carlton in washington march 21 the federal reserve raised interest rates a quarter of a percentage point last week for the first time since 2018 in an attempt to combat rising inflation afp yonhap federal reserve chair jerome powell delivered his most muscular message to date monday local time on his battle with too high inflation saying the central bank must move expeditiously to raise rates and possibly more aggressively to keep an upward price spiral from getting entrenched in remarks that sent financial markets scrambling to recalibrate for a higher probability of the fed lifting interest rates by a half percentage point at one or more of its remaining meetings this year powell signaled an urgency to the central bank s inflation challenge that was less visible than just a week ago when the fed delivered its first rate hike in three years the labor market is very strong and inflation is much too high powell told a national association for business economics conference there is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability in particular he added if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than 25 basis points at a meeting or meetings we will do so aig s global head of strategy constance hunter called it powell s the buck stops here speech u s stocks fell and traders already betting on at least a quarter point interest rate increase at each of the year s remaining six fed meetings moved to price in a better than even chance of half point interest rate increases at each of the fed s next two meetings in may and june that would lift the short term policy rate pinned for two years near zero to a range of 2 25 percent to 2 5 percent by the end of the year higher than the 1 9 percent that fed policymakers just last week anticipated most fed policymakers see the neutral level as somewhere between 2 25 percent and 2 5 percent powell repeated monday that the fed s reductions to its massive balance sheet could start by may a process that could further tighten financial conditions this is not just going to be a near term tactical phenomenon said kevin flanagan head of fixed income strategy at wisdomtree investments in new york this is a more strategic type of messaging i think from the fed a consensus for more aggressive tightening or at least an openness to it appears to be growing atlanta fed president raphael bostic who expects a slightly gentler path of rate increases than most of his colleagues said earlier on monday he is open to bigger than usual rate hikes if that s what the data suggests is appropriate speaking on friday fed governor chris waller said he would favor a series of half percentage point rate increases to have a quicker impact on inflation the price of gas is displayed at gas station in panama city march 20 afp yonhap the u s unemployment rate currently is at 3 8 percent and per person job vacancies are at a record high a combination that s pushing up wages faster than is sustainable there s excess demand powell said adding that in principle less accommodative monetary policy could reduce pressure in the labor market and help stabilize inflation without pushing up unemployment generating a soft landing rather than a recession inflation by the fed s preferred gauge is three times the central bank s 2 percent goal pushed upward by snarled supply chains that have taken longer to fix than most had expected and that could get worse as china responds to new covid 19 surges with fresh lockdowns adding to the pressure on prices russia s war in ukraine is pushing up the cost of oil threatening to move inflation even higher the united states now the world s biggest oil producer is better able to withstand an oil shock now than in the 1970s powell noted although the fed in normal times would not likely tighten monetary policy to address what in the end may be a temporary spike in commodity prices powell said the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer term expectations uncomfortably higher last year the fed repeatedly forecast that supply chain pressures would ease and then was repeatedly disappointed as we set policy we will be looking to actual progress on these issues and not assuming significant near term supply side relief powell said monday policymakers began this year expecting inflation would peak this quarter and cool in the second half of the year that story has already fallen apart powell said to the extent it continues to fall apart my colleagues and i may well reach the conclusion we ll need to move more quickly and if so we ll do so fed policymakers hope to rein in inflation without stomping on growth or sending unemployment back up and their forecasts released last week suggest they see a path for that with the median view for inflation falling to 2 3 percent by 2024 but unemployment still at 3 6 percent powell said he expects inflation to fall to near 2 percent over the next three years and that while a soft landing may not be straightforward there is plenty of historical precedent the economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy he said adding that he doesn t expect a recession this year it is a difficult trick to finesse analysts said powell was reasonably forthcoming that there s uncertainty said seth carpenter chief global economist at morgan stanley if you keep going until you see the outcome that you desire chances are you ve gone too far reuters

russia has been under sanctions for more than three weeks after their botched invasion of ukraine videos have emerged of desperate russians scrambling for packets of sugar as commodities that feel like basics for many have become the latest battleground for a government intent on war in russia sanctions are beginning to bite the supermarket next to valentina s kiosk is restricting the purchase of certain items to prevent panic buying valentinaskiosk series 2 episode 6 bbcnews bbcworld bbcworldservice bbcradio4 pic twitter com hrs8rjifyf steve rosenberg bbcstever march 20 2022 the sanctions are there to force the russian government to back own or at least come to the negotiating table there has reportedly been good progress in talks between russia and ukraine in the last week but large differences still remain between the two parties in the meantime sanctions will continue to bite and bombs will continue to drop sanctions work both ways so while the russian populace is fighting over an ever decreasing supply of goods the nations that have imposed the sanctions have their own problems increases in the price of oil gas and electricity are stinging the wallets of those in the west but these unintended consequences are the tip of the iceberg of the effects that are rippling around the world related stories what are some of the sanctions russia are under so far sanctions against russia include freezing central bank assets as well as the disconnection of russian banking from vital components like visa and mastercard this has left people unable to withdraw money and the run on the banks from the first week of the has led to spiralling inflation with people unable to withdraw foreign currency however there has yet to be a full ban on russian oil and gas largely due to european reliance on such fuels to power their countries the european union bloc relies on importing 40 percent of its natural gas from russia immediately cutting this off would send already sky high prices to incredible and intolerable levels the unprecedented sanctions and export controls the u s and over 30 countries have imposed on russia are taking their toll today the ruble is worth less than a penny the russian stock market is closed for the longest time ever russia s credit rating is now junk status the white house whitehouse march 11 2022 what this means in real terms is a driving up of prices across russia according to moscow today an independent russian newspaper inflation has increased over four percent in just four weeks for comparison the central bank of russia aims to keep inflation under four percent each year that target has already and will continue to be broken there is no guarantee the sanctions will have the desired effect in recent examples of iran and cuba economies do adjust to sanctions over time how will this affect the us the fallout from the russian sanctions is being most felt in the price of energy the us has banned the import of russian crude oil removing 7 percent of their imports last year in one swipe if crude oil and therefore gasoline has a high price then everything is affected all routes of trade and supply are at some point impacted by the price of crude the price of fuel is still rising despite the cost of oil dropping in the last week so it might not be the sanctions as the sole reason behind high prices before the invasion the us was seeing year on year inflation of over 7 percent the highest in 40 years the sanctions have exacerbated this but didn t cause it but while the cost of goods is increasing in the us this consequence pales in comparison to the effect on ukrainians under bombardment or for those countries which desperately rely upon ukrainian and russian exports to just survive there are around fifty countries that import more than thirty percent of their wheat from the two nations egypt for example imports 80 percent of its wheat the very real prospect of not receiving such a wealth of food will force many to hunger if not starvation global food chains demand global solidarity in times of crisis said lama fakih executive middle east and north africa director at human rights watch without concerted action to address the supply and affordability of food the conflict in ukraine risks deepening the world s food crisis particularly in the middle east and north africa

menafn globenewswire nasdaq san diego march 21 2022 globe newswire travere therapeutics inc nasdaq tvtx today announced that it has submitted a new drug application nda to the u s food and drug administration fda under subpart h for accelerated approval of sparsentan for the treatment of iga nephropathy igan there is a clear need for novel treatment options that can reduce proteinuria and slow the devastating progression towards end stage kidney disease for people living with iga nephropathy said eric dube ph d president and chief executive officer of travere therapeutics the submission of this nda marks an important milestone on our path to potentially making sparsentan if approved a new treatment standard for the rare kidney disease community and we look forward to working with the fda during the upcoming review process the nda submission is supported by positive interim results from the ongoing pivotal phase 3 protect study a global randomized active controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in a total of 404 patients with igan as well as data from additional clinical trials and pre clinical testing of sparsentan the company expects to receive notice regarding the acceptance of the nda as well as the timeline for nda review from the fda in may 2022 about iga nephropathy iga nephropathy igan also called berger s disease is a rare kidney disorder characterized by the buildup of immunoglobulin a iga a protein that helps the body fight infections in the kidneys the deposits of iga cause a breakdown of the normal filtering mechanisms in the kidney leading to blood in the urine hematuria and protein in the urine proteinuria other symptoms of igan may include kidney pain swelling edema and high blood pressure igan is the most common type of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and a leading cause of end stage kidney disease eskd igan is estimated to affect more than 100 000 people in the u s and is one of the leading causes of acute nephritis in europe and japan there are currently no approved non immunosuppressive treatments indicated for igan about the protect study the ongoing protect study is one of the largest interventional studies to date in igan it is a global randomized multicenter double blind parallel arm active controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of 400mg of sparsentan compared to 300mg of irbesartan in 404 patients ages 18 years and up with igan and persistent proteinuria despite available ace or arb therapy in august 2021 the company announced the protect study met its pre specified interim primary efficacy endpoint with statistical significance after 36 weeks of treatment patients receiving sparsentan achieved a mean reduction in proteinuria from baseline of 49 8 percent compared to a mean reduction in proteinuria from baseline of 15 1 percent for irbesartan treated patients p40 percent reduction in up c from baseline after 36 weeks of treatment 42 0 percent of patients receiving sparsentan achieved fpre compared to 26 0 percent of irbesartan treated patients p 0 0094 preliminary results from the interim analysis suggest that at the time of the interim assessment sparsentan had been generally well tolerated and shown a comparable safety profile to irbesartan in the phase 2 duet study of sparsentan in fsgs the combined treatment group met its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating a greater than two fold reduction in proteinuria compared to irbesartan and was generally well tolerated after the eight week double blind treatment period irbesartan is part of a class of drugs used to manage fsgs and igan in the absence of an approved pharmacologic treatment if approved for both indications sparsentan could potentially

judging from the poses being struck by governor lamont and state legislators of both parties connecticut might think that happy days are here again in what just happens to be a gubernatorial election year among other things the governor and legislators are plotting property tax relief increasing the earned income tax credit suspending gas and sales taxes and spending more on popular programs and yet as the connecticut mirror s keith phaneuf reported the other day state government is becoming more indebted than ever how come first it is because lamont s administration and that of his predecessor dannel p malloy repeatedly refinanced the state s debt stretching out its duration thereby reducing near term payments at the expense of long term payments so that the present generation may spend more and future generations will have to pay more for spending that benefited their ancestors second it is because state government recently was shamed into reducing from 8 to 7 its estimate of the average annual growth in its pension fund investments over coming decades both estimates are wishful thinking that presumes there will never be a serious decline in the stock market but even that small step toward realism greatly inflates the calculation of the state s pension liabilities which are largely unfunded and therefore debt so connecticut s total state government debt now estimated at 95 billion is 30 higher than it was six years ago that s not progress but regression and connecticut is now the most indebted state in the country on a per capita basis with each resident s share of the state debt estimated at 62 500 more debt than most residents have incurred for their personal purposes about a quarter of the state budget already goes for government employee pensions and debt repayment and thus is unavailable for the services state government is expected to provide of course this isn t entirely the fault of the people in office now it is more the negligence and opportunism of those who preceded them but the goodies being plotted by the people now in office to improve their election chances represent the same irresponsibility that their predecessors committed the irresponsibility that has made connecticut so expensive and unattractive to new residents and businesses so much political discussion in connecticut is pious posturing as with the frequent declarations that people shouldn t have to choose between medicine and food or between a job and taking care of a sick relative yes everything desirable should be free or at least someone else should pay for whatever you want but as has been noted by politicians who have painfully graduated to statesmanship to govern is to choose and indeed life itself is always a matter of choosing so last week at a hearing of the general assembly s planning and development committee alan cavagnaro 20 a member of the planning and zoning commission in south windsor made himself part of the tedium he was supporting legislation to force more housing into towns with exclusive zoning noting that the high cost of living in connecticut is driving the state s own young people away whereupon he was challenged by rep kim fiorello r greenwich a ferocious defender of exclusive zoning she demanded of him is housing a right are you entitled to the housing you want when the young man took the bait and affirmed that housing should be a right fiorello rebuked him nastily housing is not a right because housing is built by other people fiorello said you don t have a right to other people s labor true but not true enough for while housing is not a right it is a necessity and a responsible government must facilitate the production of necessities to increase the prosperity of its people after all the young man wasn t asking to live in fiorello s town where residential property typically costs 3 million essentially he was protesting the devastating explosion of housing prices in connecticut where exclusive zoning sharply restricts supply fiorello cynically evaded this bigger point she may not realize that property is respected and safe only where it is reasonably distributed if it s not fiorello s own constituents may have the most to lose
on a school night in late january stephana ferrell a 39 year old mother of two elementary school children in orange county fla logged onto a virtual meeting with more than 200 other parents around the country who like her have been alarmed to see books pulled off the shelves of their children s schools ferrell a family photographer who owns a business began dipping her toes in local activism for the first time in early 2021 when she lobbied her school district to continue covid 19 precautions as mask mandates were being lifted but her involvement ramped up later in the year that s when she began organizing parents all around florida to oppose calls to ban books that some conservatives have deemed too divisive or pornographic to be in schools and curricula ferrell hoped her experience organizing a campaign against book challenges might be instructive to others who similarly oppose what she views as a politically driven campaign at children s schools lawn boy is not on the shelf right now and then all boys aren t blue says that it s in stock and available ferrell told the online participants we had a high school student go in there and try to ask for it and they said sorry that book s not available right now for checkout so that s a shadow ban on all boys aren t blue the session was the inaugural training of a national campaign called book ban busters organized by a left leaning grassroots network called red wine blue with the tagline of channeling the power of suburban women the group was established in 2019 and has extended its reach across the country founded with the purpose of activating primarily left leaning moms around local and school issues it also emphasizes a social component to organizing prior to the pandemic local groups affiliated with the network organized get togethers at moms homes or restaurants during the past two years much of their activity has been online this past year many of these parents have watched their schools become battle turf over mask mandates vaccines and inclusive education locally conflicts over book bans are often framed simply as the next in that series of culture wars but to some political science experts and historians the book bans resemble censorship campaigns that could strike at the very heart of democracy the suburbs have traditionally been seen as conservative bastions but they re becoming more diverse i called the organization red wine blue because when these women would get together there would be wine and there would be some pretty good snacks says katie paris the group s founder paris a mom in suburban cleveland previously worked in washington d c for left leaning causes she established the group to build on the political engagement of suburban women who rejected former president trump s attempts to win over suburban housewives during the 2018 midterm elections she says the network now includes more than 300 000 parents the suburbs really been shifting and changing paris says they ve always traditionally in politics been seen as these sort of conservative bastions but the suburbs are becoming more diverse they re shifting ideologically tony dejak ap ap katie paris speaks to members of red wine and blue during a meeting monday sept 28 2020 in cleveland the book bans seemed to happen everywhere all at once for many parents at the local level the push to remove inclusive materials from schools looked from the beginning very different from the contentious debates over masks and vaccines it seemed to happen everywhere all at once it was clearly organized paris says so we knew pretty much off the bat that this is an orchestrated effort that impression is born out in the data more than 330 unique books were challenged from september through november last year according to the american library association s office for intellectual freedom that s twice as many as the entire year before paris says moms in the red wine blue network were among the first to see the effort take shape early last summer several began surfacing questions to ask if anyone had heard about something called critical race theory the term has been incorrectly applied by rightwing pundits seemingly to anything relating to race diversity and equity to some experts the campaign carried all the hallmarks of a different controversy that played out years earlier all of these organizations that appear to be grassroots parent organizations that are outraged about what their are learning they all have ties to exactly the same donors that have been behind the campus free speech crisis says isaac kamola associate professor of political science at trinity college in hartford connecticut it s the same network of people the same funders that are kind of manufacturing this false narrative and then using this dense network in order to demand that society and the public take it seriously he says parents in certain organizations may not know that their activism is around issues created to serve the interests of wealthy corporate elites kamola who co authored the book free speech and koch money says that many institutions and people connected to the crt debate have ties to the donors trust and donors capital fund those organizations have facilitated huge contributions from ultra wealthy libertarians toward rightwing think tanks such as the manhattan institute policy outfits like the goldwater institute media outlets and legal organizations to advance an extreme conservative agenda ralph wilson who co authored the book with kamola and co founded the corporate genome project has traced links between some of these entities and parents groups organizing to restrict instruction related to race in schools as an example he says that the group no left turn in education offers model legislation with sections that closely mirror wording in an academic transparency act proposed by the koch funded goldwater institute no left turn in education did not respond to questions from npr wilson says many parents in these organizations may not be aware that their activism is around an issue that was manufactured to serve the interests of wealthy corporate elites they view critical inquiry free inquiry that s done in the academy as a threat to their wealth they see it as a threat to the future of capitalism and free enterprise in this country wilson says the end political agenda that s being served doesn t actually help those parents that are involved in it it doesn t actually help those children it helps a larger political movement that s trying to capture the culture and ultimately capture the state history has shown that these type of gag rules rarely work in the long run book challenges have a long history in the u s with calls for censorship coming from the left as well as the right there also have been precedents for the kind of legislation that would restrict public speech about certain topics says eric berkowitz a human rights lawyer and author of dangerous ideas a brief history of censorship in the west in the 1830s all discussion of abolition was barred from the house of representatives berkowitz says it was for the purpose of restoring tranquility to the public mind so the notion of abolishing slavery was not only a political threat but it was also advanced and i suppose sold on the belief that divisiveness discomfort things along those lines are bad for the public mind and a more docile population is a much more easily governed one the nonprofit education news website chalkbeat has tallied 36 states as of early february that had adopted or were considering legislation to put limits around teaching about race or racism but berkowitz says history has shown that these type of gag rules rarely work in the long run these kinds of ham handed efforts to mold discourse through the banning of books or through the banning of movies or through the banning of entire subjects only causes greater interest in them he says political scientists nonetheless have been particularly troubled by how the recent spate of state legislation and policies to circumscribe discussion of race in schools has happened amid a tide of rising anti democratic populism around the globe the measures fall into a category called memory laws says harvard government lecturer george soroka book bans are part and parcel of a crisis of democracy memory laws in the sense of official prohibitions on how the past can be talked about are very much a modern phenomenon and until quite recently they were primarily a european phenomenon soroka says according to soroka who has helped build a database to track memory laws there has been a relatively recent proliferation of this type of legislation particularly in post communist european states countries such as russia poland ukraine and hungary have enacted measures to downplay the role some of their countrymen had in the holocaust and to foster a single heroic narrative about those countries experiences in world war ii soroka says there are parallels to the u s where so called anti crt legislation and censorship ultimately may serve to whitewash the realities and legacy of slavery pluralist ideas about the past multivocality of narratives are threatening when you are trying to foster a nation that is really exclusive in terms of its identity he says soroka says the rise of these measures in the u s and elsewhere signals a troubling political shift this is part and parcel of a crisis of democracy he says we see this with the rise of more xenophobic types of nationalism this idea that how the past is remembered can be weaponized and can be specified by governmental decrees back in florida stephana ferrell says she sees efforts to erase or minimize marginalized voices from the classroom as clear attempts to undermine the values of a pluralist democracy ferrell points to the recent passage of hb1557 which opponents have dubbed the don t say gay bill as an example the legislation would restrict discussion about sexuality and gender in the classroom they re leaving people out of the conversation completely she says we have whole swaths of communities completely excluded and teachers tiptoeing around what they can discuss about lgbtq people and black and indigenous people here in this country copyright 2022

you are here by xinhua writers li rui tian ye cairo march 22 xinhua policymakers in some non oil exporting middle east countries are racing to bring down surging food costs after their primary food supply chain was disrupted by the russia ukraine conflict which has exacerbated staple food inflation that had already been steadily rising even before the crisis policies including diversifying food imports increasing food subsidies and lowering food taxes have been pursued by these countries which rely heavily on wheat imports from russia and ukraine and have limited financial resources to respond to rising food costs some countries have also moved to shore up their food stocks and seek policy adjustments to cut their heavy reliance on food imports as food security is vital to maintaining social stability in the volatile middle east surging food prices over the past few weeks several middle east countries have seen cereal oil and meat prices climb especially countries highly dependent on imports from ukraine and russia which are still fighting and engaging in tough negotiations turkey now pays 346 u s dollars for importing a ton of wheat up from 297 dollars in 2021 after the country s supply chain was affected by the covid 19 outbreak and 230 dollars in 2020 according to statistics published by turkish media in egypt the world s largest wheat importer the market price of a ton of flour increased to 11 000 egyptian pounds nearly 700 dollars in march up from 9 000 pounds a month earlier said attia hammad head of the bakeries division at the cairo chamber of commerce in palestine the costs of flour vegetables chicken and sugar have risen significantly the russia ukraine conflict will have an impact on the global grain market because russia and ukraine account for about 30 percent of global grain exports said waleed gaballah a professor of financial and economic jurisdictions at cairo university the impact on the middle east food market is particularly noticeable in nations that rely largely on russia and ukraine for imports in istanbul turkey s largest city the price for a bottle of 5 liter cooking oil has increased by 35 percent in three days to 200 turkish liras nearly 14 dollars on march 7 with a 64 percent self sufficiency rate in sunflower oil turkey meets the rest of its cooking oil need by imports largely from russia and ukraine consumers in turkey have flocked to grocery stores and supermarkets to empty shelves due to the rising price of cooking oil and a fear of scarcity food shortage compounded in economically challenged countries like lebanon and yemen higher costs will make staple food less accessible to the most needy the ongoing russia ukraine conflict will further complicate lebanon s food supply chain as the country has already been suffering from a financial crisis and a severe shortage of foreign currency needed to import basic items and food products said ahmad hoteit a representative of lebanon s wheat importers lebanon may face wheat shortage in the future he warned in yemen rising food costs compounded by the conflict may exacerbate the country s humanitarian crisis according to the world food program wfp imports from ukraine have accounted for 31 percent of the wheat arriving in yemen in the past three months with prices seven times higher than in 2015 raising the cost of wfp operations in the country to 10 million dollars per month the wfp has been forced to cut rations in order to feed the people in the greatest need it said in a statement on march 14 the russia ukraine

the fed is under pressure from widespread criticism that it has reacted too slowly to a price spike that has catapulted inflation to four decade highs example video title will go here for this video

enough to restrain growth and hiring if it decides this would be necessary to slow rampaging inflation powell s message was more hawkish than his comments were after last week s fed meeting when officials raised their key rate a quarter point from near zero to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 hawks typically support higher rates to stave off inflation while doves generally prefer lower rates to bolster hiring his remarks in a speech to the national association for business economics caused a sharp drop in the stock market with its implication that potentially much higher rates could be on the way for mortgages auto loans credit cards and other consumer and business borrowing u s stocks later recovered with the s p 500 index ending the day down less that 0 1 powell said that if necessary the central bank would be open to raising rates by a comparatively aggressive half point at multiple fed meetings the fed hasn t raised its benchmark rate by a half point since may 2000 he added too that the policymakers could go so far as to send rates into restrictive territory that would slow economic growth and possibly raise the unemployment rate if needed to tame high inflation we will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability the fed chair said in his speech to the nabe s annual economic policy conference in particular if we conclude that it is appropriate to move more aggressively by raising the federal funds rate by more than a quarter point at a meeting or meetings we will do so the fed is under pressure from widespread criticism that it has reacted too slowly to a price spike that has catapulted inflation to four decade highs when they met last week fed officials forecast that they would raise rates six more times this year and four times in 2023 they also projected that inflation would slow to 2 7 by the end of next year powell cautioned monday that those projections of future interest rates and inflation can become outdated quickly at times like these when events are developing rapidly according to an nabe survey of its member economists 77 think the fed s interest rate policy remains too low nearly the same proportion said they believed inflation would remain above 3 next year suggesting that the fed s inflation expectations are too optimistic nabe members mostly work for large businesses consulting firms and trade associations last week the fed s policymakers projected that the economy would remain resilient enough to keep growing and that the unemployment rate would fall from its current level of 3 8 to 3 5 by year s end matching a 50 year low reached before the pandemic some economists argue that such a painless outcome what they refer to as a soft landing is unrealistic given the challenges the economy faces including the potential for deeper economic disruptions resulting from russia s invasion of ukraine the war has already raised the cost of oil wheat nickel and other vital commodities but powell asserted that the fed has achieved such soft landings before i believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism he said soft or at least soft ish landings have been relatively common in u s monetary history still the fed chair added that no one expects that bringing about a soft landing will be straightforward in the current context very little is straightforward in the current context he acknowledged that higher oil and commodity prices serve as a reminder of the oil price spikes of the 1970s which fed soaring inflation in that decade it wasn t until the early 1980s after chairman paul volcker had sent the fed s rate to nearly 20 that inflation was tamed not a happy experience powell acknowledged but he argued that the u s economy was less sensitive to oil prices now in part because it is more fuel efficient powell pointed to a near record high level of open jobs which topped 11 million in january that is equivalent to 1 7 available positions for every unemployed person he suggested that higher rates from the fed could slow consumer spending enough to reduce that outsize demand for workers which would in turn reduce wage growth to a level that wouldn t boost inflation this is a labor market that is out of balance powell said which he acknowledged was good for workers because it has meant higher pay for many but those wage gains can also lead companies to raise prices to offset their higher labor costs we need the labor market to be sustainably tight he said powell s remarks followed a flurry of comments from officials concerning fed policy since last week s meeting all pointing in a hawkish direction also on monday raphael bostic president of the federal reserve bank of atlanta said that controlling inflation is the top concern that i have for 2022 bostic also said he expects the fed to raise rates a total of six times this year and twice more in 2023 that is a more dovish approach than most of his colleagues but he emphasized that this was mostly because of the extreme uncertainty currently surrounding the economy if more rate hikes were necessary to slow inflation he would support them he said on friday christopher waller a member of the fed s influential board sounded a hawkish note in an interview on cnbc he said he could support half point rate hikes at each of the next two meetings of fed policymakers waller argued that while

related diseases today announced that its novel mdm2 p53 inhibitor alrizomadlin apg 115 was granted a rare pediatric disease rpd designation by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of neuroblastoma to date alrizomadlin has received a total of six orphan drug designations odds and two rpds by the fda the food and drug administration safety and innovation act fdasia came into effect in 2012 established the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher prv program to reward sponsors for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of rare pediatric diseases fdasia defines rpds as rare diseases or conditions diseases with a prevalence of less than 200 000 patients in the us primarily affecting individuals aged from birth to 18 years including age groups from neonates infants children to adolescents being qualified for the prv is one of the main benefits of the rpd designation as sponsors who are rewarded with the prv are eligible for priority review of future new drug applications or biologics license applications and they may also choose to have the prv transferred to another sponsor at an estimated value around several hundred million us dollars neuroblastoma is a type of embryonic tumor arising from the peripheral sympathetic nervous system it is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children and the third most common pediatric cancer according to the american cancer society acs there are about 700 to 800 new cases of neuroblastoma each year in the united states this number has remained about the same for many years due to its aggressive nature and high risk of metastasis neuroblastoma accounts for up to 15 of all deaths caused by pediatric cancers it is mostly diagnosed in infancy with 41 of patients diagnosed in the first three months after birth and most patients are diagnosed by the age of 5 years with a median age of diagnosis around 18 months neuroblastoma is a serious condition that can be life threatening to pediatric patients patients diagnosed as low risk usually have a good prognosis however those diagnosed with high risk disease are difficult to cure with a large proportion of these patients eventually experiencing disease recurrence despite intense multimodal treatments patients with high risk neuroblastoma have a poor prognosis with an event free survival efs of less than 50 patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma are extremely difficult to cure and there is no standard treatment for these patients being developed by ascentage pharma alrizomadlin is an orally administered selective small molecule inhibitor of the mdm2 protein alrizomadlin has strong binding affinity to mdm2 and is designed to activate tumor suppression activity of p53 by blocking the mdm2 p53 protein protein interaction in earlier studies apg 115 as a single agent has shown antitumor activity in in vitro and in vivo models of neuroblastoma demonstrating a mechanism of action that supports the clinical development of the drug candidate in patients with neuroblastoma dr dajun yang chairman ceo of ascentage pharma said in addition to the benefits provided by the odd the rpd designation offers sponsors the additional incentive of priority review status for their future marketing applications encourages the drug development for the treatment of rare pediatric diseases alrizomadlin is a key drug candidate in our apoptosis targeted pipeline it has already been granted six odds one fast track designation ftd and two rpds by the us fda thus signifies this asset s clinical potential this rpd will qualify this program for a prv which should help us better communicate with the fda to hopefully accelerate the clinical development of alrizomadlin we will initiate the clinical study in neuroblastoma as soon as possible in order to develop a new treatment option for those pediatric patients in need references american cancer society cancer facts figures 2014

by xinhua writers li rui tian ye cairo march 22 xinhua policymakers in some non oil exporting middle east countries are racing to bring down surging food costs after their primary food supply chain was disrupted by the russia ukraine conflict which has exacerbated staple food inflation that had already been steadily rising even before the crisis policies including diversifying food imports increasing food subsidies and lowering food taxes have been pursued by these countries which rely heavily on wheat imports from russia and ukraine and have limited financial resources to respond to rising food costs some countries have also moved to shore up their food stocks and seek policy adjustments to cut their heavy reliance on food imports as food security is vital to maintaining social stability in the volatile middle east surging food prices over the past few weeks several middle east countries have seen cereal oil and meat prices climb especially countries highly dependent on imports from ukraine and russia which are still fighting and engaging in tough negotiations turkey now pays 346 u s dollars for importing a ton of wheat up from 297 dollars in 2021 after the country s supply chain was affected by the covid 19 outbreak and 230 dollars in 2020 according to statistics published by turkish media in egypt the world s largest wheat importer the market price of a ton of flour increased to 11 000 egyptian pounds nearly 700 dollars in march up from 9 000 pounds a month earlier said attia hammad head of the bakeries division at the cairo chamber of commerce in palestine the costs of flour vegetables chicken and sugar have risen significantly the russia ukraine conflict will have an impact on the global grain market because russia and ukraine account for about 30 percent of global grain exports said waleed gaballah a professor of financial and economic jurisdictions at cairo university the impact on the middle east food market is particularly noticeable in nations that rely largely on russia and ukraine for imports in istanbul turkey s largest city the price for a bottle of 5 liter cooking oil has increased by 35 percent in three days to 200 turkish liras nearly 14 dollars on march 7 with a 64 percent self sufficiency rate in sunflower oil turkey meets the rest of its cooking oil need by imports largely from russia and ukraine consumers in turkey have flocked to grocery stores and supermarkets to empty shelves due to the rising price of cooking oil and a fear of scarcity food shortage compounded in economically challenged countries like lebanon and yemen higher costs will make staple food less accessible to the most needy the ongoing russia ukraine conflict will further complicate lebanon s food supply chain as the country has already been suffering from a financial crisis and a severe shortage of foreign currency needed to import basic items and food products said ahmad hoteit a representative of lebanon s wheat importers lebanon may face wheat shortage in the future he warned in yemen rising food costs compounded by the conflict may exacerbate the country s humanitarian crisis according to the world food program wfp imports from ukraine have accounted for 31 percent of the wheat arriving in yemen in the past three months with prices seven times higher than in 2015 raising the cost of wfp operations in the country to 10 million dollars per month the wfp has been forced to cut rations in order to feed the people in the greatest need it said in a statement on march 14 the russia ukraine conflict is dealing a
