uk and a corporate financier in most others noel quinn group chief executive tells while a group of investors sought the bank s restructuring to boost returns quinn believes recent rising incomes prove the lender s current structure is adequate to help achieve the desired results edited excerpts clearly there s a major economic challenge for the world with the level of inflation where it is and nobody s quite sure as to whether inflation will start to cap out in the near term or will continue to rise the question mark is on how much higher interest rates need to get to in order to manage the inflationary pressures there will be a correction in the demand curve because as inflation is starting to impact disposable income i believe the demand side of the equation is going to start to soften and maybe that will do some of the job of interest rates i think qe needs to be withdrawn progressively qe was brought in for a reason first of all for the global financial crisis then brought in because of the covid situation and i think markets did need to see a level of normalisation emerge and therefore it is right to progressively withdraw qe to return the markets to a more normal operating environment it s not equal all around the world there are different market dynamics taking place in continental europe particularly at the moment with the impact of the russia ukraine war the energy supply challenges for europe and the inflationary consequences of that contrast that to the middle east which is a very different set of economic circumstances if i contrast it here in india the inflationary pressures in india are not as great as the inflationary pressures elsewhere in the world so i think what you re going to find is governments will adopt different interest rate policies to suit their particular part of the economy you re going to see more divergent economic policies emerge over the coming years i think the big challenge for the economy at the moment is energy supply any country that has an energy supply problem has the potential to have a challenging time over the next few weeks or months so continental europe has both an inflationary pressure and an energy supply problem the uk on the other hand doesn t have so much of an energy supply problem it does have a significant energy inflation problem and then the us as i said has less of a supply problem but there is some inflationary pressure in the energy sector and the food sector as a consequence i think india in particular has a very strong bright future ahead of it it s quite a stable economy with manageable inflation very strong growth prospects and a stable political environment within india and i think that fosters a very strong growth environment i put it slightly differently i call it re globalisation supply chains are changing they re changing for a number of reasons they re changing partly because of geopolitics they re changing partly because of resilience covid made people aware of their over dependence on any one source of supply there is a longer supply cycle today as a consequence goods are on the water longer and then the ticket price of trade has gone up so with inflation the invoice prices of goods are higher today than two years ago we are seeing a significant growth in trade but the supply chains are different buyers are seeking more than one or two sources of supply some of that supply will be scale further away from their home market some of that supply will be near assured in order to allow greater flexibility to manage supply demand implications of their market so we have seen a significant amount of supply chain shift into the likes of mexico from asia but it s not for the whole but for part of the supply chain so you have part of the supply chain within 24 hours 48 hours of delivery to the us market india can be a massive beneficiary of that and you have a good developing growing market to be an effective global supplier you clearly need a large manufacturing capability now for india it s how do you facilitate the creation of large scale manufacturing plants that can be built within reliable timescales that can be approved and brought to operational capacity within a reasonable timeframe and in the past some of the planning regulations some of the approval processes were more cumbersome than they are today and i think there s progress being made in creating the environment for large scale manufacturing plants to be built the second thing that you need for an effective supply chain is very efficient and effective logistics capability now i think india has all of the raw material that it needs because it s got a significant supply of labour in order to be a supplier to the world when i was living in hong kong and i first came to india i remember having a conversation with my team and said i d love you to be boringly consistent for the next 10 years now my definition of boring was 15 per annum growth maybe 20 india is such a huge opportunity it s a market that does value relationship banking and long term dependable relationships if you go back to our report and accounts including all of our activities in india last year we reported a pre tax profit of 1 11 billion so it s not a small business we are constantly seeing pbt over the last few years growing by 10 per annum we have been an international bank for 157 years and geopolitics has changed very significantly in those years in many different ways and forms and will continue to if you are an international bank which is what we are then you try and stay focused on finance this year our corporate clients in commercial banking have asked us to open bank accounts for them in other countries as they expand their operations and that level of ask is up 13 in the first six months of this year so despite the geopolitics and the challenge and economic circumstances our customers are asking us to help them expand their businesses not just with import export in the us we sold mass market retail because we didn t have competitive differentiation but we do have competitive differentiation on wholesale banking about 95 of our capital of america is now wholesale banking related we are doing a very similar thing in continental europe where we have agreed to sell our retail bank in france that will mean the majority of our capital and balance sheet in europe will be wholesale banking but we are different in the uk where we are a full service bank banking everything from start ups and smes and students through to the top in private banking and large corporates the same is true of hong kong and mexico in the other markets in which we operate in we are typically an international wholesale bank banking clients in multiple geographies and we re an international wealth bank there s press commentary about our joint venture here in india on the insurance side about one of our joint venture partners our acquisition strategy now is very much aimed at growing our wealth and insurance business the broader definition of wealth wealth products insurance products and asset management across asia with the four important pillars of india singapore hong kong and china the commercial real estate market in china is coming through a massive policy correction that has caused a lack of confidence in international capital markets to provide capital for that sector that policy correction is still underway and nobody can fully predict how it is all going to land and work out my view is it will take two or three years before we fully understand the new policy framework and how financeable the new policy framework will be we are working through with them but i don t think it is going to be a quick solution it is going to take time we have dialogues with all of our shareholders there has been press speculation that ping an is keen for us to consider alternative structural options to create value enhancements we have evaluated those options in the past there has been speculation that we have been asked to consider partial separation or listing and other forms of structural change the management team and the board are fully confident in the strategy we are currently pursuing it s the right one and the fastest and the safest route to higher returns which you saw in our half year results where we have upgraded our market guidance so that our return on tangible equity will be 12 plus next year the transformation we have embarked upon in the last two or three years has improved the operating leverage of hsbc by 400 basis points a fundamental corporate restructuring of the holding structure of the group will lead to significant revenue de synergies and cost de synergies and massive uncertainties for the next three to five years with no certainty of getting any of these proposals approved by shareholders or regulators we would require 25 regulators around the world to approve such a structure and we don t believe it s the right answer we believe we are following the right strategy

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

meghan markle is back in britain fronting a summit about equality and poverty i ve no idea what she actually said in her opening address in manchester last night because i don t care and nor should you even by her standards it s staggeringly stupendously preposterously absurd for a woman who married a multi millionaire prince gave up her job and now lives entirely off the gargantuan proceeds of his royal status that she ruthlessly fleeces to the highest bidders to be involved in lecturing anyone about poverty and equality just as it is when she bleats away about the environment from her mate sir elton john s private jet but for markle to pull this stunt in britain the country she loathes and couldn t wait to abandon once she sunk her claws into halfwit harry at a time when we re in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the end of world war two is as sickening as it s outrageous to be blunt who the f does she think she is coming back here at all after all the vile manure she s gleefully flung at britain the monarchy and the royal family and for her to have the brass neck to position herself as a gender equality and poverty campaigner when she leads a life of unimaginable wealth and privilege purely because of her husband s birth right is not just completely inappropriate it s shamefully tone deaf beaming on proudly was harry the doormat who is just as bad as his wife what on earth does he know about equality and poverty after an entire lifetime existing in luxurious palatial conditions of spectacular inequality as always with the duke and duchess of sussex i still don t understand why the hell they re allowed to keep these titles given how cynically they exploit them for personal financial gain their actions are riddled with hypocrisy it s shamefully tone deaf for meghan markle to position herself as a gender equality and poverty campaigner when she leads a life of unimaginable wealth and privilege purely because of her husband s birth right writes piers morgan photo by chris jackson getty images delegates attending the one young world summit are paying 1 000 a day 1 690 aud to attend the three day event which does not include either the cost of travelling to manchester or their accommodation so that s around 5 000 8 472 aud a pop for most of them when many britons are struggling to afford basic food or heating bills how does that sit with the themes of equality and poverty exactly the hypocrisy doesn t stop there another theme of the summit according to its official website is conflict prevention how can we prevent conflicts i ll admit i laughed out loud when i read that no two people on planet earth have done more to foster conflict than the sussexes who ve fallen out with both their sets of families and never stop trashing them in public to please their american corporate paymasters indeed so deep is the division that meghan whose archewell foundation boasts about unleashing the power of compassion has disowned her distraught father thomas with such mercilessness that she hasn t even contacted him since he suffered a massive stroke several months ago and harry is now not only virtually estranged from his own father prince charles he reportedly won t even see his brother prince william during this visit despite staying just half a mile away from him on the same windsor estate the double standard would be hilarious if it wasn t so ridiculous a third one young world summit theme is ethical leadership which is described thus with the current trust deficit in public figures and institutions how can we instil transparency honesty and integrity as core values for leaders and ensure that they act for the good of all forgive me if i don t physically snort with derision at that one princess pinocchio s constant disingenuous bullsh t from falsely claiming she was secretly married three days before her televised wedding to her recently saying a south african cast member of lion king who mysteriously doesn t seem to exist said her nuptials were as historic a cause for celebration as nelson mandela s release from prison has made her a global laughing stock as i tried to warn everyone when i was forced out of my job hosting good morning britain for disbelieving her nonsense meghan s truth has turned out to be about as far removed from the actual truth as i am from being the next pope and the worst thing about her and harry s constant royal bashing antics is the appalling hurt and distress it causes the poor queen who is 96 and in poor health her majesty has spent 70 years devoted to selfless duty to her country and done so with great humility grace integrity and a mantra of never complain never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public yet just as the whole existence of the monarchy that she s preserved so well is being openly debated for the time when she is sadly no longer with us here are her errant runaway grandson and his ghastly money grabbing wife crashing back into britain like some renegade rival royal family to promote a summit dedicated to four things they are woefully ill equipped to promote preventing conflict poverty inequality and unethical behaviour meghan and harry want their two faced royal cake without doing any duty in return and to be free to scoff it as greedily as they wish regardless of how badly they damage the reputation of the monarchy in the process it s disgusting

focus unravelling the persona of a business colossus a recent article on the 10 coolest billionaires in the world compiled by global super brands featuring globacom chairman dr mike adenuga jnr is another eloquent testament to his vast wealth and unassuming nature writes lanre alfred not that it tickles his fancy or gives him the kicks but a recent article on the 10 coolest billionaires in the world by global super brands the world s largest independent arbiter of branding featuring the chairman of globacom dr mike adenuga further shows what nigerians he might be nigeria s wealthiest but most understated billionaire of all time the article attempts to draw a parallel between the new set of billionaires in music tech and arts among other sectors and older men who have spent decades honing their crafts until recently the article posited that the mention of billionaires evoked pictures of boring older individuals who have spent decades honing their craft the times are shifting and much younger people have worked hard to amass wealth while maintaining their individualities and peculiarities said the publication while tons of young billionaires have sprung up from music tech arts and many more sectors there are the not so young who in the face of a vastly changing world continue to define their own sense of being and nothing could be cooler they all find an intersection in their coolness it was not a surprise that adenuga s name featured prominently on the list including tesla founder elon musk virgin atlantic founder richard branson and francoise bettencourt meyers the third generation heiress of the world s largest family cosmetics company l oreal the report claimed that although forbes values adenuga at 6 1 billion with their methodology principally focused on stocks and most of mike s wealth hedged elsewhere his wealth has been said to be understated by at least 10 billion according to the publication adenuga is worth closer to 20 billion in real terms and that is not where his coolness derives though the publication notes that the globacom honcho is one billionaire in that you wouldn t see him at any random event you will not hear him quoted in the papers or on tv but his impact pervades philanthropy business sports and contemporary culture talk about a spirit manages his space and energy and also gets to make the universe move in the direction of his thoughts the report added in a world where billionaires crave the attention of the ruling class and the media nothing could be cooler than to know that there is one that would rather everyone comes to him instead the important ones do animated conversations locally and internationally have trailed the report s publication signposting an honour well deserving of adenuga s stature in an era when both the mainstream and new media commit the systemic looting of accolades heaping it on undeserving social symbols and demagogues adenuga who holds the french and ghanaian highest national honours attracts recognition by dint of his good works notwithstanding his depth as an entrepreneur stylist philanthropist and citizen of humanity adenuga covets no vanities he demands no free verses heroic couplets or ornamental rhymes to glorify his personage as a man however it is often said if adenuga does not strike you at first sight then possibly he is a masterpiece of a man disguised as a blank canvas the multibillionaire affects a flurry of beings curled into one he is science an art a foundation of genius with dashes of brilliance brightening the creativity of his mind and soul thus illumining the world a product of pure intellect vision and sheer enterprise he can become any form he creates he is a library of masterpieces an intricate web of sensitivity and hope attuned in full measure to the world s needs a glimpse of who he truly is globacom nigeria s second national carrier is considered adenuga s cash cow because it is the fastest growing telecommunications company in africa with a subscriber base of over 55 million and a vast network of fibre optics crisscrossing all parts of nigeria including a submarine cable that runs from the united states of america to lagos through the united kingdom and 17 other european and african countries he founded and developed devcombank and equitorial trust bank into highly profitable companies that played active pioneering roles in developing the economy s public commercial and retail sectors the banks were consolidated into one equitorialtrust bank and later merged with sterling bank plc with adenuga as the largest shareholder the multibillionaire philanthropist also owns 74 4 per cent of conoil one of nigeria s largest petroleum marketing businesses through conpetro limited the first indigenous company in nigeria to explore discover and produce oil in large commercial quantities with the fastest on stream production activity from licence award to the first production in only nine months conoil sells diesel kerosene low pour fuel aviation fuel and gasoline it produces and markets lubricants under the quatro brand name it has over 1200 retail outlets all over the country and is the acknowledged leader of development in modern retail outlets such as mega stations and non space pumps in the new look retail outlets aside from operating six oil blocks in the niger delta conoilis also the market leader in aviation fuels despite a considerable reduction in its top line performance in the first half of 2022 the company reported double digit percentage growth in earnings according to its half year financial report profit increased 70 5 per cent to n1 81 billion 4 35 million in the first half of 2022 from n1 06 billion 2 55 million in the first half of 2021 despite a double digit decline in revenue adenuga reportedly received a n1 29 billion 3 1 million dividend as a portion of the dividends distributed to shareholders that is from just one company likewise adenuga owns a 25 1 per cent stake in construction giant julius berger through goldstones estates limited as profits surged by double digits in december 2021 adenuga gained 7 2m on his stakeholding his daughter bella adenuga disu serves as a non executive director on the board of julius berger yet while fellow billionaires changed their personalities and honed their skills to conform to the dictates and challenges of the realities of the day wealth has not in any way changed the persona of adenuga who remains impressively unassuming and immune to self conceit he is like the mango tree the more fruits he bears the lower he bows in humility for adenuga success comes with the weight of humility indeed adenuga s famed self effacing nature is innate not cosmetic or contrived that effortless detachment from the hype

watch the documentary mexico s deadly coca cola addiction via sbs on demand nobody in the world drinks more coca cola and other fizzy drinks than the residents of chiapas mexico s southernmost and poorest state in the state s mountain town of san cristóbal de las casas population 186 000 locals drink just over two litres of soft drink a day or around 800 litres a year that s more than five times higher than the national average of 150 litres per person per year consequently mexico is facing an obesity epidemic and in chiapas health officials have declared a diabetes emergency pedro jiminez lives in san cristóbal with his mother maria ton and brother roberto pedro plays at a funeral of a person who died from covid 19 they also had diabetes pedro has been battling diabetes for almost thirteen years his entire family have also been diagnosed with the deadly disease as a musician pedro is often called to play at the funerals of residents who have died too young sometimes the sadness enters seeing how someone has died we are all going through this process of dying but the level that diabetics go through it crosses your mind he says i better look after myself roberto is seriously unwell and doesn t have the ability to do everyday actions my head has no strength i almost can t open my eyes roberto says pedro s brother roberto could be having a diabetic emergency his symptoms tiredness sweating and confusion are all signs he could be having a diabetic emergency and roberto s doctor says too many people in this community are facing the same reality in chiapas which has a population of 5 6 million people 3 000 people die each year from diabetes related illness making it the second leading cause of death after heart disease type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes though is it unknown as to whether excess sugar is the main cause a person is more likely to be diagnosed if they are overweight obesity levels in this mexican state are high and are linked to the consumption of high calorie sugary drinks the main reason for this is the country s love affair with the bubbly beverage and some have taken this obsession to the extreme liquid gold an hour away from san cristóbal lies the indigenous town of san andrés larráinzar where coca cola is considered liquid gold it s used by local shamans like maria lopez as part of their religious ceremonies maria lopez is a shaman in the small town of san andrés larráinzar as maria aims to cure a diabetic she prays over bottles of coke as incense and smoke from hundreds of candles fill the air situated right next to her shrine is maria s own coke fridge she sells around fifty crates a month her perspective on the origins of diabetes differs to the scientific and medical reasoning due to her religious beliefs this drink has healing properties she says diabetes is caused by anger and problems in the family when we scold each other when we yell at each other it turns into diabetes i m 51 and have never been sick i have drunk and eaten plenty of soda liquor beer and chicken a religious ceremony involving bottles of coca cola according to a 2019 study by the chiapas and southern border multidisciplinary research center cimsur each resident of the southern state drank more than 800 litres of coke in a year this equates to more than 3 000 250ml cups a year why such a large consumption with a growing population safe drinking water is becoming increasingly scarce in a town where some neighbourhoods have running water just a few times a week so many residents drink coke produced by a local bottling plant the beverage can be easier to find than bottled water and is almost as cheap the plant is owned by femsa a food and beverage conglomerate that owns the rights to bottle and sell coca cola throughout much of latin america the owners are allowed to extract more than 1 3 million litres of water a day as part of a concession with the federal government that dates back decades doctor marcos arana is campaigning against the power and influence of coca cola coca cola has developed a strategy precisely so that it s available everywhere he says they convince consumers to sell soft drinks on a small scale and obviously that generates many captive customers according to statistics they say they have 400 employees which obviously doesn t compensate for the ecological environmental social and health impacts they got the concession a long time ago the situation has changed the city has grown a lot and there is a greater demand for water now coca cola has developed a strategy precisely so that it s available everywhere dr marcos arana coca cola says it s committed to a responsible marketing policy which complies with the laws and regulations in mexico pointing to mexico s water commission which found the concession did not put the populations water supply at risk it says it understands water is a vital shared resource and has been investing in conservation projects for over a decade the company gets its water from deep underground wells but the drinking water people rely on comes from overground springs scarce drinking water fermin reygadas is campaigning to improve the town s water supply testing the quality of the town s river water and springs for levels of e coli bacteria all of these houses do not have sewage and so they are basically dumping their sewage into the river because they don t have the infrastructure to collect the sewage he says the city really needs to tap into the water that is underneath having a plant that has pristine water and you have hundreds of thousands of people in the dry season that have to deal with a small amount of water he says i think that inequality shouldn t exist this sample shows e coli is present in the town s drinking water supply mr reygadas says the presence of bacteria means the children grow up malnourished and because they are drinking a lot of coca cola their bodies don t assimilate the sugar in 2021 an estimated 14 million adults in mexico were living with diabetes with a rise of 10 per cent in the last two years almost half of those living with the disease were undiagnosed to combat the health emergency mexico introduced a sugar tax in 2014 of around a 10 per cent increase in price on any non alcoholic drink containing added sugar after the first two years of the tax mexico saw an estimated 7 6 per cent reduction in household purchases of taxed beverages they ve been drinking it for so long it s become a custom maria ton since its introduction a global momentum for this form of fiscal policy has been building especially in australia in three years it s projected a third of australian adults will be clinically obese with diabetes being the fastest growing chronic disease earlier this year the australia medical association ama launched the sicklysweet campaign which suggested a tax of 40 cents per 100 grams of sugar reducing sugar consumption of sweet drinks by 12 to 18 per cent the ama says australians drink more than 2 4 billion litres of sugary drinks each year maria ton runs a shop that sells coca cola but critics say there is not enough evidence it would reduce obesity in mexico coca cola had been around for decades before it started booming in popularity this shift happened in the late 1960s when one of its delivery workers vincente fox rose through the ranks to become president of the company in 1975 and eventually president of mexico in 2000 during fox s presidency mexico joined the north american free trade agreement in 1994 allowing coke to become cheaper to buy and more accessible since its spike in popularity coca cola has become ingrained in culture pedro and roberto s mother maria runs a small shop in san cristóbal and makes little profit from the sale of coke but her livelihood depends on it if she doesn t stock the drink her customers would go elsewhere maria buys two crates of coca cola a week as maria sits in despair thinking about her ill son she says coca cola has become deeply embedded in the mexican way of life they ve been drinking it for so long she says

europe s largest nuclear plant was knocked off ukraine s electricity grid monday its last transmission line disconnected because of a fire caused by shelling the facility s operator and the u n atomic watchdog said the international atomic energy agency said it was informed monday by ukrainian authorities that the reserve line was deliberately disconnected in order to extinguish a fire the line itself is not damaged and it will be reconnected once the fire is extinguished the iaea said in the meantime the plant s only remaining operational reactor would generate the power the plant needs for its safety and other functions the agency said we re making it easier for you to find stories that matter with our new newsletter the 4front sign up here and get news that is important for you to your inbox mycle schneider an independent analyst in canada on nuclear energy said that would mean the plant was likely functioning in island mode producing electricity just for its own operations island mode is a very shaky unstable and unreliable way to provide continuous power supply to a nuclear plant schneider said the incident fueled fears of a potential nuclear disaster at zaporizhzhia one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world experts say its reactors are designed to protect against natural disasters and incidents such as aircraft crashes but leaders around the world have appealed for it to be spared in the fighting because of the risk of a catastrophe russia and ukraine accuse each other of attacking the plant which the kremlin s forces have held since early march the plant s ukrainian staff continue to operate it the plant s operator energoatom said monday that russian forces have kept up intensive shelling around zaporizhzhia in recent days despite the warnings the russian military accused ukrainian forces of staging provocations there including sending a drone which was intercepted and shelling the adjacent city of enerhodar ukrainian energy minister herman halushchenko said on facebook that fighting around the power station made it impossible to repair damaged power lines putting the world once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster the developments at zaporizhzhia came on the eve of a report to the u n security council on tuesday by the iaea inspectors about what they found on their visit the iaea still has two experts at the plant after a perilous inspection that required its inspectors to travel through the fighting last week ukraine s presidential adviser mykhailo podolyak applauded the iaea s decision to leave some experts at the plant there are russian troops now who don t understand what s happening don t assess the risks correctly podolyak said there is a number of our workers there who need some kind of protection people from the international community standing by their side and telling russian troops don t touch these people let them work meanwhile in some of moscow s bluntest comments yet on the standoff between it and western europe over energy supplies kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov blamed western sanctions for stoppages in russia s supply of natural gas to europe other reasons that would cause problems with the pumping don t exist peskov said the sanctions on moscow and russian oil companies have created problems with equipment maintenance he said a claim that has been refuted by western governments and engineers german officials have said russian complaints about technical problems are merely a political power play germany s siemens energy which manufactured turbines the nord stream 1 pipeline uses said turbine leaks can be fixed while gas continues to flow through the pipeline russian energy company gazprom announced friday that a suspension of gas supplies heading westwards through the nord stream 1 pipeline would be extended indefinitely because oil leaks in turbines need fixing that move brought a surge in european natural gas prices and walloped global stock markets high energy prices and possible shortages this winter in western europe have set alarm bells ringing among governments notably those in the european union french president emmanuel macron on monday called for a 10 cut in his country s energy use in coming weeks and months to avoid the risk of rationing and cuts this winter elsewhere in ukraine the fighting raged on the president s office said at least four civilians were killed and seven others were wounded by new russian shelling across several regions of ukraine ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy said there had been russian shelling across much of southern and eastern ukraine including at zelenodolsk nikopol chernihiv and the sumy and kharkiv regions russian rockets destroyed an oil depot in the krivoy rog region sending up huge plumes of smoke ukrainian news reports said amid increased ukrainian strikes on the occupied kherson region russian installed authorities there said early monday that for security reasons they were putting on hold their plans for a local referendum on whether the region should formally become part of russia but by the afternoon officials had a change of heart and said the ballot would go ahead as planned

the centers for disease control and prevention is recommending updated covid boosters for people ages 12 and older these newly authorized shots are reformulated versions of the moderna and pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccines and they re available at pharmacies clinics and doctors offices around the country the boosters target both the original strain of the coronavirus and the two omicron subvariants which are causing most of the current infections vaccine makers have scrambled to rejigger the vaccines as they ve become less effective against new variants this virus has been mutating so quickly over the past two years says judith guzman cottrill an infectious disease specialist at oregon health science university i feel like we ve been playing catch up and finally we have caught up guzman cottrill says pfizer s updated booster is available for anyone 12 and older the moderna booster is available for anyone 18 and older if you are eligible there is no bad time to get your covid 19 booster cdc director rochelle walensky told npr i strongly encourage you to receive it she says but after talking to several infectious disease experts we found there s a whole range of opinions on who needs to boost and when so if you are navigating this decision here are some things to consider who needs a booster as soon as possible i would recommend this booster shot for those who are immunocompromised or those who are 60 years and above says monica gandhi an infectious disease expert at the university of california san francisco gandhi says people in these groups are at highest risk according to cdc guidance people are eligible if it s been at least two months since they received their last covid shot either a booster or an initial vaccine but some vaccine experts say it would be better to wait at least four months i will get it says physician bob wachter who s in his mid 60s and in good health i m about eight months out from shot number four and so my immunity has waned significantly wachter says he plans to get an updated booster as soon as it s available as a hedge against serious infection given covid is still circulating widely with about 400 deaths per day there s no question that getting a booster increases the likelihood that you ll have a benign case if you do get infected he says wachter also agrees with the cdc recommendation that younger adults get the booster boosting can protect against the risk of long covid and helps protect the community at large by reducing transmission if there s another surge he says there are good reasons to get it even for people that have a low chance of a super severe infection wachter says when does it make sense to wait if you ve had a recent covid infection it makes sense to wait guzman cottrill and her children had mild infections in august so she says she ll wait until november to get boosted our natural antibody response will protect us against covid for another few months so i do think it makes sense to wait and get the updated booster about three months after our positive covid test she says this is in line with the recommendation from cdc vaccine advisers people who recently had covid 19 may consider delaying a booster shot by three months that s what the country s top infectious disease expert dr anthony fauci says he plans to do fauci tested positive in mid june and says he ll wait three months before he gets his updated booster guzman cottrill says both her teenagers will also get the new booster to protect us from covid this winter so we can avoid sick days from work and from school she says can i time my shot for maximum protection at the holidays it won t be a surprise if there s another covid surge this coming winter since the protection from boosters may only last several months some people say they plan to wait to get the new booster in order to have maximum protection when the risk of infection is higher you can make a rational argument to wait until case rates are higher says wachter if you re trying to time it for the period of highest risk he says there are likely to be a ton more cases in december and january than there are in september and october however wachter says this strategy is a bit like trying to time the stock market it s hard to predict exactly when the surge will happen so there s a risk in waiting you are basically accepting a period of vulnerability that you don t need to have he says and as i weigh all that my thinking is i d rather not do that another argument against waiting is that the protection from a booster shot is not instantaneous it does take a few weeks for our immune systems to be primed says dr aniruddha hazra an infectious disease specialist at the university of chicago he says it could be risky to wait until a surge is already underway hazra points out the vaccines can activate our immune systems in a few ways immune cells known as b cells help produce antibodies that fight off the virus in the short term research shows covid vaccines boost antibodies for several months but then they begin to fade after that b cells and another type of immune cell known as t cells which can destroy infected cells stick around tobuild a deeper immunity he says this deeper immunity was triggered and primed from the initial vaccines so everyone who s been vaccinated should have some protection against covid but given the omicron subvariants circulating now are so different this booster will definitely provide you with higher levels of antibodies which are short term and short lived it may also provide more deep seated immunity he says will the new booster shots prevent covid infections completely no there s lots of enthusiasm for the updated boosters but they are not a magic bullet as sars cov 2 has evolved it s become more transmissible which is why delta and omicron led to such large surges despite widespread vaccination in the u s the goal of this vaccine is to prevent severe illness sayspaul offit directorof the vaccine education center at the children s hospital of philadelphia he argues that many people who ve already received three doses of vaccine remain well protected so he doesn t see a clear benefit to giving the new boosters to everyone 12 and up according to cdc data people who have had one or two boosters have a 0 024 chance of being hospitalized with covid 19 for people under 50 it s even lower 0 014 offit agrees that certain groups should receive the new booster including elderly adults he says age 70 and up people who are immunocompromised and those with chronic conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness but he questions the value of another booster for healthy younger people offit says he had a mild infection in may that lasted a few days he s decided against getting the new booster i think i m protected against serious disease the new boosters offer a few months protection against infection he says but there s no clear evidence of benefit beyond that copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

is coming down fundstrat s tom lee says fundstrat s tom lee believes that falling gas prices show that inflation is coming down i think the bar is pretty high for investors and markets and the fed to be convinced inflation is breaking i mean part of it is because inflation is so uncertain that the market wants to have comfort that it s truly vanquished before they think the fed can even consider being a little easier lee said tuesday on cnbc s techcheck still lee said investors should be encouraged by gasoline prices that are falling like a rock in a way they hadn t in prior inflationary periods the investor also pointed to softening housing data and believes that there is more weakness in the job market than is immediately apparent i think investors should be encouraged that hit some sort of wall we think it s actually going to fall pretty quick he added sarah min canaccord genuity s dwyer says don t feed the whoosh last week s s p 500 losses continued an oversold reading on canaccord genuity s two most sensitive tactical indicators analyst tony dwyer wrote in a tuesday note it also caused two intermediate term indicators to lose their positive momentum the percentage of stocks above the 10 day moving average dropped into single digits for six consecutive days and the cboe volatility index vix rose to the mid 20s which is a level we watch closely to indicate an oversold condition he said adding our two longer term indicators have lost their upward momentum and fallen back into neutral territory in the context of a downtrend this has informed canaccord s game plan for the year which is to not chase the dips and runups in choppy markets or whooshes as they call them the weakness has been extreme enough to cause our most sensitive tactical indicators to suggest a pause in the selling but our trusty weekly stochastic for the spx continues to point to a market that lost upside momentum while in a clear intermediate term downtrend of lower highs and lower lows he said despite the possibility of an oversold bounce we continue to suggest not taking any major market or sector bets until we see a real pivot from the fed and that is likely to take

year september is known for being a volatile trading month for markets looking back at past septembers can offer some clues about what the month may have in store john stoltzfus chief investment strategist managing director oppenheimer asset management wrote in a tuesday note with q2 earnings season pretty much in the rearview mirror with 99 of the s p 500 s companies having reported through last friday and q3 earnings season not scheduled to get underway until mid october when the big banks report the what have you done for me lately market crowd are likely to carry more weight on the day to day near term and with their usual propensity for worry and negative projection he wrote counting back from 1994 to calendar year 2021 stoltzfus counted 13 septembers that saw a negative return for the s p 500 and 15 septembers when the s p 500 delivered a positive return he also noted that of the past 13 septembers that delivered negative returns only 6 of those years saw the s p 500 negative for the full year in consideration of the aforementioned we think that while it s not unreasonable to consider potential volatility in entering any september it s not necessarily a determinant for how the s p 500 will perform in that month or for that matter how the benchmark will perform for the calendar year he said carmen reinicke billionaire investor bill ackman says there

at low tide the mudflats off southport unfold like a rippled brown carpet stretching to the far horizon apart from the circling seabirds this vast expanse of the north west coastline looks empty but just beneath the sand there lies a silver lining exploring an area known as penfold south a few hundred yards from the shore shellfishermen recently discovered a vast untapped cockle bed according to simon ward and terry davies who have been harvesting cockles for many years it contains about 5 000 tons of the highly prized molluscs which could be worth as much as 10 million on the open market on september 1 the cockle picking season started in these parts and by mid october when the cockles will have grown big enough they hope to begin gathering them in the time honoured manner a wooden board with goalpost like handles called a tamp is laid down flat and rocked from side to side liquifying the mud this is thought to trick the cockles into sensing that the tide is advancing so they rise to the surface whereupon they are raked into netted sacks the industry is now strictly regulated a legacy of the tragic drowning of at least 21 chinese pickers working illegally for a ruthless gangmaster in morecambe bay in 2004 and the spoils would be shared with other accredited fishermen possessing a licence that costs 500 even so if the bed can be farmed mr ward 39 and mr davies 57 for whom times have been tough in recent years stand to rake in a very tidy sum terry davies pictured 57 a fisherman and cockler cannot fish as raw sewage he believes has been released in the areas where the cockle beds are situated a few days ago however their chances of cashing in on this bounteous merseyside beach suffered an unexpected hammer blow a setback they suspect to have been caused by raw sewage pumped into the nearby estuary by united utilities uu along with other english water companies the north west firm has come under heavy fire in recent weeks following the revelation that it discharges vast amounts of untreated household and industrial sewage into seas and rivers and having investigated this unfolding scandal the villains of which are widely portrayed as greedy monopolies with monstrously overpaid bosses uu s yacht owning chief executive steve mogford was reportedly paid almost 3 million in salary and bonuses last year and opportunistic foreign stakeholders one can understand their suspicion in many ways the story of two enterprising cockle fishermen fighting for their livelihoods against a big corporation that routinely pollutes the environment on a shocking scale encapsulates the criticism levelled at the privatised water industry it has overtones of the 2000 movie erin brockovich for which julia roberts won an oscar the film recreates a lowly legal clerk s true life struggle to prove that a huge power company contaminated the drinking water in her obscure californian town but that landmark case was settled with a record 333 million payout from the accused firm it won t happen here the story begins out on the mudflats before shellfish beds can be harvested their healthiness must be assessed by the food standards agency they are categorised as a b or c depending on the level of e coli bacteria which are found in human and animal faeces and cause illness detected in samples taken from the crustaceans those which can be eaten fresh from the water are class a and must contain less than 230 e coli per 100 grams of flesh however just seven english shellfish grounds currently meet this standard itself a damning indictment against the water firms according to critics though hardly surprising given the torrent of raw sewage dumped into inshore fishing grounds last year their storm overflows an outdated and overworked network of underground tanks and pipes that pump untreated household and industrial waste mingled with rainwater into the waterways after heavy downpours discharged their foul broth on a staggering 372 500 occasions the total amount of time they were activated exceeded 2 7 million hours but the precise figure is unknown as many of the sensors monitoring them don t work this tsunami of filth which has been pumped out for decades but has only come to national attention in recent days shames not only the water companies it also embarrasses the government which has cut funding for surveillance of these companies activities and voted down an amendment to the environment bill that would have made it their legal duty to cease dumping a serious sewage spill at morecambe in 2011 shut down mussel grounds pictured disused sewage pipes at morecambe but back to the cockles those rated as class b can be sold but only after purification a process that reduces their value to achieve this grade they must be sampled eight times usually at weekly intervals and have e coli levels no greater than 4 600 per 100 grams in 90 per cent of the samples otherwise they are deemed as class c and must be further treated before sale until this week it was broadly expected that the new southport cockle bed would be class b the classification commonly awarded in england though not on the continent where the coastal waters are generally cleaner this would have given them a wholesale value of about 2 per kilo mr davies and mr ward supply dealers selling mainly to british restaurants and shellfish stalls but some export to scandinavia france and spain where english cockles are much in demand a reading taken at penfold south on august 15 was highly encouraging showing 1 700 e coli per 100 grams well within the permitted limit when the latest result was posted online however the shellfishermen were horrified though the cockles were collected on august 24 yards from the previous batch the bacteria level had mysteriously soared to 35 000 more than 20 times higher than it had been nine days earlier over the coming weeks more specimens will be analysed should they exceed the upper level again the bed will be rated as class c slashing the cockles value to 80p a kilo and making the laborious job of farming them hardly worth it harvesting could even be banned altogether in which case 10 million worth of cockles will stay stuck in the polluted mud harvesting could even be banned altogether in which case 10 million worth of cockles will stay stuck in the polluted mud so what caused this dramatic spike as united utilities points out and mr davies accepts it could have been down to cattle droppings being washed onto the sands by the rain that belatedly fell in mid august for sizeable herds graze on the salt marshes around southport yet was it by pure coincidence that the abnormally high faecal bacteria reading came within days of the revelation that coastal waters all around the country had been deluged by sewage from storm overflows one disturbing picture showed a huge slick of brown sludge discolouring the sea at seaford east sussex on several days last month virtually every west coast beach from cornwall to the solway firth was rendered unfit for bathing according to data aggregated by the campaign group surfers against sewage and was it by chance that just ten days before the rogue sample was taken at southport people bathing in morecambe bay 50 miles to the north scrambled out of the water in disgust claiming to have encountered a tide of floating stools uu insists it didn t release any sewage into the bay at that time and there are suggestions that globules of algae might have been mistaken for faeces though one local swimmer chris caton told me indignantly that as a hospital nurse she knows a human t when she sees one whatever the truth an eye opening interactive map produced by the rivers trust reveals that the company regularly sends raw sewage into the river ribble and its tributaries which flow into the irish sea at southport inspecting the records of uu facilities situated close to the cockle bed the possibility that these caused the contamination becomes more compelling last year one wastewater treatment works pumped sludge into crossens pool which empties into the ribble estuary 43 times for a total of 207 hours on balmoral drive a couple of miles away the sewage storm overflow kicked into action 58 times for 693 hours and another on rufford road spewed into the three pools waterway 36 times for 183 hours this will doubtless appal the many nature enthusiasts who visit the mudflats an important breeding ground for wildfowl if uu was responsible for the 20 fold e coli increase mr davies claims it won t be the first time it has despoiled shellfish beds some five years ago he says a mussel ground at lytham st annes was closed by contamination just days after the firm admitted to discharging sewage in that area uu says it doesn t have any details about this alleged incident but it does own up to a serious sewage spill at morecambe in 2011 which shut down mussel grounds it describes this as a rare operational incident and says problems at the site have been solved by significant investment when i ask mr davies whether the shellfishermen sought compensation for loss of earnings after these incidents he gives a hollow laugh he is clearly not about to emulate erin brockovich we have tried in the past but it s hopeless he tells me the firm is too rich and powerful for us how could i afford to take a huge company like uu to court it is a law unto itself the local councils and the food standards agency won t stand up to it either they are frightened of it it s easier to just put a few fishermen out of work we can only pray there s not much rain before the remaining samples are taken at penfold south so that no more sewage or cattle run off floods the sands mr davies plays down the chances of him having an erin brockovich pictured moment in response a uu spokesperson said the company had recently completed a 164 million upgrade at its blackburn treatment works to improve the condition of the river ribble further investment by 2030 is planned currents and tides around the estuary are complex however and water quality could be affected in various ways while storm overflows were a contributing factor livestock grazing on the salt marshes private septic tanks and urban run off had a combined greater impact perhaps so some independent experts would doubtless take a different view yet even if the mudflats off southport or indeed any other english waterway are polluted by sewage again this autumn little or nothing is likely to be done last year southern water was fined a record 90 million after a dogged environment officer discovered that the company had illegally discharged raw sewage into the waterways more than 6 900 times between 2010 and 2015 this was to get rid of waste as cheaply as possible yet last week an investigation by channel 4 s dispatches programme revealed that 870 sewage overflow pipes are still operating without permits of these 420 belong to severn trent 184 to welsh water now a not for profit company and 61 to northumbrian water these companies said they were working with the environment agency to get licences abhorrent though it may be releasing untreated effluent into rivers and seas to avoid a backup of sewage when rainfall overloads the system is perfectly lawful morecambe happens to be my hometown and revisiting the resort this week i found storm overflow pipes hidden away at several nearby beauty spots oblivious to the potential hazards children hunted for crabs in a rockpool at the mouth of one outfall pipe which according to residents empties a few yards offshore at times of heavy rain though it was clearly marked as dangerous it grieved me to learn that in 2021 this bay the second biggest in england and to my mind the most beautiful was exposed to the longest continuous discharge of untreated sewage it went on for 5 000 hours however it was equally shocking to discover that untreated sewage gushed into a brook near my home in surrey for 1 778 hours the equivalent of 74 days last year no longer will my grandchildren be taken to play there we must hope matters improve yet according to helen nightingale who spent many of her 31 years with the environment agency ea investigating pollution incidents in lancashire and north yorkshire rivers the prognosis is grim morecombe bay was exposed to the longest continuous discharge of untreated sewage 5 000 hours in 2021 stock image moved to speak out by her love of the countryside and respect for her hard pressed former colleagues the recently retired officer told me how understaffing at the ea and a system that allows water companies to police themselves undermines efforts to keep waterways clean where once she headed a team of nine officers a number that allowed them to inspect sites of reported pollution now there are only four vacancies are being advertised but as fully trained officers are paid 24 000 a year for a tough job that can involve nasty confrontations they are proving hard to fill swamped with calls she says ea officers are instructed to report only serious incidents categorised as 1 and 2 where fish and wildlife have been killed for example or people s health is threatened lesser events are ignored worse the shortage of ea officers means that when the public report concerns about the condition of a waterway a member of the water firm s staff usually looks into it and mrs nightingale says they sometimes prioritise the company s reputation and profit margin over environmental protection it has happened where a water company says an incident is a category 3 when it s really a 2 she says and yes they would know the difference but then if you were working for a private firm and you were asked to investigate yourself would you always tell the truth particularly when the boss is putting pressure on you to maintain a five star rating it s a bit like the police asking you whether you have been speeding you re hardly likely to admit it by the same token she adds the public don t always act responsibly during her long career she saw sewage pipes clogged by all manner of objects from sanitary towels to a toy truck an abattoir even flushed away a whole sheep s head causing a blockage but these transgressions were relatively minor compared with the billions of gallons of germ laden sewage that gush from the pipes of water companies what can be done to stop the practice the debate is complex suffice to say that the industry is at odds with just about every environmental group and a good many academics water companies claim it could cost 660 billion to replace the antiquated 21 000 mile sewage network increasing water bills and causing disruption to towns and cities organisations such as the rivers trust and surfers against sewage insist that sewage overflows could be drastically reduced for a fraction of that united utilities for its part points to the 1 25 billion it has invested on the north west coastline over the past 30 years and the 230 million it will spend to reduce the impact of storm overflows by 2025 the company boasts that the region s bathing and shellfish waters are cleaner than they have ever been however the alarming e coli reading from southport s cockle bed paints a rather different picture and until the stinking rich water barons rein themselves in slashing bonuses and dividends and spending far bigger sums to abate the tidal wave of filth they will never be the fishermen s friend
oro valley may be the first community in arizona to consider changes to it s vacation short term rental rules after the arizona legislature loosened restrictions that had barred local governments from doing so that s right oro valley during a meeting this week the town council will take a look at the option to maybe possibly look into the idea of establishing a set of rules that could carry a punishment of 3 500 or suspension of a license to operate such a business hmmm this is interesting the legislature has caught grief from even voters in deep red districts about problems associated with short term rentals offered by services like airbnb the state had previously drawn only the narrowest of restrictions on these homes turned businesses basically it forbade rentals to sex offenders and well for any other sort of adult behavior so long as nothing sexual was going on the state stood on the side of property owners to do what they wanted with their homes these units are contributing to the shortage of housing stock and therefor affordability though how much in tucson is hard to determine also it s oro freaking valley wading into the discussion first ov is awful darned right wing to be leading the way into regulations state law still forbids local governments from preventing homeowners turning their home into a short term rentals however the new rules allow for licensing and policing these properties to make sure they comply with noise maintenance and zoning rules so long as those rules are not more strictly enforced on these properties being a law passed by arizona s legislature there is of course a huh factor involved short term rentals can t be prohibited but the rentals are to follow zoning zoning is entirely about prohibition of use so i m not exactly sure how that will work out but that s the compromise reached i am confident lawmakers did not think it through the idea is a suggestion and in no way yet a formal policy or ordinance it s just something the staff will bounce off the council during the wednesday meeting the council will also take up changes to a development plan first approved in 1985 near north 1st avenue and east naranja drive as part of a 1994 annexation deal the town agreed to abide by the conditions approved by the county board of supervisors it s kind of a crazy plan because the neighbors are not completely thrilled with the project but the town s hands are tied so long as the project conforms to the county s zoning laws as they were 37 years ago the project is what is called a permitted use that means it has hard zoning and the town lacks discretion still the developer threw in a recreational trail through the project and town staff are recommending approval with that trail sweetening the pot elections canceled for lack of candidates so long as i m writing about weirdness pima county supervisors will vote during their meeting on tuesday to cancel a host of elections yes cancel if elections are uncontested supervisors can cancel them and just declare the qualified candidates to have won their races if there aren t enough contestants to fill out the seats the extra positions are deemed vacant five water improvement districts and 18 fire districts failed to muster enough candidates to seek positions on the board to force an election in fact the arivaca hidden valley sonoita elgin mount lemmon tanque verde and why fire district boards generated no candidates at all under state law water districts can have be suspended without a quorum and the supes can appoint replacements for fire district boards if there is no quorum if there is a quorum still seated on the special district board the appointed members can fill a vacancy also set for cancellation is the election for the two open seats on the tanque verde unified school district governing board with only two candidates qualified for the ballot after one dropped out last month there isn t much point in going through the motions the supervisors will also vote on agreeing to sell arizona industrial authority bonds to finance a 14 million apartment complex to help low to moderate income renters older than 55 the 70 unit complex would be built at 1346 n stone ave and apparently cost 200 000 per single bedroom single bathroom apartment that s about 300 to 400 per square foot that s what four bedroom homes in the sam hughes neighborhood are going for by the way these boards administer funds collected through special taxing districts so they have a job to do people looking to get a taste of political experience might want to check out one of those boards growth is back a couple southwest side rezonings are also on the agenda as growth and the associated concerns seem poised to return to the forefront of county politics one near west valencia road and south cardinal avenue would allow for 273 lots on 61 acres current zoning allows for just 73 units the project conforms to the general plan which is a land use guide designating the types of projects the county would like to see built however rezonings are specific to the project rather than the best use of the land the planning and zoning commission voted 4 3 to deny the rezoning which often spells a project s doom without revisions neighbors are split on the project as some told the commission the project would lead to more flooding and others thought it would add needed infrastructure to the area another project faces different problems as the wong family trust seeks to a rezoning on south camino de la tierra and west valencia road the proposed rezoning would turn a 30 lot subdivision into a 143 lot high density project the county has identified this part of town as ripe for high density growth and the planning and zoning commission voted to recommend approval of the project the county staff is satisfied it s concerns have been addressed however neighbors are making the wheel squeak of the 30 plus comments received 27 opposed the project and 2 supported it the area already has multiple apartment complexes which tucson needs but this project would add to the troubles that can be created by high growth neighbors are most concerned about traffic drainage and the loss of desert habitat elections and personnel the elections department will give an after action report on the primary election s use of voting centers instead of precinct voting which the county had previously used under the new system any voter can stop into any voting center and ask for a ballot which will be printed up based on their address in a memo to the board of supervisors county administrator jan lesher said the primary proceeded like a sonoran chub just swimmingly a few problems cropped up but they were quickly fixed lesher told the board in the memo on a related elections note lesher is recommending that the supervisors approve the appointment of toni hellon to the election integrity commission she would replace longtime republican member benny white the county is also looking to beef up vacation time for its work force the policy put forward by senior county administration would add five days off across the board new hires would get 17 days instead of 12 and those with 15 years on the job would get 26 days rather than the 21 days they now get yeah when it comes to labor this is still a workers market supervisor steve christy is asking for an update to the county s personnel policy specifically he wants to know whether unvaccinated county workers will face the same prospects for promotion note to attorney general mark brnovich this is how you finesse an issue rather than suing the city of tucson and calling bonuses to some workers retaliation against others ask a legit question like will vaccination status be held against workers on future advancement maybe you think so maybe you don t it s a legit question i tend to think if the unvaccinated are still working for the county they followed county policy and proved they deserved a religious or medical exemption from the county s vaccination mandate if they conformed to policy they did their job on the other hand allow me a massive eye roll for this persistent gripe that the unvaccinated are the real victims of the million death pandemic that struck the u s and the world people were mean to them as they searched out proof of massive conspiracies and nefarious agendas cry me a riparian watershed the new strategic plan is here meanwhile the wait is over up in marana the town council will finally and officially vote on trumpets please marana strategic plan v the plan focuses on headings like cherished heritage vibrant community thriving commerce healthy lifestyles and proactive public services stab the fatted calf throw a glass on the fire the town staff has been seeking public input and giving drafts a nick here and a tuck there to come up with the final product i know the staff works hard on this and really puts effort into the document which will guide town tactics until plan vi comes around but it does seem like local governments spend an inordinate amount of time coming up with plans only to present a subsequent plan that fails to explain what happened to the previous plan they were too busy coming up with another plan a cause in the plan i fication of local governments are mandates out of washington d c to come up with them for the purposes of winning grant money down in santa cruz county the board of supervisors will be voting on plan to tap into money set aside as part of the federal workforce innovation and opportunity act the basic idea is to train the local work force to meet the needs of local business and industry in that the county describes the effort as customer driven with the customer being business seeking to hire the plan is needed to make sure that the the county knows how it would best use the money to best serve that customer the federal law was passed by a republican congress in 1998 and signed by president bill clinton so it s one of those business oriented bang for the buck initiatives the two sides liked to agree on back in the day so the county has to come up with a four year plan to submit the arizona work program which administers the money in the state in other action santa cruz supervisors will vote on a final letter to be sent to the u s senate foreign relations committee the city of nogales desperately wants out of running its wastewater treatment facility because it is hooked into the system serving nogales son nogales ariz pop 25 000 is currently running a wastewater operation serving a more than 400 000 people that s a little beyond its capacity the arizona city took over operations decades ago when the population on the other side of the border stood at a few thousand the nogales wastewater improvement act would basically federalize the system under the international boundary water commission it would be the job of the u s and mexican national governments to operate the system freeing up nogales and santa cruz county resources for other things it s a bit of an as the screw turns agenda item but the underlying issue is interesting

europe s largest nuclear plant was knocked off ukraine s electricity grid monday its last transmission line disconnected because of a fire caused by shelling the facility s operator and the u n atomic watchdog said the international atomic energy agency said it was informed monday by ukrainian authorities that the reserve line was deliberately disconnected in order to extinguish a fire the line itself is not damaged and it will be reconnected once the fire is extinguished the iaea said in the meantime the plant s only remaining operational reactor would generate the power the plant needs for its safety and other functions the agency said feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here mycle schneider an independent analyst in canada on nuclear energy said that would mean the plant was likely functioning in island mode producing electricity just for its own operations island mode is a very shaky unstable and unreliable way to provide continuous power supply to a nuclear plant schneider said the incident fueled fears of a potential nuclear disaster at zaporizhzhia one of the 10 biggest nuclear plants in the world experts say its reactors are designed to protect against natural disasters and incidents such as aircraft crashes but leaders around the world have appealed for it to be spared in the fighting because of the risk of a catastrophe russia and ukraine accuse each other of attacking the plant which the kremlin s forces have held since early march the plant s ukrainian staff continue to operate it the plant s operator energoatom said monday that russian forces have kept up intensive shelling around zaporizhzhia in recent days despite the warnings the russian military accused ukrainian forces of staging provocations there including sending a drone which was intercepted and shelling the adjacent city of enerhodar ukrainian energy minister herman halushchenko said on facebook that fighting around the power station made it impossible to repair damaged power lines putting the world once again on the brink of a nuclear disaster the developments at zaporizhzhia came on the eve of a report to the u n security council on tuesday by the iaea inspectors about what they found on their visit the iaea still has two experts at the plant after a perilous inspection that required its inspectors to travel through the fighting last week ukraine s presidential adviser mykhailo podolyak applauded the iaea s decision to leave some experts at the plant there are russian troops now who don t understand what s happening don t assess the risks correctly podolyak said there is a number of our workers there who need some kind of protection people from the international community standing by their side and telling russian troops don t touch these people let them work meanwhile in some of moscow s bluntest comments yet on the standoff between it and western europe over energy supplies kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov blamed western sanctions for stoppages in russia s supply of natural gas to europe other reasons that would cause problems with the pumping don t exist peskov said the sanctions on moscow and russian oil companies have created problems with equipment maintenance he said a claim that has been refuted by western governments and engineers german officials have said russian complaints about technical problems are merely a political power play germany s siemens energy which manufactured turbines the nord stream 1 pipeline uses said turbine leaks can be fixed while gas continues to flow through the pipeline russian energy company gazprom announced friday that a suspension of gas supplies heading westwards through the nord stream 1 pipeline would be extended indefinitely because oil leaks in turbines need fixing that move brought a surge in european natural gas prices and walloped global stock markets high energy prices and

several years anz research economists finn robinson and sharon zollner said the rbnz raised rates to 3 in august despite having peaked the economists say the risk of it rising again is present for

liz truss ministers locked in talks with energy bosses over 100billion plan to freeze bills for homes and businesses for two years with newly appointed prime minister set to use speech outside no 10 later today to launch 100 day policy blitz liz truss was confirmed as the leader of the conservative party yesterday beating rival rishi sunak 57 43 her ministers were locked in talks last night over energy bills and a potential 100billion two year freeze in her acceptance speech the new prime minister vowed to deliver deliver deliver with a bold plan the new government will set out details of the energy freeze within a week possibly as soon as thursday liz truss ministers are locked in talks with energy bosses over a 100billion plan to freeze bills for homes and businesses for two years with newly appointed prime minister set to use her speech outside no 10 later today to launch a 100 day policy blitz the new tory leader who succeeds boris johnson as prime minister today will freeze energy bills slash taxes and shake up the nhs in a shock and awe bid to stamp her authority on government the quick decisions will be made in the attempt to unite her warring party and decisively dealing with the cost of living crisis her ministers were last night locked in talks with energy bosses to thrash out details of a freeze in bills that could last two years and cost 100billion and could be announced by thursday as part of her energy plan the incoming prime minister is understood to be considering lifting the ban on fracking and expanding north sea gas extraction to boost home supplies miss truss was confirmed as leader of the conservative party yesterday after defeating rishi sunak 57 43 in a vote by members in her acceptance speech she vowed to deliver deliver deliver she added i will deliver a bold plan to cut taxes and grow our economy i will deliver on the energy bills crisis dealing with people s energy bills but also dealing with the long term issues we have on energy supply and i will deliver on the national health service new tory leader liz truss will freeze energy bills slash taxes and shake up the nhs in a shock and awe bid to stamp her authority on government the new government will set out details of the energy freeze within a week possibly as soon as thursday kwasi kwarteng who will be appointed as chancellor today will then hold an emergency budget in the next fortnight to deliver on miss truss s campaign pledges to reverse the rise in national insurance and cancel a planned hike in corporation tax mr kwarteng has suggested that plans to help with energy costs could last for two years after he told the financial times that help will last through this winter and the next yesterday the politician signalled an end to decades of treasury orthodoxy saying he was willing to borrow billions more pounds in order to protect households and boost growth this help could be extended to all of britain s 28 million households with truss allies saying that the plan will get money to everyone the times reported there has been some debate about how much the plan could cost with industry experts telling the paper that it could cost 60 billion per year while former conservative leader sir iain duncan smith said a 90 billion cost could be the sort of money that they may well be looking at there s no time now to be small or narrowly targeted he added another government figure aware of the truss campaign discussions called the intervention huge and a simple solution the telegraph reported if the planned support continues into 2024 it would surpass labour s proposal of capping energy prices at their current state until early 2023 it would also cost billions more the plan is expected to see the government subsidise the cost of gas being bought by suppliers and electricity generators this would result in the cost being capped for brits remaining at 1 971 for the average household instead of soaring to 3 549 next month it had been predicted by some analysts that it could exceed 5 000 by the new year however it could lead to a levy on household bills after the immediate energy crisis dips with the cost of subsidising prices now being repaid by the taxpayer later down the line it means that household bills may not fall drastically when the crisis ends the plan has been called intrinsically challenging by energy consultancy boss ian barker of bfy with director of the institute for fiscal studies paul johnson suggesting a freeze is unavoidable it s really hard to think of something else you can make work this winter he told the times miss truss was confirmed as leader of the conservative party yesterday after defeating rishi sunak 57 43 in a vote by members think tank boss torsten bell from the resolution foundation said that the plan would be messy and complex but would support businesses as well by capping wholesale costs the government will be shielding these firms from rising prices while also helping consumers he told the newspaper it comes as pubs and restaurants across the country warned they could face closing their doors for good if they have no help to meet soaring energy price rises the twin package of measures will also focus on boosting britain s energy supply from home with a fracking moratorium expected to be dropped truss allies told the telegraph plans could also see fewer regulations for building offshore wind farms and drilling oil from the north sea it is thought that future revenue from these expansions could help pay back the cost of freezing energy bills the incoming prime minister said in her speech on monday that she will deal with the long term issues we have on energy supply miss truss is planning a major shake up of the nhs in the coming weeks aimed at cutting costs and tackling waiting lists therese coffey who is set to be appointed as health secretary has been ordered to come up with a plan for slashing nhs red tape and delivering on miss truss s pledge to transfer billions from the health budget to social care to fix the bed blocking crisis crippling hospitals a campaign insider said liz will move fast on energy bills on the economy and the

lunchtime home secretary priti patel announced she would return to the backbenches with attorney general suella braverman set to replace her today s reshuffle is expected to leave no white men in any of the four great offices of state for the first time with james cleverly tipped to succeed miss truss as foreign secretary miss truss appeared to rule out an early election pledging to deliver a great victory over labour in 2024 labour called for a snap general election saying that miss truss needed a fresh mandate jake berry head of the northern research group of mps was in talks about becoming tory chairman a sign of miss truss s determination to hold on to one time red wall seats former tory leader sir iain duncan smith said it would be over for the conservatives unless they now united behind miss truss amid rumours that he is considering a comeback mr johnson was installed as favourite to succeed her if she falters miss truss was preparing to lift the ban on fracking as early as this week mr sunak signalled he would not take a job in miss truss s new cabinet but insisted he would not make trouble from the backbenches tory grandees called for a shake up of the leadership rules to prevent a repeat of the drawn out contest in her speech yesterday miss truss pledged to hold to the 2019 manifesto pledges that helped mr johnson secure an election landslide during this leadership campaign i campaigned as a conservative and i will govern as a conservative she said we need to show that we will deliver over the next two years she paid tribute to her

fortnight at her country retreat chevening drawing up a detailed plan for her first month in office penny mordaunt who is expected to join the cabinet today told channel 4 news she s very humbled she wants to get cracking straight away she is one of the best prepared new prime ministers we have ever had in the early stages of the leadership contest miss truss had set her face against handouts to deal with the cost of living crisis sources said she had since been convinced that the scale of the energy emergency was so great it required major government action miss truss is expected to brief her cabinet on the plans tomorrow ahead of an announcement on thursday although aides said the timetable could slip to the beginning of next week mr kwarteng said he was ready to ditch the economic managerialism that had left the uk with a stagnating economy and anaemic growth but former tory chancellor lord hammond warned that treasury orthodoxy amounted to the economic facts of life and could not be ignored miss truss s margin of victory was tighter than polls had suggested and narrower than the 2 1 result mr johnson secured over jeremy hunt in 2019 one sunak supporting mp warned that she could quickly run into trouble at westminster if she failed to reach out to her tory opponents the source said the incoming pm who is expected to shun most of mr sunak s supporters in today s reshuffle appeared to have underestimated the power of the parliamentary party to take away very quickly the prize that she has just won labour s health spokesman wes streeting called for an immediate election comparing the tories to a gang of arsonists saying to the country trust me to put out the fire liz truss s tory leadership victory speech in full here is new conservative leader liz truss s

thank you advertisement no place for white men in great offices of state as pm in waiting rewards allies and axes rishi sunak and his supporters and plots no10 adviser cull liz truss will become prime minister tomorrow and appoint a cabinet featuring no white men in the great offices of state for the first time ms truss is expected to make long term ally kwasi kwarteng chancellor with suella braverman moving to the home office and james cleverly to the foreign office if selected mr kwarteng would be the fourth non white chancellor in a row directly following sajid javid rishi sunak and nadhim zahawi and ms braverman would become the third minority home secretary after priti patel and mr javid mr cleverly currently the education secretary would become the first ever non white foreign secretary but equally as interesting as who will be in the new government is who will not be in it there is expected to be a clear out of rishi sunak and his supporters after a bitter blue on blue campaign in which he seems almost certain to be defeated into the political wilderness too will go michael gove after serving under the three previous pms dominic raab the first secretary of state and boris johnson himself are expected to return to the backbenches both have question marks over whether they can hold on to their seats at the next election there is also expected to be a clear out of political advisers within no10 the times today suggests only a handful of long serving advisers will be kept on as truss seeks to slim down the operation here we look as who is likely to be in and out of the first truss government in kwasi kwarteng chancellor of the exchequer the business secretary who lives in the same greenwich street as ms truss is strongly tipped to be promoted to chancellor and move in next to her in no11 age 47 family married to harriet a solicitor they have a young daughter education eton college the business secretary who lives in the same greenwich street as ms truss is strongly tipped to be promoted to chancellor and move in next to her in no11 a frontline supporter of her campaign he will have the huge task of keeping the economy afloat and helping households through the cost of living squeeze he will replace nadhim zahawi who could move to the cabinet office after just two months at the helm of the treasury as an interim chancellor following rishi sunak s resignation mr kwarteng s first actions will include reversing the national insurance increase and scrapping a planned rise in corporation tax in a sign that he expects to take over the treasury tomorrow he made an intervention today that looked like a pre emptive attempt to steady the markets he used a newspaper article to say a truss government led can afford to borrow more to give energy bills support to households and businesses but will remain responsible with the public finances with newspapers reporting that the new pm is preparing a package worth up to 100billion between direct support to households and tax cuts mr kwarteng sought to reassure investors about her plans the pound and british government bond prices have fallen heavily in recent weeks with some investors expressing concern about truss plans given the severity of the crisis we face there will need to be some fiscal loosening to help people through the winter kwarteng wrote in the financial times that is absolutely the right thing to do in these exceptionally difficult times we know households are worried and decisive action is needed to get families and businesses through this winter and the next they need certainty kwarteng said britain s debt to gross domestic product ratio was lower than any other group of seven country except germany so we do not need excessive fiscal tightening but the cost of living support would be done in a fiscally responsible way he said liz is committed to a lean state and as the immediate shock subsides we will work to reduce the debt to gdp ratio over time kwarteng wrote in the newspaper suella braverman home secretary ms braverman stood against miss truss in the leadership contest but her anti woke stance and opposition to the european convention on human rights is set to see her promoted from attorney general to home secretary age 42 family two young children with husband rael education cambridge university ms braverman stood against miss truss in the leadership contest but her anti woke stance and opposition to the european convention on human rights is set to see her promoted from attorney general to home secretary her main task will be to crack down on channel crossings by illegal migrants and to make sure those who do reach england are deported to rwanda which current home secretary priti patel has failed to do braverman s expected appointment makes it more likely the government will seek to reset uk s relationship with strasbourg during her leadership campaign in july the attorney general said it was unacceptable that a last minute intervention by the european court of human rights had scuppered the first attempt at a rwanda deportation flight she said leaving the european convention on human rights and the strasbourg court which oversees it was required to take back control of our borders when people voted for brexit they expected us to take back control of our borders it is unacceptable that a foreign court stopped the flight she said however remaining a signatory to the convention is written in to the good friday agreement which underpins peace in northern ireland so it is unclear how this would be achieved leaving the convention was ruled out by justice secretary and deputy prime minister dominic raab when he outlined human rights reform in the new bill of rights earlier this year it is thought a final decision on britain s membership of the convention will not be made by the new cabinet until after the rwanda judicial review and a similar case next month are complete james cleverly foreign

education thames valley university an early backer of miss truss s candidacy the education secretary is expected to be handed her current role of foreign secretary the pair worked together in the foreign office in the past year where he was a junior minister before being moved in boris johnson s emergency reshuffle he will keep up her strong support for ukraine and sanctions on russia he would also keep up a hardline on china with a more hawkish attitude to beijing expected than under mr johnson but his most immediate priority is likely to be the brexit saga over northern ireland which is nowhere near being solved despite political paralysis in ulster while the economy is certain to dominate the first months of the new premier s term johnson s successor will also have to steer the uk on the international stage in the face of russia s war in ukraine an increasingly assertive china and ongoing tensions with the european union over the aftermath of brexit especially in northern ireland truss has talked tough as foreign secretary on all three main issues though some analysts believe she may tone down her robust rhetoric if she becomes leader therese coffey health secretary

whether it wanted to move forward or backward to build a future or obsess about the past not every republican is a maga republican not every republican embraces that extreme ideology biden said a followup to his speech five days ago in philadelphia and referring to the acronym for trump s campaign slogan make america great again that same speech was attacked by republicans for condemning backers of former president donald trump but the extreme maga republicans have chosen to go backwards full of anger violence hate and division but together we can and we must choose a different path

come up with bad policies during a media call wisconsin republicans slammed biden for crime inflation and the president s plan to cancel up to 10 000 in student debt for americans earning less than

defend his record so just like he lied about not discussing hunter s overseas business venture now he falsely claims i want to cut social security i want to save social security and medicare johnson

superbubble that will cause financial tragedy for investors when it bursts famed investor jeremy grantham predicted the co founder of the asset management firm gmo said the current superbubble was entering its final act due to deteriorating economic conditions a recent bear market rally that saw the s p 500 recoup 58 of its losses from a june low follows the pattern of past stock market crashes in 1929 1973 and 2000 the current superbubble features an unprecedentedly dangerous mix of cross asset overvaluation with bonds housing and stocks all critically overpriced and now rapidly losing momentum commodity shock and fed hawkishness grantham wrote each cycle is different and unique but every historical parallel suggests that the worst is yet to come jeremy grantham has enjoyed a long and distinguished career he accurately predicted bursting stock market bubbles in japan in the late eighties along with the u s equities bubbles in the late nineties and again in 2008 grantham will surely only solidify wall street legend status with his latest superbubble call for years i ve referred to the granddaddy of all bubbles super bubble has a more polished conventional ring a superbubble word search in grantham s excellent six page shareholder letter nets 27 hits bubble receives an additional nine i also appreciate grantham s attention to critical issues that somehow don t garner deserved attention grantham all that is to say these long term negative issues that i have kept at the back of my mind and hopefully yours for years climate human fertility food and other resources are now becoming relevant short term issues that bear on both inflation upwards and growth downwards indeed collectively they pose a potential risk to our long term viability with credit and debt combining for zero word search hits there is room to differentiate my bubble analysis from mr grantham s asset inflation and speculative bubbles are always and everywhere monetary phenomena the u s stock market superbubble is a manifestation of history s greatest global credit bubble moreover the post 2008 crisis blow off finale saw unprecedented debt growth span the globe with epic inflation at the very core of global finance perceived safe central bank credit and government debt grantham why are the historic superbubbles always followed by major economic setbacks perhaps because they occurred after a very extended build up of market and economic forces with a major surge of optimism thrown in at the end super credit bubbles are followed by acute instability and economic upheaval invariably a crisis of confidence in credit and the credit system plays a profound role why was the post mortgage finance bubble economic downturn much deeper than the post tech bubble recession because credit system impairment was significantly more severe importantly a crisis of confidence in risky mortgage credit poisoned the liabilities of highly levered financial institutions fostering disruption and a dramatic slowdown in credit growth an actual contraction of mortgage credit the great depression was more the fallout from a crisis of confidence in debt and banking systems than a direct consequence of the 1929 stock market crash supercycles such as the one that gained momentum coming out of the first world war only to succumb to blow off extreme excesses during the roaring twenties see an unsustainable buildup of speculative credit leverage in asset markets i e bonds stocks real estate as was certainly the case in october 1929 the bursting of a speculative bubble in the securities markets can be the catalyst for a destabilizing contraction of speculative credit market deleveraging then leads to illiquidity general risk aversion and an abrupt slowdown or even contraction of system credit super credit bubbles inevitably end in crisis boom periods ensure credit excesses that fuel resource misallocation and mal investment government and central bank market intervention and reflationary measures as we ve witnessed repeatedly can thwart credit impairment and tightening but at the great cost of spurring only greater excess along with an extended cycle repeat this boom bust government reflation cycle a few times and you re witnessing a supercycle supercycles culminate with a terminal confluence of reckless policymaking dysfunctional markets and egregious financial excess the heart of the matter an untenable mountain of debt is supported by a deeply maladjusted economic structure the amount of perceived wealth tied up in speculative asset

drop came on the heels of last quarter s 1 6 percent decline according to economists two back to back quarterly gdp decreases satisfy the definition of technical recession observers said the u s economic contraction is due to its own factors including improper monetary policies and its spillover effects will drag down the global economic recovery posing challenges to emerging economies particularly slowdown in august strategists at leading global financial institution goldman sachs predicted a 35 percent chance of the u s economy entering a recession in the next two years zhong feiteng a researcher with the national institute of international strategy of the chinese academy of social sciences said a technical recession had occurred 10 times in the u s since 1949 with each one recognized as a recessionâ a significant widespread and prolonged downturn in economic activityâ later soaring prices are posing severe challenges the consumer price index a main gauge of inflation rose 9 1 percent in june from a year ago the largest 12 month increase since november 1981 according to the u s labor department in 2022 alone the u s federal reserve fed has already increased its benchmark interest rate four times from near zero in march to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 percent to increase borrowing costs and tamp down inflation desmond lachman a researcher with the american enterprise institute said he fears that by continuing to aggressively raise interest rates at a time of incipient domestic economic weakness at home and of a brewing perfect economic storm abroad the fed would seem to be inviting a hard u s economic landing we ll definitely have a recession as the lagged impacts of this major monetary tightening start to kick in stephen roach a former chairman of morgan stanley asia told cnbc on august 30 they haven t kicked in at all right now a recession will be long and severe and could bring financial distress across the board bloomberg in august cited nouriel roubini an iranian american economist who predicted the housing bubble burst in 2008 despite the grim outlook strong u s employment seems to indicate more interest rate hikes are possible job openings in the u s rose to 11 2 million in july from a revised 11 million in june according to the labor department in response several fed officials argued the economy is still able to tolerate higher borrowing costs while economic output contracted for two consecutive quarters a strong labor market means that currently we are likely not in recession frank steemers senior economist at the conference board a nonprofit research organization shared a different viewpoint however economic activity is expected to further cool toward the end of the year and it is increasingly likely that the u s economy will fall into recession before year end or in early 2023 steemers prediction coincided with a recent survey conducted by the national association for business economics on august 22 showing that roughly one fifth of panelists believe the country is already in a recession while 47 percent expect a recession to begin by the end of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023 the survey showed that some 73 percent of panelists indicate they are not very confident or not at all confident that the fed will be able to bring inflation down to its 2 percent goal within the next two years without triggering a recession employment is always a lagging indicator and i think it will be very clear by the time when we get to september that the u s economy is already in recession jack rasmus a professor in the economics and politics departments at st mary s college in california told cctv spillover effects whatever policy the fed chooses it s unlikely to bolster the u s real economy mei xinyu a researcher with the chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation under the ministry of commerce told global times looking at the bigger picture the u s dollar based international currency system is becoming increasingly flawed he added the u s dollar s status as the world s currency was based on the u s once paramount economic productivity yet mei said the fed s quantitative easing policy in recent years has decimated the u s manufacturing competitiveness and by doing so undercut the dollar system the abrupt tightening of monetary policy after years of easing along with other factors is likely to lead to a financial crisis mei warned the fed s policy will inevitably affect international capital flows raising the cost of financing african countries need to maintain economic activities thus affecting their recovery from the covid 19 pandemic charles onunaiju director of the abuja based center for china studies in nigeria told xinhua news agency the long term u s dollar hegemony has made african economies tie their key economic fundamentals and foreign trade to the currency he said adding this means the u s could transfer inflationary pressure to these countries through its domestic monetary policy one of the challenges that economies in nigeria and africa at large face is inflationary pressure they are all imported inflationary pressures arising from the hegemony of the dollar as a major currency of exchange onunaiju said according to malhar nabar a division chief with the imf s research department emerging economies that have borrowed heavily in u s dollars could find themselves in a difficult position he told xinhua that for those who are already mired in debt if they cannot meet debt service obligations that will create wider problems the volatile international situation plus energy and food crises have already led to social and political instability in some developing countries zhong echoed adding that debt problems in some of them may even deteriorate and result in social disorderâ a vicious cycle risk averse sentiment will rise in the face of a u s economic slowdown or recession josua pardede chief economist at indonesia s permata bank told xinhua adding such sentiment will lead to capital outflows from the financial market particularly in the bond market the shock in the u s economy will drag down the global economy and global trade volume will also decline he said adding that the export performance of indonesia and some other developing countries will go down given the u s is their main trading partner the spillover effects also include stock market volatility currency depreciation rising cost of imported raw materials and other challenges for many emerging markets according to experts all countries including china should remain highly vigilant to the potential impacts on their exports due to u s economic recession and possible capital outflows as the fed has reaffirmed plans for an

another half point hike is not off the cards said sarah hunter senior economist at kpmg i wouldn t rule out necessarily another 50 basis points just based on today but slower for sure going forward

is coming down fundstrat s tom lee says fundstrat s tom lee believes that falling gas prices show that inflation is coming down i think the bar is pretty high for investors and markets and the fed to be convinced inflation is breaking i mean part of it is because inflation is so uncertain that the market wants to have comfort that it s truly vanquished before they think the fed can even consider being a little easier lee said tuesday on cnbc s techcheck still lee said investors should be encouraged by gasoline prices that are falling like a rock in a way they hadn t in prior inflationary

plan for the year which is to not chase the dips and runups in choppy markets or whooshes as they call them the weakness has been extreme enough to cause our most sensitive tactical indicators to suggest a pause in the selling but our trusty weekly stochastic for the spx continues to point to a market that lost upside momentum while in a clear intermediate term downtrend of lower highs and lower lows he said despite the possibility of an oversold bounce we continue to suggest not taking any major market or sector bets until we see a real pivot from the fed and that is likely to take more time dwyer added carmen reinicke nasdaq on track for seven days of losses its longest since 2016 the nasdaq composite ticked lower on tuesday heading for its seventh consecutive day of declines

year september is known for being a volatile trading month for markets looking back at past septembers can offer some clues about what the month may have in store john stoltzfus chief investment strategist managing director oppenheimer asset management wrote in a tuesday note with q2 earnings season pretty much in the rearview mirror with 99 of the s p 500 s companies having reported through last friday and q3 earnings season not scheduled to get underway until mid october when the big banks report the what have you done for me lately market crowd are likely to carry more weight on the day to day near term and with their usual propensity for worry and negative projection he wrote counting back from 1994 to calendar year 2021 stoltzfus counted 13 septembers that saw a negative return for the s p 500 and 15 septembers when the s p 500 delivered a positive return he also noted that of the past 13 septembers that delivered negative returns only 6 of those years saw the s p 500 negative for the full year in consideration of the aforementioned we think that while it s not unreasonable to consider potential volatility in entering any september it s not necessarily a determinant for how the s p 500 will perform in that month or for that matter how the benchmark will perform for the calendar year he said carmen reinicke billionaire investor bill ackman says there

economy headed for a recession many economists would say yes the u s gdp shrank 0 9 percent at an annualized rate in the april june period according to data from the u s department of commerce the drop came on the heels of last quarter s 1 6 percent decline according to economists two back to back quarterly gdp decreases satisfy the definition of technical recession observers said the u s economic contraction is due to its own factors including improper monetary policies and its spillover effects will drag down the global economic recovery posing challenges to emerging economies particularly slowdown in august strategists at leading global financial institution goldman sachs predicted a 35 percent chance of the u s economy entering a recession in the next two years zhong feiteng a researcher with the national institute of international strategy of the chinese academy of social sciences said a technical recession had occurred 10 times in the u s since 1949 with each one recognized as a recessionâ a significant widespread and prolonged downturn in economic activityâ later soaring prices are posing severe challenges the consumer price index a main gauge of inflation rose 9 1 percent in june from a year ago the largest 12 month increase since november 1981 according to the u s labor department in 2022 alone the u s federal reserve fed has already increased its benchmark interest rate four times from near zero in march to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 percent to increase borrowing costs and tamp down inflation desmond lachman a researcher with the american enterprise institute said he fears that by continuing to aggressively raise interest rates at a time of incipient domestic economic weakness at home and of a brewing perfect economic storm abroad the fed would seem to be inviting a hard u s economic landing we ll definitely have a recession as the lagged impacts of this major monetary tightening start to kick in stephen roach a former chairman of morgan stanley asia told cnbc on august 30 they haven t kicked in at all right now a recession will be long and severe and could bring financial distress across the board bloomberg in august cited nouriel roubini an iranian american economist who predicted the housing bubble burst in 2008 despite the grim outlook strong u s employment seems to indicate more interest rate hikes are possible job openings in the u s rose to 11 2 million in july from a revised 11 million in june according to the labor department in response several fed officials argued the economy is still able to tolerate higher borrowing costs while economic output contracted for two consecutive quarters a strong labor market means that currently we are likely not in recession frank steemers senior economist at the conference board a nonprofit research organization shared a different viewpoint however economic activity is expected to further cool toward the end of the year and it is increasingly likely that the u s economy will fall into recession before year end or in early 2023 steemers prediction coincided with a recent survey conducted by the national association for business economics on august 22 showing that roughly one fifth of panelists believe the country is already in a recession while 47 percent expect a recession to begin by the end of 2022 or the first quarter of 2023 the survey showed that some 73 percent of panelists indicate they are not very confident or not at all confident that the fed will be able to bring inflation down to its 2 percent goal within the next two years without triggering a recession employment is always a lagging indicator and i think it will be very clear by the time when we get to september that the u s economy is already in recession jack rasmus a professor in the economics and politics departments at st mary s college in california told cctv spillover effects whatever policy the fed chooses it s unlikely to bolster the u s real economy mei xinyu a researcher with the chinese academy of international trade and economic cooperation under the ministry of commerce told global times looking at the bigger picture the u s dollar based international currency system is becoming increasingly flawed he added the u s dollar s status as the world s currency was based on the u s once paramount economic productivity yet mei said the fed s quantitative easing policy in recent years has decimated the u s manufacturing competitiveness and by doing so undercut the dollar system the abrupt tightening of monetary policy after years of easing along with other factors is likely to lead to a financial crisis mei warned the fed s policy will inevitably affect international capital flows raising the cost of financing african countries need to maintain economic activities thus affecting their recovery from the covid 19 pandemic charles onunaiju director of the abuja based center for china studies in nigeria told xinhua news agency the long term u s dollar hegemony has made african economies tie their key economic fundamentals and foreign trade to the currency he said adding this means the u s could transfer inflationary pressure to these countries through its domestic monetary policy one of the challenges that economies in nigeria and africa at large face is inflationary pressure they are all imported inflationary pressures arising from the hegemony of the dollar as a major currency of exchange onunaiju said according to malhar nabar a division chief with the imf s research department emerging economies that have borrowed heavily in u s dollars could find themselves in a difficult position he told xinhua that for those who are already mired in debt if they cannot meet debt service obligations that will create wider problems the volatile international situation plus energy and food crises have already led to social and political instability in some developing countries zhong echoed adding that debt problems in some of them may even deteriorate and result in social disorderâ a vicious cycle risk averse sentiment will rise in the face of a u s economic slowdown or recession josua pardede chief economist at indonesia s permata bank told xinhua adding such sentiment will lead to capital outflows from the financial market particularly in the bond market the shock in the u s economy will drag down the global economy and global trade volume will also decline he said adding that the export performance of indonesia and some other developing countries will go down given the u s is their main trading partner the spillover effects also include stock market volatility currency depreciation rising cost of imported raw materials and other challenges for many emerging markets according to experts all countries including china should remain highly vigilant to the potential impacts on their exports due to u s economic recession and possible capital outflows as the fed has reaffirmed plans for an aggressive interest rate policy said yu xiang a research fellow with the center for international security and strategy at tsinghua university print edition title looming recession copyedited by

after a week water pressure has been restored in jackson mississippi the state s capital and largest city allowing some 150 000 resident to flush their toilets and get water from their faucets some residents have reported that the water which is flowing through their faucets is severely tainted making it unsafe to consume workers at the highway 18 walmart distribute the last of 6 000 cases of water to a long line of residents in jackson mississippi on thursday september 1 2022 a recent flood worsened the city s longstanding water system problems city officials reported significant gains were made late friday night going into saturday with the o b curtis water treatment plant increasing plant output to 86 pounds per square inch psi close to their goal of 87 psi on sunday water pressure reached 90 psi all tanks maintained storage levels overnight we currently do not have any tanks at low levels all of jackson should now have pressure and most are now experiencing normal pressure the city s new release declared monday during a monday news conference mississippi republican governor tate reeves said today the tanks are full water pressure is solid noting there may be more bad days in the future we have however reached a place where people in jackson can trust that water will come out of the faucet people in jackson can trust the toilets can be flushed the explicit warning of more bad days is a backhanded guarantee that there will be no overhaul of the city s water infrastructure to ensure every resident s basic social right to clean water the next extreme weather event all but guaranteed due to the effects of climate change could once again knock out this essential service on monday jackson public schools announced in person classes will resume tuesday thanks to resumption of water service this despite the ongoing covid 19 pandemic that has claimed more than 1 million lives in the united states alone rest assured we will make every possible effort to keep our schools open for in person learning a jackson public schools twitter declared notwithstanding water pressure having been returned to the city jackson residents remain under a boil water advisory in order for the advisory to be lifted officials must receive two rounds of clear samples from the water this is expected to occur according to city officials this week since july 30 the city has been under a boil water notice due to high level of manganese combined with the use of lime from damaged main pumps at the o b curtis water treatment plant according to city officials late last month torrential rains brought significant flooding to the pearl river which placed immense strain the o b curtis plant causing it to fail on sunday federal emergency management agency fema administrator deanne criswell said it was far too early to determine whether jackson residents will have access to safe drinking water the focus right now is making sure we can get bottled water out criswell noted also on sunday jackson s democratic mayor chokwe antar lumumba warned of additional challenges pertaining to repairs being made as water pressure is restored such as the bursting of fragile decades old pipes in speaking with abc s this week lumumba said as i have always warned even when the pressure is restored even when we re not under a boil water notice it s not a matter of if these systems will fail but when these systems will fail he continued there are many points of failure we re talking about a set of accumulated challenges that have taken place over the better part of 30 years over that same period democratic and republican administrations have poured trillions of dollars into war coups and regional destabilization from the first gulf war to the bombing of yugoslavia iraq afghanistan somalia yemen syria and libya to name but a few examples now the biden administration is spending tens of billions on the proxy war in ukraine against russia all the while society s infrastructure which the population relies on has been allowed to decay and collapse president joe biden and the democrats who posture as the saviors of disadvantaged communities particularly those of color have made no effort to overhaul the majority african american city let alone the nation s crumbling infrastructure the 2 trillion infrastructure investment and jobs act nationally will prove insufficient for needed repairs and replacements in every state while funneling money into the coffers of big corporations meanwhile the stock market will remain safe thanks to federal reserve and government bailouts without any serious opposition from the biden administration mississippi s republican controlled state legislature has sat on federal funds from the covid 19 pandemic stimulus instead of distributing it to those in need the federal government is going to have to figure out ways to bypass these republican controlled governors and legislatures to get money in the hands of the cities which are going to be the democratic party stronghold said kali akuno co director of cooperation jackson a local activist organization which operates in the orbit of the democratic party mississippi typifies that in a lot of ways said akuno continuing but i think we re kind of a canary in the coal mine for what s coming down the road for a lot of municipalities facing similar infrastructure issues mississippi republican senator roger wicker one of 19 republicans to join senate democrats in passing the 2021 1 2 trillion infrastructure law told cnn the o b curtis water treatment facility deteriorated in part because there have been tax base problems with population decline in jackson mayor lumumba has alluded to raising the sales tax on jackson residents a quarter of whom live below the federal poverty line which will be needed to resolve the city s funding issues lumumba told abc safe drinkable reliable sustainable and equitable will be a long and arduous task to secure in promoting himself as a political innovator that can make gains for the working class he said i ve been lifting up this circumstance amongst many individuals that are in leadership and have influence over a solution further stating i don t want to put it squarely in one person s lap but i think there s a well defined record of me lifting that up on monday governor reeves spoke truly of the state of the water system this system broke over several years and it would be inaccurate to claim it is totally solved in a matter of less than a week however in this truth reeves has expressed an indifference to the lives of those who live in jackson and throughout the state as he bears responsibility for stalling necessary funds for covid 19 relief and overhauling water sewage infrastructure in the city

that might appear straightforward but dwac has been running an aggressive campaign to get the votes out suggesting that it is concerned about the outcome its sponsors hold about 18 per cent of the vehicle s shares but the rest is widely dispersed among largely retail shareholders dwac s chief executive patrick orlando has said a majority of the stock is held by those retail investors typically in proxy votes only about 28 per cent of retail shareholders participate he said in an online interview late last month i ve made a fortune by using debt and if things don t work out i renegotiate the debt i mean that s a smart thing not a stupid thing donald trump to get the extension across the line dwac needs a vote of at least 65 per cent in favour which means it needs about 57 per cent of the non sponsor votes while most of the retail investors will probably be die hard trump supporters that s still a tough ask if the extension doesn t get sufficient support then dwac could get a six month extension if it can convince its backers to put more money up but there is no certainty that the sec or the doj will have completed their investigations by then or what action they might take without the deal trump media is probably in a bit of strife indeed with reports that it is already failing to pay its bills it might already be donald trump does of course have a track record of not paying his debts as part of what he sees as a clever business strategy i ve made a fortune by using debt and if things don t work out i renegotiate the debt i mean that s a smart thing not a stupid thing he once said truth social and its parent trump media technology group tmtg however don t appear to have much of a future even if trump were to get his hands on dwac s cash without it it would have to either raise cash elsewhere trump might have to dig deep into his own pockets or be liquidated the social media platform something of a rip off of twitter has struggled to gain traction with anyone other than trump s hardcore maga crowd it has only modest traffic a couple of hundred thousand viewers a day compared with the 1 5 million when it launched and trump himself has only about 4 million followers compared with the 88 million he had on twitter before it kicked him off that platform twitter has nearly 40 million active users a day loading while the site did get something of a spike when the fbi raided mar a lago that only reinforced the view that the site is completely dependent on trump and his popularity which has been waning among voters in the us as dwac itself said in a sec filing recently that if president trump becomes less popular or there are further controversies that damage his credibility or the desire of people to use a platform associated with him and from which he will derive financial benefit tmtg s results of operations as well as the outcome of the proposed business combination could be adversely affected apart from the fact that truth social doesn t have exclusive access to trump s truths he could tweet post elsewhere if other platforms allow him he has an obvious use by date if he runs for president again and wins in 2024 he could extend that date but his shelf life and that of the platform appears limited to how long he remains a central figure within us politics and even that assumes he can broaden truth social s appeal beyond his base that ambition of enlarging the audience has been impacted by google s decision to block truth social from its play store citing multiple violations of its content policies clearly needs dwac s cash or a big lump of funding from elsewhere if it is to have a future after the fbi raid in florida one truth social user posted kill the fbi on sight he was subsequently shot and killed after attempting to storm an fbi field office in cincinnati that s the sort of thing that gets you banned or kicked out of app stores but threats of violence aren t uncommon on the platform as for controversies the hoard of classified documents he was hanging onto at mar a lago is only one of a myriad controversies and potential legal threats trump faces from his controversial tenure of the white house

harmony and understanding sympathy and trust abounding no more falsehoods or derisions golden living dreams of visions mystic crystal revelation and the mind s true liberation aquarius aquarius let the sunshine in from hair james rado and gerome ragni the finest sunset he could remember had been in morocco sitting high in the atlas mountains looking west toward a storm forming on the coast the colour blasted the sky all around he d sat for a good hour until he felt the chill then turned back to his tent for food and sleep over the years he recalled it this gorgeous spill of salmon and peach and blood it was a masterpiece worthy of the gods alone perhaps a turner could paint it but he preferred the perfect memory of it rather than hope to see it on canvas this sunset was not going to be as grand sure it flashed from the windows and coloured the coldness of the concrete but it lacked grandeur and depth it warmed the distant sky but not the spirit it was cooler now and i was hungry it had been a busy day trekking across to the zoo spending hours looking for the frogs by the waterfowl enclosures rejoicing when i found them watching the wonder of discovery in the faces of children and occasionally adults now i was taking the train back to manhattan being rocked to sleep by the motion if i closed my eyes and imagined i was on a boat at sea i preferred the surface trains to the subway because sometimes i get to look down into the streets with their markets and shops and cafés alive with the people who were the blood corpuscles of the city most of them coming back from work now they brought the energy that was money to pump it into the muscle that was commerce there were days it made me sad watching them hustling and struggling to survive each of them a son a daughter a father mother sibling lover in the whole organism that was the city they were nonetheless individuals each important in their own lives sometimes they glowed with the joy of achievement sometimes under the pressure of a sisyphean burden every day some of them would blink out every day a new ones would light up however today was a day for me to notice their joy the couple with new hatched love hand in hand and replete with discovering glances the father with his daughter taking pleasure in her skipping the woman with her pregnant hopeful glow in the train too people seemed to have a lightness about them was it the colour of the sunset did that warmth reach into them i started to think about where to have supper and what i should plan for tomorrow and continued my slow scan of my fellow passengers in any bus or train carriage any café or bar there s always one that stands out for whatever reason some people just fail to blend in it might be their garb it might be that they aren t buried in book or facebook it might be some animation or ebullience this woman was just fey dressed like a tree wreathed in green like the couple i saw earlier she was dressed out of time she even had woollen stockings actual old fashioned stockings with good sturdily made brown leather shoes that bridged the gap between pragmatic and elegant brass aglets polished colourful scarves silk trying to hide necklace chains she too was observing the people in the street and watching those alighting and disembarking of course she caught my eye caught my eye and then smiled suddenly she stopped looking thirty something she was a little girl impish and curious she had brown eyes flashed with copper made keener by the fading dusk light she practically radiated and she had radiated at me of course in such circumstances one is taken aback this is new york this is the big anonymous and private city in which you do your best to not draw attention to yourself and to be clear i am a master of hiding in plain sight it s a gift i have always had and a skill i consider perfected almost no one ever notices me not if i don t want to be noticed children were more likely to notice me for some reason i could never fathom and of course would engage me with smiles i d learned to smile back nonetheless she saw me and i couldn t not notice couldn t ignore her i smiled back then as at a child she was almost directly opposite me but now partly obscured by a new standee she leant back in her seat to continue her inspection of me by now we were crossing the river if i was to satisfy my curiosity about this woman i had to act soon i pulled up all my charm leaned forward and mimed eating she nodded looked at the map and held up three fingers grand central deal i gave a thumbs up and hoped she wasn t of greek stock no no she wasn t too fair time telescoped we were there she stood slung her messenger bag around to her front and hugged it she looked back at me through the throng and smiled again as she shuffled and pushed gently through the crowd once on the platform she walked out of the way of the other passengers and waited for me i approached her stood at a distance i honestly didn t know how to proceed from here in my experience this just didn t happen in new york benjamin i said holding out my hand keziah she said and didn t i fancy pizza you re buying this was clearly a statement not a question i immediately thought of prova pizza on the dining concourse it would be busy but i was sure i d manage of course a woman of taste i was amused that she hadn t shaken my hand but as i keep reminding myself this is new york let s head to prova i said heading for the escalator best pizza nearby i could feel her watching me as we rode up and when we started walking along the concourse she moved alongside keeping cadence without glancing at me she suddenly said you re wondering why me right i looked at her nodded i m psychic i was watching you since i got on the train now she looked at me eyes as round as an anime schoolgirl s do you believe in psychics what sort of a psychic are you i can read things tell what sort of people they are some call it aura reading but it s more like i can read people s intentions so a soul reader i asked and she laughed a sound like real reindeer bells if you like so you do believe i believe the sun will come up tomorrow i believe there s a lot that people don t understand i believe that everyone has different abilities skills it s not often that i have to search for a word but i didn t want to appear hesitant talents that s the word i needed we got to prova and it was busy there was quite the queue when we got there and i was suddenly hungrier than ever i thought about a table i thought hard about how long the line was and how long the day had been two groups in front of us started grumbling about the wait so i thought about that they left then the two people in front of us left amazingly enough we were almost at the front keziah watched the events and shot me a look how did you do that i looked at her i didn t do anything people are impatient i don t believe you i shrugged call it a talent then now we were at the front of the line she ordered a vegetarian i ordered a chicken piccata and we sat down okay why me i asked because you re honest and i see no harm in you you put a lot of trust in your soul reading i feel i don t see how you can tell that just by looking at someone like i said i m psychic so keziah tell me something about me she looked me up and down everything from my hair and face down to my shoes her gaze was careful intent well you re not from around here you don t quite fit in the city as i said you seem very open you re interested in people you re curious and you ve travelled a lot you ve been to a lot of places you re right so where am i from then i looked into those copper brown eyes again she felt for the necklace hidden under her scarf and her brow furrowed your accent is vaguely british but you re not british european maybe but i think you ve been travelling so long that you re from many places i can t quite work that out yet give me time she smiled and the air felt lighter i looked hard at her she was certainly a puzzle you re close and you re right about my travelling i ve moved around a lot you re not very good with small talk are you she asked i had to laugh not only was she right she was either truly pyschic or very insightful i had just had the same thought i m not very good with small talk with all my practice you d think i would be but the fact that it s of little consequence means i tend not to put a lot of energy into it the food was delivered saving me from having to answer the question no matter how obvious and easy the answer keziah thanked the server and tucked into her pizza it looked good my chicken was excellent i thought about offering some to her then thought better of it i didn t want to poke at her nor to offend her then i changed my mind would you like to try some of this i asked gesturing to my plate i would love to she said she picked up a fork took a good chunk and held it to her face opening her mouth to smell it as a cat would she chewed it clearly savouring every morsel she smiled nodded and gestured to her own plate i cut a small piece and ate it thank you i said and smiled at her good flavours very fresh up to their standards we ate the remainder of the meal in silence each of us looking around at the other diners and occasionally catching one another s gaze eventually we finished and began to walk back to the concourse i have no idea why i did this i said to her i m not normally given to taking complete strangers for meals i m glad you did thank you she hesitated for a moment then stopped perhaps we could go for a drink now it was my turn to hesitate i was really caught off guard by this whole event but equally curious about this woman why she d latched on to me and why i was fascinated i decided to go for broke i d love to i said where are you headed after this the bronx you times square well west 45th and 8th so drinks there or on the way she gave me an arch look it s your choice i mean i m not trying to hustle you into bed but i have a good drink selection at home and it s more comfortable than any bar i know it s a deal is it fancy yes you d probably call it fancy good my place is not you must have some money to live there what do you do i m retired you must have had a good living what did you do real estate and investment it was as close to the truth as i could make it and you what do you do she laughed again with that jingling i work in tech systems admin it s dull but it pays the bills and you re a new yorker i didn t have to cheat it was in her accent brooklyn all over yep brooklyn born and raised my father always said that we d live and die there is that why you got out didn t want to die in brooklyn no she laughed i went to college in the bronx it was just easier to stay there after i graduated we hadn t settled where you re from you ve practically had my life history now my family is middle eastern from way back slowly moved west ended up in northern europe came to america your parents here too she tipped her head to one side now she was probing harder i m the only one here again it was as close to the truth as i could get i knew it so you came here by yourself i needed adventure so yes now we were walking past fifth avenue again and i glanced down toward the library you want to walk through the park there s a park it beats cars in that case we ll cross here i said with that she hooked her arm around mine and stopped at the corner i had a good feeling about today she said letting go of me when i got up i had the feeling there d be something new now i laughed i m hardly new new enough for me she said and the lights changed we walked around the back of the library bryant park isn t big not central park big but it s green and it s peaceful even though the traffic may be busy on the streets the trees do a good job of reducing the noise during the day it can be full of students researchers workers and tourists but in the evening it s less busy people are here with intent some of them can be a little sketchy but not tonight tonight it felt safe secure and above all quiet it s amazing how much the vegetation masks the noise she said as we walked onto the grass this must have been beautiful before we built all over it funny i was thinking that just this morning i said that there was a time when it was all nature not concrete now we have to go out of our way to find trees she suddenly sat down on the grass it was cooler now that the sun was set she pulled her jacket tighter fluffed her scarf up shivered a little she looked up patted the grass next to her i dutifully sat stretched my legs out leant back a few stars glimmered i noticed her necklace again small crystals catching the very last of the light and glowing my girlfriend used to hate sitting on the grass she said digging her fingers into the ground it was one of the reasons why we split up she looked over at me was she looking for a boomer reaction did she expect me to be upset mortified morally offended no i decided she was just being open it s important to share interests i said common ground with just a hint of things to challenge like books or films or music you read a lot of books she looked across at me again and again those eyes i live in an apartment shaped library i chuckled as you may find out later my grandfather owned a bookstore she said i was surrounded by books from childhood on i practically lived in his store when school was out i ve always had an interest mostly not fiction though i do read some now and again i m the other way i like to open my imagination spread the wings of my mind let it fly free she looked at the crows flying in the trees pointed at them one of the reasons i like birds is that they love to fly the way i like to read she lay back on the grass held her arms out and closed her eyes she waggled her wrists and hands brushed my jacket with a fingertip i could tell she was feeling flight for my part i was puzzled how i got to this point and what her interest was with me i m normally given to observation not interaction i m a watcher not a talker it was as though she d cast a spell and i was caught up in it if she was truly the psychic she seemed to be this could be dangerous i d invited her to my home and i was beginning to wonder exactly what i had invited with that thought still in my mind i reached down and took her hand shook it gently we should go it s getting cold i said tugging gently and getting up she laughed up at me pull me up she said so i stood still holding her hand then helped her up she was light hummingbird light take me home she said with those eyes flashing again with inner laughter so we went holding hands all the way thanks to

president joe biden praised unions in a speech at milwaukee s laborfest and used the event monday to continue his broadside against the maga republican wing of the gop i m here because of you the middle class built america but the unions built the middle class that s a fact biden said laborers are the single greatest technicians in the world people forget you go four five years to school in an apprentice build a better product it lasts longer it s cheaper for the business it s better for the country wisconsin democratic and labor leaders including gov tony evers and u s rep gwen moore welcomed biden who visited just two months before the high profile midterm elections in the battleground state noticeably absent from the miller lite stage at henry maier festival park was lt gov mandela barnes who is challenging incumbent sen ron johnson barnes participated in a laborfest parade before biden s arrival according to his campaign more 5 takeaways from president joe biden s speech at milwaukee laborfest celebration more one union can t do it alone workers gather on labor day to celebrate successes listen to joe biden biden thanked milwaukee and wisconsin elected officials including barnes saying he couldn t be here but he s going to be your next united states senator biden then carried a political message as he said the country was at an inflection point whether it wanted to move forward or backward to build a future or obsess about the past not every republican is a maga republican not every republican embraces that extreme ideology biden said a followup to his speech five days ago in philadelphia and referring to the acronym for trump s campaign slogan make america great again that same speech was attacked by republicans for condemning backers of former president donald trump but the extreme maga republicans have chosen to go backwards full of anger violence hate and division but together we can and we must choose a different path unlike in the philadelphia speech biden didn t mention the former president by name instead referring to the last guy and trumpies biden targeted sen johnson saying he wants to put social security and medicare on the chopping block this guy never stops he said referring to johnson more sen ron johnson says social security was set up improperly and would have been better invested in the stock market evers who is in a tight race with republican challenger tim michels has pledged to support biden if he launches a reelection campaign for a second term introducing biden monday evers called the president an important partner to states like wisconsin fortunately we have a president who understands the challenges facing working families and is willing to work with us to find common sense solutions evers said wisconsin republicans tim michels and ron johnson take jabs at biden michels appearing at milwaukee s lakefront ahead of the speech said if i had the chance to talk to him biden i would talk to him about inflation and how it s out of control and the reason we have out of control inflation is because of the excess government spending that s been going on and a failed energy policy as well michels charged that biden and evers are two peas in a pod they re politicians that are in way over their heads he said echoing a campaign television ad they ve done nothing nothing but come up with bad policies during a media call wisconsin republicans slammed biden for crime inflation and the president s plan to cancel up to 10 000 in student debt for americans earning less than 125 000 per year johnson said biden has become the divider in chief not only have his policies been a disaster for hard working wisconsinites he continued his dishonest attacks against me he can t defend his record so just like he lied about not discussing hunter s overseas business venture now he falsely claims i want to cut social security i want to save social security and medicare johnson said in a statement issued after the speech that included a reference to the president s son hunter biden the biggest threat to both programs is the massive deficit spending and growing debt that biden and the democrats are pushing wisconsinites are tired of the division and forty year high inflation record gas prices and rising crime that are the result of democrat policies more u s sen ron johnson defends record warns of fundamental transformation of america in speech to american legion paul farrow chairman of the republican party of wisconsin said the student loan forgiveness proposal puts a burden on people who didn t choose to take on debt farrow said this proposal is different than another federal loan forgiveness program the paycheck protection program that business owners were eligible for more businesses tied to speaker robin vos and other lawmakers could see taxes cut after they took ppp loans those businesses that received those loans didn t have the decision to close down they were forced to close by the government farrow said i don t believe the government should be repaying a student loan for someone saying this is what i want to do this is what i signed up for labor parade draws hundreds to zeidler union square hundreds of union members and workers gathered at zeidler union square to rally and march to the summerfest grounds before biden s arrival the road to working class and immigrant justice runs through wisconsin said christine neumann ortiz president of voces de la frontera an immigrant rights activist group as an organization that has built the largest statewide network of latinx and multi racial youth voters in wisconsin we were critical to delivering a winning margin of victory that defeated scott walker in 2018 and trump in 2020 we energies lineman john hagen of waterford has been a union member for 35 years he s currently part of ibew local 2150 union i don t need a union but they take care of bidding for me to ensure that i have fair pay hagen said hagen said being together on labor day with others who do similar work felt good we re the storm chasers we re the ones that put the lights back on hagen said being here with the other folks that are doing a lot of the same things is so meaningful to me only because again if it s not for the infrastructure what good is this country more what are you going to do for working

spencer platt getty images news this has been a torrid year for intercontinental exchange nyse ice its share price declined from 133 95 at the beginning to the year to 101 28 as of sep 3 2022 i have no doubt at all that ice is a fantastic business operating in a fantastic industry so for me the exam question is is 101 28 an attractive price at which to buy its shares given that most probably a recession is about to come i believe ice is materially undervalued at the present that it had a consistently excellent track record in the past and that its long term future prospects are brilliant in this article i explain why company profile ice operates three lines of businesses exchanges fixed income and data services and mortgage technologies in the exchanges segment ice operates a number of regulated marketplaces for trading and clearing financial instruments such as shares and derivatives think the new york stock exchange which it owns in the fixed income and data services ice provides services such as fixed income pricing reference data indices and analytics in the mortgage technologies segment ice uses machine learning algorithms to provide streamlined and simplified solutions for mortgage lenders which allow them to originate loans more efficiently they have minority stakes in subsidiary companies among them the point of interest is bakkt the black sheep of the family i will touch on it briefly later their main competitors are other exchanges based in the us such as nasdaq ndaq and the cme group cme they also compete against exchanges worldwide such as the london stock exchange group lseg and euronext otcpk euxtf some statistics at a glance as of close of business on sep 3 2022 share price 101 28 market cap 57 0 billion p e ratio 17 0 debt ebitda ratio 2 4 operating margin 38 2 profit margin 23 5 upside case in this section i describe why i believe ice shares are undervalued dcf valuation i use the discounted cash flow method to estimate a fair value for ice and i find that the fair value of an ice share is around 45 above its current price i consider dcf appropriate to use for the valuation because in the last 10 years ice has been profitable every year and has paid out dividends in every year moreover the amount of dividends paid has increased steadily over time in 2021 each share paid 1 32 in dividends in 2014 the first full year when ice paid dividends every quarter that was 0 13 a highly attractive cagr of 14 2 the dcf method gives the fair present value of a share as v0 d1 r g calculating g i estimate g the sustainable growth rate for ice as g rr x roe my review of sell side analyst reports suggests that the median forward looking return on equity roe for ice is slightly below 14 for simplicity i round this down and set roe as 13 on a trailing twelve months basis for the avoidance of doubt from q3 2021 through to q2 2022 ice has earnings per share of 5 97 and paid a dividend of 1 42 the retention ratio is calculated as retained earnings divided by earnings per share in this case i find that the retention ratio is 76 2 this yields a sustainable dividend growth rate of 9 9 i note that this is materially above the s p 500 s historical dividend cagr of 6 5 but it is materially below ice s historical dividend cagr 14 2 as well as its net profit cagr 15 2 not only are exchanges profitable businesses ice is also nursing a number of promising ventures in the wings therefore i consider 9 9 a conservative estimate of ice s dividend growth rate calculating d1 ice pays dividends quarterly therefore i set d1 as the sum of the four dividend payments in the next twelve months which will occur in sep and dec 2022 and mar and jun 2023 ice has already declared a dividend of 1 52 for the year 2022 of this amount they have paid half in march and june and they will pay the other half in september and december therefore i set 0 76 as first half of d1 i assume the dividend payments in march and june 2023 will grow at the sustainable growth rate of 9 9 therefore i set 0 84 as second half of d1 in this case i set d1 as 1 60 calculating r i estimate r my required rate of return for ice as r rfr beta tmr rfr since the inception of the s p 500 in 1957 it has provided investors with an annualised total return of 11 88 i use the most recent effective fed funds rate for which data is available as of august 2022 of 2 33 as the risk free rate i note that ice s 5 year monthly equity beta is around 0 90 therefore i calculate the required rate of return for ice as r 2 44 0 9 11 88 2 33 10 93 for simplicity i round up my required rate of return to 11 calculating v0 in this case the estimated fair value of a share is 1 60 11 9 9 146 50 this is 45 above its current price of 101 28 as of sep 2 2022 a substantial margin of safety i show my work in table 1 below table 1 dcf valuation eps 5 97 dividend in year 0 1 42 retention ratio 1 76 2 roe 13 sustainable growth 9 9 required rate of return 11 0 dividend in year 1 1 60 fair value in year 0 146 50 share price at valuation date 101 28 implied upside 1 45 click to enlarge ev ebitda valuation as a cross check i use the ev ebitda valuation method to estimate a fair value for ice and i find that the fair value of an ice share is around 47 above its current price i favour the dcf approach when it is feasible over the ev ebitda approach as the method of finding suitable comparables is in my view neither exactly a science nor an art but something close to black magic highly subjective and sensitive to manipulation nevertheless ev ebitda can be useful as a sense check to the dcf approach let s take a look i select five comparables for ice nasdaq cme cboe cboe the london stock exchange group lseg and the japan exchange group jpx in table 2 below i note the values for their evs ebitdas and the corresponding ratios as well as the average of their ev ebitda ratio of 16 9x note that i cannot use euronext because it has negative ev table 2 ev ebitda ratios comparators ev ebitda ev ebitda nasdaq b 35 0 1 9 18 9 cboe b 14 5 0 6 25 6 cme group b 73 1 4 2 17 3 lseg b 60 6 4 4 13 9 jpx b 6 8 0 8 8 8 average 16 9 click to enlarge i apply the average ratio of 16 9x to estimate the fair value of ice s ev i note that ev is the sum of market capitalisation and total debt less cash and cash equivalents therefore i subtract from my estimate of the fair value of ice s ev the total debt and then add back cash and cash equivalents to arrive at a fair estimate of ice s market capitalisation in this case the estimated fair value of a share is 148 70 this is 47 above its current price of 101 28 as of sep 2 2022 a substantial margin of safety i show my calculations in table 3 below table 3 ev ebitda valuation ebitda b 6 0 fair value ev b x 16 9 101 2

70 click to enlarge excellent track record and brilliant prospects ice has been expanding steadily over the last 10 years they have been consistently profitable and their profits have been growing for me this is one of the main selling points for the company ice has experienced a 19 9 cagr for revenues since 2011 the breakthrough came in november 2013 when ice completed its acquisition of what is now its flagship the new york stock exchange revenues surged from 1 7 billion in 2013 to 4 4 billion in 2014 and never looked back in 2021 ice booked 9 2 billion in revenue i show this in figure 1 figure 1 historical revenue growth i pro rate 2022 revenue by multiplying revenues in the first two quarters by two my analysis based ice financial statements while ice s flagship exchanges segment is doing very well the exponential growth of its mortgage technology is especially exciting ice aims to streamline and automate the mortgage lending procedure by using machine learning algorithms to train over its data of which it has voluminous amounts to find and match the optimal mortgage to the optimal applicant this can improve the accuracy and cut down the salary costs and human errors of using human employees for the same work if they successfully corner this part of the market i expect this segment to do very well indeed ice has a comparative advantage not just in its scale and financial resources but also the amount of data it has to train its algorithms with that s why i believe ice s mortgage technology is a promising venture with a strong potential of earning rapid growth in sales and profits next i show in figure 2 the gross operating and net profit margins for ice figure 2 historical margins i use q2 margins for 2022 and end of year margins for all other years my analysis based on ice financial statements as figure 2 shows ice does not have much in the way of margins growth historically but i do not think that is an issue because their margins are already excellent ice has a deep and in my view impregnable economic moat beloved of warren buffett with which it safeguards its business and its lucrative returns because for companies that want to list shares and for investors who want to trade them where can they turn to if not ice there is of course nasdaq but it focuses on tech and is not suitable for much of america s traditional economy such as oil and gas automotive manufacturing and banks cme and cboe come next but the first is predominantly commodities and the second predominantly options all of them compete in the same markets that ice operates in of course but for equity shares and especially american ones the new york stock exchange and its owner ice reign supreme potential risks i consider three main risks to ice the coming recession the first and the most significant is the looming recession obviously recessions are bad for business but they could be extremely damaging to the business of exchanges in economic booms people have lots of money and even more self confidence and everyone thinks they can get rich by trading and every silly loss making idea with a baby faced smooth talker can make billions floating their business on exchanges like ice that is fair enough it generates a great deal of business activities and transaction fees for ice but in recessions people stop trading they stop doing ipos and they certainly stop doing spacs they begin getting defensive and start hoarding cash if there comes a recession and i think it will come ice s revenue will dry up or in their words a stagnation or a decline in the initial public offering or ipo market could have an adverse effect on our revenues p 22 in the last recession ice s share price collapsed from about 38 in dec 28 2007 to 12 in mar 6 2009 a 68 decline it s not just ice comparable exchanges like the lseg experienced similarly sharp declines from about â 18 in dec 28 2007 to â 4 in mar 6 2009 a 78 decline with the benefit of hindsight we can all see that the market was grossly undervaluing their shares during a recession sure but how good are your nerves can you endure a 70 share price decline for over a year regulatory risks one of the previous articles on seeking alpha characterised ice as a company that operates quietly in the background i do not know what gave that author such an impression but ice is a magnet for regulatory attention aside from the ftc s review of its proposed merger with black knight i am also aware that cma may be considering to begin a preliminary abuse of domination review of ice meanwhile ice also has to deal with the vortex of changing financial regulations with eagle eyed regulators waiting on all sides for the slightest slip up to pounce ice is a hugely successful very profitable company with strong market power and high margins exactly the kind of company that governments journalists and voters especially in the uk and europe but also sadly increasingly in the us love to hate for competition regulators taking on high profile companies like ice is a quick and sure way to win plaudits and favourable media attention bakkt rekt bakkt holdings is a technology platform for the management of digital assets that s well and good but recently people have trouble buying gas to heat their homes and drive to work they certainly don t want digital assets as much as before ice owns a 68 stake in bakkt when the company listed in late 2021 ice booked a substantial income in capital gains from that stake on its income statement in their 2021 financial statement they noted with smug self satisfaction that we recorded a pre tax gain on the bakkt transaction of 1 4 billion p 105 it s also the main reason why as you may have noticed on figure 2 that ice has higher net profit margin than operating margin the bakkt gain is classified as a non operating income so what gives bakkt s share price which plunged from a high of 42 56 to 2 56 as of sep 2 2022 how did ice put it also in their 2021 fs we may not realize the expected benefits of our majority investment in bakkt and the investment may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model p 20 no they may not cryptos aren t trendy anymore for the foreseeable future at least look forward for some material non operating losses in 2022 conclusion i rate ice a buy because given what we are certain of now i believe the fair value of ice shares is around 45 above the current market value of their shares but i do not rate it a strong buy because in my view ice is far more sensitive than other firms to prolonged economic downturns and i worry that one is coming soon if you are a long term investor i do not believe you will regret having ice in your portfolio and i believe 101 28 is an attractive price to buy more ice shares but would it be smarter to wait for a recession to hit first and then buy the market bottom i don t know i don t know perhaps

northbrook ill sept 05 2022 globe newswire clarus therapeutics holdings inc clarus otc crxt a pharmaceutical company dedicated to providing solutions to unmet medical needs by advancing androgen therapies announced today that it together with its wholly owned subsidiary clarus therapeutics inc has filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code in the u s bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the court clarus has also filed a motion seeking authorization to pursue an auction and sale process under section 363 of the u s bankruptcy code of its sole commercial asset jatenzo that is approved for use by healthcare providers to treat testosterone deficiency in men with certain medical conditions clarus has filed a series of motions with the court seeking to ensure the continuation of normal operations while on this path clarus believes that it has sufficient financial resources to meet its operational and financial obligations to patients healthcare providers suppliers and employees through the chapter 11 process in addition scaled back efforts will continue to support commercialization of jatenzo after thoroughly exploring our strategic options in a robust process conducted by the capital structure advisory team at raymond james and in light of the extremely challenging financial markets clarus board of directors and its senior management team have unanimously concluded that a structured sale process represents the best possible solution for clarus and its stakeholders said dr robert dudley ceo of clarus we strongly believe that jatenzo has the potential to be a valuable product for the treatment of men with testosterone deficiency and with continued commercialization efforts to capture increasing market share over time unfortunately clarus is no longer in a tenable financial position to provide such efforts nor remain a viable entity the proposed bidding procedures if approved by the court would allow interested

st george the monsoons of the recent weeks have been bringing about creepy and crawly things from under the desert sands while most have seen scorpions and spiders there is one small creepy crawly that has people texting and jumping on social media asking what it is some argue it s a type of spider while others argue it s a type of scorpion both of those arguments are wrong looking like a cross between a spider and a scorpion the sun spider is an arachnid but fits into neither of the families the spider or scorpion if you think this alien looking bug is actually a vinegaroon you would be wrong the vinegaroon is an actual creature another arachnid but totally different and resides in a totally different environment yet there is even another guess on a name that is incorrect for the creature a sowbug killer spider once again those who would guess this would be wrong too so what is the difference between these three arachnids and how can they be identified properly misidentification of the sun spider as a vinegaroon some people in southern utah southern nevada and northern arizona who have come across a sun spider immediately misidentify it as a vinegaroon zach schumm of the utah state university extension and biology department is considered an arachnid expert for utah he believes there is one main reason the misidentification happens to an entomologist they look almost nothing alike to the layperson they have a similar shape which could be the sole reason for the misidentification schumm said shape is often all that is necessary for the layperson to identify something as a particular type of organism schumm explained an entomologist looks at all the physical traits of the organism before identification is decided upon these physical traits include but are not limited to legs wings size color and sometimes even counting hairs to differentiate between different species basic features of all 3 species sun spiders have ten legs so they cannot be placed in the same order as spiders said schumm explaining why sun spiders are actually not spiders he also explained the sun spider is found prevalent on just about every continent in the world and ranges in size he reported north american species can be up to about an inch maximum in size however other regions have found sun spiders up to around 6 inches in size these include the egyptian camel spiders in the middle east area vinegaroons on the other hand have eight legs but only use six of them for movement the front two are legs which kind of services like antennas the antenniform legs detect chemicals moisture vibrations prey mates and more vinegaroons can get up to more than 3 inches in length and have a tail like appendage that looks similar to a stinger that appendage is their main defensive mechanism it sprays an acetic acid out of the base of the appendage which is of about 85 concentration and reaches up to a foot in distance acetic acid is the base of vinegar hence the name vinegaroon the sun spider does not have a tail it does use its front two legs pedipalps similar to the vinegaroon to detect vibrations moisture prey and more unlike the vinegaroon the sun spider does not emit any acetic acid some very visually seen difference between the two is the colors the sun spider is found in colors ranging from light brown to yellow in color with some grey to bronze markings while the vinegaroon is more black and gray colors another visual difference is their eyes the vinegaroon has eight eyes like most spiders however the sun spider only has two eyes the sowbug killer spider is also an authentic spider and is best known as a type of woodlouse spider they have a similar shape and look like a sun spider but not elongated in shape and different coloring of the brown body with reddish head and legs they also have eight eyes most spiders have eight eyes but some spiders can have up to 12 one of the biggest differences in physical traits is in the mouth areas of the three species the sun spider has two chelicerae similar to three segment pincers which serve more like a jaw and help grind food down the vinegaroon has two pedipalps which are clawed in shape and serve as pincers that help eat sowbug killer spiders have actual fangs which inject poison into their prey this is not harmful to humans environments and seasons the sun spider is known to be local in desert and arid regions such as southern utah southern nevada arizona texas new mexico and southern california it is also found throughout the world on every single continent except for antarctica they can also be found in dry grassland regions there are about 1 000 species of solifugae the vinegaroon on the other hand is found in tropical and subtropical areas such as the caribbean puerto rico and costa rica most areas with vinegaroons are within asia euro asia northern south america central america and the southern united states the giant vinegaroon is found in arizona texas and florida and a few times in southern california within the mohave desert region there are about 1 200 species worldwide the sowbug killer spider is best known to be located from new england to georgia the midwest and the pacific northwest it is also commonly encountered in england northern europe and australia it gets its name from its favorite food the sowbug a k a roly poly bug all 3 species are more prevalent during spring and summer especially after storms dangers of the bite schumm explained a sun spider s bite is far from deadly they can give you a painful bite but they are not considered a significant health concern to humans contrary to posts you ll see on social medial he said just wash a bite wound with soap and water and you should be good to go vinegaroons are rather docile and have been known to be held by people including children their bite is rather painful and the only concern is an infection due to bacteria like the sun spider washing with water and soap should be plenty to treat the bite the sowbug killer spider s bite is nonvenomous to humans and is unlikely to bite however if bitten some people will experience swelling and possibly some pain if a bad reaction to the bite is experienced seek medical attention with an anti inflammation medication and antihistamine like benadryl urban myths for the sun spider a common belief is when bit by one the inflicted person would taste an acetic or vinegary taste inside their mouth this is incorrect the vinegaroon not the sun spider sprays acetic acid from its whip like tail named caudal appendage but does not give an acetic acid taste in the mouth if the person is bitten by the arachnid the most common urban legend of the sun spider or camel spider is the size of the creature people have claimed to have found sun spiders up to 6 ft in size on the internet with pictures provided however the pictures of these creatures often with military personnel in areas of afghanistan or the middle east are pictured at least a couple of feet in size the images are often photoshopped or the perspective of the camera makes the solifugae appear to be more mass and weight in size a certain angle of the camera gives them the appearance to be a couple of feet in length when they are actually about 5 6 inches in size it s also widely believed that sun spiders will hunt you down and can jump extremely high as high as 7 ft in some accounts this is another urban myth the sun spider does not jump as they rely on its front two legs to find prey they do not hunt their prey down either another belief is that sun spiders are faster than humans and chase humans once again another urban myth as the sun spider has been clocked in under 10 mph and they chase humans for their shade they are nocturnal and only chase humans to get into the shadow of the human they are running after they are not aggressive the last urban myth is they scream when they attack again this is false they may hiss but usually do not make a sound pest control when asked about control of these arachnids from entering your house schumm explained it is the same as other pests as with all creatures that want to be prevented in the home seal up the home as best as you can with new door sweeps and thresholds seal foundation cracks replace window and screen door screens and re caulk where necessary your friendly arachnid far from being aggressive and given a bad reputation by urban myths the sun spider and vinegaroon are not a threat to humans they are known to be rather docile only biting when threatened by a potential predator i find sun spiders to be incredibly fascinating i have found some in costa rica and picked them up barehanded without any issue so give these guys some love they are nothing to be afraid of schumm said photo gallery copyright st george news saintgeorgeutah com llc 2022 all rights reserved
by frank holmes as of last month the u s jobs market fully recouped the number of jobs that were lost due to the pandemic in less than half the time it took following the previous downturn a stunning 528 000 jobs were added in july pushing the total number of payrolls above the february 2020 level good news may be bad news in this case however as the blockbuster jobs report may prompt the federal reserve to tighten more aggressively than planned to cool growth this could decisively trigger the recession many market watchers believe we ve already entered with real gross domestic product gdp having shrunk for two consecutive quarters inflation standing at near historic highs and a service sector in contraction in addition u s yields have inverted at the deepest level since 2000 on friday the yield on the two year government note closed at 3 24 the 10 year at 2 83 a difference of 41 basis points every recession in the past several decades has been preceded by a yield curve inversion so we may be in the very late stages of the business cycle it will be interesting to see what jay powell co decide to do at the next federal open market committee fomc meeting scheduled for september 20 21 americans are cutting back on driving but lower fuel costs could be a game changer another sign that parts of the economy may be slowing lower fuel demand coupled with falling gas prices energy information administration eia data shows that this summer americans are consuming less gasoline per day than they did in the summer of 2020 when nearly everyone was stuck in their homes bingeing tiger king on netflix gas prices above 5 per gallon it seems are a greater deterrent to venturing outside your house than covid fears and government mandated lockdowns were the decrease in driving activity is in line with the results of a recent survey conducted by the american automobile association aaa the nonprofit found that a whopping 88 of americans were driving less due to higher gas prices three quarters of respondents said they were combining errands in each trip while 56 said they were reducing shopping and dining out interestingly only 13 of people who took the survey said they were driving a more fuel efficient vehicle in response to soaring gas prices virtually no one or 2 of respondents said they were switching to an electric vehicle ev the eia will report last week s fuel consumption numbers on wednesday and i expect to see that demand has jumped back above 2020 levels now that gas prices have fallen for more than 50 straight days after peaking at an all time national average high of 5 02 on june 14 for many americans vacations will happen no matter what another recent survey this one conducted by mckinsey co shows that many americans are still planning a vacation this summer no matter what even as inflation remains a top concern nearly 70 of respondents said they were taking a trip regardless of rising prices covid a potential economic slowdown or other worries this positive sentiment was echoed by booking holdings ceo glenn fogel who told cnbc this week that americans are going to keep on traveling and they are going to travel more and more over the long run fogel joined the network to discuss booking s incredible second quarter financial report the online travel agency which owns well known brands such as priceline kayak and opentable recorded more room night bookings in the three months ended june 20 than in any quarter in 2019 before the pandemic total revenues were 4 3 billion nearly double what they were in the previous quarter while net income was 857 million compared to a net loss in the same quarter last year looking ahead fogel expects record revenue in the third quarter and bookings for the final quarter of the year are currently about 15 ahead of the same period in 2019 we re bullish on not just booking but also rivals tripadvisor and expedia shares of which have recovered their loses and then some as gas prices have retreated from all time highs on june 14 shipping giant maersk posts record results besides consumers lower gas costs are beneficial to industries that consume great amounts of petroleum liquid fuels those include airlines and shipping container companies the latter of which is still seeing worsening congestion at ports in north america europe and china according to shipping giant a p moller maersk the world s second largest shipping company is often seen as a barometer of the global shipping industry and if that s the case maersk s second quarter results should put investors minds at ease the copenhagen based company reported record revenue of 21 7 billion in the june quarter and a net profit of 8 6 billion also a new quarterly record based on these impressive results maersk is raising its guidance for the full year from 30 billion ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization to 37 billion it s also raised its free cash flow fcf estimate from 19 billion to above 24 billion maersk s board of directors is also increasing the company s share buyback program to 3 billion for the years 2022 2025 up from 2 5 billion earlier some financial news outlets have drawn attention to the fact that maersk moved 7 4 fewer containers in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year but as the company itself points out this is due to the increasing port congestion not a meaningful slowdown in demand according to the census bureau new orders for manufactured durable goods rose to 272 6 billion in june a 2 increase from may shipments of

researchers have discovered an invasive insect infestation near cobourg ont which they say could have a detrimental effect on hemlock trees essential to their ecosystems and used in certain wood products scientists with natural resources canada s canadian forest service accidentally discovered the outbreak of hemlock woolly adelgid which they say had gone undetected for some time this summer while collecting data on hemlock trees in southern ontario chris macquarrie a research scientist with natural resources canada says the cobourg finding is concerning because it s much deeper in ontario than the only other known active population of the species in the niagara region that s hundreds of kilometres away from other places where we know the insect is said macquarrie we think it s been there for quite a while because it was fairly large and rather easy to see and it has already started to kill trees so you have a small insect that s hard to find and doesn t need to mate to reproduce those are conditions for building up the population really quickly chris macquarrie research scientist hemlock woolly adelgid are aphid like insects that attack hemlock trees by sucking sap from the base of their needles draining the trees of their energy and killing them their egg sacks look like cotton balls or clumps of snow making them hard to detect hwa pose no threat to humans but are highly destructive to hemlock trees which are used for firewood timber and other wood products hemlock trees are also indicators of a healthy forest offer shading for aquatic ecosystems in streams help deer navigate their trails in the winter by blocking snow and are scenic fixtures in ontario s cottage country large number of dead hemlock trees macquarrie noted the find is fairly close to an area where the abundance of hemlock trees starts to become evident he said there were a large number of dead hemlock trees in the surrounding area indicating the bug has been present there for years since it usually takes the species between four and six years to kill a tree and they may have spread beyond the infested zone the invasive species can be spread by wind animals and human movement of nursery stock logs firewood and other wood products macquarrie said the infestation was likely spread to some parts of ontario and nova scotia by birds in those places especially in southern nova scotia it s killed a fair number of trees he said it went undetected for a while so it had a chance to build up the bugs were likely introduced to north america in the 1950s from japan through infested nursery stock according to the invasive species centre it was first discovered in virginia in the 50s and has been spreading along the eastern seaboard of the continent since then the sault st marie based non profit wrote on its website a factor that contributes to hwa s ability to invade is the fact that it reproduces asexually for most of its life cycle said macquarrie all that is needed to establish a population is one female so you have a small insect that s hard to find and doesn t need to mate to reproduce those are conditions for building up the population really quickly he said macquarrie said the insect reached canada a number of times in the early 2010s when it was accidentally introduced on horticulture trees but populations were later discovered in southern nova scotia in 2018 and in the niagara region of ontario in 2019 we can look to the eastern seaboard of the u s and southern nova scotia for examples those are places where the insect has been for a bit longer and where there s a fair amount of hemlock he said in that area there s been a lot of tree mortality following the discovery of the cobourg outbreak the canadian food inspection agency will survey the surrounding area to detect any other infestations according to macquarrie he said anyone who spots hwa should contact the cfia for confirmation and handling

warren buffett is often the first name that comes to mind when discussing the most successful investors of our time warren buffett s estimated wealth of 100 billion is more than any of us can ever have in our lifetimes but mind you there was no stroke of luck involved in buffett s accumulation of wealth he accomplished this feat with astute financial management but despite this it s risky to attempt to mimic buffett s investment strategy these are the few reasons you should adopt a completely different approach 1 you re not aiming for the same things a person s investment strategy should prioritize long term development and be directed primarily on amassing a sizable nest egg for retirement stocks and investments that pay dividends are a good option for retirees looking to supplement their income however berkshire hathaway s investing goals are far more nuanced it considers both its stockholders long and short term interests when making decisions it buys up companies that seem odd on the surface but makes sense from a strategic perspective you don t want to blow up your entire savings in one lifetime leaving a financial legacy to your children is a worthy aspiration yet you presumably aren t planning to leave your whole inheritance to several charities for this reason you should choose a strategy distinct from buffett s 2 you lack his expertise in selecting stocks warren buffett uses specific strategies because he has years of expertise and a profound understanding of business think about how difficult it is to judge the competence and honesty of upper management one of warren buffett s many strengths is the ability to gauge others character he has been an investor for over 60 years and has thus read hundreds of financial statements and stockholders letters he also has experience in corporate management the ability to make decisions based on information that an average retail investor may overlook is a natural byproduct of absorbing this much data throughout a career and drawing on actual business experience the same holds for determining whether a company has a significant competitive edge once pointed out everyone can perceive a competitive advantage but spotting them beforehand is difficult 3 sometimes he makes investments based on emotion rather than logic even warren buffett is sometimes known to put his emotions above his intellect when investing not all of his investments are logical and devoid of emotion think about how much he likes coca cola coca cola is a remarkable example of stock market success but its stock has lagged behind the market for the last five years nevertheless buffett s berkshire hathaway owns around 400 million coca cola stocks or nearly 9 of the corporation 4 lack of research the oracle of omaha s narrow focus on the market significantly contributed to buffett s underperformance over the previous decade to put it another way buffett has a narrow investment emphasis mostly on financials and retail staples one positive result of warren buffett s narrowed emphasis is that he is an expert at finding value in those few industries he has made it clear that he believes bank equities to be the best long term investment opportunity for berkshire hathaway in the last ten years buffett has amassed over 10 of shares in financial institutions including bank of america and u s bancorp however buffett s reluctance to broaden his research to other industries may cause him to miss game changing startups some of the best performing firms so far this year in 2020 include cloud service providers and telemedicine companies because he lacks the time and motivation to keep up with clinical research and u s food and drug administration judgments buffett makes few if any healthcare investments equally avoided is a technology outside the scope of buffett s comprehension compared to the gains made in the technology and biotechnology sectors over the past decade buffett s bet on banks and consumer staples has been losing 5 often irrelevant in today s business world buffett s performance hasn t been up to par recently since his techniques of judging firms aren t necessarily relevant to today s corporations even though we live in an increasingly digital age buffett is used to appraising companies based on their physical assets it should be no surprise that buffett s appraisal approach often entails assessing a company s physical assets given that he is a devotee of banks and brand name corporations to determine if a firm is cheap buffett considers the value of its physical assets such as its property machinery and other equipment stocks and other items on the other hand some of the most successful it businesses of the last decade have had very few physical assets buffett s traditional method of analyzing a balance sheet is becoming more irrelevant as more and more companies move their operations online 6 investing in mutual funds and exchange traded funds will benefit you more it s no secret that warren buffett has an impressive track record of stock selection his berkshire hathaway is a massive conglomerate that has holdings in a broad variety of businesses and sectors however trying to invest in specific firms in hopes of outperforming the market as a whole is a fool s errand for the vast majority of individuals building a diversified stock portfolio is a time consuming process investing in a mutual or exchange traded fund may diversify your portfolio throughout the stock market without tracking the performance of individual stocks 7 he doesn t have much variety berkshire hathaway is a massive enterprise that has holdings in several different sectors but just a few enterprises make up the bulk of the company s assets investments in kraft wells fargo coca cola and ibm account for more than half of the firm s assets berkshire has about 40 invested in consumer goods and another 30 in the banking sector at the same time the corporation has just a little presence in critical sectors such as healthcare power and communication in a nutshell there is no shame in trying to copy warren buffett s success however should you make the same kind of investments as he did the odds are against that happening it is challenging to invest like warren buffett and a look at berkshire s portfolio suggests that the typical investor may not do well in mimicking the company instead continue learning from what he says and adapting it to your own life listening to buffett who has a history of sharing his insights may help ensure a

menafn jordan times london during the irish famine in the 1840s as more than one million irish citizens died vast quantities of food were exported from ireland to britain for the whig government in london the defence of commercial interests the dictates of laissez faire economics and political indifference to irish suffering trumped any obligation to prevent mass starvation by intervening in markets the international response to the covid 19 pandemic bears a discomfiting resemblance to the british response to the irish famine although science and industry have given us the means to immunise the world nine months after the first arm was jabbed with a covid 19 vaccine rich countries are using their market power to direct doses away from poor countries placing millions of lives at risk consider some recent actions by the european union under a contract with johnson johnson j j the bloc has imported millions of vaccine doses from a company in south africa a country where a mere 11 per cent of the population is vaccinated and the delta variant is fuelling a surge in cases yet efforts to divert vaccine exports from europe to south africa and its neighbours were met with a display of vaccine gunboat diplomacy with the eu threatening to take action under a clause in the j j contract prohibiting export restrictions the message to the world was clear while eu commissioners and political leaders may arrive at un meetings waxing lyrical about the importance of international cooperation and global vaccine equity the iron fist of vaccine nationalism is driving real world policy when it comes to weighing african lives against marginal gains in the health of already protected eu citizens africans come in a distant second former uk prime minister gordon brown recently highlighted the south africa example as a shocking symbol of global vaccine injustice he was right but the injustice is global in a world that has delivered more than five billion doses over 70 per cent of people in rich countries have now received at least one jab compared to only 1 8 per cent in the poorest countries this is an equity gap that kills we know that vaccinations provide effective protection against covid 19 deaths and hospitalisation as us president joe biden has reminded americans this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated the same is true globally nevertheless the united states and other rich countries are now preparing to deliver vaccine booster shots to already protected populations facing marginal health risks effectively diverting supplies from countries where access to vaccines is quite literally a matter of life and death the current distribution of vaccines is not just ethically indefensible it is also epidemiologically short sighted and economically ruinous leaving large swaths of the world unvaccinated increases the risk that vaccine resistant viral mutations will emerge effectively prolonging the pandemic and endangering people everywhere meanwhile expanding vaccinations would boost economic recovery adding 9 trillion to global output by 2025 according to an estimate by the international monetary fund and help prevent major reversals in poverty health and education basic arithmetic shows that we can vaccinate the world estimates by the data analytics firm airfinity suggest that around 12 billion vaccine doseswill be produced in 2021 with output doubling in 2022 that s more than enough to achieve the international target of 40 per cent coverage by the end of this year and 60 70 per cent by mid 2022 unfortunately it is not enough to achieve the targets while satisfying rich countries desire to hoard surplus stocks with their current contracts rich countries could achieve full vaccination coverage rates for over 80 per cent of their populations including boosters for vulnerable people and have a surplus of 3 5 billion doses according to the airfinity data enough to cover the deficit in poor countries and still leave rich countries with a healthy contingency reserve instead rich countries are actively undermining international cooperation efforts aid donors have invested 10 billion in the covid 19 vaccine global access covax facility the international program designed to provide vaccines to the world s poorest countries that financing has secured contracts for around two billion doses additionally the world bank has provided 4 billion for covax and an african union vaccine purchase initiative but covax and poor countries are constantly pushed to the back of the line for supplies from vaccine manufacturers for whom rich countries come first not least because of their governments threats to take legal action and impose penalties the pandemic has demonstrated that the world needs a more efficient and equitable distribution of vaccine production capabilities developing these capabilities will require knowledge sharing technology transfer intellectual property waivers and long term investment but without immediate and decisive action to replace the trickle down approach to vaccine provision with market redistribution john maynard keynes s dictum that in the long run we are all dead will have a tragic resonance there are three priorities first vaccine delivery must be aligned with the target of 40 per cent coverage in all countries by the end of this year rich countries must agree to adjust their own schedules so that vaccine manufacturers can make deliveries for covax and developing countries building surplus stocks in rich countries while allowing people to die for want of vaccines in poor countries is indefensible aid donors should also provide the additional 3 8 billion in grant financing needed to trigger covax options on an additional 760 million doses by the end of 2021 second to meet the international targets we need to move beyond intermittent vaccine donations to large scale coordinated dose sharing the eu the united kingdom and the us should immediately share an additional 250 million doses less than one quarter of their collective surplus through covax by the end of september with a clear schedule for providing an additional one billion doses by early 2022 third beyond vaccine equity there is an urgent need to strengthen health systems not just through the provision of medical oxygen which is in critically short supply therapeutics and diagnostic equipment but also by investing in the health workers and infrastructure needed to get vaccines into arms the current gap between funds pledged and funds allocated for this purpose is around 16 6 billion our ability to save lives restore hope and rebuild economies shattered by the pandemic is constrained not by a shortage of vaccines or financing but also by a deficit of justice and international cooperation the governments of rich countries often recite the mantra that no one is safe until everyone is safe their leaders must now act like they believe it kevin watkins a former

this content is brought to you by omba advisory investments having lived in south africa for most of my life and having worked in financial services for much of it i have been part of trying to time taking money out of south africa when the rand is strong and bringing it back when the rand is weak and i have seen the same attempts by investors but all of this changed when i realised that unless you are doing this to speculate on the rand value of your offshore investment it is a rather pointless exercise if you are truly externalising the capital for the long term should you not just avoid taking your rands out at ridiculously high historical levels or to not even worry at all if your intention is to speculate then good luck if it is to participate in global markets and diversify the location of your assets outside of south africa over the long term then it may not make too much difference keep in mind that south africa is only 0 5 of global equity markets as represented by the msci all country world index acwi keep in mind also that moving your money out of sa when the rand is strong does not necessarily mean it is a suitable time to enter the markets on the other side as the valuations may be weak and vice versa emerging market countries both their equity markets and currencies tend to perform well when global risk aversion is low and investors are allocating to riskier asset classes like equities or emerging market countries bonds and equities but do not take my word for it let us look at what the charts say keep in mind when investing you should always consider yourself as a global investor if you landed on earth with an amount in a currency what currency would you hold and in which markets would you invest as a sa resident foreign exchange controls are far lighter now than they were 20 years ago so it is quite easy to move money offshore recent developments in sa have also allowed investors to take us much as 45 of their retirement funds offshore and equity linked living annuities allow for 100 offshore chart a below shows the total incl divi returns of the jse alsi usd the msci world usd and the rand usd the return of the markets is on the right of the chart and the value of the rand usd is on the left chart a in the early 2000 s the world experienced a commodities super cycle like no other the rand appreciated by some 40 and the jse led by the jse resources 10 shot through the roof chart b below resources were approximately 20 25 of the jse back then becoming as much as 50 at the end of the cycle resources were a small part of global markets so global markets rose far less nearing the end of 2007 if you had perfect hindsight you would have started moving rands into usd and buying global markets over the subsequent 15 years the jse has tracked sideways while global markets have climbed steadily but at this time you were more limited by south african exchange controls chart b in 2008 the world experienced the global financial crisis and the jse fell back to pre commodity super cycle levels and the rand depreciated once more by some 60 global markets sold off far less because they had less commodities exposure recall the jse had around 50 commodity exposure at this time in crisis commodities take a huge hit especially from what would have been very stretched valuations during this time not many investors would have wanted to have moved into offshore markets with such a weak rand and market but if you had your usd returns globally over the next 13 years would have been far superior to local chart c below chart c during this period there was nothing separating local and global valuations chart d below which were both more attractive following the big sell off chart d 2012 to 2016 was a very trying time in south africa emerging markets tracked side ways jacob zuma had started to shake the tree government were scoring a number of political own goals and the rand continued to weaken on the back of it during this time the local markets moved in equilibrium with em while global markets continued to climb 2015 culminated with the collapse of the rand when nhlanhla nene was replaced by david van rooyen but do not be fooled that the shenanigans in sa were to blame for the rand s fall 2015 was very much also about the dollar reigning supreme on expectations of an interest rate rises expected from the federal reserve which impacted emerging markets oil and metals if at the time of the rand s demise if you had lost patience and taken your funds offshore and invested in global markets your result in usd over the subsequent 6 years would have been far better than keeping it local chart e below if i can also refer you back to the valuations chart d which shows that at this time sa equities were slightly more expensive than offshore equities chart e in 2017 the rand rallied to 12 much to investors surprise given the toxic climate in sa at the time emerging markets where strong and that is what counted it weakened thereafter alongside broad em despite jacob zuma being replaced by cyril ramaphosa as leader of the anc and government if at the time of its strength you had swapped rands for dollars and invested offshore you would have done better globally chart f below chart f enter 2020 and the covid pandemic when governments panicked emerging markets saw the largest outflows of capital on record and the rand along with all other emerging markets currencies and markets weakened significantly global markets in usd fell less protected by the currency once again who would have been brave enough to sell rands at this weak point chart g below shows that if you did your investment result over the last 2 years would have been better in the jse albeit over a truly brief time period chart g in conclusion what we have attempted to show is that whether the rand is weak or strong it is not necessarily a good or a bad time to invest offshore other factors such as valuations global macro considerations and your investment horizon should be taken into account investing offshore gives you access to a much bigger market than south africa with diversification across currencies countries and sectors the jse is very concentrated idiosyncratic risk to a number of larger stocks such as naspers bhp billiton british american tobacco and ab inbev furthermore emerging markets are exposed to a great deal of geo political and macro risk which makes for a bumpy ride for their currencies and markets the usd does add more stability and certainty to investing

menafn afp asian investors struggled tuesday to recover from the previous day s losses on growing fears over europe s worsening energy crisis china s economic slowdown and central bank efforts to contain surging inflation however the dollar lost some of its momentum against its major peers on profit taking with the euro finding some support ahead of an expected european central bank interest rate hike and sterling lifted by the election of a new prime minister russia s decision not to resume gas supplies to europe in retaliation for sanctions over ukraine sent shock waves through trading floors monday as it ramped up expectations of a painful recession in major economies european bourses took the brunt of the selling though they pared their earlier losses as commentators said the shutoff had been expected to come at some point with wall street closed for a holiday asia had few new catalysts to drive buying in early trade markets fluctuated between gains and losses with hong kong seoul and wellington down while shanghai sydney singapore taipei and jakarta edged up tokyo and manila were flat a lot of clients are asking have we seen the bottom yet and are we going into a global recession grace tam of bnp paribas wealth management hong kong told bloomberg television we do think the risk of a global recession especially next year is actually quite high and that the energy crisis is not fully priced into markets she said the next key event for investors is the ecb rate decision thursday with some observers tipping a 75 basis point hike to bring down record high inflation that is followed later in the month by the federal reserve s meeting where policymakers will debate a similar move which would be the third rise in a row however while central banks are lifting borrowing costs to fight surging prices they have little power over the cost of oil a key driver of the rises and on monday opec and other major producers announced a surprise cut in output sending both main contracts rising the move came after the crude market fell in recent months on demand fears caused by a possible recession in absolute terms the 100 000 barrels a day supply cut doesn t matter that much to global supply balances said noah barrett of janus henderson investors however in terms of signalling the move is important as it indicates that opec is watching demand very closely and is trying to manage supply to keep a floor on oil prices several countries including the united states had earlier called for a rise in production which was followed by a small lift of 100 000 barrels the modest increase we got a month ago is now gone so opec is clearly sending a message that they are not bowing to external demands said barrett we should expect continued volatility in oil prices with global demand indicators driving price movements brent and wti were both down from monday s levels key figures at around 0230 gmt tokyo nikkei 225 flat at 17 624 96 break hong kong hang seng index down 0 3 percent at 19177 54 shanghai composite up 0 4 percent at 3213 31 euro dollar up at 0 9960 from 0 9921 on monday dollar yen down at 140 40 yen from 140 53 yen pound dollar up at 1 1587 from 1 1507 euro pound down at 85 96 pence from 86 22 pence west texas intermediate down 1 0 percent at 88 54 per barrel brent north sea crude down 1 0 percent at 94 80 per barrel new york dow closed for public holiday london ftse 100 up 0 1 percent at 7 287 43 close
