financial markets reeled tuesday after vaccine maker moderna predicted the omicron variant would inflict a material drop in their covid 19 shots power and federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the viral strain could produce downside risks to in person work and supply chains moderna ceo stephane bancel speaking to the financial times said there is no world in which covid 19 vaccines are as effective against the variant discovered in south africa as they are against the delta variant that dominates now spooking wall street before trading even began i think it s going to be a material drop i just don t know how much because we need to wait for the data but all the scientists i ve talked to are like this is not going to be good mr bancel said offering a more dismal view than dr anthony fauci and other scientists who feel any decrease in vaccine effectiveness will not be grave the dow jones industrial average dropped over 650 points nearly 1 9 after mr powell told congress the fed might speed up its plan to pull back on monthly purchases of 120 billion in government backed securities a practice designed to support financial markets amid the pandemic he said the fed will debate in december whether to begin wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases which we actually announced at our november meeting perhaps a few months sooner mr powell said the central bank s thinking could change as they get more information about the omicron variant that s spread to multiple continents the recent rise in covid 19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation mr powell testified to the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions the s p 500 dropped 88 points or 1 9 and the nasdaq composite closed down 245 points or 1 5 financial markets went into a tizzy even as the white house told americans to take a deep breath and wait for scientists to pore over viral samples that should answer key questions around the omicron variant including whether it causes more severe disease some early patients in south africa did not suffer from severe illness and didn t lose their taste or smell though scientists cautioned they were on the younger side and the pandemic tends to inflict its worst damage on older adults be careful about bread crumbs they might not tell you what kind of loaf of bread you have dr fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases told a white house reporter who asked him to talk about what the early crumbs of data reveal michael mina an assistant professor of epidemiology at the harvard t h chan school of public health told the media to please stop repeating anecdotes that physicians have seen mild cases of omicron the vast majority of covid cases of all variants are mild the problem is a fraction are not and when cases pile up the fraction adds to a lot of hospitalization death and long covid he tweeted white house officials said there have been 205 known cases of omicron from 18 countries although not in the u s dutch officials on tuesday said they found the omicron variant in a sample collected on nov 19 indicating it was present in europe before it burst into view last week and countries put restrictions on air travel from south africa and surrounding nations rochelle walensky the director of the centers for disease control and prevention said it is collecting samples from all states and territories and so far 99 9 of all sequenced samples remain the delta variant that took over during the summer vaccine makers say it will take at least two weeks to assess how damaging omicron is to the shots dome of protection they are drafting plans to develop a booster shot that is specifically tailored to omicron but it would take at least three months to get it out the door and more time to manufacture it at scale in the meantime drugmakers and federal scientists say existing boosters should offer additional protection against the virus and its variants so there is no reason to wait for an omicron specific booster that might not materialize we re still waiting for more data but what remains true is that our best protection against the virus remains the vaccine people should get vaccinated and boosted at this point i m confident that our recovery remains strong treasury secretary janet yellen told lawmakers likewise pfizer ceo albert bourla tweeted the best hedge against omicron is to get fully vaccinated and boosted as recommended he said his company can make an omicron specific vaccine within 100 days mr bancel the chief of moderna said it would take several months to produce an omicron specific vaccine at scale his company is exploring whether a high dose of its existing booster shot suffices against omicron especially for seniors and the medically frail during a white house briefing dr fauci said covid 19 vaccines were built to target the ancestral strain from wuhan but the shots spur a big enough antibody response and trigger the immune system to suppress most variants you get a level so high that even if the mutations of various variants diminish that level of protection you are still within the range of some degree of protection dr fauci said and that s usually most manifested in protection against severe disease that leads to hospitalization we re hoping and i think with good reason to feel good that there will be some degree of protection he said markets don t like uncertainty however and the sour mood is infecting consumer confidence which dropped to its lowest level in nine months the consumer confidence index declined to 109 5 from 111 6 in october amid concerns about inflation the conference board a nonprofit that tracks the metric said tuesday the expectations index that takes stock of how consumers feel about income business and employment conditions in the near term also fell to 87 6 from 89 mr powell said the fed will have to monitor a variety of factors as it decides what to do about inflation and whether omicron poses a major threat it s really about transmissibility the ability of existing vaccines to address any new variant and it s about the severity of the disease once it s contracted he told lawmakers experts say they ll know quite a bit about those answers within about a month we ll know something though within a week or 10 days and then and only then can we make an assessment of what the impact would be on the economy mr powell testified for now it s a risk it s a risk to the baseline it s not really baked into our forecast for more information visit the washington times covid 19 resource page tom howell jr can be reached at thowell washingtontimes com
by chris isidore cnn business just when us airlines thought they were on the verge of profitability again along came the omicron variant to put those hopes in doubt leisure travel is back to near pre covid levels this thanksgiving marked the busiest week for air travel since the start of the pandemic but major us airlines had been counting on a return of their most lucrative revenue sources business and international passengers the emergence of the omicron variant could put those passengers on hold according to experts i think the year end holiday travel is booked and will go forward but the plans for international travel and business travel i would imagine there will be a wait and see attitude on those said philip baggaley chief credit analyst for airlines at standard poor s business travel has remained a fraction of its pre pandemic level partly because many offices remain closed or have limited staffing that had been expected to turn around in january with many major employers announcing return to office plans for after the holidays airline analysts worry that the uncertainty about omicron and the overall rise in covid cases could delay those reopening plans if offices are delaying reopening there is less reason for business travel said j p gownder an analyst at forrester gownder said that it s too soon for many businesses to have made a decision to delay the reopening but the rise in new us cases as the weather has turned colder and people have moved inside has already prompted some delays most prominently by apple which is reported to have pushed back its return to office plans from early january to february even before the news of the omicron variant gownder said the decision on having workers in the office will be a moving target for most major companies microsoft had some good language it said our ability to be together in person will wax and wane he said many public health officials say it will take a couple of weeks to know the threat posed by omicron while there are no confirmed us cases of the variant yet almost all experts believe it will find its way here if it s not here already gownder said the risk posed by the variant and the decision on when to reopen offices will depend upon how resistant to existing vaccines the omicron variant turns out to be whether it becomes common and whether it causes an increase in hospitalizations and deaths the truth is it s too early to know what the impact is going to be he said so far so steady but that uncertainty is not working in the airlines favor when it comes to travel plans going forward unknowns by themselves are bad news baggaley said data from adobe show that us airline bookings are little changed so far in the days since the omicron variant was disclosed the four major airlines said they could not detail any changes in their plans or expectations at this point other than that they will comply with new rules restricting travel for those who have been in south africa or seven other african countries to only us citizens legal permanent us residents and their spouses but investors are running away from airline stocks shares of the nyse arca airline index fell 6 5 in trading friday and was only narrowly higher in monday trading as other us stock indexes enjoyed more solid rebounds shares of the index fell again in morning trading tuesday omicron will likely lead to a decline in bookings but that decline should be short lived predicted helane becker airline analyst with cowen in the past year each new variant has brought a decline in bookings but then an increase once the surge dissipates becker said in a note to clients monday she expects the same will occur this time as people begin to accept that we will have to learn to live with this indefinitely numerous countries besides the united states have placed restrictions on travel from south africa and nearby countries as cases rise those kinds of travel restrictions are likely to spread even if the variant is likely to be found worldwide in short order i think you will see a patchwork of poorly executed travel bans said gownder and there s a certain stickiness to those kinds of travel bans that would be particularly bad news for the nation s three largest airlines united american and delta all of which depended greatly on international travelers before the pandemic started all had been counting on a strong rebound in international travel in 2022 mainly thanks to pent up demand united had been planning for its international business in 2022 to be above the levels it achieved in 2019 international travel is most vulnerable said baggaley governments are going to react more quickly than they have in the past with travel bans politicians are afraid of being second guessed if they don t act the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

for the sake of argument as a gedankenexperiment i assume that the benign picture from south africa holds up over the winter and that we will land at the optimistic end of the goldman spectrum the picture for markets is bad in the immediate sense that jumpy snake bitten governments will shutter parts of the economy as a precaution cross border travel is already paralysed but i doubt it will last long and it is in any case a small fraction of global gdp in other respects business has learned to cope brilliantly with the pandemic it is good to the extent that it brings this ordeal to a rapid climax and pulls forward the day when we can dismantle the suffocating architecture of perma testing flight curbs vaccine passports forced isolation and state intrusion in people s lives scientists will know in a couple of weeks whether omicron has a lower case fatality rate than delta they flag two obvious grounds for caution viral infections tend to start with mild disease and past waves show that young people tend to catch covid first before it spreads up the age ladder the original cohort of patients breezing through surgeries in johannesburg with little more than a headache may be a trick of the time sequence scientists will know in a couple of weeks whether omicron has a lower case fatality rate than delta credit ap should the benign scenario prevail it will turbo charge global economic growth and set off another leg of the commodity boom probably pushing stock market indices to even frothier levels you would not want to be in us treasuries gilts or bunds loading remember that the atlanta fed s instant tracker of us growth is running at 8 6 per cent for the fourth quarter and the fed is still adding its coup de whisky with us105 billion 148 billion a month of quantitative easing china s economy touched bottom last month after a recession unacknowledged and the regime had begun to crank up credit again just before omicron hit goldman sachs thinks global inflation will fall faster in its upside scenario because spending will shift from goods back to services alleviating supply chain blockages this reflects the new keynesian orthodoxy of central banks that shortages are causing the surge in prices heaven forfend that it should be the result of their own money creation critics say the fed conflates symptoms with cause overlooking the deeper monetary roots of us inflation now running at a 30 year high of 6 2 per cent i will happily take the other side of the goldman trade willing to bet that a faster global recovery would keep inflation bubbling and force central banks to tighten harder than they dare admit or markets expect note that professor raghuram rajan ex governor of the reserve bank of india and now at chicago university has come close to accusing the fed of losing the plot in a recent piece for project syndicate warning that the institution has embarked on a structural inflation policy that is going to end badly my presumption is that the dam will break across the world rapidly if omicron proves to be as mild as it looks and wins the transmission contest against delta he said the powell fed is stuck in a psychological time warp still fighting the last war from the era of secular stagnation and furthermore that it is a political hostage to a congress on a fiscal rampage in the past the current levels of inflation would have prompted them to square their shoulders look determinedly into the tv cameras and say we hate inflation and we will kill it but now they are more likely to make excuses he said the implication is that overheating in the world s paramount economy the anchor of dollarised international finance is likely to be a bigger issue over the next year than anything covid 19 throws at markets a benign omicron outcome reshuffles the political debate and splits the world into different camps those countries such as the uk the us mexico brazil or india inclined to live with the virus will return to normal very fast at the other extreme china is trapped by zero covid ideology and two years of state propaganda extolling the country s superiority over the west for having successfully bottled up the virus china has scant natural immunity and prefers not to put its semi defective vaccines to public test goldman sachs has outlined four scenarios for markets after the discovery of the omicron variant credit ap the chinese centre for disease control and prevention published a report this week warning that infections could top 630 000 a day if the country opens up this document should be read as a statement that china aims to tough it out with zero tolerance but xi jinping cannot dodge the issue he faces the invidious choice of hermetically sealed isolation for years or accepting what the report called the real possibility of a colossal outbreak which would almost certainly put intolerable stain on the medical system loading if we can cope with the delta variant we can also cope with omicron says a breezy zhang wenhong china s covid guru fine but is zero covid a rational policy against a milder variant is it politically tenable at a time when korea singapore and others are switching to controlled endemic spread europe is in a quandary delta is pushing hospital systems to the brink in germany austria holland and most of central europe with france catching up as its vaccine immunity wanes with a lag harsh measures are needed yet a milder omicron variant would call for the opposite policy in quick succession those states still pursuing suppression strategies to varying degrees may find it ever harder to justify coercive action risking gilets jaunes movements of spontaneous dissent it is arguable that austria s policy of forced vaccination soon to be copied by a string of neighbours is already a violation of the european convention on human rights as are discriminatory lockdowns for the unjabbed

david nash is the founding dean emeritus and dr raymond c and doris n grandon professor of health policy at the jefferson college of population health he is a board certified internist follow what constitutes conflict of interest coi for physicians in general coi exists in a situation where a person is or appears to be at risk of acting in a biased way because of personal interest physicians who engage in paid consulting and speaking arrangements who conduct research studies to help develop new pharmaceuticals or medical devices who invest in biotechnology companies or who own testing facilities or treatment centers that provide healthcare services may do so to improve patient care however these activities come under scrutiny when physicians benefit financially even when they take care to avoid it physicians judgments and actions may be influenced by coi in subtle ways monetary payments from pharmaceutical companies may affect how physicians report results of research studies what they teach residents about particular drugs or what treatments they recommend for patients those who own or invest in treatment centers may give preference to these facilities when referring patients for care thus benefiting financially on the flip side relationships between physicians and other entities are not all bad they actually have value in terms of physician education and new drug and medical device development the most common way of averting problems is for physicians to clearly state their relationships with all individuals companies or organizations transparency about coi allows healthcare institutions patients and the public to judge whether a particular relationship may be influencing a physician s actions to that end there are multiple public reporting programs listing payments physicians received from pharmaceutical and medical device companies and many medical centers provide information on their websites about staff physicians coi why has coi become an important issue during the lazy days of summer dozens of physicians from some of boston s prestigious harvard affiliated hospitals signed a petition aimed at prohibiting hospital ceos from working on corporate boards extracurricular activities that may earn them millions of dollars but also create serious cois what set off the coi tempest in boston a boston globe investigative report found that boston hospital ceos hold exceptionally lucrative board positions in publicly traded companies at a much higher rate than other major u s cities according to the globe report five of seven ceos and presidents of boston s major teaching hospitals also receive compensation for serving on boards of publicly traded companies often in the form of company stock potentially worth millions of dollars this isn t considered illegal but it doesn t necessarily appear ethical the globe report shed light on these cozy relationships and the potential coi and ethics issues they raise for instance a former ceo of boston children s hospital who was paid 2 7 million annually also held a seat on the board of a for profit telehealth company and lobbied massachusetts legislators for telehealth funding at the start of the pandemic upon retiring from the ceo position in 2021 the estimated worth of this individual s company stock compensation for work on the board was 8 8 million in july 2020 the brigham and women s hospital president resigned from the board of biotech company moderna to alleviate any potential concern about the conduct of the outcomes of the covid 19 vaccine trial when the hospital was identified by nih as a clinical site for the phase iii trial in march 2021 this individual stepped down as hospital president and a mere 10 days later rejoined the moderna board readers who are

biotech company boards over the years i have worked hard to assiduously avoid any cois in addition to completing an annual coi review i have always believed that sunshine is the best disinfectant disclosure of all possible conflicts is the best policy there are no easy answers here but the path forward is pretty clear declaring a coi is only the first step constant vigilance is essential and it is vitally important that the most senior leaders set the appropriate tone it shouldn t take a petition from physicians and medical students to call attention to this issue healthcare organizations and physician leaders must put real effort into preserving industry relationships that advance innovation and human health while ensuring that these relationships do not put individual and

already unnerved by the newest coronavirus variant wall street deepened its losses tuesday after the head of the federal reserve said the central bank will consider shutting off its support for financial markets sooner than expected the standard poor s 500 index fell 1 9 erasing its gains from a day earlier the sell off accelerated after fed chair jerome h powell told congress the central bank may halt the billions of dollars of bond purchases it s making every month perhaps a few months sooner it had been on pace to wrap up the purchases meant to goose the economy by lowering rates for mortgages and other long term loans in june advertisement an end to the purchases would open the door for the fed to raise short term interest rates from their record low near zero that in turn would dilute a major propellant that has sent stocks to record heights and swatted away concerns about an overly pricey market as investors moved up their expectations for the fed s first rate increase after powell s remarks yields on short term treasurys rose losses for stocks mounted quickly with the drop for the dow jones industrial average more than tripling in half an hour as it sank 711 points the blue chip index ended down 652 22 points or 1 9 at 34 483 72 the nasdaq composite held up slightly better than the rest of the market shedding 245 14 points or 1 6 to close at 15 537 69 higher interest rates tend to hurt stock prices broadly but they hit hardest those seen as the most expensive or those banking on big profit growth the furthest in the future such companies play a bigger role in the nasdaq than in other indexes microsoft fell 1 8 and chipmaker nvidia slid 2 1 the whammy on interest rates came after stocks were already weak in the morning because of concerns about how badly the fast spreading omicron variant of the coronavirus may hit the global economy the chief executive of moderna predicted in an interview with the financial times that existing covid 19 vaccines may be less effective with omicron than earlier variants regeneron also said tuesday that its monoclonal antibody treatment may have reduced effectiveness on omicron moderna fell 4 4 regeneron dropped 2 7 much is left to be determined about the variant including how much it may slow already gummed up supply chains or scare people away from stores that uncertainty has sent wall street through up and down jolts as investors struggle to handicap how much economic damage omicron will ultimately do advertisement there will be heightened volatility around any piece of information said kristina hooper chief global market strategist at invesco she said markets will probably remain cautious before we know more the s p 500 dropped 88 27 points to 4 567 the benchmark index sank 2 3 on friday for its worst loss since february only to rise 1 3 on monday as investors reconsidered whether the reaction was overdone before giving way to tuesday s loss the index closed out november with a 0 8 loss that follows a 6 9 gain in october and a 4 8 drop in september the index is now up 21 6 for the year one measure of nervousness in the stock market jumped almost 19 on tuesday nearing its level from friday when it touched its highest point since march much of the rise occurred after powell began speaking gold usually does well when fear among investors is rising but its price slipped 0 5 higher interest rates could reduce the appeal of gold which doesn t pay its holders any interest object preview crude oil prices slid with concerns that a global economy weakened by omicron would burn less fuel benchmark u s crude dropped 5 4 and touched its lowest level in three months brent crude the international standard fell 3 9 if omicron ultimately does heavy damage to the global economy it could put the federal reserve in a difficult spot usually the central bank will lower interest rates which encourages borrowers to spend more and investors to pay higher prices for stocks advertisement but low rates can also encourage inflation which is already high across the global economy powell acknowledged in his testimony before congress that inflation has been worse and lasted longer than the fed expected for months officials described inflation as only transitory but powell said that word no longer works the subsequent losses for stocks tuesday were widespread with all but seven stocks in the s p 500 ending lower apple rose 3 2 for the biggest gain in the index smaller stocks also took heavy losses the russell 2000 index slid 43 07 points or 1 9 to 2 198 91 investors typically see them getting hurt more than their larger rivals by both higher interest rates and a weaker u s economy one signal in the bond market was also flashing some concern about the economy s prospects longer term treasurys usually offer higher yields than shorter term treasurys in part to make up for the increased risk that future inflation may eat into their returns a 10 year treasury is still offering more in yield than a two year treasury but the gap narrowed sharply tuesday the two year yield rose to 0 54 from 0 51 late monday the 10 year yield meanwhile fell to 1 45 from 1 52 many investors see that narrowed gap as meaning the bond market has less confidence in the economy s long term strength if it were to flip with short term yields rising above long term yields many investors would see that as a semi reliable predictor of a recession advertisement associated press writer alex veiga contributed to this report
the renewable energy producer is targeting high end dividend growth over the next five years clearway energy cwen 2 94 cwen a 2 88 is one of the largest renewable energy producers in the u s those assets generate lots of clean energy for the power grid and cash flow for clearway s investors the company currently pays out the bulk of that money via its dividend which yields 3 6 that s more than double the s p 500 s yield of 1 25 what makes that dividend even more attractive is its growth potential the company recently set its sights higher which could power big time total returns for investors in the coming years delivering despite a major headwind clearway energy restarted its dividend growth engine last year the company has increased its payout each quarter since last june growing it by nearly 7 over the past year including 1 6 in the most recent quarter that achieved its goal of delivering dividend growth at the upper end of its 5 to 8 long term target range the company delivered that higher end growth despite a major headwind to start the year the winter storms across texas in february impacted its cash flow by about 30 million however the company offset that issue thanks partly to closing on the acquisition of another 35 interest in the agua caliente solar farm in the first quarter that deal boosted its stake to 51 and allowed it to remain on track with its full year guidance for cash available for distribution of 325 million meanwhile the company also made lots of progress on its strategic growth plan it signed new contracts for two of its natural gas power plants selling 80 and 100 of their capacity respectively through 2026 it also agreed to acquire a 50 interest in a portfolio of solar energy projects in utah and decided to sell its thermal business to a private equity fund these deals set it up for continued growth in the coming years setting its sights higher clearway energy s strategic successes in 2021 have bolstered its confidence in its ability to grow the dividend in the future it s now targeting dividend growth at the upper end of its 5 to 8 range through 2026 that higher target sets the company up to potentially deliver higher total returns in the coming years several factors are driving the company to sight its sights higher one major catalyst is the sale of its thermal assets for 1 9 billion or 1 3 billion in net cash after repaying the associated debt the company plans to use about 620 million of those funds to close its utah solar acquisition and its committed drop down investments from its parent clearway energy group ceg that will leave it with about 680 million of capital to deploy on future opportunities it has already identified several potential investment opportunities thanks to its relationship with ceg its parent currently has over 1 9 gigawatts gw of late stage development projects that clearway could fund through 2024 meanwhile ceg has a larger long term development pipeline of more than 17 gw of projects in addition to its relationship with ceg clearway can continue to pursue third party acquisitions the company has made several such deals including buying the mt storm wind farm in west virginia from castleton commodities international in april and another 35 interest in the agua caliente from nrg energy nrg 0 89 with renewable energy project developers and utilities needing capital to fund new investments clearway should have plenty of opportunities to acquire renewable energy assets from third party owners a powerful dividend growth stock clearway energy delivered high end dividend growth this year despite some headwinds thanks to the success of its strategic expansion plan it now believes it can continue growing its dividend toward the upper end of its long term target range through 2026 that sets investors up to capture a growing stream of renewable powered income over the next several years making clearway stand out as an excellent buy for dividend seekers
for the sake of argument as a gedankenexperiment i assume that the benign picture from south africa holds up over the winter and that we will land at the optimistic end of the goldman spectrum the picture for markets is bad in the immediate sense that jumpy snake bitten governments will shutter parts of the economy as a precaution cross border travel is already paralysed but i doubt it will last long and it is in any case a small fraction of global gdp in other respects business has learned to cope brilliantly with the pandemic it is good to the extent that it brings this ordeal to a rapid climax and pulls forward the day when we can dismantle the suffocating architecture of perma testing flight curbs vaccine passports forced isolation and state intrusion in people s lives scientists will know in a couple of weeks whether omicron has a lower case fatality rate than delta they flag two obvious grounds for caution viral infections tend to start with mild disease and past waves show that young people tend to catch covid first before it spreads up the age ladder the original cohort of patients breezing through surgeries in johannesburg with little more than a headache may be a trick of the time sequence scientists will know in a couple of weeks whether omicron has a lower case fatality rate than delta credit ap should the benign scenario prevail it will turbo charge global economic growth and set off another leg of the commodity boom probably pushing stock market indices to even frothier levels you would not want to be in us treasuries gilts or bunds loading remember that the atlanta fed s instant tracker of us growth is running at 8 6 per cent for the fourth quarter and the fed is still adding its coup de whisky with us105 billion 148 billion a month of quantitative easing china s economy touched bottom last month after a recession unacknowledged and the regime had begun to crank up credit again just before omicron hit goldman sachs thinks global inflation will fall faster in its upside scenario because spending will shift from goods back to services alleviating supply chain blockages this reflects the new keynesian orthodoxy of central banks that shortages are causing the surge in prices heaven forfend that it should be the result of their own money creation critics say the fed conflates symptoms with cause overlooking the deeper monetary roots of us inflation now running at a 30 year high of 6 2 per cent i will happily take the other side of the goldman trade willing to bet that a faster global recovery would keep inflation bubbling and force central banks to tighten harder than they dare admit or markets expect note that professor raghuram rajan ex governor of the reserve bank of india and now at chicago university has come close to accusing the fed of losing the plot in a recent piece for project syndicate warning that the institution has embarked on a structural inflation policy that is going to end badly my presumption is that the dam will break across the world rapidly if omicron proves to be as mild as it looks and wins the transmission contest against delta he said the powell fed is stuck in a psychological time warp still fighting the last war from the era of secular stagnation and furthermore that it is a political hostage to a congress on a fiscal rampage in the past the current levels of inflation would have prompted them to square their shoulders look determinedly into the tv cameras and say we hate inflation and we will kill it but now they are more likely to make excuses he said the implication is that overheating in the world s paramount economy the anchor of dollarised international finance is likely to be a bigger issue over the next year than anything covid 19 throws at markets a benign omicron outcome reshuffles the political debate and splits the world into different camps those countries such as the uk the us mexico brazil or india inclined to live with the virus will return to normal very fast at the other extreme china is trapped by zero covid ideology and two years of state propaganda extolling the country s superiority over the west for having successfully bottled up the virus china has scant natural immunity and prefers not to put its semi defective vaccines to public test goldman sachs has outlined four scenarios for markets after the discovery of the omicron variant credit ap the chinese centre for disease control and prevention published a report this week warning that infections could top 630 000 a day if the country opens up this document should be read as a statement that china aims to tough it out with zero tolerance but xi jinping cannot dodge the issue he faces the invidious choice of hermetically sealed isolation for years or accepting what the report called the real possibility of a colossal outbreak which would almost certainly put intolerable stain on the medical system loading if we can cope with the delta variant we can also cope with omicron says a breezy zhang wenhong china s covid guru fine but is zero covid a rational policy against a milder variant is it politically tenable at a time when korea singapore and others are switching to controlled endemic spread europe is in a quandary delta is pushing hospital systems to the brink in germany austria holland and most of central europe with france catching up as its vaccine immunity wanes with a lag harsh measures are needed yet a milder omicron variant would call for the opposite policy in quick succession those states still pursuing suppression strategies to varying degrees may find it ever harder to justify coercive action risking gilets jaunes movements of spontaneous dissent it is arguable that austria s policy of forced vaccination soon to be copied by a string of neighbours is already a violation of the european convention on human rights as are discriminatory lockdowns for the unjabbed
shang chi and the legend of the ten rings star simu liu talks about his favorite skit from his gig hosting saturday night live snl and his struggle with imposter syndrome even as one of marvel s most successful leads in an exclusive interview with nextshark warning minor spoilers ahead liu has had an exhausting weekend after hosting snl on nov 20 he prepared for the home release of shang chi and was carted off to ring in thanksgiving with big bird and ji young for sesame street as we discussed snl his recent marvel movie and his life trajectory after appearing in memes and skyrocketing to internet fame he welcomed every question with a smile battle with bowen liu shared that although there were many memorable skits the one he did with cast member bowen yang parodying the mad rush to award asians for being the first to do anything was the stand out without question it s the bowen versus simu not to be the exact thing that we re making fun of but i think it s historic he said with a laugh i think it s actually the first time that an asian centric skit has ever existed on snl and it s momentous written by various snl writers including korean canadian comedian celeste yim the sketch about first asian titles was so vividly and unapologetically asian american according to liu it featured contributions from both yang and yim who the shang chi star said he considers amazing talents when liu first received an offer to host the show he looked forward to the opportunity to represent asians within the comedy world and to affect the conversations that would come out of it liu noted that the skit was made even more relevant for the fact that yang is a trailblazer in his own right as the first asian cast member on the show while we both laughed at the ridiculous nature of the skit and how nextshark may also be guilty of sometimes over excitedly posting first asian headlines liu explained that it s important for publications to continue that push it s also because we are still at a point where we re getting a lot of firsts that are happening he continued part of the progress that we need to make as a community is getting to a point where there are no more firsts left to celebrate i m really excited for us to get there unfortunately maybe the headlines won t be as clickbait y but that s ok the love behind shang chi one of the major themes behind shang chi is succession and how the ten rings will advance their empire between prolific actors tony leung hero michelle yeoh crouching tiger hidden dragon yuen wah kung fu hustle and emerging talents arnold sun as teen shang chi and jayden zhang as young shang chi the cast itself passes the torch it was very intimidating these guys are absolute legends in their own right and first of all we were so incredibly honored and humbled to even be considered that they would even consider us liu said on top of working with asian acting and martial arts veterans the shang chi star found himself in a situation where the never meet your heroes adage didn t apply described as down to earth and approachable and even goofy liu only had great things to say about leung and yeoh who played his onscreen father and aunt you think about hollywood a listers or you think about show business and you think egos you think divas you think big entourages and it just could not have been further from what the reality was he recalled fondly it was just these two it just felt like my auntie and my uncle they were just so wonderful and warm and kind and generous and michelle just such a goof she was just dancing in between takes and being fun it truly was the best return of the stock photo master with liu s addition to phase four of the marvel cinematic universe it s safe to say that he will be solidified further into his role as marvel s first asian lead ready to continue fighting otherworldly evils but to those unfamiliar with liu before shang chi hit cinemas he was known for regularly going viral for his tweets after all that s how he landed the marvel role from his evolution as the master of almost breaking my neck to kung fu master and from garbage boy awkwafina is nora from queens to bus boy liu s jump from memes to master was an unexpected one he shared that he faces insecurity as someone who didn t study at a traditional theater school or come from a film school background it s certainly been a process i ve been a master of a lot of things none of them anything useful i ve been a master of stock photos i ve been a master of working the car rental desk at handy car rental he said i think i ve proven so much to just myself and how much i m able to really commit to a role and really do it although he s still struggling with feeling like an imposter and trying to fit in he acknowledges that he and the shang chi cast flew to sydney to shoot a record breaking movie which the world showed up to see we ended our interview with liu by offering him some well deserved gochujang shrimp crackers which he excitedly reached for with both hands shang chi and the legend of the ten rings first became available to watch on all major digital platforms on nov

yes it s true it s always the thought that counts but if you re still last minute christmas shopping there s one gift that will do more than just the thought charities have certainly been hit hard this year and christmas is a perfect time to donate donate donate here are some simple ways to give back this christmas even during a pandemic the new york times suggests donating with qr codes not coins to keep things covid safe and simple you can scan your smartphone rather than dropping money into the money part women and home says if you re intimidated or having doubts you can t go wrong any charity you donate your money or time to this festive season is absolutely worthwhile help guide recommends donating to an organization that s making a difference to your health during the pandemic some examples include hospitals and health centers or local charities that provide housing financial assistance or food virtual volunteering does exist wild apricot reminds you to join an online volunteer organization like teaching or even bring a furry isolation friend home for adoption the new york times says be in it for the long haul donating is a marathon not a sprint so it s important to remember the need will remain for longer than you think advertisement supply chain problems hit charities holiday gifts for kids share copy link copy with less than four weeks to go until christmas kristyn begari has been rushing to find enough doll styling heads to give to kids in need but the purchasing coordinator for the california based nonprofit family giving tree says it s been difficult to find them or racially diverse barbies or disney princess dolls others charities who give to kids during the holidays say they re also facing challenges finding enough gaming consoles laptops and other electronic items amid the global shortage of chips used in cars phones and other devices i ve never seen something like this begari said our biggest fear is we re not going to get the quality of gifts that we want or we re not going to have enough in general attempting to grant thousands of holiday wish requests has always been challenging for begari but it s been downright miserable this year as the global supply chain bottlenecks create shortages on many items making it difficult to grant many holiday wishes for the 34 000 children and adults the organization expects to aid in the bay area this holiday season some wholesale vendors have already informed her that purchases will not arrive giving her the option of getting a refund or buying another item if a child doesn t get their preferred gift she said the organization will attempt to grant their second wish or find another replacement item similar worries are being felt across the country as covid related supply chain snafus produced by clogged u s ports a lack of workers to move the cargo and skyrocketing shipping costs lead to empty store shelves and higher prices on some products the supply chain slowdown is one of the main reasons why donations of new toys to the toy foundation have declined by nearly 80 in dollar value this year compared to 2019 according to pamela mastrota the executive director of the group which was formed by a toy industry trade association to act as an industry wide charitable collective for manufacturers the lack of trade shows due to the covid 19 pandemic also put a wrench in their collection efforts for the second year in a row straining their ability to get gifts for sick impoverished or other vulnerable children who are in need it s been a real challenge this year and last year mastrota said but this year especially mastrota s only hope now is if more toys are donated quickly but such donations might further stress the profit margins of manufacturers who are facing high shipping costs and pressure to pass on increased costs to consumers jim silver ceo of toys tots pets more a toy industry review website says charities are bound to see less toy donations from manufacturers this holiday season because many containers holding their products are stuck at u s ports which have been experiencing record volumes of shipping containers as the economy recovers from the pandemic there is going to be a shortage he said without a doubt last month president joe biden announced plans to establish around the clock operation at the port of los angeles the nation s largest to tamp down the inflation being caused by ships waiting to dock and a shortage of truck drivers to haul goods port officials have said some of the bottleneck has since eased but experts note it will take a long time before things get back to normal silver notes small and mid size manufacturers who largely produce toys in countries like china are feeling squeezed by the supply chain problems more than larger ones however the disruption is also being felt at mga entertainment the american toy giant which makes bratz and l o l surprise dolls isaac larian the company s ceo says they ve only been able to meet 70 of the demand for items because the company is waiting for hundreds of containers full of toys to clear the california ports these goods are not going to make it to christmas larian said and the toys that are in stores now cost 23 higher than they did last year he noted his advice for anyone looking to get a toy is simple shop now despite an earlier planning process many gift requests for gaming systems and other items submitted to one simple wish have been out of stock or are facing major shipping delays said daniella gletow the founder of the organization which works with social service agencies across the country to facilitate holiday wishes anyone can grant for children in need that s obviously holding up our ability to make sure that we re going to be able to fulfill all these needs in time for the holidays gletow said because our goal is to get everything out by the week before christmas to avoid further delays she says the organization is encouraging donors to grant wishes earlier than they have in prior years toys for tots the nation s most well known toy donation drive run by the united states marine corps reserve is not expecting shortages said david cooper the organization s vice president of operations he said the organization purchased about 16 5 million worth of toys this spring to mitigate any impact supply chain issues might have on donations there are concerns more families might register to receive toys from them this year due to higher costs however a toys for tots spokesperson says early indicators for their holiday collection efforts point in a positive direction some of their donations in the past have gone towards the salvation army s angel tree program which also collects gifts for children and families in need during the holidays the organization estimates about 5 million gifts are donated each year though the program though this year kenneth hodder salvation army s commissioner says there are concerns many kids might not receive their gifts on time we are encouraging everyone who has generously supported us in the past and who would like to do so again this year to shop early and to get those toys to us as quickly as they can he said at the christian relief charity samaritan s purse the concerns center around shipping delays david thompson the senior director for the international portion of the group s operation christmas child project says the organization is aiming to send 9 7 million shoeboxes filled with christian materials and gifts to children in more than 100 countries but a shortage of truckers delivery equipment and other factors have slowed things down we have to be flexible thompson said but our in country teams volunteers and logistical networks

photo credit seroma72 shutterstock the release of updated consumer price index data in november provided new evidence that the u s economy is in an inflationary period the cpi rose by 6 2 from october 2020 to october 2021 the highest annual rate in three decades rising costs have shown up in many sectors of the economy including energy transportation and food but perhaps the most worrying increase is in the cost of housing price increases in the housing market have been one of the major stories of the economy since the start of the pandemic in the residential real estate market the median sales price for a home in the u s has grown by around 20 over the last 12 months for renters the median rent has increased by 16 since the beginning of 2021 one of the key factors behind rising housing costs has been insufficient supply in the summer of 2020 the inventory of homes for sale fell to all time lows and while inventory of existing homes has since rebounded to pre pandemic levels new construction is not keeping up with demand supply chain challenges have made many materials harder to find or more expensive and many construction businesses are still struggling to fill jobs as a result new housing starts are up but completions have not kept pace but while the pandemic has put additional pressure on the housing market supply was already too low in many areas to keep up with population growth and consumer demand the federal home loan mortgage corporation estimated in 2018 that the u s had a housing deficit of 2 5 million units part of the challenge in increasing supply is density a strong majority of consumers prefer living in single family homes rather than multi unit buildings and zoning regulations in many localities restrict higher density development builders have responded to these factors by building more single family units with the number of new single family homes authorized more than doubling over the last decade from around 418 000 in 2011 to 979 000 in 2020 but one downside is that single family housing is less efficient for increasing supply than structures with more units especially in cities that are already more densely populated many states and localities with severe housing shortages are now loosening their zoning regulations to alleviate these issues the inability for housing stock to keep pace with growth is most troubling in areas where growth is occurring fastest parts of the country that are experiencing strong economic growth have attracted more residents who come seeking jobs and other opportunities whenever population growth happens more quickly than new housing becomes available supply and affordability challenges become a greater issue one of the places where these problems have become a major issue is california while the state has added millions of jobs in recent decades due to fast growing industries like technology the growth of new housing lags behind california now is among the most expensive states for housing in the country and its rate of population growth has been slowing as people move away or seek out locations with lower cost of living elsewhere california is just one of a number of states

financial markets reeled tuesday after vaccine maker moderna predicted the omicron variant would inflict a material drop in their covid 19 shots power and federal reserve chairman jerome powell said the viral strain could produce downside risks to in person work and supply chains moderna ceo stephane bancel speaking to the financial times said there is no world in which covid 19 vaccines are as effective against the variant discovered in south africa as they are against the delta variant that dominates now spooking wall street before trading even began i think it s going to be a material drop i just don t know how much because we need to wait for the data but all the scientists i ve talked to are like this is not going to be good mr bancel said offering a more dismal view than dr anthony fauci and other scientists who feel any decrease in vaccine effectiveness will not be grave the dow jones industrial average dropped over 650 points nearly 1 9 after mr powell told congress the fed might speed up its plan to pull back on monthly purchases of 120 billion in government backed securities a practice designed to support financial markets amid the pandemic he said the fed will debate in december whether to begin wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases which we actually announced at our november meeting perhaps a few months sooner mr powell said the central bank s thinking could change as they get more information about the omicron variant that s spread to multiple continents the recent rise in covid 19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation mr powell testified to the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions the s p 500 dropped 88 points or 1 9 and the nasdaq composite closed down 245 points or 1 5 financial markets went into a tizzy even as the white house told americans to take a deep breath and wait for scientists to pore over viral samples that should answer key questions around the omicron variant including whether it causes more severe disease some early patients in south africa did not suffer from severe illness and didn t lose their taste or smell though scientists cautioned they were on the younger side and the pandemic tends to inflict its worst damage on older adults be careful about bread crumbs they might not tell you what kind of loaf of bread you have dr fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases told a white house reporter who asked him to talk about what the early crumbs of data reveal michael mina an assistant professor of epidemiology at the harvard t h chan school of public health told the media to please stop repeating anecdotes that physicians have seen mild cases of omicron the vast majority of covid cases of all variants are mild the problem is a fraction are not and when cases pile up the fraction adds to a lot of hospitalization death and long covid he tweeted white house officials said there have been 205 known cases of omicron from 18 countries although not in the u s dutch officials on tuesday said they found the omicron variant in a sample collected on nov 19 indicating it was present in europe before it burst into view last week and countries put restrictions on air travel from south africa and surrounding nations rochelle walensky the director of the centers for disease control and prevention said it is collecting samples from all states and territories and so far 99 9 of all sequenced samples remain the delta variant that took over during the summer vaccine makers say it will take at least two weeks to assess how damaging omicron is to the shots dome of protection they are drafting plans to develop a booster shot that is specifically tailored to omicron but it would take at least three months to get it out the door and more time to manufacture it at scale in the meantime drugmakers and federal scientists say existing boosters should offer additional protection against the virus and its variants so there is no reason to wait for an omicron specific booster that might not materialize we re still waiting for more data but what remains true is that our best protection against the virus remains the vaccine people should get vaccinated and boosted at this point i m confident that our recovery remains strong treasury secretary janet yellen told lawmakers likewise pfizer ceo albert bourla tweeted the best hedge against omicron is to get fully vaccinated and boosted as recommended he said his company can make an omicron specific vaccine within 100 days mr bancel the chief of moderna said it would take several months to produce an omicron specific vaccine at scale his company is exploring whether a high dose of its existing booster shot suffices against omicron especially for seniors and the medically frail during a white house briefing dr fauci said covid 19 vaccines were built to target the ancestral strain from wuhan but the shots spur a big enough antibody response and trigger the immune system to suppress most variants you get a level so high that even if the mutations of various variants diminish that level of protection you are still within the range of some degree of protection dr fauci said and that s usually most manifested in protection against severe disease that leads to hospitalization we re hoping and i think with good reason to feel good that there will be some degree of protection he said markets don t like uncertainty however and the sour mood is infecting consumer confidence which dropped to its lowest level in nine months the consumer confidence index declined to 109 5 from 111 6 in october amid concerns about inflation the conference board a nonprofit that tracks the metric said tuesday the expectations index that takes stock of how consumers feel about income business and employment conditions in the near term also fell to 87 6 from 89 mr powell said the fed will have to monitor a variety of factors as it decides what to do about inflation and whether omicron poses a major threat it s really about transmissibility the ability of existing vaccines to address any new variant and it s about the severity of the disease once it s contracted he told lawmakers experts say they ll know quite a bit about those answers within about a month we ll know something though within a week or 10 days and then and only then can we make an assessment of what the impact would be on the economy mr powell testified for now it s a risk it s a risk to the baseline it s not really baked into our forecast for more information visit the washington times covid 19 resource page tom howell jr can be reached at thowell washingtontimes com
by maggie fox cnn as soon as south africa announced the spread of a new and troubling variant last week scientists went to work by the time the world health organization had named the new lineage omicron multiple teams of researchers had already duplicated the work of the laboratories in durban and elsewhere and mapped out the genetic changes that made omicron the new bad actor of the coronavirus family although many of those mutations were familiar from other variants scientists still were not sure whether they make omicron substantially different from previous variants especially the super dominant delta variant it will take weeks of testing to tell what added superpowers if any these mutations give omicron researchers will look at what s happening in the real world by testing samples taken from patients sequencing their genomes to see if it s omicron causing the infections and looking to see if more and more samples turn out to be omicron they ll also watch to see if omicron infections lead to more severe disease and if fully vaccinated people end up more likely to become infected with omicron variants as opposed to other strains that kind of in real life testing can take months astrazeneca is also already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified namely in botswana and eswatini that will enable us to collect real world data of vaxzevria against this new virus variant a spokesperson for the vaccine maker said friday vaccine makers are turning to what s become a go to technique throughout the pandemic pulling blood from vaccinated volunteers and people who have recovered from recent infections and mixing it with samples of the new variant or a lab engineered version called a pseudovirus to see how immune cells and proteins work against it blood serum contains the antibodies and the b cells and t cells that do the hard work of the body s immune system pfizer and its partner biontech moderna and johnson johnson all say they re starting these experiments the company is testing blood serum from participants in completed and ongoing booster studies to look for neutralizing activity against the omicron variant johnson johnson said in a statement monday this approach has been used to demonstrate first that vaccines were likely to work to protect people against infection then to show they worked to protect people against the alpha beta gamma and delta variants and finally to provide the first evidence of waning immunity such lab dish techniques combined with real life evidence form the basis of decision making on vaccine authorizations approvals and guidance on their use and they ll be used to inform the world about the risks of omicron there s two ways we re going to figure this out national institutes of health director dr francis collins told cnn monday one is by laboratory experiments to do that you need to actually have an isolate of omicron growing in the lab and then you mix that with serum from people who ve been vaccinated and ask does that vaccinated serum still neutralize the virus that just takes a while for the virus to be grown up there s not a lot we could do to accelerate that world health organization covid 19 technical lead maria van kerkhove told cnn it will take some time to grow up the stock of the virus to do that our estimate is between two and four weeks she said dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases outlined the two approaches tuesday one of the things you do is you get the virus and you grow it or you put it into a modified form called a pseudovirus and when you do that you can then get convalescent plasma monoclonal antibodies as well as sera and antibodies that are induced by the vaccine to see if they neutralize the virus he told a white house coronavirus briefing convalescent plasma comes from people who have been infected and recovered that will give you a pretty good idea as to what the level of immune evasion is that process will take likely two weeks or more perhaps even sooner depending upon how well the virus grows in the isolates that we get fauci said and in those countries in which there are a lot of cases like south africa the computational biologists and the evolutionary biologists are going to be getting a good feel as to what the competition of this virus would be with delta those are just a few of the things that will take a couple of weeks to a few weeks to learn us food and drug administration acting commissioner dr janet woodcock said in a statement tuesday the agency is working with medical product companies those making tests therapeutics and vaccines to address any potential effects of new variant historically the work to obtain the genetic information and patient samples for variants and then perform the testing needed to evaluate their impact takes time however we expect the vast majority of this work to be completed in the coming weeks woodcock said the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s naomi thomas and virginia langmaid contributed to this story
federal reserve chairman jerome powell said tuesday that the fed s target for inflation had been reached and that the fed would consider accelerating the wind down of its easy money policies in light of persistently high inflation the announcement marks a major pivot for powell into an inflation fighting mode until tuesday s testimony before the senate banking committee the fed chair had emphasized the need for the fed to proceed slowly and cautiously to avoid hurting the recovery by tightening too early the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high powell said it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases perhaps a few months sooner the fed began to shrink its monthly bond purchases this month a process known in the financial sector as tapering at the pace announced for november and december the fed would stop adding to its bond portfolio in june although it would continue to make new purchases to replace bonds as they matured at tuesday s hearing powell signaled that fed officials would discuss a speedier wind down of the purchases when the fed s policy committee next meets in mid december that would put the fed on a path to likely raising rates as early as the first half of next year powell s remarks at the hearing cleared up some confusion created by the release of his prepared remarks the night before some interpreted references to the omicron variant as a signal that the fed would become more cautious about tightening perhaps slowing the wind down while it waited to see the impact on the economy others thought the references pointed in a hawkish direction signaling a more aggressive stance on fighting inflation when the pandemic first struck the federal reserve and the u s treasury acted together both monetary policy and fiscal policy were loosened to provide ample liquidity to the economy pumping up incomes savings and spending in an attempt to stave off the kind of fall in demand that can trigger economic slumps in times of unexpected shocks or crises the economy briefly entered a very deep recession last year but exited almost immediately once the severest restrictions on economic activity were lifted this year it became clear that the longer lasting effects of the virus on the economy were on the supply side instead of the brief hiccup in supply chains and employment levels that many at the fed expected low labor market participation and supply chain problems have persisted and even spread coupled with robust demand for homes and goods such as appliances cars and furniture from consumers pumped full of stimulus money and low levels of unemployment this has created the conditions for high and rising inflation at the very time fed officials thought inflation would be fading the risk now is that omicron could lead to factory and port shutdowns around the world it may also make some americans now on the sidelines hesitant to return to the workforce the migration of spending from goods to services could be thwarted or reversed if people turn away from eating out and travel again to avoid infection or just the inconveniences of mask requirements and social distancing the recent rise in covid 19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation powell said greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions the idea of tightening monetary policy earlier got bipartisan support at tuesday s hearing several republicans including the panel s ranking member sen pat toomey r pa urged powell to speed up the bond purchase wind down and move away from the central bank s ultra accommodative stance they were joined by sen mark warner d va on tuesday i do hope that you will move more aggressively on this tapering says warner one of the leading democratic moderates senator joe manchin d wv has been publicly fretting about inflation and pushing powell for an end to bond buying for months questioned about powell s earlier insistence that inflation was transitory powell insisted he had been misunderstood the word transitory was not meant to convey the idea that inflation would be short lived but merely that it would not permanently result in higher inflation powell said it s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean he said for over a year now powell has been emphasizing the fed s mandate to maximize employment arguing that this meant not only lowering the overall unemployment rate but making sure the benefits were spread more equitably on tuesday powell acknowledged that the burden of high inflation also hurt equality saying it imposes significant burdens especially on those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation powell got the nod for a second term as fed chair last week from president joe biden some fed watchers think that may have made powell feel less pressure to continue to advocate for an accommodative stance stocks fell sharply on powell s hawkish stance on tuesday with the dow jones industrial average the s p 500 and the russell 2000 each falling around 1 9 percent the nasdaq composite declined 1 55 percent the associated press contributed to this report

every generation of americans has its own racial challenges its own inherited values its own education and understanding to expand its own tolerance issues to temper people act like there is a start and end date to achieving equality but it has always been a continuum since the beginning of the american experiment we are all individually undertaking the journey to get there and it takes many generations to get everyone there each generation along the way has its own story in this ongoing process of revealing democracy s freedom some stories are weirder than others this story is about the 1920s when weird was formally institutionalized apologia mansfield has some moments in its history that are difficult to address of dark times and demeaning events i m not afraid to go there because i love this city i know how important it is to draw the secrets into the light to achieve greater wholeness by filling in the missing pieces some of our history is shameful that s one of the things that makes us interesting those stories are what we have as proof that our community has grown up not quite black white it is a difficult thing to write in a politically correct way about racism in a city that was 95 percent white during the ku klux klan era of the early 20th century but then the mansfield klan was not so exclusively focused on color as it was in other areas of ohio and the country i don t mean to downplay the racist elements of this story it certainly was there loud and strong but the race riots in mansfield took place years before the klan arrived unquestionably in keeping with the national ideology of their organization the local kkk wanted to keep african americans subdued but around here the klan was far more worried about other targets the catholics the jews the immigrant not americans it takes very few fingers to tally up the number of incidents in richland county when the klan used its powers of intimidation to formally antagonize black people but there were quite a few events in the county staged by the kkk between 1920 1928 directed toward catholics when they burned the 50 foot cross at the top of ashland hill it wasn t so much to frighten the black folks in mansfield it was to make sure all the poles italians macedonians greeks and hungarians were aware that mansfield is a christian land which to them meant protestant the mansfield office klan 75 on north main street engaged in a number of cross burning events as was typical of kkk groups across the u s in 1923 but their mission in richland county was more clearly summed up in their other headline making formal gestures presenting american flags to schools and churches their job as they saw it was to keep our community very clearly 100 percent american the birth of the movement in the first decades of the 20th century everybody had heard of the ku klux klan from their history books as a violent southern movement that rose up after the civil war to counter us policies presenting equal opportunities to newly liberated slave people officially the conflagration of the klan was put out in the 1870s by the federal government there were embers that continued to smolder underground however and the flame reignited in 1915 that was the year when the film industry initiated a new art form of propaganda that mesmerized the american public and inadvertently redirected the national agenda toward intolerance the movie was the birth of a nation it was an unbelievably popular movie that happened to glamorize the morality of klan values the film was banned in ohio in its early days but once it was allowed in 1917 it always did a brisk business in mansfield in the 1920s when it showed at the mansfield memorial opera house it drew standing room only crowds recruiting during the first half of the 1920s the reawakened klan gained in numbers as the organization became established in every state and though the group came back to life in georgia the largest membership rose in northern states it is likely there were 300 000 klan members in ohio by 1923 and no fewer than 4 million in the u s by 1924 they marched through the streets of the nation s capital in ranks measured in miles so it was no secret movement the first formal efforts to create a klan organization in mansfield happened in 1921 when representatives from huge groups in indiana and cleveland came to town quietly looking for recruits only two years later by 1923 there were already dozens of klan events taking place in richland county very publicly with tremendous attendance it was like any social fad in u s history it mounted gradually from a groundswell rose in a terrific wave and then crashed on the shore and faded away the high water mark of the kkk in richland county was 1923 24 at that time the local klan numbered at least 3 900 members from every town and village there were crosses burned across the entire county on the highest hills all of the public mansfield cross burnings were staged in proximity to the lincoln highway route 30 in order to catch attention of passing travelers both east and west of town in the summer months long lines of cars parked on the side of the road to watch the spectacles the biggest events took place at the fairgrounds which was at that time on springmill street near where route 30 is today the klan demonstration and initiation events in 1923 brought far more crowds to the fairgrounds than the county fair ever did in september they staged an initiation ceremony that invested 1 000 men and 500 women into the organization at one time this event went so well they did it again barely six weeks later emboldened by success thousands of klansmen lined up in ranks to stage a parade through mansfield in full hooded and robed costume they marched from the fairgrounds down springmill street to downtown around the square and back it is a nearly four mile hike and accounts said it was done in almost complete silence except for scattered polite applause from the bystanders downtown who they were it is easy to think by today s standards that these huge crowds of robed folks drew in all the disaffected characters from the fringes of society but that was not true at all in the 1920s the kkk manifested in ohio more like a fraternal service organization that was appealing and beneficial to community leaders roll calls of the local klan included prominent businessmen industrialists judges and city leaders of the highest positions belonging to the kkk was considered a patriotic duty in fact the chief activity of public promotion that the klan undertook was presenting american flags to schools and churches in formal ceremonies for example they marched into the methodist church in butler all in costume in the middle of a sunday service and presented the minister with a flag a bible and an envelope full of cash this was a typical klan activity and it made headlines when it happened in mifflin taylortown shelby lexington plymouth and mansfield the klan made flag presentations at grade schools high schools even the boy scout camp they wanted to make it difficult to criticize their motives their motives even though the klan put forth an appearance of benign benevolence with flags and bibles their exhibitions with disguises and cross burnings were much more provocative as the trappings of intimidation and anger look behind most peoples anger and the first thing you find is fear so what did the people in mansfield have to be afraid of in the 1920s to all appearances they were more than sufficiently secure industry was booming at an all time high and production was increasing every day there were more jobs than ever before that was exactly the problem however more jobs meant more strangers to fill the positions the city was growing at a phenomenal rate which was wonderful but it was filling up with black families emigrating from the south and foreign families immigrating from europe these newcomers brought with them an alien culture the chemistry of the melting pot was changing and mansfield had many more people who didn t speak english it was not the america that old mansfielders had grown up with fireworks the first overt actions taken by the kkk in mansfield were in the form of threatening letters these letters weren t sent to the foreigners they were mailed to the mansfield police department they said if the cops wouldn t control the foreigners the klan would do it themselves with hot tar the klan was indignant that foreigners were partying late at night it was after all the prohibition era and alcohol was illegal non americans were having too much fun the local klan wasn t concerned with race specifically or ethnicity so much as principles and ethics they considered themselves guardians of public morality they protested movies that showed women drinking no one was taking them very seriously as arbiters of public behavior so they decided to make a demonstration of how fearsome they could be by burning a cross over the mansfield skyline where no one could miss it one night in january 1924 they carried a 50 foot cross to the top of ashland hill and set it on fire it was however january and everybody was inside where it was warm no one was looking at the skyline so the klan guys set off a bomb it was an effective tactic startled folks ran outside to see what blew up and there clearly visible in the sky above mansfield was the flaming emblem of the invisible empire that was really the kkk red letter day in mansfield everybody noticed them that time it was all downhill from there ashes they burned a lot more crosses after that one was 75 feet tall but nobody was paying much attention outside the organization within a year the local klan was already losing its magnetic appeal folks stopped paying their dues some unsanctioned rogue bands of klansmen tried to stir things up in town burning crosses in the square and at st peter s catholic church but the individuals were quickly apprehended jailed and disavowed by the klan by 1925 when the klan tried to rent mansfield high school auditorium for an event the school board turned them away that seemed to indicate an end to all official community blessing in 1926 they scheduled parades and hired police to guard their route but no one showed up and the events were called off end of an era looking back at the 1920s can be kind of embarrassing it s hard to think of our town engaged in the politics of intimidation of course how much righteous dignity can you impart when you re dressed up in bedsheets like trick or treat you have to be embarrassed for them at the time they must not have recognized how bizarre they looked in 1929 the stock market crashed and the plummeting economy leveled the playing field so suddenly everybody was flat broke and no one could pretend to be superior all those 100 percent americans were too busy trying to survive to take time out to strut around in robes and besides during hard times when every dime counted no one wanted to spend 1 to get those robes cleaned
washington chair jerome powell said tuesday that the federal reserve will consider acting more quickly to dial back its ultra low interest rate policies to counter higher inflation which powell acknowledged will likely persist well into next year the fed has begun reducing its monthly bond purchases which are intended to lower longer term borrowing costs at a pace that would end those purchases in june but powell made clear that fed officials will discuss paring those purchases more quickly when it next meets in mid december doing so would put the fed on a path to begin raising its key short term rate as early as the first half of next year a higher fed rate would in turn raise borrowing costs for mortgages credit cards and some business loans the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high powell said at a senate banking committee hearing it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases perhaps a few months sooner powell said the fed should know more about the potential economic impact of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in time for that next meeting but he suggested that for now omicron hasn t been factored into the fed s economic outlook stock prices tumbled after powell s comments with the dow jones industrial average down about 1 5 percent in mid day trading many investors had hoped that powell would signal that the fed would put off any policy changes until the impact of the omicron variant had become clearer instead he suggested that the fed has taken a decisive turn toward reducing its economic stimulus advertisement the emergence of a potentially dangerous new covid 19 variant could make powell s job harder and more complicated next year if omicron leads to another wave of factory and port shutdowns in the united states and overseas and to a reversal of the back to office return for many workers americans might keep spending heavily on goods such as furniture appliances and cars that trend would likely worsen supply bottlenecks and raise prices even more at the same time the variant could renew fears among many workers about becoming infected on the job more resignations might then follow at a time when the rate of job quitting is already at record highs thereby magnifying labor shortages this would risk weakening the job market and the economy under such a scenario the fed s dual mandates of stable prices and maximum employment could come into conflict powell hinted at these trends in his testimony before the committee the recent rise in covid 19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation he said greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions under fire from some senate republicans about worsening consumer inflation which reached a three decade high last month powell acknowledged that price increases have been worse than the fed expected and will last longer than the policymakers initially thought as a result he said the term transitory no longer works as a description of inflation it s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean he said advertisement powell s comments come after other fed officials in recent weeks have said the central bank should consider winding down its ultra low interest rate policies more quickly than it currently plans they cited concerns about inflation which has jumped to three decade highs treasury secretary janet yellen also testified before the senate banking panel and urged congress to raise the nation s borrowing limit yellen has previously warned that without a hike in the debt ceiling the u s government could default on its debt obligations for the first time soon after dec 15 i cannot overstate how critical it is that congress address this issue yellen said america must pay its bills on time and in full if we do not we will eviscerate our current recovery congress is expected to address the borrowing limit and also faces a friday deadline to provide enough funding to keep the federal government open yellen also said that for now the economic recovery remains strong but urged that americans get vaccinated or receive booster shots to guard against the omicron variant powell acknowledged that inflation imposes significant burdens especially on those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation advertisement he said most economists expect inflation to subside over time as supply constraints ease but added that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year at a news conference last month powell said high inflation could persist into late summer at their last meeting november 2 3 fed policymakers agreed to start reducing the central bank s 120 billion in monthly bond purchases by 15 billion a month that would bring the purchases to an end in june those bond buys an emergency measure that began last year are intended to hold down longer term interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending the fed has pegged its short term interest rate which influences other borrowing costs such as for mortgages and credit cards at nearly zero since last march when covid 19 first erupted last week the fed released minutes from the november meeting that showed some of the 17 fed policymakers supported reducing the bond purchases more quickly

improvement because of what you all did to help with overnight hours and because of the team s work to reroute to other ports to extend our lead times and have other creative solutions we ve seen an increase in throughput over the last four weeks of about 26 nationally in terms of getting containers through ports walmart s ceo said in the southern california ports in particular where you ve been really focused we ve seen a 51 improvement in that flow through and that s helped a lot as it relates to categories like toys which are so important for christmas so we ll keep working to make sure

from two pivotal phase ii studies the hqp1351cc201 study and the hqp1351cc202 study these results showed that olverembatinib is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with cml cp and cml ap and the probability and depth of clinical response is expected to increase with prolonged treatment period cml is a hematologic malignancy of the white blood cells the introduction of bcr abl tkis have significantly improved the clinical management of cml however acquired resistance to tkis remains a major challenge in the treatment of cml bcr abl tyrosine kinase mutations represent a key mechanism of acquired drug resistance t315i which is the most common drug resistant mutation occurs in about 25 of patients with drug resistant cml patients with t315i mutant cml are resistant to both first and

least up to lunchtime when the index was up over 90 points once again the sellers moved in and when the bell rang the index was up only 50 points on the market on close match up another 34 points were

twist in the omicron tale stagflation a couple of months ago talk of stagflation was scoffed at by economists who pointed out that while inflation was rising as the economy was slowing from its rapid pace the stagflation tag of the 1970s referred to double digit inflation in a deep recession the one caveat to a degree would be if the fed were forced to raise rates to fight persistent inflation into a slowing economy last night jay powell dropped a bombshell at a congressional committee hearing with regard transitory inflation he suggested it s probably a good time to retire that word and explain more clearly what we mean on that note he said it would be appropriate given the present economic backdrop to consider speeding up the tapering process wall street s response was a resounding why now had he made this capitulation months ago when the economy was strong delta was easing and inflation was rising wall street would have applauded if he d done so last thursday wall street would still have hardly blinked but when the world faces a whole new round of covid uncertainty powell decides to put on the economic brakes the decision will be made in the next fed meeting in a couple of weeks to rub in the salt janet yellen warned the government will run out of money by december 15 or earlier unless the debt ceiling is lifted but before all of this happened the ceo of moderna set markets back on edge by predicting that current vaccines would be less effective against omicron the fed is caught between a rock and a hard place before omicron it was clear that inflation will not go away in a hurry due to ongoing supply problems that began in the 2020 virus waves and subsequent lockdowns and were exacerbated by delta now omicron threatens lockdowns once more particularly in the global supply hub of asia where china in particular is maintaining a zero covid policy and locking down at the first sign of trouble if new vaccines are needed that will take time and inflation will only persist or get worse in the interim the global economy will not only slow if lockdowns spread but likely recede once again at least in the short term stagnant economy high inflation the fed now risks being as much a part of the problem as the solution to be fair faster tapering does not immediately imply rate hikes but surely brings forward the timing just as wall street has being trying to tell the fomc for the past months wall street will also send a message to the fed if stock markets once again tank in which case monetary tightening might have to be completely reconsidered shades of december 2018 when too many rate hikes sent wall street tumbling forcing the fed into a policy pivot i don t envy his job one interesting element of wall street s otherwise unsurprising second crunch last night was a matter of safe havens gold fell us 10 oz and apple rose 2 5 had apple have gone the other way falls on all three major indices would have been much much worse government bonds

by alex wong getty images article content the u s central bank should consider accelerating the winding down of its large scale bond purchases at its next policy meeting in two weeks amid a strong economy and expectations that a surge in inflation will persist into the middle of next year federal reserve chair jerome powell said on tuesday powell twinned his remarks described by some analysts as surprisingly hawkish with a characterization of the economic risk from an emergent variant of covid 19 that has unnerved officials and financial markets worldwide in recent days as not comparable

retired suggesting policymakers would make a more concerted effort to rein in price increases in the months ahead at this point the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases which we actually announced at the november meeting perhaps a few months sooner and i expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting in a couple of weeks powell who testified alongside treasury secretary janet yellen told the senate panel the fed began to reduce its support for the economy this month and is currently on track to fully taper its us 120 billion in monthly purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities by next june the program was introduced in early 2020 to help nurse

purchases and were made as financial markets continued to be roiled by the emergence of the new omicron variant of the coronavirus that is more easily transmissible and may evade vaccinations that

article content powell came off as much more hawkish than many were assuming given the variant risk said ben jeffery interest rate strategist at bmo capital markets in new york he said now is the time to kind of abandon the transitory characterization of inflation and said that maybe a conversation about tapering earlier than previously assumed might be appropriate futures tied to the expected outcome of the fed policy meetings signalled investors and traders expect the central bank to progress from the end of the bond buying taper to its first interest rate hike as early as its june 2022

a risk to the baseline it s not really baked into our forecast nonetheless powell acknowledged that omicron is elevating the uncertainty around the outlook for the economy and potentially adding to

sped through your final round of bicep curls same and completely bypass the minds of others which person you are largely depends on your appetite or how often you get hungry believe it or not the strength of our appetite actually has a lot to do with our genetic makeup according to a british study published in 2023 there s a strong correlation between the two which can mediate weight fluctuations later in life that doesn t mean that you re always going to be hungry if your genetics say you will be yes it s based in genetics but our appetite depends on loads of other environmental factors as well you may have had a busy day at work and accidentally missed lunch or you find yourself eating very little after the loss of a loved one maybe you re just dealing with the common cold and the idea of having to stuff something down your itchy throat makes you feel even more sick but what if you haven t been hungry for several days in a row when should you start to get worried regular loss of appetite could signal that you may have a medical condition says kacie vavrek r d at ohio state university some of the main reasons are going to be more disease related like a cold or some gi issues vavrek says that said certain medications can also cause loss of appetite so just to be safe read up on these reasons for appetite loss and then determine if you can relate to any of them so much that it might be time to take yourself to the doctor and if everything seems a okay well here s to your next meal causes of appetite loss common cold infections as if being sick isn t bad enough losing your appetite is common if you have a cold this is why you sometimes lose weight when you re sick you simply just don t want to eat your white blood cells release cytokines that help fight off infection but these chemicals can also cause a loss of appetite in fact appetite loss could be a symptom of covid 19 bacterial infections like pneumonia and strep can also lead to a dip in hunger of course this subsides once you recover stress and anxiety you often hear about people who stress eat their feelings but sometimes anxiety can make you lose your appetite too jacobs stock photography ltd one reason is that stress causes your body to release a hormone called epinephrine also dubbed adrenaline which temporarily diminishes hunger according to harvard health however this loss of appetite is usually short lived persistent stress can cause your body to release cortisol a hormone that revs up appetite medications it s no secret that medications come with a long list of potential side effects gastrointestinal issues like nausea stomach pain or diarrhea are commonly found on prescription warning labels and it goes without saying that these side effects can make you lose your appetite narcotics like codeine and morphine as well as some antibiotics are common appetite killers weather there s a reason most people crave lighter foods like salad and fresh fruit in the summer in fact some people may feel like skipping meals completely when the temperatures rise according to vavrek wundervisuals hot environments can suppress your appetite where cold environments can increase your appetite she says your body produces heat when eating if temperatures are unbearably warm you ll feel less inclined to dig into a meal and raise your own internal temperature vavrek explains food choices in fact if you re eating the right amount of two key nutrients at every meal you may not even get that hungry between meals those key nutrients protein and fiber experts agree that eating at least 30 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber at each meal will both help you fill up and not overeat during a meal and keep you feeling full until the next whenever that may be when to see a doctor sometimes lack of appetite may signal other medical issues including hypothyroidism diabetes or even cancer each will likely be present with other symptoms but signs can be subtle it s important to see your doctor if food is always unappealing according to vavrek you should head to the doctor if you ve lost weight or gone three to four days without an appetite it s important to determine whether an underlying medical condition is at the root of the problem you ll also want to remedy the problem quickly because your body will use protein stores as energy causing you to lose muscle mass it s very easy to lose muscle and hard to get it back she says how to get appetite back you need to eat regardless of how much you want to if you re struggling with appetite loss there s a few things you can do to get hungry again regularly schedule meals research has found that appetite control is linked to the circadian rhythms that run on a 24 hour cycle eating at the same time everyday can help you maintain an appetite get excited about your food find things you re excited to eat be it old favorites or something new that you ve been wanting to try keep snacks around that way when you do get a quick spark of hunger you can act on it no matter where you are the get your exercise in studies have shown that exercise both increases appetite and increases post meal satiety

in a white house speech addressing the new covid 19 variant omicron president biden yesterday reiterated several times the need to vaccinate the world to beat the pandemic aids healthcare foundation ahf applauds the president for emphasizing the need for a united global response to the pandemic and his call for other nations to step up vaccine sharing president biden made it entirely clear that sharing excess vaccine doses is as much a matter of national security as it is a moral obligation no nation exists in a vacuum and those in a position to help their neighbors must do so that is our only shot at stopping the proliferation of new and potentially more lethal variants said ahf president michael weinstein our allies in western europe are sitting on vaccine stockpiles so large they expire and end up getting flushed down the drain meanwhile in africa only 11 of people have had a chance to get vaccinated this is an entirely preventable humanitarian disaster unless we fully commit to vaccinating our world as one global community the pandemic will drag on claiming millions more lives and taxing the economies growth and stability of all countries for years to come to date the us has pledged to share over 1 1 billion vaccine doses before 2023 so far over 245 million doses have been delivered to recipient countries and another 26 million are en route the remaining us vaccine stock is estimated to be 625 million doses by contrast the european union has a remaining stock of 1 3 billion and has only pledged to share 500 million doses of which 100 million have been shipped but not yet delivered to recipient countries in both instances the us and eu have so far purchased vaccine quantities far in excess of what is needed 278 and 340 of their populations respectively within days of omicron s discovery it has already been detected in 19 countries including many eu countries which shows that with current limited genomic sequencing and epidemiological surveillance capacity around the world quarantines and travel restrictions do a poor job of preventing the spread of new variants at this point our best strategy as well as a moral duty is to ensure that we vaccinate our world so that as many people are protected from covid 19 as possible lest we give the virus free rein to mutate uncontrollably and run the risk of developing vaccine resistant strains ahf launched an international vaccinate our world campaign in april 2021 to promote global vaccine access and equity read more about it at www vaccinateourworld org
whatever the venue rabbi avraham mordechai malach uses wit and humor as a medium but never loses sight of the message photos naftoli goldgrab while motzaei shabbos in brooklyn usually features heavy foot traffic on this particular weekend with a hurricane battering new york people were shuttered in their homes i get out of my uber my kapoteh dripping wet and the edges of my shtreimel blowing wildly in the wind and gratefully step into the warm and more importantly dry malach home i m excited to finally meet the man behind the most popular soundtrack in tens of thousands of frum homes people listen to rav avraham mordechai malach s shiurim in doctors waiting rooms and in hospitals on the way to work and while waiting for the train his speeches are broadcast on an endless loop at chinuch conventions and it s the no fail conversation starter nu have you heard malach s latest vort his vertlach are always engaging his rich language laced with humor he s been gifted with stand up comedian talents but he uses them only as a medium for the messages he conveys to his audiences about chinuch avodas hashem our role in this world emunah and bitachon and the jewish way to deal with challenges he s not afraid to touch on sensitive subjects he s a maggid shiur in yeshivas meor hatorah one of the most sought after speakers in jewish world and an entertaining badchan at weddings he s the man who almost literally seems to dance at all weddings the setting in the malach home is familiar it s a typical motzaei shabbos scene the havdalah candle is still on the table as is the shabbos tablecloth the lights are all on children are underfoot and the rich scent of cholent lingers in the air my host is wearing a pair of woolen tzitzis and his peyos sway from side to side and we sit down for what turns out to be a fascinating conversation reb avraham mordechai was born a bit more than 40 years ago his father reb pinchas menachem malach a h passed away a number of years ago but hearing reb avraham mordechai speak about his father it s clear he was a strong influence reb pinchas menachem was born in the small town of ostrolenka to a family of gerrer chassidim and his father reb chaim wolf was a chassid of the sfas emes while reb pinchas menachem himself was drawn to the influence of the novardok mussar movement he never forgot his gerrer roots anyone who hears reb avraham mordechai s shiurim has surely heard numerous stories of his father s mesirus nefesh for yiddishkeit in the forests of siberia he once told me an interesting story reb avraham mordechai shares my father was in siberia with another bochur who came from a gerrer family they were digging in the ground and suddenly they found a full bottle of vodka it must be a sign from above the friend said so they sat down and figured out it was 5 shevat the yahrtzeit of the sfas emes it was very moving for two bochurim whose parents had traveled to the tzaddik after the war reb pinchas menachem settled in israel where he married and had seven children but then his wife fell ill and passed away and he was left a widower with young children rav yaakov galinsky ztz l who was a close friend from novardok suggested a shidduch with the cook of the yeshivah a righteous g d fearing woman originally from libya my father had seven children on the other hand the proposed woman had no children and she wanted to have a family so she went to the beis yisrael of gur and shared her concerns the rebbe reassured her and promised you will yet have children the rebbe s promise materialized and she had two sons reb avraham mordechai is one of them to this day the malach family maintains close ties with the libyan side of their family if you had been here on shabbos and seen the huge number of dips and salads you would have easily figured out where we come from reb avraham mordechai laughs his wife comes from illustrious stock as well my father in law reb yisrael moshe baum a h was a very special yid he says warmly sadly he passed away from covid reb avraham mordechai shares an interesting story about his father in law he fulfilled the words of chazal v yiheyu aniyim bnei beisecha that one should bring paupers into his home his shabbos and yom tov meals were spent in the company of all kinds of people many of whom faced rejection elsewhere when he came to eat in our home up to the last purim of his life all his special guests came along with him and when he once went to the catskills for pesach he rented accommodations for them as well why am i telling you this he explains to give you some context for the second fascinating part of the story it was at his levayah we opened the door to the chevra kaddisha vehicle and we see another aron there whose is this we asked the chevra kaddisha in surprise oh they said apologetically it s a yid who passed away from corona a real meis mitzvah he has no family or friends do you mind if he is part of the levayah we who knew our niftar were sure that this is exactly what he would have wanted that he should have guests on his final journey as well i ask reb avraham mordechai how his speaking career began he smiles people ask me avrum modche since when are you speaking i tell them i ve been speaking since i was born but one day people just started listening to me the beginning was modest i was a maggid shiur during the day i taught young bochurim in yeshivah and in the evenings i entertained people at weddings when people ask me when i started speaking for adults i tell them they re the same children i taught when they were young it s just that they grew up in the meantime there was an organization called tiferes avos that organized chinuch lectures and the directors asked me to come and give a lecture it was my first speech on the subject of chinuch and i was super nervous i spent a whole week preparing it was snowing heavily the night of the lecture i came and saw a sign tiferes avos downstairs i was surprised i knew the place but didn t know it had a basement so i went down and there was my audience sitting in a coatroom which had been converted into an improvised conference room there were three people sitting there including the photographer i was really disappointed he remembers i didn t know what to do but that ignominious lecture would prove to be the catalyst to his future as a speaker one of the three people in the audience was rabbi mechel shapiro who later founded the keiravtuni organization an organization dedicated to bringing jews closer to hashem their families and communities rabbi shapiro brought rabbi malach on board as a speaker at keiravtuni s two annual weekends and his reputation grew quickly reb avraham mordechai malach is the undisputed star speaker at those weekends for his part he saves his best stories for these lectures i m like shammai hazakein who found a select animal each day and said this is for shabbos he jokes every good idea that i come across i save for the keiravtuni shabbos unless i get better merchandise of course that first basement lecture unimpressive turnout notwithstanding gave reb avraham mordechai a great story for his repertoire but more importantly he adds i ve also learned that you mustn t make light of any word at any event you never know where it will get to and who it will influence covid brought new intensity to reb avraham mordechai s sense of mission it was at the beginning of the pandemic people were dying one after the other the doctor warned my wife that covid was dangerous for people who are overweight and i panicked then one day it happened i came down with a fever and was struggling to breathe my condition deteriorated and the doctor said i was going to die so i decided to make a deal with hashem instead of one weekly shiur i pledged to give a daily shiur i told hashem i ll give chizuk to your children and i ll tell them what i would want to hear and you give me chizuk i named this lecture coffee with reb avraham mordechai coffee is soothing and in yiddish it s kaveh like in kavei el hashem the message we all needed desperately at the time i went down to the living room one child played the song kavei el hashem on the piano and i recorded a shiur coughing incessantly throughout after the shiur i felt very ill and i couldn t sleep i went down to the dining room to walk around a bit i had a strong urge to daven at my father s kever in eretz yisrael which of course was impossible i took a yahrtzeit lecht and lit it in memory of my father and said tearfully i wish i could daven at your kever let this be considered as if i did then i wept like a little baby it was a scary time people were dying every day i promised again to give chizuk to klal yisrael and then i collapsed into bed feeling worse usually i upload my shiur to the hotline right after i give it and the first ones to hear it are israelis and europeans where it s morning earlier sometimes by the time it s morning for me there s already feedback waiting on the line and you wouldn t believe the first recorded message that waited for me the next morning this is spitzer from ashdod i m standing next to the tziyun of your father on har hamenuchos and i m davening for your recovery the message had come in at the exact time that i had lit the candle but i didn t know anyone named spitzer from ashdod so i called him and asked who are you and what are you doing at my father s kever my father s kever is not easy to locate it sometimes took me two hours to locate his kever when i went there he answered for the past two years i ve been going to his kever each week and i tell him a vort in your name there so why are you calling me only now i asked so he told me his father was a widower who lived alone in yerushalayim each thursday night he would travel from ashdod to visit his father and then slept over before he went home on fridays he always stopped at har hamenuchos to visit his mother s kever once he noticed the matzeivah of the next kever over and that it belonged to a yid named malach he wondered if there was any connection between him and the malach whose weekly shiur he listened to on the way home each friday morning the epitaph on my father s kever speaks of his mesirus nefesh in siberia when once during a shiur i spoke of my father s self sacrifice during the war he realized it was my father s kever but i still didn t get it why are you only calling me now to tell me about this i usually go to yerushalayim on thursdays he explained this time because of covid i knew i wouldn t be able to visit my father anyway and it was erev rosh chodesh on wednesday so i decided to go to yerushalayim on wednesday just to daven at har hamenuchos while driving i thought to myself too bad malach s weekly shiur isn t on yet and suddenly i got the alert that the new shiur had been uploaded i listened to the kaveh that you gave i was so moved that i felt i had to tell your father of course i heard the coughing and realized that i had to daven for a refuah for you as well reb avraham mordechai has found that sprinkling his shiurim with humor and wit gives him a direct route to his listeners minds and hearts still while he is unquestionably entertaining he never loses sight of his ultimate goal and while he travels extensively he will not under any circumstances join vacation programs i don t like being part of an entertainment roster that includes the juggler the comedian and the magician he explains joining us for melaveh malkah is the fromowitz family good friends of the malachs and his regular audience at the thursday night derashah he records at home i m surprised and delighted to find out that reb yossi fromowitz is the lacher the voice behind the rolling laughter that is always heard when reb avraham mordechai offers an especially witty thought for years there have been theories about the nature of the laughter now reb yossi agrees to go public with his secret when i want to raise the morale in my classroom a bit reb avraham mordechai relates i call yossi put the phone on speaker and ask him to get a smile out of them there s nothing like it to restore some life to a sleepy classroom aren t you afraid that sometimes your milsa d bedichusa the humor is a bit too much i ask hoping i haven t crossed a line reb avraham mordechai doesn t seem perturbed no he answers i think there is no better way to convey messages of mussar and lessons for life than to make them accessible in this way it s the most up to date language and most effective one that speaks to our youth and he explains our generation is called the ikvesa d mishecha we are the heel sometimes we come to visit a sick person and he is covered with bandages you can t touch him or pat him the only thing you can sometimes do is draw close to his exposed heel and tickle it a bit with your fingertips bringing him a smile this is our way of arousing this generation with the heel with tickles that generate smiles needle pricks don t scare anyone anymore today i wonder aloud if he still needs to prepare a lot before speaking his answer surprises me a ton it s endless often after i ve already recorded an entire speech i listen to it and decide that it s not what i want and i don t broadcast it but it always looks like you re just saying things off the cuff i exclaim nu you can only imagine how hard i have to prepare and how hard i have to work to make it look that way he answers chinuch is a focal point of passion for reb avraham mordechai throughout his meteoric rise he has never stopped giving shiurim in yeshivah he also has a group of older bochurim to whom he delivers a shiur in mussar and chassidus his family remains his priority despite the heavy demand for his lectures over weekend chizuk events one of the rules he s adopted is that he will not be away from home for two consecutive shabbosim chinuch is a primary theme in his lectures as well he teaches parents how to communicate with their children how to influence them without distancing them he pleads with parents not to scream not to threaten and sometimes not even to get involved but to simply calmly consider what can be done he decries the phenomena of parents who live in their own world held captive by their phones or private affairs and then demanding that their children follow the straight and narrow reb avraham mordechai also isn t deterred that young bochurim listen to his speeches when they grow up and become parents they ll be able to implement what they heard as bochurim he says with a grin his listeners are familiar with the motto he uses in almost every speech on chinuch reb avraham mordechai asks parents to do one simple thing say a good word sometimes one good word even if it s not entirely accurate can transform a child completely he shares a story to bring out his point i davened shacharis one day at the klal yisrael shul of the nikolsburger rebbe i was standing on the upper level of the huge porch near a bochur when an empty coffee cup someone had left on the railing fell to the lower level i looked at the bochur wondering if he would go downstairs to pick up the cup or ignore it like most bochurim i know from my 20 years in yeshivah would but no the bochur went down to the lower level and picked up the cup i went over to him and said has anyone ever told you that you re a good boy with good middos a few weeks later the menahel ruchani of one of the yeshivos in the area met me and said reb avrum modche you cannot imagine what chizuk you gave to a bochur from my yeshivah you must mean one of my speeches i asked no he replied and he told me the story with this bochur you should know that this bochur was on the verge of leaving yeshivah he said he has a weak mind he didn t have chavrusas and he had decided to drop out then you came with your compliment and he was reborn he tells it to anyone who is willing to listen reb avraham mordechai then shares another powerful story this morning when i came out of the mikveh i met reb simcha weber he s an american yid who has a fiery chassidic soul each friday night he walks for about 45 minutes to the rachmistrikva rebbe s tish and when he s in eretz yisrael he does not miss a single tish at the rebbe of toldos avraham yitzchak he had an amazing story to tell me he then related reb simcha s words we spent shabbos with my parents in long beach reb simcha said in the middle of the seudah my two year old son got tired and we decided to put him to sleep we said shema with him and sent him to bed suddenly i remembered that i hadn t yet danced with him shabbos kodesh like i do with each child individually on friday night after the seudah i checked on him and saw that he was still up he said to me tatty we didn t dance shabbos kodesh let s dance now i replied he happily agreed but insisted on coming out of bed with no choice i took him out and as we danced in the dark singing shabbos kodesh a heavy bookcase collapsed onto his bed reb avraham mordechai concludes the story on motzaei shabbos reb simcha called the toldos avraham yitzchak rebbe who told him the merit of shabbos protected you besides the incredible hashgachah manifested in the story reb avraham mordechai notes the beauty of the father s custom of dancing with his children and the vital importance of maintaining a strong connection between parents and children it can save their lives his shiurim reach every jewish corner in the world and sometimes one story generates another as the inspiration multiplies exponentially during one of my speeches i described how the middah of chesed is ingrained in our jewish dna and i illustrated my point with this story there was a restaurant in manhattan one of the workers bothered by the amount of food discarded every day asked the owner s permission to donate the leftover food to the old age home across the street the seniors were grateful except one who refused to touch the food when the worker inquired why he said because it s jew food and i hate jews but i m not jewish the man told him i don t know the old man insisted only jews can do this kind of thing that night the worker shared what had had happened with his mother she was very agitated and shared with him that he was indeed a kosher jew the story has an interesting sequel a woman reached out to reb avraham mordechai sharing that she d met a nurse in the hospital who admitted she was jewish but was completely uninterested in learning more about yiddishkeit the next time she went to the hospital the volunteer driving the car was playing rabbi malach s shiur where he shared the story about the restaurant worker who discovered his jewish identity when the story ended they arrived at the hospital where the woman met the same nurse again the nurse was upset and shared with the woman that she was very bothered by the staff s attitude toward a sick child who was alone the woman still under the influence of rabbi malach s story shared it with the nurse and told her the reason you re so upset by the mistreatment of this little boy is because you re jewish and you cannot escape your judaism the nurse began to cry and has been growing spiritually ever since reb avraham mordechai has learned to take his words very seriously people absorb every word every nuance every move he says it s happened that a sefer that i mentioned during a shiur sent sales spiking sharply till it was sold out it s not a responsibility he takes lightly and so he continues to share his messages in yeshivah at weddings at chizuk events delivering mussar and torah lessons in packaging that leaves the listeners waiting for more originally featured in mishpacha issue 888

stressful the three pius x seniors say in unison as they busily jot down share counts and dollar figures and it s easy to see why the conference room turned stock exchange is a flurry of activity when the trading bell signals a new day teams both in person and virtual have 1 million to invest in shares of fictitious and sponsored companies over two months each day lasts 60 seconds the students fight for the attention of traders volunteers in vests who record the transactions while trying to follow the fast moving figures on ticker screens around the room the simulation includes news events too that can swing the market i think it s as real life to trading on the stock market as you re going to get said barb shanahan who brought 12 of her business students from wahoo public schools to lincoln those included wahoo seniors ben thrasher colin ludvik gavin pokorny and freshman sam marxsen who decided to diversify their portfolio they invested in cryptocurrency a dogecoin knockoff called pupper coin an oddly familiar sounding technology company called heyward parker and firespring a local company and one of the event s sponsors they see another company they like and decide to dish out more money for shares but the four start to learn the risks of investing too when their portfolio takes a hit later on you can t always trust the stock market marxsen jokes sometimes you have to take chances in the end a team competing virtually from yutan took the top prize followed by teams from lincoln southeast and ashland greenwood the top three finishers get to compete at the national competition while the top two receive scholarship money to unl a group of ryan psota s students from pius x won last year when the event was virtual this year it was nice to be back in person he said i think it s a real beneficial experience for the kids to get some hands on work with collaboration and looking at trends and seeing how the real life market works said psota who brings his senior economics students to the event each year they really enjoy the competition and just getting to see them interact with one another and making real life decisions is important getting a taste of how the stock market works can be hard to understand at first psota said some of it s a crapshoot early on and they don t know how diversified to be or if they ve been on one stock and it starts going south how soon do they sell it he said those kinds of things are interesting for them to figure out around 350 students competed in person while more than 650 video conferenced into the event according to tera norris president of junior achievement s lincoln division the disruption caused by the pandemic last year has actually been a blessing in disguise norris said since it opened up virtual options for schools from across the state looking to compete it s really the best of both worlds she said and while the event might look slightly different kids are still taking away the same key skills they ve always learned from the event how to invest make personal finance decisions and pursue a solid career these are skills that might not always be emphasized in the classroom said nick castner a volunteer who helped emcee the event we should teach more real world skills and this reflects really closely with how the stock market works he said it s been a tough few years for high school students because of the pandemic and just having them excited about a real world activity and something they can take with them is just wonderful top journal star photos for november top

we ve all read the headlines and know about the effects of the worker shortage like with many things until it happens to us it doesn t feel real the ski areas are opening and employees are returning to work if they can find housing there are endless social media posts where people who want to work in vail and be part of this lively active community are close to begging for housing or unable to show up for work because living in a car is an unrealistic situation elyse howard the worker shortage due in large part to the impossibility of finding affordable housing has long reaching consequences and impacts us all it s more than the inconvenience of finding starbucks closed at two the grocery story operating on reduced hours and restaurants without waitstaff when people who provide services from doctors to housekeepers grocery workers to chefs can t find a place to live it negatively impacts our community the crisis touches all of us people are priced out of buying a safe secure home and can t afford rent because of rising building costs developers can t build the shortage increases and crisis deepens finally we are moving beyond conversations as the community works towards creative solutions for affordable housing we applaud the voters of vail and avon who in november passed initiatives to increase access to affordable housing avon voters approved a tax on short term rentals in the town this revenue will go towards a dedicated community housing fund in vail voters approved a 5 sales tax increase this tax could raise more than 4 million in its first year for housing support local journalism donate creative thinking and partnerships at the higher level are the key to finding solutions state lawmakers set aside 400 million for housing via hb21 1329 from the american rescue plan act i ve been excited to participate in coalition with other affordable home ownership developers across the state including land trusts and modular developers to advocate to the state affordable housing transformational task force and subpanel for solutions that will increase affordable home ownership opportunities for coloradans we ve worked for months to provide insight and suggestions as they evaluate how to direct these funds and invest in colorado s housing infrastructure state rep dylan roberts and summit county commissioner tamara pogue have been key voices representing rural colorado i am grateful for their willingness to dive into the details of the housing needs across the state their keen understanding of the housing issues facing our mountain communities has allowed them to respond to the need to spread funds across the entire housing continuum arpa represents a historic opportunity to begin to balance unequal access to home ownership developing and preserving affordable home ownership opportunities for coloradans is the best and most impactful investment of these funds the shared equity home ownership model used by hfh and community land trusts is proven to be one colorado can use to expand homeownership opportunities a national study of deed restricted type home ownership programs found that homeowners benefit from the program when they sold their homes they accumulated on average 14 000 in earned equity opening a path for new homeowners to buy a house as one family moves up the housing ladder we ve seen this firsthand when a habitat homeowner sells their home and moves on able to put a significant down payment on a new home with their equity and having a new family settle into the habitat home specifically our coalition is advocating for rapid production of for sale housing to address inequities in the market exacerbated by covid 19 we are advocating for grants of 75 000 per unit to affordable home ownership developers to create new affordable housing stock accessible to households up to 120 ami this investment would yield 2 500 new units by the end of 2024 for hardworking coloradans affordable home ownership creates transformational change for the homeowner for the community and the state it s time to fully and equally fund the housing continuum by creating affordable home ownership opportunities colorado will increase community wealth while fueling the economic engine of new home development many coloradans need safe affordable homes the task force is charged with determining the best way to invest these arguably once in a lifetime dollars to create transformational change in the state s housing infrastructure we believe funding should be balanced across the housing continuum that ownership is a transformational investment and to maintain affordable prices for families subsidy is required with investment affordable home construction can increase across the state the per unit construction cost to build a unit for home ownership is the same as to build a rental unit however the ownership unit yields a greater roi families build wealth put down permanent roots and are key members of the community the value in building affordable homes is obvious it s more than a need without housing within reach we will lose valuable members of our community i am excited that i testified at the state capitol on tuesday and and spoke in favor of the plan we have been working on i believe in our work i believe in the power of community and the strength of our collective voices to make a better world for everyone elyse howard is the director of development for habitat vail valley learn how you can be part of the solution at habitatvailvalley org

ever since the age of the classical antiquity there was a widespread myth of the fabled sunken city of atlantis a true ancient metropolis that was in many ways the epitome of advanced civilization however the legends state that the city was lost sunk beneath the waves of the ocean never to be seen again of course this myth remained a myth as no credible evidence has been found yet no ruins and no exact location that could tell us that that the storied atlantis was an actual historic cities and it was exactly this lack of an exact location that prevented archaeologists from pursuing the legend of atlantis in greater detail still numerous likely locations were discovered over the decades many of them uncannily alike the descriptions of atlantis that were penned down by the classical greek writer plato one of these locations is in modern day tunisia could a tunisian atlantis be the long lost truth tunisia s largest salt lake chott el djerid in the middle of the country just inland from the mediterranean is said to be the most promising location for the tunisian atlantis dr brains gfdl 1 3 a tunisian atlantis isn t a new theory at all in the years prior to the outbreak of the second world war and even in decades that followed it there was a great interest in a tunisian atlantis many scholars and archaeologists proposed it as the possible location of the mythical atlantis of course over the millennia and centuries tunisia was home to some of europe s most advanced civilizations and cultures and was well known as a region to both the ancient greeks and ancient egyptians and the greek philosopher plato 420s 348 347 bc mentioned a specific location in ancient tunisia in his quest to solve the atlantis mystery 2 400 years ago archaeological excavations yielded evidence that tunisia was inhabited by humans as early as 100 000 years before present such evidence was discovered mostly in southern tunisia in particular at a site near the city of tozeur in the vicinity of some of the nation s many chotts and it is these chotts that will be crucial in the story of the tunisian atlantis but what are chotts in simplest terms a chott is an endorheic salt lake endorheic roughly means that it is stagnant water not flowing out to any other body of water in tunisia these chotts mostly dried up during the hot summer months and fill up with water when it was cooler and the tiny little springs began flowing into them again as salt lakes they are a great source of crude salt for the inhabitants of the region and can even be traversed during summer when a salty crust is formed over the muddy dredges where the lake was in the story of the tunisian atlantis one such chott plays an important role the chott el djerid chott el djerid known in arabic as šoṭṭ el jarīd is situated in the center of tunisia about 124 miles 200 kilometers west of the mediterranean coast where the town of gabès is located translated into english chott el djerid means lagoon of the land of the palms and it is exactly this that could stand for the first piece of evidence could that name be a hint to some ancient lagoon or oasis that stood on the site either way this chott is the largest salt pan in the country measuring some 2 700 square miles 7 000 square kilometers in area its unique dry landscape is iconic and was used as the filming location for tatooine home to anakin and luke skywalker and hideaway for obi wan kenobi in the star wars movie series but could this chott be hiding more secrets several researchers think this huge salt lake so close to the mediterranean holds the secrets of the tunisian atlantis tunisia s chott el djerid salt lake as the shooting location for tatooine home to both skywalker and hideaway for obi wan kenobi in the star wars movie series stefan krasowski cc by 2 0 paul borchardt ancient greeks and the hunt for atlantis it was in the 1920s that a scholar named albert herrmann proposed that chott el djerid is the site of the fabled atlantis he connected the salt lake with lake tritonis which was specifically mentioned by plato in his work centered on the lost city of atlantis lake tritonis greek τριτωνίδα λίμνην was described as a large body of fresh water located somewhere in north africa and was mentioned in several ancient texts mostly in classical greece what is more ancient greek writers all placed that lake somewhere in modern day south tunisia herodotus tells us that the lake had two islands one of which was colonized by the ancient greek lacedaemonians furthermore several ancient legends cite this lake as the place where the goddess athena was born it is also known that this lake had specially erected earthen dykes surrounding it designed to stop it from drying up however an ancient natural disaster collapsed these dykes thus sealing the fate of the lake and anyone who might have dwelt in it just like chott el djerid and just like the story of atlantis is this more than a coincidence another scholar from the 1920 s thought so doctor paul borchardt borchardt was a colorful jack of all trades although coming from a family of german jews paul borchardt quickly adopted theosophy and immersed himself in the occult works of mrs blavatsky in his youth he served with the german army in the first world war coming to prominence through his service in north africa as a spy and a pilot there he became fascinated with tunisia he returned to explore the country after the war it was during this time that he became convinced that tunisia is the undeniable location of ancient atlantis borchardt stated that the lost city might have stood somewhere between the dried up lake tritonis i e chott el djarid and the modern city of gabès on the tunisian coast gabès has very ancient roots and was known to the ancient greeks it lies at the mouth of the gulf of gabès and opens up directly to the vast mediterranean sea before it for many this seems like the ideal spot for a powerful ancient city and perhaps the tunisian atlantis during his research borchardt recorded the name for the nearby site as chott hammeina another dried salt lake that was perhaps an extension of the much larger chott el djarid paul borchardt deduced that this lake was once called lake of the atlantes formerly lake tritonis also he recorded that the local name for chott el djarid was bahr atala meaning the sea of atlas this and several other discoveries convinced borchardt that he discovered ancient atlantis making it the tunisian atlantis tunisia s chott el djerid salt lake is a big tourist attraction today but beneath these very sands may lie the ruins the tunisian atlantis goran jakus adobe stock the enigma of the dried up salt lakes of tunisia borchardt was at the head of a series of large excavations in the vicinity of modern gabès which yielded some interesting finds he found the ruins of an ancient city which could or could not be the remnants of the ancient city of tacapae as gabès was called remnants of a large irrigation canal and enormous concentric features he also believed that the fabled pillars of hercules that were said to have stood at the entrance to atlantis were actually found at the proposed temple of hercules that was to be found at the entrance to the dried up chotts furthermore dr paul borchardt discovered numerous linguistic connections chiefly the similarities between berber tribal names and the names of the fabled kings of atlantis for example plato stated that the founder of the royal house of atlantis was king euenor a name which borchardt connected to the name of uenur the mythical father of all berbers yet another striking coincidence or borchardt s highly elaborate theories were published in the 1920 s in several german science magazines notably a very detailed map proposing the site of tunisian atlantis was published in petermann s geographische mitteilungen in 1927 however his work related to atlantis ceased after the 1930s borchardt was caught up in the whirlwind of world war two imprisoned at dachau and later sent to the united states through an intervention he had connections amongst the germans and was also known to the british mi5 in the usa he was recruited as a spy for the germans through an odd turn of events and denounced his jewish background in favor of catholicism alas when the german spy ring in america was broken up around 1942 borchardt was caught and sentenced to 20 years in prison for espionage he was later granted early release and given a pension whether he ever returned to the matter of the tunisian atlantis remains unknown today these dried up chotts can be studied in greater detail and they show a striking glimpse into the geography of tunisia in the past a glimpse that tells us that the whole area could have been one great inland sea in ancient times the great number of these chotts and their size could mean that they were all once connected as a great sea this was proposed as early as 1883 by edward dumergue in his booklet the chotts of tunis in which he states that these chotts could be formed into one great inland sea extending from near biskra and chegga in algeria through tunis tunisia to the gulf of gabès about 300 miles in length and about 60 in breadth forming a new gulf into the mediterranean with an area somewhat greater than the irish sea another french geographer from the 1880 s étienne félix berlioux proposed the very same theory the 1200 bc mega earthquakes in the mediterranean mark the beginning of the late bronze age collapse that spelled the end of knossos pictured here and mycenae and troy and probably also atlantis vladimircaribb adobe stock a totally different ancient topography could this mean that the ancient city of atlantis was once situated at the head of a deep and protected gulf that opened up onto the mediterranean it is important to mention that ancient natural disasters could have greatly impacted the topography and geography of this area ancient greek historian diodorus siculus tells us that a catastrophic seismic event or earthquake struck north africa around 1250 bc this could be the same devastating earthquakes that contributed to the collapse of the bronze age around 1200 bc when civilizations and cities such as mycenae knossos and troy dwindled and collapsed in just 50 years could it be that ancient atlantis also suffered the same fate around this time some scholars propose that these devastating natural disasters were responsible for changing the topography of tunisia and cutting the great gulf off from the rest of the mediterranean eventually creating the numerous salt lakes that are now chotts in fact the central mediterranean is known for its geological instability making this theory quite reasonable in recent times other scholars also stand firmly by the theory that tunisia and more precisely chott el djarid is the site of ancient atlantis italian professor alberto arecchi is one of the modern proponents of this tunisian atlantis theory he states that the ancient inland sea in tunisia was to the ancient greeks known as the atlantic sea or atlantic ocean mentioned by plato and also agrees that the devastating seismic activity caused tunisia s giant inland sea to drain into the mediterranean and effectively disappear in 2018 charles a rogers also stood by the theory identifying modern tunisia as ancient atlantis whose capital city stood at the mouth of the triton river that flowed into lake tritonis through careful deduction of plato s reckoning of years rogers concluded that atlantis likely disappeared around the middle second millennium bc just like the other civilizations that mysteriously collapsed in the region in the bronze age and this year 2021 hong quan zhang of the university of tulsa came forward with an evidence based theory that places atlantis at the eastern end of chott el djarid the lost civilization of atlantis may well be the tunisian atlantis and if the chott salt lake theorists are right then atlantis lies beneath the sands of tunisia and not in any existing ocean depths fergregory adobe stock the eternally slumbering secrets of the atlanteans further evidence was offered in 2012 with numerous convincing links connecting the area of the chotts with atlantis for example they are accurately situated west of both egypt and greece as ancient sources claim furthermore herodotus wrote of atlanteans as peoples living near lake tritonis and mount atlas the latter still called so i e the atlas mountain range of north africa over fifteen diverse links were proposed including the fact that numerous local berber legends toponyms and folk deities relate to the myths of atlantis in the end there was never a conclusive discovery that could confirm definitely that atlantis is located in modern day tunisia somewhere near dried up chott el djarid but who knows what lies beneath that salty and marshy expanse of drought ridden land perhaps the ruins of a great and fabled ancient civilization slumber beneath the soil waiting for a chance discovery either way the coincidences are simply too many too count reaching the point where they are no longer coincidences but instead hard and uncontested facts is ancient atlantis one step from being unearthed or is it doomed to forever rest beneath the soils of tunisia and waves of the mediterranean we might never find out top image in summer tunisia s chott el djerid salt lake is almost entirely dried up as seen in this photo from may 2021 but many believe that beneath this sand lies the remains of tunisian atlantis source kais photographies cc by sa 4 0 by aleksa vučković

for some folks inequity is a non issue or a malady best left undiagnosed racism would disappear if only we stopped talking about it our nation s gaping wealth disparity would evaporate if people

mutate into variants we re tempting fate and a vaccine resistant strain the toll of covid 19 has become a metaphor for the indifference and outright contempt toward the oppressed the impoverished and people of color our disunity and inequity are killing us africa is the world s least vaccinated continent for reasons that have to do with a dearth of wealth lack of vaccine access inadequate healthcare infrastructure and something that should sound familiar to u s ears vaccine hesitancy when south africa warned the world of the newest coronavirus variant since dubbed omicron the world s immediate impulse was to isolate the nations of southern africa now we re learning that at least 16 other countries including our neighbor to the north canada have reported cases of the omicron variant and on tuesday the plot thickened as dutch health authorities announced that they detected the omicron variant within its borders before south africa sounded the alarm about the mutation it s interesting and i m being polite that the dutch unlike the south africans did not disclose their discovery before now the washington post reports that the earliest known cases are still in southern africa but it remains unclear where the mutation originated one in four south africans are fully vaccinated a rate that places it third on the continent behind morocco and tunisia according to the vaccine tracking of the new york times less than 1 of the democratic republic of the congo is fully vaccinated on a continent where around 10 have received one dose of vaccine according to the times there seems to have been no coherent strategy to immunize people in africa s 54 nations many of which lack the vaccine stock or health care infrastructure to effectively administer it perhaps the rest of the world has no use for africa beyond colonialism extraction and exploitation the world appears to think it can employ the usual barriers to reduce exposure to an undesirable element a strategically placed highway railroad tracks a wall or an ocean police officers border guards immigration policies or travel bans racism sexism or classism it doesn t have to be this way and it can t stay this way for most of the first year of this pandemic latinos in richmond va and neighboring henrico county were most likely to become sick and die from the virus but today nearly three out of four latinos are vaccinated making them the most vaccinated group in those jurisdictions their vaccination rate exceeds the state average a result of intentional efforts to expand vaccine access immunizing an entire continent is a more difficult lift but nothing good happens locally or globally without intentionality education and a plan the alternative is to continue staking out and jealousy guarding our separate positions on an ever crumbling terrain it s no way to live but it s a sure way to destabilize democracy feed inequity and sustain the virus through its various mutations perhaps donne no stranger to deadly plagues in his lifetime saw our moment coming but this about more than covid 19 systemic racism injustice poverty greed and gun violence are symptoms of a larger malady we are divided locally nationally and globally at a time when we desperately need to come together to address inequity in all its forms this virus is a reminder that none of us is beyond the reach of any catastrophe it would behoove us to embrace our common humanity before the bell tolls for thee williams censorship is being weaponized as a tool of exclusion school districts need to stop the book

pharma has been approved by the china national medical products administration nmpa for the treatment of adult patients with tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki resistant chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia cml cp or accelerated phase cml cml ap harboring the t315i mutation as confirmed by a validated diagnostic test an indication that has not been approved in the us developed by ascentage pharma with support from the national major new drug discovery and manufacturing program olverembatinib is a potentially best in class drug that will be co commercialized in china market by innovent and ascentage pharma for the benefit of more patients and their families as china s first third generation bcl abl tki developed for the treatment of tki resistant cml this approval fills an important treatment gap in t315i mutant cml and marks a major milestone signifying that ascentage pharma has successfully entered the commercial stage this approval for olverembatinib is based on the results from two pivotal phase ii studies the hqp1351cc201 study and the hqp1351cc202 study these results showed that olverembatinib is efficacious and well tolerated in patients with cml cp and cml ap and the probability and depth of clinical response is expected to increase with prolonged treatment period cml is a hematologic malignancy of the white blood cells the introduction of bcr abl tkis have significantly improved the clinical management of cml however acquired resistance to tkis remains a major challenge in the treatment of cml bcr abl tyrosine kinase mutations represent a key mechanism of acquired drug resistance t315i which is the most common drug resistant mutation occurs in about 25 of patients with drug resistant cml patients with t315i mutant cml are resistant to both first and second generation bcr abl inhibitors hence presenting an urgent unmet medical need for an effective treatment prof xiaojun huang md director of the institute of hematology peking university director of the hematology department at peking university people s hospital and a principal investigator of olverembatinib in china commented efficacy and safety data from studies to date have consistently showed that olverembatinib has enormous potential in effectively addressing the unmet medical need in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and is a drug with true best in class potential the clinical progress with this novel therapeutic has also received widespread interest from the global hematology community over the years i am excited that olverembatinib is now approved in china as it finally brings about a breakthrough to the clinical conundrum caused by drug resistance and a milestone in the treatment of cml in a broad sense this approval also signifies that china is rapidly emerging as a world leader in hematology clinical development prof qian jiang md deputy director of the hematology department at peking university people s hospital and another principal investigator of olverembatinib in china noted first and second generation tkis are ineffective in patients with t315i mutant cml cp and cml ap and drug resistant cml has long represented an urgent unmet clinical need this approval for olverembatinib bears great significance for doctors and patients as it offers a long awaited change to the treatment landscape in cml i am confident that the approval of olverembatinib will bring significant survival benefit and renewed hope to patients with cml dr yifan zhai chief medical officer of ascentage pharma president and ceo of healthquest pharma commented

look forward to collaborating with ascentage pharma for the co commercialization of olverembatinib in order to bring forth this novel drug to solve the unmet medical needs from chinese tki resistant t315i mutated cml patients as early as possible end about chronic myeloid leukemia chronic myeloid leukemia cml is a malignancy caused by the clonal proliferation of hematopoietic stem cell in the bone marrow also referred to as chronic myelocytic leukemia cml is one of the most common subtypes of chronic leukemia accounting for 15 of all leukemia cases in adults according to epidemiology data the onset of cml in chinese patients happens at a younger age than that in the west the median age of onset of cml in china is around 45 50 years old while it is 67 years old in the west bcr abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors tkis have significantly improved the clinical management of cml however acquired resistance to tkis remains a major challenge in the treatment of cml bcr abl tyrosine kinase mutations represent a key mechanism of acquired drug resistance t315i which is the most common drug resistant mutation occurs in about 25 of patients with drug resistant cml patients with t315i mutant

health officials in the netherlands today said they have detected the omicron b 1 1 529 variant in two samples collected before travel measures took effect raising the possibility of earlier and wider spread than originally thought as countries bar travel to southern african countries to assess the arrival of the new variant and attempt to limit its spread the head of the world health organization who today again pushed back on wide ranging travel bans in other developments companies that make vaccines and treatments are airing concerns about potential drops in effectiveness which today resulted in more stock market jitters netherlands probes earlier cases adds new details about flight test results in a statement today the netherlands national institute for public health rivm said that the samples that yielded the omicron variant were obtained on nov 19 and 23 before south africa announced its findings and before travel bans went into effect the samples were taken during municipal health service testing and investigations and contact tracing are under way rivm also provided more details about the results of covid 19 testing of 624 people returning from south africa who arrived at schiphol airport on nov 26 of 61 who tested positive for covid 19 14 had the omicron variant sequencing revealed different strains of the omicron variant suggesting that people were probably infected from different sources and locations meanwhile more countries reported omicron cases japan confirmed its first case which involves a namibian diplomat who arrived in japan on nov 28 before the country s travel ban went into effect officials said the man had been fully vaccinated and was asymptomatic upon his arrival in japan but developed a fever the next day in an update the european centre for disease prevention and control ecdc said 44 cases have now been detected by 11 european union and european economic area countries and so far the majority had a history of travel to african countries for cases with known clinical information all infections were asymptomatic or mild england reported 8 more cases bringing its total to 13 also the uk s health security agency said scotland has reported nine cases jenny harries the hsa s chief executive said officials expect to find more cases in the days ahead as investigations and contact tracing ramp up in response to omicron variant emergence uk experts are now recommending booster shots for everyone older than 18 and the government has implemented a mask mandate for public transport as well as shops banks and beauty parlors elsewhere canada reported three more cases including two from ottawa and one from quebec bringing its total to five who challenges travel bans releases new guidance in remarks at an information session for member states today who director tedros adhanom ghebreyesus phd said it s understandable that countries want to protect citizens from a variant that s not fully understood but i am equally concerned that several member states are introducing blunt blanket measures that are not evidence based or effective on their own and which will only worsen inequities he called on countries to take rational proportional steps in keeping with international health regulations in a related development the who today released new international travel advice given the omicron developments as of nov 28 58 had ordered travel bans due to the new variant the group urged countries to continue taking an evidence based approach emphasizing that blanket travel bans won t prevent international spread but may put a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods while punishing countries for quickly reporting epidemiologic and sequencing data the who urged countries to regularly review and update the travel measures as new evidence comes to light about omicron or any other variant wary outlooks for vaccines monoclonal antibody treatment though scientists don t have definitive answers about how well covid 19 vaccines will protect against the omicron variant with its large number of mutations some of them concerning officials from two vaccine companies signaled that existing ones might not be as effective and may need updated versions moderna s chief executive officer stephane bancel today told the financial times that based on his initial talks with scientists current vaccines might not protect as well as they did against delta and that it may take months to make variant specific vaccines his comments prompted financial market drops in the united states europe and asia according to the washington post meanwhile his counterpart at pfizer albert bourla on twitter today said following the company s experience with the beta and delta variants scientists came up with an approach to develop and produce variant versions of the vaccine in about 100 days if needed still we believe that the best hedge against spread of the omicron variant and any new variant that may emerge is getting all eligible people fully vaccinated and boosted as recommended he said regeneron maker of a monoclonal antibody treatment for covid 19 said in a statement today that though there s no direct evidence evaluating the impact of its treatment against the omicron variant it has some concerns it said earlier that in vitro analysis and modeling of individual mutations present in omicron point to possible reductions in neutralization activity both vaccine induced and from monoclonal antibodies delta developments though the world focused on the omicron variant threat the battle against delta driven surges continues especially in europe
traders in neon green vests weave through a crowd of well dressed high school students busy as bees tapping away at their handheld touch screens amid the frenzied activity a trio of seniors from lincoln pius x high school aly woita tenley heimes and payton tuttle flags one of them down they explain they d like to buy hundreds of shares of star food company an enterprise that has recently gone public after completing a multimillion dollar merger it s at 16 a share and we think it will go up woita says with all the confidence of a wall street investor with the flick of a wrist the trader records the purchase and moves on for the space of two hours on tuesday morning transactions like these are completed in a conference room at nebraska innovation campus that has been transformed into a frenetic stock exchange floor complete with tickers and calculators and slips of paper scribbled with orders but the millions of dollars exchanging hands aren t real these students from across the state are here buying and selling mock shares as part of the junior achievement stock market challenge in which teams compete to build the largest portfolio over a simulated trading period it s stressful the three pius x seniors say in unison as they busily jot down share counts and dollar figures and it s easy to see why the conference room turned stock exchange is a flurry of activity when the trading bell signals a new day teams both in person and virtual have 1 million to invest in shares of fictitious and sponsored companies over two months each day lasts 60 seconds the students fight for the attention of traders volunteers in vests who record the transactions while trying to follow the fast moving figures on ticker screens around the room the simulation includes news events too that can swing the market i think it s as real life to trading on the stock market as you re going to get said barb shanahan who brought 12 of her business students from wahoo public schools to lincoln those included wahoo seniors ben thrasher colin ludvik gavin pokorny and freshman sam marxsen who decided to diversify their portfolio they invested in cryptocurrency a dogecoin knockoff called pupper coin an oddly familiar sounding technology company called heyward parker and firespring a local company and one of the event s sponsors they see another company they like and decide to dish out more money for shares but the four start to learn the risks of investing too when their portfolio takes a hit later on you can t always trust the stock market marxsen jokes sometimes you have to take chances in the end a team competing virtually from yutan took the top prize followed by teams from lincoln southeast and ashland greenwood the top three finishers get to compete at the national competition while the top two receive scholarship money to unl a group of ryan psota s students from pius x won last year when the event was virtual this year it was nice to be back in person he said i think it s a real beneficial experience for the kids to get some hands on work with collaboration and looking at trends and seeing how the real life market works said psota who brings his senior economics students to the event each year they really enjoy the competition and just getting to see them interact with one another and making real life decisions is important getting a taste of how the stock market works can be hard to understand at first psota said some of it s a crapshoot early on and they don t know how diversified to be or if they ve been on one stock and it starts going south how soon do they sell it he said those kinds of things are interesting for them to figure out around 350 students competed in person while more than 650 video conferenced into the event according to tera norris president of junior achievement s lincoln division the disruption caused by the pandemic last year has actually been a blessing in disguise norris said since it opened up

listen to this article listen to this article washington chair jerome powell said tuesday that the federal reserve will consider acting more quickly to dial back its ultra low interest rate policies to counter higher inflation which powell acknowledged will likely persist well into next year the fed has begun reducing its monthly bond purchases which are intended to lower longer term borrowing costs at a pace that would end those purchases in june but powell made clear that fed officials will discuss paring those purchases more quickly when it next meets in mid december doing so would put the fed on a path to begin raising its key short term rate as early as the first half of next year a higher fed rate would in turn raise borrowing costs for mortgages credit cards and some business loans the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are high powell said at a senate banking committee hearing it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases perhaps a few months sooner powell said the fed should know more about the potential economic impact of the omicron variant of the coronavirus in time for that next meeting but he suggested that for now omicron hasn t been factored into the fed s economic outlook stock prices tumbled after powell s comments with the dow jones industrial average down about 1 5 in mid day trading many investors had hoped that powell would signal that the fed would put off any policy changes until the impact of the omicron variant had become clearer instead he suggested that the fed has taken a decisive turn toward reducing its economic stimulus the emergence of a potentially dangerous new covid 19 variant could make powell s job harder and more complicated next year if omicron leads to another wave of factory and port shutdowns in the united states and overseas and to a reversal of the back to office return for many workers americans might keep spending heavily on goods such as furniture appliances and cars that trend would likely worsen supply bottlenecks and raise prices even more at the same time the variant could renew fears among many workers about becoming infected on the job more resignations might then follow at a time when the rate of job quitting is already at record highs thereby magnifying labor shortages this would risk weakening the job market and the economy under such a scenario the fed s dual mandates of stable prices and maximum employment could come into conflict powell hinted at these trends in his testimony before the committee the recent rise in covid 19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation he said greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions under fire from some senate republicans about worsening consumer inflation which reached a three decade high last month powell acknowledged that price increases have been worse than the fed expected and will last longer than the policymakers initially thought as a result he said the term transitory no longer works as a description of inflation it s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean he said powell s comments come after other fed officials in recent weeks have said the central bank should consider winding down its ultra low interest rate policies more quickly than it currently plans they cited concerns about inflation which has jumped to three decade highs treasury secretary janet yellen also testified before the senate banking panel and urged congress to raise the nation s borrowing limit yellen has previously warned that without a hike in the debt ceiling the u s government could default on its debt obligations for the first time soon after dec 15 i cannot overstate how critical it is that congress address this issue yellen said america must pay its bills on time and in full if we do not we will eviscerate our current recovery congress is expected to address the borrowing limit and also faces a friday deadline to provide enough funding to keep the federal government open like this article gain access to all of our great content with a month to month subscription start your subscription here

by helen clark arancha gonzález susana malcorra and james michel auckland madrid victoria anse royale the ocean covers more than 70 per cent of our planet s surface produces half of the oxygen we breathe feeds billions of people and provides hundreds of millions of jobs it also plays a major role in mitigating climate change over 80 per cent of the global carbon cycle passes through the ocean but this precious natural resource is not invincible despite all the benefits it affords us the ocean today faces unprecedented man made crises that threaten its health and its ability to sustain life on earth the greatest threat to marine biodiversity is overfishing more than one third of global fish stocks are overfished and a further 60 per cent are fully fished each year governments around the world encourage overfishing by providing 22 billion in harmful fisheries subsidies although these subsidies are designed to help support coastal communities they instead prop up unsustainable and unprofitable fishing activity depleting the very resource on which local populations livelihoods depend this problem is not new in fact the world trade organisation s wto members have been trying to negotiate a deal to curb these damaging payments since 2001 world leaders reiterated their commitment to tackling the issue when they agreed in 2015 to the sustainable development goals sdgs under sdg 14 which aims to put a healthy ocean at the heart of the global sustainable development agenda leaders promised by 2020 to reach an agreement at the wto that would reduce fisheries subsidies but they missed the deadline as negotiations slowed during the worst of the covid 19 pandemic research shows that if wto members were to eliminate all harmful fisheries subsidies the most ambitious scenario global fish biomass could increase by 12 5 per cent by 2050 that is an additional 35 million metric tons of fish or more than four times north america s annual fish consumption in 2017 and this is a conservative estimate removing destructive subsidies really will mean more fish in the sea the aim is not to remove support from fishing communities but rather to redirect it in a more meaningful and less damaging way even if a deal does not eliminate all harmful subsidies it would create a global framework of accountability and transparency for subsidy programmes that in turn would spur dialogue between governments fishing communities and other stakeholders to spur the development of redesigned policies that better support fisherfolk while protecting our global commons moreover an agreement is within reach if the political will is there to deliver it the most recent lapse of the negotiations resulted from differences over how to structure flexibility in subsidy regimes for developing countries as well as how to define and enforce rules on illegal fishing and sustainable stocks but after numerous proposals and discussions the comprehensive draft now on the table combines measures to curb harmful subsidies with specific exceptions for developing countries with the start of the wto s 12th ministerial conference in geneva just days away now is the moment for a deal failure to conclude one would not only harm the ocean and the livelihoods of those who depend upon it but also would diminish the global rules based system and damage the pursuit of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in contrast ending harmful fisheries subsidies would reduce the cumulative pressures on the ocean and increase its resilience in the face of climate change in the wake of the united nations climate change conference cop26 in glasgow governments must demonstrate their willingness to use every tool at their disposal to tackle the climate crisis the stakes at the upcoming wto ministerial conference have perhaps never been higher the future of multilateral trade cooperation is at risk but above all jobs food security and the health of our global commons are on the line that is why 33 former government leaders and ministers from around the world have joined forces with nearly 400 scientists in urging wto members to harness their political mandate to protect the health of the ocean and the well being of society governments have given their word that they will curb destructive fisheries subsidies next week s meeting in geneva will test the credibility of that pledge

listen to this article listen to this article editor s note business content from the new york times will now be included with your subscription to finance commerce not a subscriber start your subscription here megan searfoss has been hoarding sneakers in connecticut searfoss the owner of two running stores in darien and ridgefield connecticut would normally have about 3 000 pairs of shoes in stock ahead of the holiday season but as she watched supply chain concerns in vietnam mount this summer and into the fall she secured a new storage facility and is now carrying around 4 100 pairs it s a costly gamble for searfoss who said she is extended about 165 000 more than she would typically be in november because of worries about potential shortages it s placing a big bet and anticipating that what all the analysts are saying is correct searfoss said usually we get through the new york city marathon and then we stop buying shoes we sell off what we have and go into january super super lean but we re being told not to do that because there s just not going to be any shoes the buildup of running shoes in connecticut is just one example of how supply chain woes and pandemic related shortages are affecting thousands of small businesses around the united states this holiday season while the widespread availability of vaccines is translating into a busier shopping season than last year businesses of all sizes are grappling with the impact from factory shutdowns overseas backups at ports and trucking and other labor shortages for many small businesses the unpredictability this year has forced them to make buying decisions months or weeks earlier than they normally would and to tie up more of their cash in inventory which can be risky the big thing is you really have to order in advance said dan quinn an owner of what we make a furniture business in algonquin illinois which sells tables and other wares through etsy i ve got 14 weeks of projects i need to get most of that material in house as fast as possible and keep buying it until you have a stockpile basically while many small businesses are affected by manufacturing issues overseas some have used this moment to their advantage etsy which powers online stores for millions of sellers said that more than half of its u s vendors source materials from within their own states allowing them to bypass many of the supply chain problems that are impacting the global economy etsy stores don t have the complex supply chains that are vulnerable to single points of failure josh silverman etsy s chief executive said in an interview still the range of shortages can manifest themselves in unusual ways isabel amigon owner of the online store sololi is still waiting on an order of christmas tree ornaments she placed in april the manufacturer alerted her that the order would be delayed because of a shortage in strings to tie on top of the decorated orbs amigon who is based in westchester county new york said that she was worried that if she didn t get them in time for the holiday season she would have to wait until next year to make use of the inventory the string shortage has also led her to remove specific home goods items from her website such as table runners and washcloths even if i get them by the end of november i won t be able to sell all of them because most people have already bought their ornaments amigon said i placed the orders early and i still have to face this situation other missing items are more traditional than string earlier this year angela and sean arnold were planning to order another set of disney princess dolls to fill some shelves in their toy store playmatters toys in pepper pike ohio but they got a notification in september from the distributor alerting them and other toy store owners that the items were indefinitely out of stock because the factory in vietnam where the dolls are manufactured was shut down because of a covid 19 outbreak even though they anticipated shipping delays and ordered some toys in mid may instead of august they could not get ahead of the global disruption and it s not only dolls the couple has been missing out on other toys and electronics because of shipping delays or disruptions in manufacturing plants in vietnam the couple has also been forced to raise prices on some products as they face higher transportation and wholesale costs from toy vendors some things we ordered in june and july are still coming in sean arnold said because of these kinds of delays etsy has viewed this moment as one in which small businesses can provide gift options that are not reliant on overseas factories and shipping extra consumer interest in small businesses whether online or offline would likely be welcome after the pandemic dealt a crippling blow to so many last year etsy said it had seen searches for living room furniture soar by 1 572 and less dramatic but significant jumps for dining tables checkers or chess boards suggesting that some shoppers are coming to the site rather than going to chain stores etsy learned how to better handle large surges in demand after face masks exploded as a category on the site during the onset of the pandemic and it has made improvements designed to mitigate shipping issues it experienced then silverman said that now virtually all items from sellers in the u s have an expected delivery date which was not the case a year ago and shoppers can filter products by geography to shop from vendors in their area which can help accelerate shipping the company also said it checks in with sellers to ensure they have enough raw materials and supplies when its technology observes jumps in demand for specific items quinn the owner of the furniture seller what we make has seen his business boom as americans grapple with long wait times and lack of availability for furniture from chains customers have been willing to wait 10 weeks for a dining table from him particularly after seeing 20 week waits at chains like west elm the big box stores don t have a lot of things they normally have so the positive for us is that people are sort of forced to look at other options whereas before they d settle for the simplest option he said still he has seen his business disrupted in other ways including a sharp increase in material prices and a scramble for reclaimed wood which typically comes from old barns the people who take down the barns for the material we use a lot of them ended up getting laid off or going on unemployment quinn said so we have had to try to stockpile material and order well in advance of what we used to do while quinn has been thriving in spite of competition from major furniture sellers the country s biggest retailers are often better equipped to handle supply chain issues than small businesses companies like walmart and amazon are massive enough that they can charter airplanes to obtain certain goods jeannine cook doesn t have that luxury cook the owner of harriett s bookshop in philadelphia noticed during the summer that publishers were having trouble delivering her book orders with some unable to even provide a timeline for when orders would arrive the problem became more widespread in late august cook who opened a second location in collingswood new jersey in july said that more customers were canceling their orders from the bookshop it makes me nervous because i don t want folks to feel like they can t get what they need or want cook said it s hard because we re already up against the big box companies that have so much more infrastructure than we do a recent study by adobe showed that out of stock messages in october more than quadrupled compared with october 2019 that s one reason that the retail industry including small businesses have urged the public to shop early this year to secure gifts for the holiday season i hate that we have now gone right from halloween to christmas said searfoss the proprietor of the running stores who said that she began holiday marketing on nov 1 for the first time i don t want people to feel frantic but i do think it s pretty serious that they re not going to get what they want this year she anticipated that shipping delays and out of stock issues at bigger chains might drive business to her stores people those days before christmas will be buying whatever they can from whatever local store they can she said it s just a little bit stressful for me thinking ok look at all that i ve bought searfoss said if i buy it will they come this

ralph nader last week called on attorney general merrick garland to take control of the 500 million compensation fund that grew out of the boeing deferred prosecution agreement attorney general merrick garland under that agreement boeing was required to pay the 500 million to the 346 victim families 1 45 million per victim the 500 million fund is separate and apart from the wrongful death cases now making their way through federal court in chicago boeing hired kenneth feinberg to make sure that each family received their 1 45 million share as you might have read recently some attorneys representing families of the victims of the boeing 737 max crashes are charging ten percent 145 000 00 or more to secure the 1 45 million each victim was guaranteed under the deferred prosecution agreement the justice department negotiated with boeing earlier this year under the trump administration nader wrote to garland some families have expressed outrage at this excessive fee charge especially since many attorneys are justifiably not charging anything for filling out paperwork and kenneth feinberg s law firm which boeing hired to administer the fund when requested has helped 25 of the families fill out the paperwork without charging anything i was surprised to hear from kenneth feinberg that the justice department has shown no interest in this matter of the disbursement of the 500 million set aside for the victims families by the deferred prosecution agreement especially since the agreement specifically gives the department s fraud section final say in the matter according to the boeing deferred prosecution agreement only the fraud section of the department of justice shall be empowered to make final decisions regarding a the individuals who should receive the victim payments from the crash victims beneficiaries compensation amount and b the compensation amounts that these victims should receive why then is the justice department saying no comment to inquiring reporters nader asked as of last week ken feinberg had disbursed funds to 211 of the 346 families i urge you to take charge of this matter and make sure that the lawyers representing the remaining 135 families do not take a percentage fee nader wrote i have urged ken feinberg to help these remaining families fill out the necessary paperwork as he did with 25 other pro se families and i urge you to have the lawyers who charged the 145 000 return that money to the families you should exercise the authority granted to you in the deferred prosecution agreement and return the funds justifiably due to the victims families nader wrote in a separate letter to feinberg nader asked since boeing is required to pay all of your expenses why couldn t your office have done these form filing services without charge to the claimants if there were a few complications as you said in somalia local counsel could be retained at boeing s expense it seems that some of these charging lawyers are justifying this overreach to put it mildly by referring to you as the authority for what is a reasonable fee e g ten percent or 145 000 plus a similar percentage earlier on the 150 000 if that was the case this should bring you to a reconsideration of this development and whether this should lead to a different kind of advisory from your office there are knowledgeable people in legal ethics who believe that the ten percent lawyers should be refunding that sum minus a few by the hour charges what makes this story so heartbreaking ken is that it comes after a sweetheart settlement by the department of justice dashing the expectations of the families for punitive justice on the company and its top culpable officials they then receive in toto a far smaller sum than did the airlines already the recipients of some 50 billion in pandemic subsidies in spite of 45 billion in stock buybacks over a few past years then comes the carve out from lawyers at levels that can only be called larcenous you ve had to deal over the years with many sticky issues inside the personal tragedies that require judgment calls which are not easy to make i urge you to put your experience and sense of equity to work to produce restitutions that are clearly equitable and needed for those families not yet in receipt of their awards you can forestall the ten percent problem and proactively provide pro se services after all your calls are not always entirely excellent and perfect no one is perfect mistakes under pressure are understandable nader wrote let s hear from you corporate crime reporter contacted both the justice department and feinberg s office for comment on the story and to get a list of lawyers involved and how much they charged their clients to secure the 1 45 million the justice department did not respond to an inquiry feinberg asked that we call before deadline which we did we wanted to question feinberg about his claim on the boeing compensation fund web site that the attorneys fees should not be excessive but how can he know whether the fees are excessive or not if he doesn t know what the fees are which is what feinberg claimed to nader i can t speak at all about the letter to merrick garland feinberg said that s beyond my jurisdiction as for the letter i received from ralph nader i will tell you on the record that ralph nader is a great american he has transformed the american legal system and i m always glad to receive a letter from ralph nader and i ll take the letter under advisement that s it okay thank you feinberg said wait a second before you go you say the attorneys fees should not be excessive how would you know whether or not they are excessive if you don t know what they are i have nothing further to add feinberg said i did not want you to write a sentence in any story saying feinberg did not respond i responded and that s my statement feinberg said i have no comment on the details other than to say i m always pleased to receive a letter from ralph nader we have interviewed feinberg s law partner camille biros in detail in the past about the boeing case will camille biros answer some of these questions no feinberg said she will just refer you to ken s on the record quote about ralph nader you are not going to release the list of the lawyer fees you have my statement feinberg said

for some folks inequity is a non issue or a malady best left undiagnosed racism would disappear if only we stopped talking about it our nation s gaping wealth disparity would evaporate if people simply worked harder or smarter unequal access to medical treatment is not nearly as dangerous as allowing socialism to encroach upon our health care system too many of us refuse to wear a mask or get vaccinated one political party appears incapable of crafting a response to a deadly virus that doesn t inject yet another potentially lethal dose of politics into our national bloodstream in the name of personal freedom no man is an island the poet john donne wrote nearly four centuries ago and yet here we are today on our separate islands buffeted by the storm winds of a pandemic and threatened with eventual inundation as a result of global warming we ve allowed the vast majority of a continent to go unvaccinated in the midst of a global pandemic creating a huge haven for the coronavirus to mutate into variants we re tempting fate and a vaccine resistant strain the toll of covid 19 has become a metaphor for the indifference and outright contempt toward the oppressed the impoverished and people of color our disunity and inequity are killing us africa is the world s least vaccinated continent for reasons that have to do with a dearth of wealth lack of vaccine access inadequate healthcare infrastructure and something that should sound familiar to u s ears vaccine hesitancy when south africa warned the world of the newest coronavirus variant since dubbed omicron the world s immediate impulse was to isolate the nations of southern africa now we re learning that at least 16 other countries including our neighbor to the north canada have reported cases of the omicron variant and on tuesday the plot thickened as dutch health authorities announced that they detected the omicron variant within its borders before south africa sounded the alarm about the mutation it s interesting and i m being polite that the dutch unlike the south africans did not disclose their discovery before now the washington post reports that the earliest known cases are still in southern africa but it remains unclear where the mutation originated one in four south africans are fully vaccinated a rate that places it third on the continent behind morocco and tunisia according to the vaccine tracking of the new york times less than 1 of the democratic republic of the congo is fully vaccinated on a continent where around 10 have received one dose of vaccine according to the times there seems to have been no coherent strategy to immunize people in africa s 54 nations many of which lack the vaccine stock or health care infrastructure to effectively administer it perhaps the rest of the world has no use for africa beyond colonialism extraction and exploitation the world appears to think it can employ the usual barriers to reduce exposure to an undesirable element a strategically placed highway railroad tracks a wall or an ocean police officers border guards immigration policies or travel bans racism sexism or classism it doesn t have to be this way and it can t stay this way for most of the first year of this pandemic latinos in richmond va and neighboring henrico county were most likely to become sick and die from the virus but today nearly three out of four latinos are vaccinated making them the most vaccinated group in those jurisdictions their vaccination rate exceeds the state average a result of intentional efforts to expand vaccine access immunizing an entire continent is a more difficult lift but nothing good happens locally or globally without intentionality education and a plan the alternative is to continue staking out and jealousy guarding our separate positions on an ever crumbling terrain it s no way to live but it s a sure way to destabilize democracy feed inequity and sustain the virus through its various mutations perhaps donne no stranger to deadly plagues in his lifetime saw our moment coming but this about more than covid 19 systemic racism injustice poverty greed and gun violence are symptoms of a larger malady we are divided locally nationally and globally at a time when we desperately need to come together to address inequity in all its forms this virus is a reminder that none of us is beyond the reach of any catastrophe it would behoove us to embrace our common humanity before the bell tolls for thee williams censorship is being weaponized as a tool of exclusion school districts need to stop the book

this world aids day as part of the hiv in view campaign viiv healthcare releases survey data highlighting outdated attitudes and beliefs about hiv despite advances in treatment and care london business wire pervasive stigma and prejudice towards people living with hiv continues to persist according to a new international survey released today on world aids day funded by viiv healthcare the global specialist hiv company majority owned by glaxosmithkline plc gsk with pfizer inc and shionogi limited as shareholders the survey uncovers outdated attitudes and inherent bias amongst the general public towards people living with hiv an overwhelming majority 88 of respondents believe there are still negative perceptions towards people living with hiv even though it can now be effectively managed with antiretroviral arv medication concerningly almost a third 30 of people surveyed incorrectly believe hiv can be transmitted through kissing the survey conducted online by the harris poll surveyed 5 047 adults across four countries australia portugal united kingdom and united states data revealed that over three quarters 76 of adults who responded are unaware that a person living with hiv who is taking effective treatment cannot pass hiv on to their sexual partners due to the virus being at a level that is undetectable in their blood 1 in recent years an overwhelming body of clinical evidence has firmly established the undetectable untransmittable u u concept as scientifically sound yet outdated misconceptions still exist this survey reinforces the importance of anti stigma campaigns such as hiv in view a collaboration between viiv healthcare and shutterstock studios to establish the largest online photo library of people living with hiv hiv in view features empowering images that authentically portray the reality of living with hiv today far from reflecting the fear once associated with hiv the gallery is filled with inspiring examples of just how much things have changed for many people living with hiv commenting on the survey results silvia petretti ceo of positively uk a peer led charity which aims to improve health and quality of life for people with hiv and participant in the photography collaboration said over the past four decades we ve seen incredible progress in the hiv response yet as this new survey clearly demonstrates there are still many misconceptions around hiv i am proud to have taken part in the hiv in view photography project to show that people living with hiv can live fulfilling healthy lives i hope hiv in view helps people to understand the reality of living with hiv and removes hiv related prejudice seen in the survey results the hiv community has made tremendous strides in tackling stigma and bias faced by people living with hiv yet it is alarming to see the level of misunderstanding and inherent bias uncovered by this new survey says deborah waterhouse chief executive officer viiv healthcare we often hear from the hiv community that interactions with friends family the general public and even healthcare providers sometimes feel fractured due to misinformation misconceptions and the inherent bias held towards people living with hiv our hope is that through anti stigma campaigns such as hiv in view we can change the way the world views hiv so that one day we can finally dismantle pervasive stigma for good download the gallery here to be a part of changing the way the world views hiv about the survey this survey was conducted online by the harris poll on behalf of viiv healthcare from

in this oct 28 2020 file photo twitter ceo jack dorsey appears on a screen as he speaks remotely during a hearing before the senate commerce committee on capitol hill in washington pool photo via ap jack dorsey is out of his post as twitter s chief executive for the second time in his career this time he says by choice dorsey who co founded the company offered no specific reasons for his resignation monday beyond an abstract argument that twitter where he s spent 16 years in various roles should break away from its founding and founders dependence on company founders he wrote is severely limiting he will be succeeded by twitter s current chief technology officer parag agrawal a choice wall street analysts seemed to welcome seeing him as a safe choice who will usher the company into what s widely seen as the internet s next era the metaverse investors were less sure sending twitter s stock 3 lower dorsey was the social platform s first ceo in 2007 until he was forced out the following year then returned to the role in 2015 he is known for his relaxed demeanor for his sometimes massive beard that s the subject of several parody twitter accounts and for silicon valley eccentricities that include dabbling in silent retreats intermittent fasting cryptocurrencies and blockchain he leaves twitter at a crossroads the service changed american politics journalism and culture but it also it turns out had a darker side and has been exploited for years by people who want to harass other people and spread falsehoods about other individuals about groups of individuals about the state of democracy said paul barrett deputy director at the new york university stern center for business and human rights in a letter posted on his twitter account dorsey said he was really sad yet really happy about leaving the company and that it was his decision dorsey sent the first tweet on march 21 2006 that read just setting up my twttr twitter went through a period of robust growth during its early years but as its expansion slowed the san francisco company began tweaking its format in a bid to make it easier and more engaging to use while it never rivaled facebook in size twitter became a primary conduit for political discourse and journalism for better and for worse he will remain on the board until his term expires in 2022 agrawal joined twitter in 2011 and has been cto since 2017 dorsey expressed confidence in agrawal and new board chairman bret taylor who is president and chief operating officer of the business software company salesforce twitter was caught up in the heated political atmosphere leading up to the 2020 election particularly when it banned former president donald trump following his incitement of the jan 6 riot at the u s capitol dorsey defended the move saying trump s tweets after the event resulted in a risk to public safety and created an extraordinary and untenable circumstance for the company trump sued the company along with facebook and youtube in july alleging censorship critics argued that twitter took too long to address hate speech harassment and other harmful activity on its platform particularly during the presidential campaign publicly dorsey has signaled that he understood twitter s need to change in a series of tweets in 2018 he said the company was committed to collective health openness and civility of public conversation and to hold ourselves publicly accountable towards progress we have witnessed abuse harassment troll armies manipulation through bots and human coordination misinformation campaigns and increasingly divisive echo chambers we aren t proud of how people have taken advantage of our service or our inability to address it fast enough he wrote the company adopted more stringent content moderation standards and other changes barrett said and that s all to the good but it s not perfect and it s nowhere close to perfect dorsey has faced several distractions as ceo starting with the fact that he s also founder and ceo of the payments company square some big investors have questioned whether he could effectively lead both companies since twitter went public in 2013 its stock has been sluggish it closed at 41 on its first day of trading eight years ago on monday it ended the day at 45 78 square has enjoyed far greater financial success with dorsey at the helm its stock which began trading in 2015 around 13 closed monday above 212 last year twitter came to an agreement with two of those activist investors that kept dorsey in the top job and gave a seat on the company board to elliott management corp which owned about 4 of twitter s stock and another to the silver lake private equity firm agrawal is a safe pick who should be looked upon as favorably by investors wrote cfra research analyst angelo zino who noted that elliott had pressured dorsey to step down elliott released a statement monday saying agrawal and taylor were the right leaders for twitter at this pivotal moment for the company while twitter has high profile users like politicians and celebrities and is a favorite of journalists its user base lags far behind old rivals facebook and youtube and newer ones such as tiktok it has just over 200 million daily active users a common industry metric agrawal is far less known than dorsey he previously worked at microsoft yahoo and at t in research roles at twitter he s worked on machine learning revenue and consumer engineering and audience growth an immigrant from india he studied at stanford university and the indian institute of technology in bombay as ceo he will have to step out from his largely technical background and confront social and political issues including misinformation abuse and effects on mental health agrawal got a fast introduction to life as ceo of a company that s one of the central platforms for political speech conservatives quickly unearthed a tweet he sent in 2010 that read if they are not gonna make a distinction between muslims and extremists then why should i distinguish between white people and racists as some twitter users pointed out the 11 year old tweet quoted a segment on the daily show which was referencing the firing of journalist juan williams who made a comment about being nervous about muslims on an airplane twitter did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment on the tweet barrett said dorsey s founder ceo peers notably facebook ceo mark zuckerberg should take heed it would be wise for the founding generation to actually give up control on a day to day basis of these entities sooner than they tend to do i think there s a natural tendency to want to hold on to your baby and guide and shape it he said but it s a very different role coming up with the idea in the first place and refining it in its very earliest years and then running it when it becomes something that has hundreds of millions of users
