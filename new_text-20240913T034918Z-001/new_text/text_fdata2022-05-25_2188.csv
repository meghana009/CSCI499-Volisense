plans like 401 k s americans on the cusp of retiring are facing a tough choice as they watch their nest eggs shrink stay the course or keep working a stock market slump this year has taken a big bite out of investors portfolios including retirement plans like 401 k s the s p 500 the benchmark for many index funds is down about 17 since its all time high in early january the sharp reversal after a banner 2021 for wall street has been particularly unsettling for those who have been planning to retire sooner rather than later and banking on a healthier stock portfolio to help fund their post work lifestyle it doesn t help that the cost of everything from gasoline to food is up sharply amid the highest inflation since the 1970s and that the federal reserve s recipe for fighting inflation hiking interest rates has heightened fears the u s economy will slide into a recession all of that is bad news for corporate earnings growth which is a key driver of stock prices the market skid has financial planners hearing more often from anxious clients seeking advice and reassurance in equal measure they say some clients are opting to push back their retirement date in hopes that will buy time for their investments to bounce back meanwhile retirees already tapping their investments may have to consider beefing up their savings with a part time job or putting off major travel or spending plans from late 2020 through 2021 we saw a wave of clients retire because of the large gains in the stock market and because they no longer wanted to work in the covid new normal work environment said mark rylance a financial planner in newport beach california this year half the clients who discussed retirement opted to still retire while the other half decided to hold off he said historically the stock market has tended to deliver positive returns within a year following steep declines but unlike younger investors who can ride out wall street s sharp swings workers closing in on retirement don t have as much time to make up losses from hefty market downturns i am a little afraid i don t want to work until i m 70 said nancy roberts a librarian in meridian idaho the 60 year old is counting on her ira to fund her retirement which is a little over 4 years away but the market decline has her feeling stressed i do know i ve lost money but i m trying not to freak out and look at it every day she said many soon to be retirees are also terrified about inflation which can be devastating over decades said mark struthers a financial adviser with sona wealth advisers in st paul minneapolis social security has a built in inflation adjustment but it doesn t keep up with real inflation and pensions which far fewer workers have these days often max out the inflation adjustment at 1 5 he said compounding is magical when it is working for you but devastating when it s working against you struthers said he advises retirees who are worried about getting by on their savings to be willing to cut back on spending on big ticket items that could mean taking a big vacation every other year instead of annually or waiting 10 years rather than 7 to buy a new car struthers also strongly recommends that retirees work part time when stocks are in a downward spiral investors traditionally shift money into bonds which are less risky than stocks but bonds have not been a refuge from losses lately high inflation has made bonds and the fixed payments they make less attractive one index of high quality u s bonds has lost more than 9 so far this year despite the market s decline investors like mark bendell in boca raton florida are sticking to their retirement timeline the engineer decided early in 2021 that he would retire before the end of this year the 62 year old reviewed his finances with a financial adviser and came away confident he would be able to live off his nest egg which includes a 401 k plan he s been contributing to for about 34 years a small pension savings and social security his wife laurie a teacher plans to retire next year not that watching the stock market plunge hasn t been difficult i have a stiff drink about a couple of times a week and then i take a look at my investments bendell said i don t look as much as when the market was climbing other than tweaking his 401 k to make sure it wasn t heavily invested in more speculative holdings bendell hasn t made any major changes to his investment strategy since he started his retirement countdown clock i stayed the course he said trying to time the market doesn t work and i believe that that approach even during big market slumps is typical among investors with 401 k s or iras a fidelity investments review of 24 000 retirement investment plans found that only 5 6 of people with a 401 k made a change to their plan s allocation in the first quarter that compares to 5 3 in the last three months of 2021 and 6 4 in the first quarter last year the company said the set it and forget it strategy helped but didn t shield investors entirely from losses this year the average fidelity 401 k plan balance stood at 127 100 in the first quarter down 2 from a year ago and off 7 from the fourth quarter wall street has been racking up gains more often than losses over the past decade the market plunged 34 in march 2020 at the height of the pandemic lockdowns and climbed to new highs a few months later last year the s p 500 scored its third best performance in the last decade delivering a total return of nearly 29 including dividends that s why americans who ve long been socking away money into 401ks and other retirement investment accounts are likely still well ahead consider the 1 7 million investors who have had a 401 k through fidelity the past 10 years saw their balance soar by an average of nearly fivefold to 383 100 however as of the end of 2019 only about 60 million employed americans had a 401 k plan according to the investment company institute an association representing investment funds previous years stock market gains are hard to keep in perspective when one s retirement account balance shrinks by the day however having the bulk of her retirement savings in her ira as the market declined has been unnerving said roberts the librarian from meridian so she s leaving it in the hands of her financial adviser who sends her regular updates and has moved some of her money from higher risk investments into mutual funds they ll move some money to cash if they have to temporarily she said roberts works four days a week at a library spending the rest of the week caring for her elderly mother and taking her to doctor s appointments if she had to she could try to work five days a week though it would be a strain

district court relating to the company s copper world project in arizona the district court ruled in favour of hudbay on all issues including that copper world and rosemont are not connected under the national environmental policy act nepa and therefore that the army corps of engineers acoe does not have an obligation to include copper world as part of its nepa review of rosemont the district court also granted hudbay s motion to dismiss the copper world preliminary injunction request filed by the plaintiffs in the two lawsuits challenging the section 404 clean water act permit for rosemont on the basis that the lawsuits are moot after the company surrendered its 404 permit back to the acoe in april 2022 the acoe has never determined that there are jurisdictional waters of the u s on the

plan with the first phase reflecting a standalone operation with processing infrastructure on hudbay s private land and mining occurring on portions of the deposits located on patented mining claims the first phase is expected to require only state and local permits and is expected to reflect an approximate 15 year mine life the second phase of the mine plan is expected to extend the mine life and incorporate an expansion onto federal lands to mine the entire rosemont and copper world deposits the second phase would be subject to the federal permitting process the company believes the district court s decision together with the may 12 2022 decision from the 9th circuit court of appeals clarifies the permitting path for copper world including the requirements to receive federal permits for the second phase under existing mining regulations hudbay expects the pea to demonstrate robust economics for this low cost long life copper project delivering the copper needed for

washington brian p brooks today released the following statement on becoming acting comptroller of the currency i am deeply honored to serve my country as acting comptroller of the currency and lead this important and prestigious agency during this challenging time over the past several months the federal banking system has been integral to the nation s response to covid 19 it has been a central means to deliver relief to businesses and consumers and has continued to function admirably under significant stress banks and savings associations entered this crisis well positioned to play this important role they remain a source of strength for the economy and an engine of opportunity the nation can rely on the federal banking system due in large part to the 3 600 men and women of the office of the comptroller of the currency who have maintained a flexible regulatory framework in which banks can evolve to meet the needs of their communities rigorously examined banks to ensure their safe sound and fair operation and when necessary exercised our authority to enforce corrective action an agency with a 157 year history understands covid 19 s seemingly long shadow is temporary while managing through its effects will take significant focus and effort we must not lose sight that we aim toward a longer brighter purpose we should approach our work not just with an eye to the next year but to ensure the federal banking system adapts to the changing needs of consumers markets and the nation for the next 50 or 100 years the agency can take both the long view and meet the challenges facing banks today by focusing on four priorities 1 build upon responsible innovation to help the banking system keep up with changes in the way american consumers and businesses manage their finances 2 enhance the strength of the federal banking system by enhancing the scope and relevance of the national charter 3 ensure banks serve their entire community through fair access to credit capital and financial services and 4 provide occ employees engaging rewarding and challenging career opportunities build upon responsible innovation to help the banking system keep up with changes in the way american consumers and businesses manage their finances innovation is a personal passion of mine and the occ can build on its foundation of innovation to provide banks and thrifts the regulatory certainty the flexible framework and oversight that allows them to evolve and capitalize on technology and innovation to deliver better products and services to operate more efficiently and to reduce risk in the system some of that work includes defending our authority to issue bank charters that support companies ability to engage in the business of banking on a national scale including taking deposits lending money or paying checks we should support banks use of new technology products and models that safely and fairly accelerate the velocity of money create greater financial inclusion and empower consumers and businesses with more control over their financial affairs enhance the strength of the federal banking system by enhancing the scope and relevance of the national charter covid 19 reminded us that challenges facing a nation often rely on a national strategy response and capability for our collective good lincoln understood this when he created a system of national banks in 1863 to unify our republic provide for interstate commerce and solidify a national currency with the country s full faith and credit behind it hamilton understood this too although lin manuel miranda gave it a better melody and educated a generation about the centrality of national banks to the collective prosperity of a nation maintaining that system requires vigilance and care but we also have to remember that we are not curating a history museum we re overseeing a system that has to be responsive to the needs of americans in this generation and the next as the administrator of the federal banking system we have a responsibility to defend the authority and the powers congress granted that enable the federal banking system to evolve to harness the power of rapidly changing technologies and financial markets to support a nationwide economy and to serve local needs we will work to clarify what true lender means to underscore that the terms of a lawfully made contract remain valid for the duration of that contract even if it is sold by a bank to another investor and to specify what the parameters of the fintech charter and other special purpose charters should be ensure banks serve their entire community through fair access to credit capital and financial services if the first two priorities provide the bedrock on which a federal banking system can thrive the third priority focuses on why they exist at all to serve their entire community last week the occ acted to strengthen community reinvestment act rules which will encourage banks to lend and invest more and to make assessing how well banks serve their entire community more disciplined and consistent but there is more to it than that section 324 of the dodd frank act clarifies that the occ mission includes ensuring fair access to financial services and fair treatment of customers by the institutions and other persons subject to its jurisdiction fair access has come under attack whether under the disreputable practice of choke point or under the guise of reputation risk we should not tolerate lawful entities being denied access to our federal banking system based on their popularity among a powerful few that is a dangerous and untenable practice that we will work to correct provide occ employees engaging rewarding and challenging career opportunities our success in ensuring banks operate in a safe sound and fair manner relies entirely on the men and women who serve the nation examining banks every day to assess their health promote their compliance with laws and regulations and provide sage counsel and insight that only the nation s preeminent prudential supervisor can it is service at its finest and i am proud to work alongside such dedicated and professional people the occ executive committee and i will do everything in our power to provide a world class place for occ employees to work that delivers the resources and support necessary to successfully oversee the world s most respected banking system these priorities will guide our effort over the months ahead and will ensure a safe sound and fair federal banking system will help banks better serve the consumers businesses and communities that rely upon them and will promote growth and economic opportunity particularly for main street america i congratulate joseph otting the 31st comptroller of the currency and my friend on a successful tour and on the many accomplishments the agency achieved under his stewardship i am also grateful to secretary of the treasury steven mnuchin for his leadership and his confidence in giving me this rare and august responsibility

editors note this story and interview with the reload s stephen gutowski were conducted before today s shooting at robb elementary school in uvalde texas in which 14 students and a teacher were killed in light of this horrific news there s another very big question surrounding the nra s annual meeting in houston namely whether it will still take place at all we ve reached out to the nra s public affairs office for comment and will update if and when we hear back advertisement the 151st annual meetings of the national rifle association kick off this friday in houston texas and bearing arms will be on the ground all weekend long covering the action from friday s nra ila leadership forum including an appearance from former president donald trump to monday s meeting of the nra s board of directors where former board member allen west hopes to become the group s next executive vice president and current evp wayne lapierre hopes that board members will continue to stand by his leadership we re previewing this weekend on today s bearing arms cam co with the reload s stephen gutowski and in our conversation we ended up focusing on several big questions starting with this one 1 how many people will show up this is the first full scale nra annual meeting to be held since 2019 with the 2020 and 2021 meetings cancelled over covid concerns pre pandemic nra annual meetings were routinely drawing northwards of 80 000 members in the years before the covid 19 virus led to the shuttering of most large scale events and while i would be shocked if the nra sets a new attendance record this year the fact that most of us are trying to adjust to a world where covid is endemic could lead to a smaller than expected decline in attendance i d argue that conservative leaning gatherings are also less susceptible to large declines in attendance than events put on by left leaning outfits this year s shot show in las vegas for example hosted about 43 000 attendees which was down slightly from the 55 000 or so who attended in 2020 compare that to the attendance at the consumer electronics show also held in vegas which declined by almost 75 between 2020 and 2022 advertisement the nra s great american outdoor show in harrisburg pennsylvania took in more than 165 000 visitors during its nine day run this year down from 179 000 in 2020 when the show was last held so i don t think we re looking at that steep a drop for nra s attendance even with the controversies surrounding the group s leadership and the fact that the annual meetings will be taking place over the memorial day holiday my semi educated guess is somewhere between 70 80 000 attendees over this coming weekend and i wouldn t be surprised if it was closer to the high end of that figure 2 what will trump say actually gutowski and i didn t spend much time on this particular question during our conversation but it s still one of this weekend s big storylines what will be on trump s mind as he addresses nra members well i doubt we re going to hear a full throated defense of his bump stock ban or an endorsement of georgia gov brian kemp but other than that the possibilities are endless i don t expect trump to announce a 2024 presidential run but there ll likely be plenty of hints in that direction along with well deserved jabs at joe biden s war on legal gun owners and the firearms industry i would also expect that trump would talk up his judicial appointments including the confirmation of two supreme court justices especially as we re all waiting with anticipation for what the supreme court will say in its pending decision in the new york carry case advertisement 3 who wins the fight for executive vice president this is undoubtably the biggest issue heading into the nra annual meeting though perhaps not the biggest question both gutowski and i agree that wayne lapierre is likely to remain as executive vice president of the organization despite a challenge by former board member allen west who announced his candidacy a couple of weeks ago in an open letter to board members west never mentioned lapierre by name and in fact said that he s not running against anyone including the sitting evp i have answered the call to run for executive vice president of the nra for only one reason to serve the members and restore the trust and confidence of the membership in the organization i am not running against anyone which is an absurd supposition i am running for the preservation of the nra and the restoration of its honor integrity and character my objective is simple a return to our core competencies of marksmanship training and programs along with protection of our second amendment rights the blog nra in danger which has called for lapierre s removal by the board for some time also posted an email purportedly from nra board member marion hammer to her fellow board members urging them to stay the course anytime your fellow board members abandon truth and honor in favor of self serving agendas for personal and financial gain it is not only sad but deserving of contempt for them to be trying to take down wayne la pierre a man who has done so much for nra gun rights preserving the second amendment and protecting freedom in america is about low as it gets then along comes allen west a man with more failures to his professional credit than anyone would ever imagine pretending to ride in on a white horse to save the day what i see is a hungry man desperately in need of a job riding in on a jackass to try to take down a second amendment hero and gut the nra does this sound like a man you want representing you and nra advertisement as gutowski explains this particular fight will take place largely outside the view of most members the nra board meetings will take place on monday after the exhibits and acres of guns and gear have been packed away but we could see some fireworks on saturday morning during the official members meeting when members will have the opportunity to present resolutions on a number of topics including lapierre s continued tenure the members themselves won t be casting a vote on whether or not lapierre remains on the job however that duty is relegated to board members themselves and last year board member rocky marshall only received two votes in his challenge to lapierre s leadership with the vast majority of the board members in attendance voting to stick with the status quo gutowski says the nra members that he spoke to in harrisburg continue to support the organization though almost everyone has something they wish the group was doing differently a greater emphasis on firearms training was a common thread of great american outdoor show attendees according to the reload founder if there is a genuine groundswell of members calling for change this weekend monday s vote could get very interesting but at this point i d put the odds of wayne lapierre remaining as evp higher than 50 for many attendees the drama surrounding the board s vote won t even register they re coming to take in the sights and sounds of the annual meeting gather together with tens of thousands of their fellow second amendment supporters and have a good time after the past two years of covid craziness we ll be covering it all here on bearing arms beginning on friday and we ll have on the ground coverage throughout the weekend as well

toronto may 24 2022 globe newswire hudbay minerals inc hudbay or the company tsx nyse hbm received a favourable decision from the u s district court for the district of arizona district court relating to the company s copper world project in arizona the district court ruled in favour of hudbay on all issues including that copper world and rosemont are not connected under the national environmental policy act nepa and therefore that the army corps of engineers acoe does not have an obligation to include copper world as part of its nepa review of rosemont the district court also granted hudbay s motion to dismiss the copper world preliminary injunction request filed by the plaintiffs in the two lawsuits challenging the section 404 clean water act permit for rosemont on the basis that the lawsuits are moot after the company surrendered its 404 permit back to the acoe in april 2022 the acoe has never determined that there are jurisdictional waters of the u s on the copper world site and hudbay has independently concluded through its own scientific analysis that there are no such waters in the area in april 2022 the company commenced early site works at copper world with initial

phase reflecting a standalone operation with processing infrastructure on hudbay s private land and mining occurring on portions of the deposits located on patented mining claims the first phase is expected to require only state and local permits and is expected to reflect an approximate 15 year mine life the second phase of the mine plan is expected to extend the mine life and incorporate an expansion onto federal lands to mine the entire rosemont and copper world deposits the second phase would be subject to the federal permitting process the company believes the district court s decision together with the may 12 2022 decision from the 9th circuit court of appeals clarifies the permitting path for copper world including the requirements to receive federal permits for the second phase under existing mining regulations hudbay expects the pea to demonstrate robust economics for this low cost long life copper project delivering the copper needed for domestic supply chains

for veteran members of the new york state senate thrown into uncertainty by new district lines drawn under court order real estate is destiny their choices like those of any new yorker shaped by what they can afford to own or rent and where in queens sen toby stavisky saw her current 16th district dramatically reshaped leaving her with a district where less than 7 of the population are former constituents and an incumbent she d have to beat she has been serving northeast queens since 1999 after succeeding her late husband in a special election for the last 10 years her sprawling 16th senate district has centered on forest hills zig zagging from the bqe to nearly the cross island parkway but in fact for the past two years stavisky has been registered to vote at a different address outside the district seven the forest hills high rise where state sen toby stavisky owns an apartment inside the district she represents while she s registered to vote miles away credit gabriel sandoval the city miles away about an hour away by three city buses property and ethics commission records show stavisky who s 83 owns co op apartments in two districts one in forest hills within the boundaries of her current seat and the other in a complex in beechhurst near the throgs neck bridge before the court redrew district lines stavisky petitioned to run for the forest hills seat from the beechhurst apartment she s owned since the 80s records show neighbors approached by the city said they couldn t recall when they d seen the veteran senator personally i ve never seen her maybe she s here when i m not here said a resident of stavisky s high rise on yellowstone boulevard in forest hills the woman who declined to provide a name but identified herself as a democrat fed up with the party s stupidness in albany said stavisky s absence wouldn t make a difference to her stavisky could run from either of her two residences or pick up and move to a third where she will run in the upcoming august primary remains a mystery the senator intends to run for re election and is having discussions with her neighbors supporters and colleagues she will be making an official announcement soon said stavisky campaign spokesperson tess mcrae utterly undemocratic the story is very different for bronx sen gustavo rivera age 46 who has served the kingsbridge area since being elected in 2010 currently in the 33rd district he s lived in the same modest brick building on university avenue for more than 20 years in a rent stabilized one bedroom apartment but that apartment is now in the new 31st senate district as is the washington heights residence of sen robert jackson d manhattan which would throw them head to head if rivera runs there the city s have i been redistricted tool shows that 56 of residents of that new district had been in jackson s old district which could give the manhattanite an advantage in winning reelection democratic state sens robert jackson d manhattan left and gustavo rivera d the bronx both of whom live in a new district spanning both boroughs credit ben fractenberg the city nys senate media services unlike stavisky rivera doesn t have another home to run from senate salaries start at 110 000 a year and state financial disclosures show he reported no outside income and no assets in 2020 in contrast to stavisky who earned between 50 000 and 153 000 in dividends alone and holds as much as 3 2 million through stocks mutual funds bonds and a retirement account to have a shot at winning reelection without a bruising battle with another incumbent rivera will have to uproot from the neighborhood he s called home for years and find a new place to live at a time when rents for vacant apartments are reaching new heights rivera declined to comment to the city instead pointing to a statement he tweeted saturday morning when new york awoke to see the final court ordered lines he announced that he ll be running for the newly drawn 33rd district he currently neighbors which now spans riverdale bedford park and belmont and brings with it 47 of his current constituents more than any other senator calling the new lines deeply flawed utterly undemocratic and intended to diminish the voices of communities of color in our government he declared i will be running for reelection in the new 33rd senatorial district which includes significant parts of my current district as well as many communities that i represented when i was first elected to the senate seat shuffle election law experts stress that candidates can run from anywhere in a redistricting year so long as they are a new york state resident toggling between two addresses could pose a politics and optics problem for stavisky but it s perfectly legal since they re legitimate residences said election lawyer sarah steiner determining someone s residency carries a hard burden of proof since new york law provides no clear definition of what constitutes a significant amount of time in their home steiner explained somebody having a couple of residences is no big story the people who have a rent stabilized apartment and having to move somewhere else that s more problematic steiner said new york democrats were so desperate to head off the court imposed redistricting that rep sean patrick maloney a hudson valley democrat who heads the democratic congressional campaign committee urged gov kathy hochul and other state officials to challenge the lines in the u s supreme court said people with knowledge of the discussions state senators scramble since a draft of the lines emerged earlier this month has been overshadowed by dramatic chess moves from some candidates for congress including u s rep mondaire jones of rockland county who announced he s running in a hotly contested new district spanning brooklyn and manhattan maloney himself is running for jones current seat as is state sen alessandra biaggi who currently represents parts of the bronx and westchester but lower visibility state lawmakers were also plotting their next moves during weeks of uncertainty while the courts hammered out the new political lines behind closed doors some democrats were trying to figure out whether some of them needed to move to avoid going head to head with colleagues according to sources familiar with the private discussions it s really sad you see all of these folks coming out of the woodwork against each other and not necessarily discussing what they can do and not holding their powder a little bit so they can come together with a plan said camille rivera a democratic strategist and consultant clashing lines based on her beechhurst residence stavisky could opt to run in the newly drawn 11th district that curves like a backward c from the northern portion of astoria through whitestone beechhurst douglaston little neck and queens village cutting out the vast majority of her old district it wouldn t be unfamiliar territory either she or her late husband have represented different portions of queens almost continuously since 1954 first in the city council then assembly and senate as she s run for repeated re election the district has changed with asians now making up the plurality of area residents many have been represented by sen john liu who immigrated from taiwan as a child was the first asian american to be elected to the city council and hold citywide office and one of the first in the state senate liu s own flushing home is in the newly compact 16th district after senate republicans reconfigured the senate map in 2012 stavisky was able to win a newly created heavily asian district with the backing of every asian american elected official in the city at the time and did not face any asian candidates shortly after that she purchased her forest hills residence within that district property records show now the court s redistricting put her building into a district that includes st albans cambria heights and springfield gardens historically black neighborhoods currently represented by democratic sen leroy comrie a spokesperson for comrie did not immediately respond to request for comment the new 31st senate district spans the harlem river between upper manhattan and fordham in the bronx credit hiram alejandro durán the city rivera s residence sets him up for another kind of clash between two progressive senate stalwarts jackson has been a champion for public school funding even before he entered politics as a plaintiff in the campaign for fiscal equity lawsuit against the state rivera meanwhile has been a staunch ally for new york s immigrant communities and is the head of the influential health committee noted jasmine gripper executive director of the alliance for quality education the last thing you want to do is lose your champions for mediocre folks to come in especially when they both represent their communities gripper said robert jackson is a black muslim man who s in the senate we have gustavo a latino man in the senate and it s like yes these folks should be here they represent new york state they represent our communities and there s no situation where you can really justify why one should be there over she added

measures the company reports financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap included in this press release are certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with gaap they are designed to supplement and not substitute excelerate s financial information presented in accordance with u s gaap the non gaap measures as defined by excelerate may not be comparable to similar non gaap measures presented by other companies the presentation of such measures which may include adjustments to exclude non recurring items should not be construed as an inference that excelerate s future results cash flows or leverage will be unaffected by other nonrecurring items management believes that the following non gaap financial measures provide investors with additional useful information in evaluating the company s performance and valuation see the reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to the most comparable gaap financial measure including those measures presented as part of the company s 2022 financial outlook in the section titled non gaap reconciliation below adjusted gross margin the company uses adjusted gross margin a non gaap financial measure which it defines as revenues less direct cost of sales and operating expenses excluding depreciation and amortization to measure its operational financial performance management believes adjusted gross margin is useful because it provides insight on profitability and true operating performance excluding the implications of the historical cost basis of its assets the company s computation of adjusted gross margin may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure included as a supplemental disclosure because the company believes it is a useful indicator of its operating performance the company defines adjusted ebitda a non gaap measure as net income before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization and items such as charges and non recurring expenses that management does not consider as part of assessing ongoing operating performance adjusted ebitdar is a non gaap financial measure included as a supplemental disclosure because the company believes it is a valuation measure commonly used by financial statement users to more effectively compare the results of its operations from period to period and against other companies without regard to its financing methods or capital structure the company defines adjusted ebitdar a non gaap measure as adjusted ebitda adjusted to eliminate the effects of rental expenses for vessels and other infrastructure which are normal recurring cash operating expenses necessary to operate its business the company adjusts net income for the items listed above to arrive at adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within its industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income as determined in accordance with gaap or as an indicator of the company s operating performance or liquidity these measures have limitations as certain excluded items are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are components of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar adjusted ebitdar should not be viewed as a measure of overall performance or considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income because it excludes rental expenses for vessels and other infrastructure which is a normal recurring cash operating expense that is necessary to operate the company s business the company s presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar should not be construed as an inference that its results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items the company s computations of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies for the foregoing reasons each of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar has significant limitations which affect its use as an indicator of its profitability and valuation and you are

alex veiga and rebecca boone the associated press americans on the cusp of retiring are facing a tough choice as they watch their nest eggs shrink stay the course or keep working a stock market slump this year has taken a big bite out of investors portfolios including retirement plans like 401 k s the s p 500 the benchmark for many index funds is down about 17 since its all time high in early january the sharp reversal after a banner 2021 for wall street has been particularly unsettling for those who have been planning to retire sooner rather than later and banking on a healthier stock portfolio to help fund their post work lifestyle it doesn t help that the cost of everything from gasoline to food is up sharply amid the highest inflation since the 1970s and that the federal reserve s recipe for fighting inflation hiking interest rates has heightened fears the u s econ omy will slide into a recession all of that is bad news for corporate earnings growth which is a key driver of stock prices anxiety the market skid has financial planners hearing more often from anxious clients seeking advice and reassurance in equal measure they say some clients are opting to push back their retirement date in hopes that will buy time for their investments to bounce back meanwhile retirees already tapping their investments may have to consider beefing up their savings with a part time job or putting off major travel or spending plans from late 2020 through 2021 we saw a wave of clients retire because of the large gains in the stock market and because they no longer wanted to work in the covid new normal work environment said mark rylance a financial planner in newport beach california this year half the clients who discussed retirement opted to still retire while the other half decided to hold off he said historically the stock market has tended to deliver positive returns within a year following steep declines but unlike younger investors who can ride out wall street s sharp swings workers closing in on retirement don t have as much time to make up losses from hefty market downturns i am a little afraid i don t want to work until i m 70 said nancy roberts a librarian in meridian idaho the 60 year old is counting on her ira to fund her retirement which is a little over 4 years away but the market decline has her feeling stressed i do know i ve lost money but i m trying not to freak out and look at it every day she said devastating inflation many soon to be retirees are also terrified about inflation which can be devastating over decades said mark struthers a financial adviser with sona wealth advisers in st paul minneapolis social security has a built in inflation adjustment but it doesn t keep up with real inflation and pensions which far fewer workers have these days often max out the inflation adjustment at 1 5 he said compounding is magical when it is working for you but devastating when it s working against you struthers said he advises retirees who are worried about getting by on their savings to be willing to cut back on spending on big ticket items that could mean taking a big vacation every other year instead of annually or waiting 10 years rather than 7 to buy a new car struthers also strongly recommends that retirees work part time when stocks are in a downward spiral investors traditionally shift money into bonds which are less risky than stocks but bonds have not been a refuge from losses lately high inflation has made bonds and the fixed payments they make less attractive one index of high quality u s bonds has lost more than 9 so far this year holding steady despite the market s decline investors like mark bendell in boca raton florida are sticking to their retirement timeline the engineer decided early in 2021 that he would retire before the end of this year the 62 year old reviewed his finances with a financial adviser and came away confident he would be able to live off his nest egg which includes a 401 k plan he s been contributing to for about 34 years a small pension savings and social security his wife laurie a teacher plans to retire next year not that watching the stock market plunge hasn t been difficult i have a stiff drink about a couple of times a week and then i take a look at my investments bendell said i don t look as much as when the market was climbing other than tweaking his 401 k to make sure it wasn t heavily invested in more speculative holdings bendell hasn t made any major changes to his investment strategy since he started his retirement countdown clock i stayed the course he said trying to time the market doesn t work and i believe that set it and forget it that approach even during big market slumps is typical among investors with 401 k s or iras a fidelity investments review of 24 000 retirement investment plans found that only 5 6 of people with a 401 k made a change to their plan s allocation in the first quarter that compares to 5 3 in the last three months of 2021 and 6 4 in the first quarter last year the company said the set it and forget it strategy helped but didn t shield investors entirely from losses this year the average fidelity 401 k plan balance stood at 127 100 in the first quarter down 2 from a year ago and off 7 from the fourth quarter wall street has been racking up gains more often than losses over the past decade the market plunged 34 in march 2020 at the height of the pandemic lockdowns and climbed to new highs a few months later last year the s p 500 scored its third best performance in the last decade delivering a total return of nearly 29 including dividends that s why americans who ve long been socking away money into retirement investment accounts are likely still well ahead consider the 1 7 million investors who have had a 401 k through fidelity the past 10 years saw their balance soar by an average of nearly fivefold to 383 100 however as of the end of 2019 only about 60 million employed americans had a 401 k plan according to the investment company institute an association representing investment funds perspective previous years stock market gains are hard to keep in perspective when one s retirement account balance shrinks by the day however having the bulk of her retirement savings in her ira as the market declined has been unnerving said roberts the librarian from meridian so she s leaving it in the hands of her financial adviser who sends her regular updates and has moved some of her money from higher risk investments into mutual funds they ll move some money to cash if they have to temporarily she said roberts works four days a week at a library spending the rest of the week caring for her elderly mother and taking her to doctor s appointments if she had to she could try to work five days a week though it would be a strain i want to have some time to spend with my adult daughters so i m really hoping that my ira hangs on she said

ask preston d cherry a cfp financial advisor university professor holder of a doctorate and master s degree and the president of the financial therapy association about the pioneers of planning and psychology and he ll rattle off a dozen or more names spanning decades he brings up academic programs at golden gate university kansas state university texas tech university and the university of georgia he speaks of growing movements and outright fields of the profession such as life planning behavioral finance and financial therapy he mentions names such as saundra davis rick kahler kristy archuleta and sonya lutter to name a few the point is the myth that planning revolves around purely investment related skills hasn t held sway among the profession s actual experts and practitioners for a long time yet it persists among some clients and prospective financial services professionals the addition this year of the psychology of planning to the profession s most popular and respected certification test the cfp examination highlights how the intersection of planning and psychology carries the potential to transform a client s relationship with money and investing and to usher in young and career changing advisors to a rewarding calling planners from across the country say they re already using the psychology of planning in their practices every day the rising level of research and adoption represents a new phase of the profession preston d cherry is the founder of green bay wisconsin based concurrent financial planning and the president of the financial therapy association preston cherry in contrast with the popular image of financial advisors as investment experts with charts and graphs of stock performance the principles relate to advancing the human condition and how past relationships and experiences with money may present barriers to our present and future progress with our life and money aspirations said cherry the founder of green bay wisconsin based concurrent financial planning you re seeing financial therapy and the psychology of money be so important everywhere cherry said we re opening up beyond academia it s a critical pivot point right now because we re reaching into the mental health aspect marriage we re reaching across thought processes professions we re really pushing toward opening up the mindset cfps in psychology the cfp board took a major step in that direction by including the psychology of planning as one of eight principal knowledge topics for the first time in march in the exams taken by more than 2 700 candidates in addition the certifying organization released a new book last month that s a guide to client and planner attitudes values and biases behavioral finance sources of money conflict principles of counseling general principles of effective communication and crisis events with severe consequences the editorial board and contributors feature many of the names programs and movements mentioned by cherry and other integral figures as for an official definition of the disparate fields in the profession applicable to the general topic of the psychology of financial planning the organization overseeing nearly 93 000 cfps nationwide describes it as identifying and responding to attitudes behaviors and situations that impact decision making the client planner relationship and the client s financial well being at an estimated 150 basis points in possible added value to clients behavioral coaching amounts to the largest individual area of gain for clients in the vanguard advisor s alpha program notes kamila elliott the chair of the cfp board and a longtime vanguard veteran who is the founder of atlanta based collective wealth partners with fund fees and other investment costs in a race to zero planners can show their value in other ways elliott points out we re in the age where there s so much information available to be a self directed investor much different than it was 50 years ago to get a newspaper and charts she said gone are those days and i think this is an important conversation to show how the profession has evolved from us being stock pickers to us now helping our clients with their personal and financial goals the psychology of advice or behavioral finance is an important part of that more frequent and constant applications the cfp board s move has led to a significant bump in web traffic to articles about financial psychology interest in continuing education sessions and firms seeking client assessments for their practices according to sarah stanley fallaw the author of the next millionaire next door and founder of a company called datapoints it s one of a handful of wealthtech companies in its specific niche these days a contrast with six years ago at its launch when fallaw said behavioral assessments were non existent as a category datapoints focuses on the measurement side of financial psychology our platform measures clients investing and money related personalities attitudes and beliefs fallaw said in an email most advisors use our tests for the personalized reports we provide for their clients these reports provide insights into the client s personality along with tips recommendations and interview questions to walk through different aspects of financial psychology with the client advisors see the relevance of the burgeoning psychological research and metrics for their practices autumn campbell a lead planner with facet wealth who studied psychology as an undergraduate and worked as a teacher before joining the profession has many clients who started out unfamiliar with the topic of planning in general and the options available to them that s why she uses psychology as often as i can in her practice campbell said i would hope that i use it in every single client meeting she said for akeiva ellis a financial education specialist with ballentine partners the pertinent psychology extends from examining how your money mindset as a planner can also bias your recommendations to clients to cultural competency around systemic barriers to wealth and to how best to prioritize a customer s most urgent pain points she said in an email it doesn t matter how wise or prudent our advice or recommendations are if the client won t implement them ellis said a frequent scenario is when clients panic during a market downturn tempted to sell their entire investment portfolio another might be issues of overspending fueled by a range of underlying motives such as wealth related guilt that leads to being overly charitable or generous with friends and family we as planners need to know how to guide our clients through these situations and to the best course of action for them natalie haggard is a tulsa oklahoma based senior wealth advisor with mariner wealth advisors natalie haggard in an interview at the tulsa oklahoma based office of mariner wealth advisors senior wealth advisor natalie haggard and director trey cooper described many ways that psychology makes its way into their practices advisors aren t being very helpful to people if they re getting stuck in the jargon of the financial advice industry and just throwing a bunch of numbers and charts and graphs at them and ignoring what they really want to know haggard said if you re ignoring the psychology of a client or a prospect you re not doing your job very well because it s there even if they re trying to just talk numbers she said a lot of it is reading between the lines of what are they really asking me what are they really worried about they re stuck on a performance number but people in general are faced every day with people telling them what to be afraid of and it s our job as advisors to help them see in most cases that it s going to be ok and ultimately that s the question they re asking when they re stuck on a performance number or a tax situation or the markets today is a good example is are we going to be ok the mental side of money often comes into play with business owners or executives who derive a significant portion of their wealth from one company s stock or value cooper said from the outside we all see that and say well that s a lot of eggs in one basket from their standpoint many times they actually view their ownership as low risk because it s what they know best it s what they can control he said they can t control what some other industry is doing or some other stock is doing or some other type of investment but they know their business the best and they actually view it as one of the least risky parts of their overall net worth popular areas of study advisors eager to explore the expanding research as part of their continuing education can tap into an array of books academic journals training or coaching sessions and podcasts exploring the links between planning and psychology cristina livadary the founder of marina del ray california based mana financial life design recommends a book that she says made her future career path suddenly clear when she was working as a mutual fund wholesaler the seven stages of money maturity by the originator of the life planning movement george kinder the kinder institute of life planning has certified 580 registered life planners and trained more than 4 000 professionals according to its website the practice run by livadary and her business partner has reached 100 clients since starting at zero only four years ago she said in an email before discussing any financial topics we work with clients to unveil their why livadary said these days mental health is being discussed in public forums in a way that would have been unheard of 10 years ago she said from star athletes to front line workers to overworked employees at tech companies we re beginning to honor the massive role our mind plays in our daily lives financial confidence is a core piece of mental health so many of the planners i meet are working with people who want to build wealth but recognize that it s impossible to be wealthy if they haven t addressed the psychological aspect of their money money stories run deep and can affect a person s ability to earn save spend and invest for decades other organizations are springing up and attracting more professionals as well the financial therapy association launched in 2008 as a group of planners financial counselors coaches psychologists marriage and family therapists social workers psychotherapists and researchers according to a history of the organization included in the first issue of its journal despite there being a long history of research into the relationship between planning and psychology there was no systematic and organized association for promoting and disseminating information about practice techniques the article states in effect practitioners have been working in a vacuum with only the occasional opportunity to share successes and failures with others or to work with researchers to truly determine the efficacy of a particular counseling treatment the fta was developed to meet this need it said cherry the organization s president suggests advisors keep learning how to improve those client or human connection or communication skills to enhance the conversations that you have with the people that you re serving he said you have set up an environment that welcomes me asks me the right questions to better understand who i am my values my experiences my attitudes cherry said those shared stories help inform what the aspirations are and then it tells us what we can do with the mechanics of the money which has better outcomes at the end of the day i would hope that i use it in every single client meeting autumn campbell a lead planner with facet wealth some of the available texts much of the burgeoning available research sprouted out of a series of 1994 sessions hosted by kinder and the late dick wagner at the retreat of one of the financial planning association s predecessor associations the institute of certified financial planners the pair asked what we felt as we watched them tear up a 20 bill were they destroying something of emotional or spiritual value or was it just money a veteran advisor who was present at it and later meetings of what became known as the nazrudin project wrote in a 2015 article contemporaries sometimes referred to wagner who also penned an influential 1990 article in the journal of financial planning titled to think like a cfp and a 2016 book called financial planning 3 0 as the profession s oracle of denver financial planning is the ultimate liberal arts profession we are not only required to know a lot about a lot but eventually we must make sense of the mix as it relates to the individual relying upon our judgment and advice wagner wrote in his book this skill and wisdom matrix necessarily includes psychology spirituality and a full understanding of the nature and implications of being human and of lives well lived this is not competing with the therapist but rather knowing enough of the therapist s work and tool kit that we both avoid harm and understand how we might incorporate the therapist into our work at appropriate moments such a broad range necessarily incorporates thinking about factors like childhood trauma often connected to the painful racial history of america and the historical exclusion of certain groups or outright violence targeting them in her 2020 book our money stories financial wellness writer eugenié george explores how women who are black asian american native american and latinx view money in light of their own personal histories and the country s past the most frustrating thing is that folks don t discuss the trauma around money particularly in the finance community we never talk about financial stress and its physical effects on our mental health george writes there is always lil trauma following us wherever we go sometimes we remain so unaware of the injury that we don t recognize it because it s normalized so even simple things like grocery shopping can bring up a trauma because your parents said that they didn t have enough money in the bank to pay for food unconscious beliefs lay dormant and it s up to us to unlearn some of the past to create a better future the interlocking strands of discussion and scholarship create rich material for advisors and clients as well as prospective ones to consider when thinking about their wealth at the mariner office in tulsa haggard and cooper agreed that financial topics comprise half or less of the time they spend in many meetings with clients haggard views that composition as the sign of a good meeting she said we re thinking about it haggard said we joke but it s true that you know that wasn t a portfolio review that was a therapy session it s not my role it s not what i ve trained in but it does benefit me and my client to have some sort of knowledge of what s going on and how we can help in addition the increasing number of practitioners embracing psychology offers a path into the profession for those who may have that imposter syndrome or another voice telling them they aren t cut out to be a planner there are very good successful advisors that really didn t have a financial background and they can be successful in this business because they understand the psychology of it how to relate to people cooper said and so i don t think this industry is just for financial background type people

horror over an elementary school shooting in texas on tuesday that left at least 14 students and a teacher dead quickly turned to fury as democrats slammed congress for its inability to take action on guns sen chris murphy d conn took to the senate floor shortly after the terrible news from the small city of uvalde circulated throughout washington d c and the country scolding his colleagues for not doing more to combat gun violence what are we doing asked an angry murphy who represents a state where the sandy hook elementary school shooting in 2012 left 20 6 and 7 year olds dead why do you spend all this time running for the united states senate why do you go through all the hassle of getting this job of putting yourself in a position of authority if your answer is that as this slaughter increases as our kids run for their lives we do nothing murphy said what are we doing i understand my republican colleagues will not agree to everything that i may support but there is a common denominator that we can find murphy added the shooting in uvalde a largely hispanic community about 85 miles west of san antonio is the worst elementary school shooting since the sandy hook shooting in newtown conn and worst overall school shooting since parkland fla in 2018 it also comes about a week after the buffalo n y grocery store shooting in a predominantly black neighborhood that killed 10 people and injured three others it s a horrible situation and unfortunately now an american problem that it seems many lawmakers refuse to solve rep veronica escobar d texas said in a cnn phone interview as details of the shooting rolled in and the problem is that firearm homicides have increased 40 percent for people between the ages 10 and 24 years old in america those are the stats for 2020 it s unacceptable and i can t believe lawmakers refuse to act escobar said fred guttenberg whose daughter jaime was killed in the parkland shooting made an emotional speech on msnbc in response to the shooting saying politicians have f ing failed our kids again i m done i ve had it how many more times are we going to sit back i m going to listen to that governor of texas talk about why he pushed laws in texas that made it easier for the guns to be had by those who want to kill how many more times guttenberg said i m speechless i don t know what to say a compromise gun control measure crafted in the aftermath of sandy hook by sens joe manchin d w va and pat toomey r pa failed in the senate in 2013 in a 54 46 vote four democrats who are no longer in office joined republicans to block the legislation the measure would have increased background checks on gun sales no major national legislation to increase gun control has succeeded in the decade since despite numerous democratic politicians including president biden calling for bans on sales of assault style weapons and other measures after the 2017 las vegas shooting the department of justice federally banned bump stocks which help a shooter to rapidly fire a semi automatic weapon manchin just last week expressed his opinion that even after the buffalo shooting movement on gun reform did not look likely are we going to another vote for the sake of taking a vote let s do some mental illness reform manchin said murphy brushed off any focus on mental health over new firearm reform measures spare me the bullshit about mental illness we don t have any more mental illness than any other country in the world murphy told reporters as he walked off the senate floor nbc reported texas gov greg abbott r who opposes gun control measures told the world of the news from uvalde he said the 18 year old shooter had been killed by police officials say the elementary school included second through fourth grades and several more students and teachers were injured republican lawmakers expressed horror at the shooting but kept their focus on prayers for the victims and waiting to find out more details rather than any legislative response heidi i are fervently lifting up in prayer the children and families in the horrific shooting in uvalde we are in close contact with local officials but the precise details are still unfolding thank you to heroic law enforcement first responders for acting so swiftly sen ted cruz r texas tweeted cruz shut down the prospect of creating new gun laws cnn reported inevitably when there s a murderer of this kind you see politicians try to politicize it you see democrats and a lot of folks in the media whose immediate solution is to try to restrict the constitutional rights of law abiding citizens cruz told reporters at the capitol on tuesday we know what does prevent crime which is going after felons and fugitives and those with serious mental illness sen john cornyn r texas said that he planned to travel to uvalde as soon as possible he expressed gratitude to law enforcement and medical staff working to prevent further deaths rep tony gonzales r texas whose district includes uvalde called the massacre an act of senseless violence it is devastating when our innocent children become the victims of senseless violence we are devastated gonzales tweeted while we monitor this situation we remember that uvalde while rocked by today s events is strong and resilient in this time of trepidation our office is always here to do whatever we can to help we are family and we will continue to be here for each other a number of gop figures are scheduled to speak at a national rifle association conference in houston on friday including former

washington d c newsroom may 24 2022 12 13 pm cna responding publicly for the first time to her archbishop barring her from holy communion in her home diocese u s house speaker nancy pelosi remained defiant tuesday in her support of abortion archbishop salvatore cordileone announced may 20 that the california democrat may no longer receive holy communion in the archdiocese of san francisco after publicly supporting abortion as a catholic politician his decision cordilenoe said is a pastoral one and not political over the years pelosi has defended abortion while citing her catholic faith the catholic church considers abortion the destruction of a human person a grave evil on tuesday pelosi gave no indication that her position on abortion and how she speaks about it as a catholic will change i wonder about the death penalty which i am opposed to so is the church but they take no action against people who may not share their view she said during msnbc s morning joe show pelosi did not say whether she intends to continue to present herself for communion cordileone s order is only applicable within the san francisco archdiocese and although cardinal wilton gregory of the archdiocese of washington has not commented publicly about cordileone s action he has not instructed priests to refuse communion to anyone pelosi reportedly took holy communion at the 9 a m sunday mass on may 22 at holy trinity catholic church in georgetown according to politico playbook but the report did not identify the source of that information a spokeswoman for the parish on tuesday referred media questions about the report to the archdiocese of washington which did not respond to cna s request for comment in response to cordileone s actions bishop robert vasa of the diocese of santa rosa california where pelosi s napa vacation home is located has said that he too will bar pelosi from holy communion during her appearance on morning joe pelosi directly mentioned cordileone once to criticize him for being vehemently against lgbtq rights host joe scarborough praised the speaker for living out the gospel of matthew by serving the truly disadvantaged jesus does not mention abortion in the gospels scarborough said instead in matthew 25 jesus told his disciples we would be welcomed into the kingdom of heaven if we gave water to the thirsty fed the hungry clothed the poor and brought hope to the hopeless he said pelosi claimed without further explanation that pro life people largely reject this gospel message thank you for referencing the gospel of matthew which is sort of the agenda of the church that is rejected by many who side with them on terminating a pregnancy she said you can watch the interview in the video below pelosi also appeared to refer to the leaked supreme court draft in the abortion case dobbs v jackson women s health organization which signals that justices are preparing to overturn roe v wade the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide this decision taking us to privacy and precedent is very dangerous in the lives of so many of the american people she said and again not consistent with the gospel of matthew at another point the speaker referenced her catholic background i come from a largely pro life italian american catholic family so i respect people s views about that she said referring to abortion but i don t respect us foisting it onto others pelosi also claimed that as a catholic she has tried in vain to speak with republicans in the past about supporting what the catholic church was asking us to do for global family planning natural family planning which our law allows to happen i think it s very insulting to women to have their ability to make their own decision hampered by politics pelosi commented this should never have been politicized pelosi called abortion a cover for a lot of other things that the far right wants to accomplish and concluded that now a woman s decision regarding abortion is a kitchen table issue
americans on the cusp of retiring are facing a tough choice as they watch their nest eggs shrink stay the course or keep working a stock market slump this year has taken a big bite out of investors portfolios including retirement plans like 401 k s the s p 500 the benchmark for many index funds is down about 17 percent since its all time high in early january the sharp reversal after a banner 2021 for wall street has been particularly unsettling for those who have been planning to retire sooner rather than later and banking on a healthier stock portfolio to help fund their post work lifestyle it doesn t help that the cost of everything from gasoline to food is up sharply amid the highest inflation since the 1970s and that the federal reserve s recipe for fighting inflation hiking interest rates has heightened fears the u s economy will slide into a recession all of that is bad news for corporate earnings growth which is a key driver of stock prices the market skid has financial planners hearing more often from anxious clients seeking advice and reassurance in equal measure they say some clients are opting to push back their retirement date in hopes that will buy time for their investments to bounce back meanwhile retirees already tapping their investments may have to consider beefing up their savings with a part time job or putting off major travel or spending plans from late 2020 through 2021 we saw a wave of clients retire because of the large gains in the stock market and because they no longer wanted to work in the covid new normal work environment said mark rylance a financial planner in newport beach california advertisement this year half the clients who discussed retirement opted to still retire while the other half decided to hold off he said historically the stock market has tended to deliver positive returns within a year following steep declines but unlike younger investors who can ride out wall street s sharp swings workers closing in on retirement don t have as much time to make up losses from hefty market downturns i am a little afraid i don t want to work until i m 70 said nancy roberts a librarian in meridian idaho the 60 year old is counting on her ira to fund her retirement which is a little over 4 years away but the market decline has her feeling stressed i do know i ve lost money but i m trying not to freak out and look at it every day she said many soon to be retirees are also terrified about inflation which can be devastating over decades said mark struthers a financial adviser with sona wealth advisers in st paul minneapolis advertisement social security has a built in inflation adjustment but it doesn t keep up with real inflation and pensions which far fewer workers have these days often max out the inflation adjustment at 1 5 percent he said compounding is magical when it is working for you but devastating when it s working against you struthers said he advises retirees who are worried about getting by on their savings to be willing to cut back on spending on big ticket items that could mean taking a big vacation every other year instead of annually or waiting 10 years rather than 7 to buy a new car struthers also strongly recommends that retirees work part time when stocks are in a downward spiral investors traditionally shift money into bonds which are less risky than stocks but bonds have not been a refuge from losses lately high inflation has made bonds and the fixed payments they make less attractive one index of high quality u s bonds has lost more than 9 percent so far this year despite the market s decline investors like mark bendell in boca raton florida are sticking to their retirement timeline the engineer decided early in 2021 that he would retire before the end of this year the 62 year old reviewed his finances with a financial adviser and came away confident he would be able to live off his nest egg which includes a 401 k plan he s been contributing to for about 34 years a small pension savings and social security his wife laurie a teacher plans to retire next year advertisement not that watching the stock market plunge hasn t been difficult i have a stiff drink about a couple of times a week and then i take a look at my investments bendell said i don t look as much as when the market was climbing other than tweaking his 401 k to make sure it wasn t heavily invested in more speculative holdings bendell hasn t made any major changes to his investment strategy since he started his retirement countdown clock i stayed the course he said trying to time the market doesn t work and i believe that that approach even during big market slumps is typical among investors with 401 k s or iras a fidelity investments review of 24 000 retirement investment plans found that only 5 6 percent of people with a 401 k made a change to their plan s allocation in the first quarter that compares to 5 3 percent in the last three months of 2021 and 6 4 percent in the first quarter last year the company said the set it and forget it strategy helped but didn t shield investors entirely from losses this year the average fidelity 401 k plan balance stood at 127 100 in the first quarter down 2 percent from a year ago and off 7 percent from the fourth quarter advertisement wall street has been racking up gains more often than losses over the past decade the market plunged 34 percent in march 2020 at the height of the pandemic lockdowns and climbed to new highs a few months later last year the s p 500 scored its third best performance in the last decade delivering a total return of nearly 29 percent including dividends that s why americans who ve long been socking away money into 401ks and other retirement investment accounts are likely still well ahead consider the 1 7 million investors who have had a 401 k through fidelity the past 10 years saw their balance soar by an average of nearly fivefold to 383 100 however as of the end of 2019 only about 60 million employed americans had a 401 k plan according to the investment company institute an association representing investment funds previous years stock market gains are hard to keep in perspective when one s retirement account balance shrinks by the day however having the bulk of her retirement savings in her ira as the market declined has been unnerving said roberts the librarian from meridian so she s leaving it in the hands of her financial adviser who sends her regular updates and has moved some of her money from higher risk investments into mutual funds they ll move some money to cash if they have to temporarily she said roberts works four days a week at a library spending the rest of the week caring for her elderly mother and taking her to doctor s appointments if she had to she could try to work five days a week though it would be a strain i want to have some time to spend with my adult daughters so i m really hoping that my ira hangs on she said send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

washington acting comptroller michael hsu offered a sober perspective of crypto in front of a room of blockchain advocates at the dc blockchain summit hsu publicly spoke about the terrausd crash at length for the first time saying the episode underscored concerns he holds about cryptocurrency more broadly hsu has been a skeptic of cryptocurrency in the past as he noted during his remarks and said that the terra meltdown should be a wake up call to the industry bloomberg news the hype and the associated vulnerabilities noted above make the crypto space very dangerous for investors of modest means he said the terrausd holder stories are heartbreaking and a strong reminder that hype is not harmless given the massive inflow of venture capital dollars into the space my fear is that the hype problem may get worse before it gets better hsu noted that the terra collapse didn t just affect terra it also spread to other cryptocurrencies including tether the largest stablecoin by volume he alluded to larger concerns about the crypto system s interconnectedness such contagion is familiar to bank regulators and students of moneylike instruments prudential regulation can help he said he also highlighted the office of the comptroller of the currency s move last year to remind banks to check in with the agency before they engage in crypto activities he said that with his encouragement and support the federal deposit insurance corp issued a similar letter this year those actions helped ensure the banking system s stability during the terra crash hsu said no banks are under stress or even rumored to be under stress due to crypto exposure he said this absence of stress has allowed the traditional banking system to remain a source of strength to households and businesses through the recent financial market volatility

with the entire nation undergoing a shortage of baby formula many parents are struggling to find the nutrients their child needs to develop healthily as grocery store shelves are cleaned out the parents who are fortunate enough to have baby food in stock at home are doing what they can to make every ounce count in a desperate attempt to keep their child fed some parents are trying to make their cans of powdered formula last longer by diluting the mixture with more water and using less powder however dr mona amin a pediatrician with pediatric associates says these well intentioned parents are actually doing more harm than they might realize get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters can i water down my baby s formula to make my supply last longer what some parents are doing is in order to make the can of powdered formula last longer they are putting more water than is recommended for each bottle says dr amin however pediatricians like dr amin strongly advise against tampering with the water to formula ratio listed on the packaging of the baby formula adding extra water to powdered baby formula over dilutes the mixture offsetting the nutritional composition in the bottle additionally it adds extra water to a child s body dr amin says these two factors can both create health issues for developing babies what harm could my child face by ingesting over diluted baby formula because the powdered baby formula is already supposed to be mixed with water many parents may not realize the potential danger of just adding a little more according to dr amin one of the main concerns with over dilution is that the baby will be consuming bottles of formula with imbalanced nutritional composition thereby not getting all the nutrients needed for proper growth additionally she says the baby will be drinking more water than is recommended which it then may not be able to filter out properly babies do not have fully developed kidneys and drinking more water than their bodies can filter out can lead to electrolyte abnormalities i would much rather you go to the emergency room to receive formula than even try to change the recipe of your formula says pediatrician dr rebekah diamond she joined lx news to debunk misleading baby formula hacks that have spread on social media and explain why breastfeeding cannot solve the current formula shortage what are electrolyte abnormalities and why are they dangerous sodium is an electrolyte over consumption of water can result in a baby having low sodium levels dr amin says that in her time as a pediatrician she has seen these low sodium levels result in complications like hyponatremia and in dire circumstances seizure activity this can present a great danger to a child in these early stages of development and should be avoided at all costs i would much rather you go to the emergency room to receive formula than even try to change the recipe of your formula says pediatrician dr rebekah diamond
shoppers will be unable to tell if they are eating gene edited foods as part of new government plans to speed up the development of crops and livestock with altered dna the new genetic technology bill due to be introduced to parliament today could pave the way for bird flu resistant chickens wheat which can withstand climate change and crops that are more nutritious but it will also allow these gene edited products to be sold without being labelled under previous european rules gene editing of livestock and plants was banned along with genetically modified gm produce dubbed frankenfood but post brexit the government is keen to embrace gene editing in an attempt to reduce the need for pesticides in farming which would make it cheaper and more environmentally friendly gene editing differs from gm foods because it alters the existing dna of a plant or animal rather than adding dna from different species it could lead to the rolling out of tomato plants that are mildew resistant to cut fungicide use or are fortified with vitamin d as well as livestock that is resistant to disease or needs fewer antibiotics future of food new legislation to speed up the development and marketing of gene edited crops is to be introduced by the government in a new bill today a research scientist is pictured examining a soybean plantlet in new brighton minnesota what are gene edited crops and how are they different to gm plants gene editing promises to produce super crops by altering or cutting out genes that naturally occur in plants unlike genetically modified gm plants gene edited ge crops contain no foreign dna from other species ge crops are produced using crispr a new tool for making precise edits in dna scientists use a specialised protein to make tiny changes to the plant s dna that could occur naturally or through selective breeding gm crops have had foreign genes added to their dna a process that often cannot happen naturally the us brazil canada and argentina have indicated they will exempt ge crops that do not contain foreign dna from gm regulations advertisement outside the eu we are free to follow the science said environment secretary george eustice these precision technologies allow us to speed up the breeding of plants that have natural resistance to diseases and better use of soil nutrients so we can have higher yields with fewer pesticides and fertilisers pesticides and herbicides used to treat crops often include controversial chemicals that can threaten insects and other wildlife such as bee killing neonicotinoids the new legislation will allow gene edited crops to be approved in one year instead of up to ten however critics have called for greater transparency for shoppers who won t be able to identify which foods are gene edited as products will be sold without being labelled bright blue a conservative think tank said consumers should not be tricked while liz o neill of the anti gm campaign group gm freeze added that there should be clear labels so people know what they are buying and eating gideon henderson defra s chief scientific adviser said there were currently no plans to introduce a labelling system for gene edited products the intention at present is not to introduce a labelling system for gene edited products which are in many cases identical to those which could be produced in other ways through traditional breeding and cannot actually be identified he added so it will be scientifically not sensible to label them as such but the labelling issue does remain an active question it could pave the way for livestock that is resistant to disease or needs fewer antibiotics as well as bird flu resistant chickens stock image super tomato is genetically engineered to produce as much vitamin d as two eggs super tomatoes that have been genetically engineered to produce more vitamin d could help reduce deficiency of the vitamin around the world british researchers used a gene editing technique known as crispr to edit the gene involved in converting provitamin d3 into cholesterol they say editing this gene allows the tomato to keep more of the provitamin which can be converted to vitamin d through uv exposure or sunlight the researchers from the john innes centre in norwich claim the vitamin d you can get from eating one of these genetically modified tomatoes is equivalent to two eggs or 28 grams of tuna they could therefore help satisfy child and adult daily requirements for vitamin d3 reducing the risk of developing diseases such as cancer parkinson s disease and dementia advertisement earlier this week mr eustice revealed that gene edited crop production was to be sped up in the uk to help tackle the global food crisis brought on by russia s invasion of ukraine russian blockades are preventing the export of key goods such as oils wheat and corn from the breadbasket of europe leading to rising food prices and shortages globally including a major threat of famine in africa legislation to cut red tape and support the development of technology to grow more resistant more nutritious and more productive crops will be introduced in parliament today the genetic technology precision breeding bill will create a new category for gene edited organisms to regulate them separately from gm organisms it will introduce new notification systems for research and marketing and ensure information collected on precision bred organisms is published on a public register the new legislation aims to speed up the development and commercialisation of crops and livestock bred with genetic editing although the government says it is taking a step by step approach by creating rules for plants first no changes will be made to the regulation of animals under the gm regime until measures are developed to safeguard animal welfare the environment department defra said it will also allow the importation of gene edited foods from other countries if they meet the same regulations substantial environmental health and food security benefits can come from use of genetic technologies to precisely mimic breeding and improve our crops said defra s chief scientific adviser gideon henderson the uk is home to some of the world s leading research institutions in this area and these reforms will enable their scientists to use their expertise to make farming more resilient and our food healthier and more sustainable the rule changes apply to england so gene edited foods can be developed and produced by english scientists and farmers but could also be sold in scotland and wales the government has already allowed field trials in england of gene edited crops without having to go through a licensing process costing researchers 5 000 to 10 000 although scientists have to inform defra of their tests globally between 20 and 40 per cent of all crops grown are lost to pests and diseases precision breeding has the potential to create plant varieties and animals that have improved resistance to diseases crispr cas9 is the primary gene editing technique and is used to edit animal and plant dna with great precision the hope is that as well as helping with foods it could also be used to treat diseases caused by genetic mutations from muscular dystrophy to congenital blindness and even some cancers the first human trials of crispr therapies are happening already and researchers hope that they are on the brink of reaching the clinic however some scientists claim to have uncovered evidence the gene editing tool causes unwanted mutations that may prove dangerous and is much less safe than once thought the government hopes the new legislation will lead to the production of wheat which can withstand climate change and crops that are more nutritious stock image others remain concerned it could create designer babies by allowing parents to choose their hair colour height or even traits such as intelligence the move was widely welcomed by scientists dr penny hundleby senior scientist at the john innes centre said if we are to meet the ambitious targets of addressing the demands of a growing population without further adding to the cost of living and while also reducing the environmental impact of agriculture we need to embrace all safe technologies that help us reach these goals gene editing and genome sequencing are great uk strengths and through the new genetic technology bill they will move us into an exciting era of affordable intelligent and precision based plant breeding prof martin warren chief scientific officer at the quadram institute added the genetic technology bill provides a wonderful opportunity to explore ways to address the nutritional deficiency that is found in many crop based foods gene editing allows for the development of plants with improved qualities that normally take many years to produce using traditional breeding programs the ability to increase levels of key minerals such as iron and zinc and vitamins a b and d in plants holds significant potential as a way to improve lifelong health through biofortification it could lead to the rolling out of tomato plants that are mildew resistant to cut fungicide use or are fortified with vitamin d stock image but the soil association s policy director jo lewis said we are deeply disappointed to see the government prioritising unpopular technologies rather than focusing on the real issues unhealthy diets a lack of crop diversity farm animal overcrowding and the steep decline in beneficial insects who can eat pests instead of trying to change the dna of highly stressed animals and monoculture crops to make them temporarily immune to disease we should be investing in solutions that deal with the cause of disease and pests in the first place she said agroecological farming and a shift to healthy and sustainable diets was the most evidence based solution for climate nature and health researchers have already produced tomatoes with more vitamin d and tomatoes which are resistant to powdery mildew infection they have also identified a gene in wheat that can make it more resilient to rising temperatures

singapore singapore maintained its 3 per cent to 5 per cent economic growth forecast for 2022 but warned that growth will likely come in at the lower half of the forecast range because of the impact of the war in ukraine and china s strict covid 19 lockdowns the ministry of trade and industry mti said on wednesday may 25 that the external economic environment has deteriorated since february due in part to the onset of the russia ukraine conflict the conflict has disrupted the global supply of energy food and other commodities which has in turn exacerbated global inflationary pressures and adversely affected the growth of many economies it said in a statement released with the first quarter 2022 economic survey of singapore meanwhile stringent measures implemented in china to contain its domestic covid 19 outbreaks are likely to weigh on its economy and contribute to global supply bottlenecks mti said the ministry said that as a result of the war and the lockdowns global supply disruptions are likely to be more severe and prolonged than earlier expected potentially persisting throughout 2022 this in turn is likely to constrain production and dampen gross domestic product gdp growth in some economies including the united states china and europe by more than previously projected mr gabriel lim permanent secretary for trade and industry said downside risks in the global economy remain significant key risks include a further escalation in the russia ukraine conflict more severe than expected global supply disruptions due to renewed covid 19 outbreaks and risks to financial market stability if monetary policy tightening in advanced economies is faster than expected he said on balance mti s assessment is that the external demand outlook for the singapore economy has weakened compared to three months ago however mti noted that the covid 19 situation in singapore has stabilised following the cresting of the omicron wave this along with the country s high vaccination rate and strong booster take up has allowed for a faster than expected lifting of domestic and border restrictions since the end of march as a result there are some sectors in the singapore economy that have seen a strengthening of their growth outlook these include the electronics cluster which is expected to expand more strongly than earlier projected bolstered by robust global demand for semiconductors from the 5g and automotive markets as well as cloud services and data centres the roll out of the vaccinated travel framework alongside the easing of border restrictions in regional economies is likely to boost the growth of professional services such as consultancy and legal

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video a stock market slump this year has taken a big bite out of investors portfolios including retirement plans like 401 k s americans on the cusp of retiring are facing a tough choice as they watch their nest eggs shrink stay the course or keep working a stock market slump this year has taken a big bite out of investors portfolios including retirement plans like 401 k s the s p 500 the benchmark for many index funds is down about 17 since its all time high in early january the sharp reversal after a banner 2021 for wall street has been particularly unsettling for those who have been planning to retire sooner rather than later and banking on a healthier stock portfolio to help fund their post work lifestyle it doesn t help that the cost of everything from gasoline to food is up sharply amid the highest inflation since the 1970s and that the federal reserve s recipe for fighting inflation hiking interest rates has heightened fears the u s economy will slide into a recession all of that is bad news for corporate earnings growth which is a key driver of stock prices the market skid has financial planners hearing more often from anxious clients seeking advice and reassurance in equal measure they say some clients are opting to push back their retirement date in hopes that will buy time for their investments to bounce back meanwhile retirees already tapping their investments may have to consider beefing up their savings with a part time job or putting off major travel or spending plans from late 2020 through 2021 we saw a wave of clients retire because of the large gains in the stock market and because they no longer wanted to work in the covid new normal work environment said mark rylance a financial planner in newport beach california this year half the clients who discussed retirement opted to still retire while the other half decided to hold off he said historically the stock market has tended to deliver positive returns within a year following steep declines but unlike younger investors who can ride out wall street s sharp swings workers closing in on retirement don t have as much time to make up losses from hefty market downturns i am a little afraid i don t want to work until i m 70 said nancy roberts a librarian in meridian idaho the 60 year old is counting on her ira to fund her retirement which is a little over 4 years away but the market decline has her feeling stressed i do know i ve lost money but i m trying not to freak out and look at it every day she said many soon to be retirees are also terrified about inflation which can be devastating over decades said mark struthers a financial adviser with sona wealth advisers in st paul minneapolis social security has a built in inflation adjustment but it doesn t keep up with real inflation and pensions which far fewer workers have these days often max out the inflation adjustment at 1 5 he said compounding is magical when it is working for you but devastating when it s working against you struthers said he advises retirees who are worried about getting by on their savings to be willing to cut back on spending on big ticket items that could mean taking a big vacation every other year instead of annually or waiting 10 years rather than 7 to buy a new car struthers also strongly recommends that retirees work part time when stocks are in a downward spiral investors traditionally shift money into bonds which are less risky than stocks but bonds have not been a refuge from losses lately high inflation has made bonds and the fixed payments they make less attractive one index of high quality u s bonds has lost more than 9 so far this year despite the market s decline investors like mark bendell in boca raton florida are sticking to their retirement timeline the engineer decided early in 2021 that he would retire before the end of this year the 62 year old reviewed his finances with a financial adviser and came away confident he would be able to live off his nest egg which includes a 401 k plan he s been contributing to for about 34 years a small pension savings and social security his wife laurie a teacher plans to retire next year not that watching the stock market plunge hasn t been difficult i have a stiff drink about a couple of times a week and then i take a look at my investments bendell said i don t look as much as when the market was climbing other than tweaking his 401 k to make sure it wasn t heavily invested in more speculative holdings bendell hasn t made any major changes to his investment strategy since he started his retirement countdown clock i stayed the course he said trying to time the market doesn t work and i believe that that approach even during big market slumps is typical among investors with 401 k s or iras a fidelity investments review of 24 000 retirement investment plans found that only 5 6 of people with a 401 k made a change to their plan s allocation in the first quarter that compares to 5 3 in the last three months of 2021 and 6 4 in the first quarter last year the company said the set it and forget it strategy helped but didn t shield investors entirely from losses this year the average fidelity 401 k plan balance stood at 127 100 in the first quarter down 2 from a year ago and off 7 from the fourth quarter wall street has been racking up gains more often than losses over the past decade the market plunged 34 in march 2020 at the height of the pandemic lockdowns and climbed to new highs a few months later last year the s p 500 scored its third best performance in the last decade delivering a total return of nearly 29 including dividends that s why americans who ve long been socking away money into 401ks and other retirement investment accounts are likely still well ahead consider the 1 7 million investors who have had a 401 k through fidelity the past 10 years saw their balance soar by an average of nearly fivefold to 383 100 however as of the end of 2019 only about 60 million employed americans had a 401 k plan according to the investment company institute an association representing investment funds previous years stock market gains are hard to keep in perspective when one s retirement account balance shrinks by the day however having the bulk of her retirement savings in her ira as the market declined has been unnerving said roberts the librarian from meridian so she s leaving it in the hands of her financial adviser who sends her regular updates and has moved some of her money from higher risk investments into mutual funds they ll move some money to cash if they have to temporarily she said roberts works four days a week at a library spending the rest of the week caring for her elderly mother and taking her to doctor s appointments if she had to she could try to work five days a week though it would be a strain

executive chairman thanks randy good day to everyone welcome to the navigator first quarter earnings call first i would like to thank the navigator staff and ships cruise for their hard work and dedication to delivering high quality service to our customers we are very grateful to all our seagoing staff that continues to be impacted by the pandemic and part of it being strongly affected by the russia ukraine conflict thanks to strong teamwork the merger integration is smoothly moving ahead we keep capturing synergies and our results continue to improve special thank you goes for the management committee comprised by niall our chief financial officer oeyvind our chief commercial officer and michael our chief operation officer as they have been leading the company and working together as a high performance team throughout the merger and we re very glad to have the new houston office up and running with randy in charge of our business development in north america and investor relations second on behalf of the board i would like to extend our huge appreciation and gratitude to our longer service board member alexander oetker and to the valuable support of andreas beroutsos both have stepped down from the board when we decided to reduce from nine to seven members although no longer serving on the board both remain committed to the ongoing growth and development of navigator gas as active and supportive shareholders the world is going through special times with amazingly volatile markets huge pandemic and geopolitical disruptions and at the same time going green the european energy crisis the russia ukraine conflict the highest inflation for the years multiple interest rate rises in short order and the latest in lockdown have all created material economic headwinds and have impacted trade but the profile of the covid 19 economic recovery has been supportive of shipping markets with returning volumes important supply chain disruptions changing trade patterns and inefficiencies that may mitigate and even create further disruption upside for freight rates despite recent financial market jitters several global market observers believe the economic expansion continues and expect commodity energy and shipping markets to stay healthy well into 2023 emission reduction policies reduced ship speeds as from next year together with a low order book for our petrochemical gas tanker segment i believe will impact the market supply demand balance creating additional volatility and improving freight rates of course time will tell turning to the quarterly highlights on slide 4 we are pleased to report a much improved financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 compared to the first quarter of last year we achieved a quarterly adjusted ebitda of 55 7 million resulting in a strong balance sheet with 168 million in liquidity roughly twice as much as last year and we continue to reduce our debt levels through program debt amortization on the commercial front we see the market steadily improving our utilization at nearly 90 and an improving time share equivalent of nearly 23 000 the rising freight rates can be explained by three underlying factors first u s natural gas liquids production and exports are on the rise american propane production for april was 7 above last year and now at the highest level on record since shale gas production started in addition ethylene exports reached an all time high of 137 000 tons during april resulting in incremental demand for seaborne logistics and throughput at the enterprise navigator ethylene export terminal at morgan s point totaled approximately 267 000 tons achieving record profitability in the first quarter second the russia ukraine conflict is disrupting traditional supply sources and trade trials the typical sourcing from the closest geographical supplier is being challenged as european customers are increasingly looking further afield in sourcing petrochemical gases which translates into more ton mile demand for gas tankers the same is happening to all products we transport namely lpg petrochemical gases and ammonia third there is less substitution effect across tanker segments gas tanker segments increased u s propane export activity is providing higher ton mile demand for larger gas carriers which in turn reduces the inter ship segment competition the same can be seen in the handysize gas carrier segment with ships employed in ethylene and ethane trades fully retreated vessels employed in ammonia trades and therefore fewer vessels available for lpg and easy petrochemicals lastly on the commercial front we completed the sale of two of our oldest vessels during the first quarter at good prices further reducing the average age of our operating fleet looking forward our outlook remains optimistic as shipping utilization and rates are on the rise north american ngl production and exports continue to climb supported by strong prices and supply demand of ships keeping becoming tighter sorry and supply and demand of ships becoming tighter following the record q1 ethylene export through our terminal we expect similar levels in the second quarter as april and may volumes have remained approximately at 100 000 tons per month this reflects a robust end user demand in asia and europe for competitively priced u s ethylene in summary we continue to see large geographical price differentials across almost all the commodities we have transport and because of this several u s midstream companies have recently announced large investments targeted at ngl infrastructure processing and exports because of these developments and the cost advantage of the u s production we are evaluating the expansion of our ethylene export terminal in houston together with our partners at enterprise the increased size of our company more efficient ship operations reduced overheads and the improving market conditions are helping us to deliver stronger results 2022 has begun with good signs for navigator gas which should translate into stronger cash flows positive earnings momentum and value creation for all our shareholders we have the vision the best people the right ships the terminal the integrated business model the correct strategy and the financial health to position navigator gas well for the future now i would like to hand over to niall who will give you a more detailed financial review thank you niall nolan chief financial officer thank you dag and good morning everybody during the first quarter the company generated a net income of 27 million which equates to 35 a share or 12 6 million or 0 16 per share if the unrealized gains on derivative instruments and foreign exchange losses are eliminated this strong operational performance compares to a net income of 2 8 million or 0 05 per share for the first quarter of last year the adjusted ebitda for the first quarter was 55 7 million a record for the company which compared to 31 million for the first quarter of 2021 and to 55 2 million for last quarter q4 of 2021 total operating revenues for the quarter were 119 8 million compared to 85 7 million for the comparative first quarter of last year 10 2 million of this 34 1 million increase in revenue was principally as a result of the seven additional handysize vessels joining the fleet as part of the ultragas transaction offset by a slight reduction following the sale of navigator neptune on january 14 of this year there was an additional 13 5 million generated as a result of the revenues derived from the unigas pool representing revenues from the now nine smaller unigas vessels following the sale of the happy bird and 1999 built 8 600 cubic meter lpg carrier in march 2022 we also continue to see an increasing charter rate environment during the quarter which accounted for 3 4 million of the increase in revenues this quarter as average charter rates rose to 22 933 per day or 697 500 per month compared to 21 956 per day for the first quarter of 2021 and this was an increase from approximately the 22 500 a day achieved in the last quarter of 2021 vessel utilization to nudge up to 89 5 for the quarter compared to 88 2 a year ago contributing an additional 1 1 million to revenues we have four vessels in dry dock during this quarter for their scheduled surveys taking a total of 94 days and with a capital cost of 4 6 million a further nine vessels are scheduled to enter dry dock for their planned surveys over the course of the remaining nine months of this year at an expected aggregate cost of 12 9 million and drydocking costs are the only scheduled capital expenditures we have in 2022 the operating revenue from the luna pool was 5 9 million for the quarter representing our share of the other participants net revenues with voyage expenses from the luna pool of 4 6 million representing the other participant share of our net revenues from the pool consequently our vessels had a net benefit of 1 3 million from the pool during this quarter similar to the 1 1 million benefit in the first quarter of last year voyage expenses increased by 33 2 or 5 2 million during the quarter to 21 9 million primarily as a result of the seven additional handysize vessels in the fleet most of which were subject to voyage charters thereby incurring these pass through voyage expenses bunker costs which is the vessel s fuel and forms part of the voyage expenses continues to increase significantly in line with surging energy prices globally our vessel operating expenses our opex increased by 41 to 38 1 million for the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2021 all of which was as a result of the additional vessels in the fleet during the quarter in fact vessel operating expenses per vessel per day reduced again this quarter by 51 per day to 7 841 per day compared to 7 892 per day for the first quarter of last year and approximately 8 000 a day for the last quarter of 2021 depreciation on our vessels during the quarter increased by 63 or 12 2 million when compared to the first quarter of last year the reason for this increase are twofold first there were 16 more vessels in the fleet during the quarter compared to last year which accounted for 5 8 million of this increase and secondly following the company s decision to reduce the estimated useful lives of our vessels from 30 years to 25 years at december 31 2021 the effect on depreciation was and will be an increase of approximately 6 1 million per quarter general and administrative expenses were approximately the same for both comparative quarters at 6 3 million with the increase of costs relating to ultragas of 1 2 million being offset by a reallocation of technical management costs to vessel operating expenses and a reduction of costs generally associated with the closure of the new york office and other income being management fees earned from the other participants for our management of the luna pool was just under 100 000 for the quarter the unrealized gains on derivative instruments were 15 2 million for the quarter primarily relating to movements in the fair value of interest rate swaps as the five year libor swap rates have risen significantly over the course of the last quarter we have fixed interest rates on two of our loan facilities at 0 36 on one and 1 3 on the other and the loans assumed as part of the ultragas transaction each have libor fixed at approximately 2 in addition there was an unrealized gain on our norwegian bond relating to the cross currency swap of 2 2 million interest expense for the quarter was 11 million an increase of 2 million on the first quarter of last year all of which was as a result of interest on the additional 183 million of debt outstanding associated with the ultragas vessels our share of results from the ethylene marine export terminal was a record profit of 6 5 million this quarter as dag said based on 267 000 tons of ethylene throughput charges during this quarter this compared to a loss of 605 000 from the first quarter of last year due to pipeline integrity issues at that time the 6 5 million profit is the second consecutive quarterly profit at this level following a profit of 6 4 million in q4 2021 we had previously given ebitda guidance of between 20 million and 25 million per annum from the terminal but now that we better understand the capability of the terminal the ebitda guidance for 2022 is increased to between 30 million and 35 million based on the annualized profits of the past two quarters in addition to annual depreciation at the terminal of 5 2 million on the balance sheet on slide 8 we see that the company had cash of 168 1 million at march 31 and a further 22 9 million available from undrawn revolving credit facilities associated with our secured vessels our minimum liquidity covenant from our various bank loans and credit agreements is a maximum of 50 million during the first quarter in january 2022 we sold navigator neptune a 2000 built ethylene carry out for 21 million and in march 22 we sold the happy bird a 1999 built 8 600 cubic meter lpg carrier for 6 1 million neither of these vessel disposals required any debt repayments it is worth highlighting that both of these vessels were sold at or in excess of their respective book values generating a small profit of just under 500 000 which supports the current values of the vessels on our balance sheet our total debt at march 31 was 910 million and as shown on slide 9 it reduced by 22 9 million during the first quarter our debt comprised of loan facilities secured by our vessels of approximately 687 million a credit facility associated with the terminal of 51 million and two norwegian bonds which in aggregate amount to 171 7 million with respect to the norwegian krone denominated bond in the amount of 71 million and which has a maturity of november 2023 we have a call option at a redemption rate of 102 864 which we are currently evaluating on slide 10 we outlined the estimated cash breakeven for 2022 at 18 300 per day this low level enables us to generate positive ebitda in even the toughest of markets and we have maintained cash generative throughout the shipping cycle in the box on the right hand side of slide 10 we provide our expected daily opex across the various vessel segments ranging from 6 500 per day for the smaller vessels to 8 800 per day for the larger more complex midsized ethylene vessels we also provide a range for the expected annual spend for 2022 for vessel opex g a costs depreciation and interest expense on slide 11 we outlined the historical ebitda showing an uplift in q3 2021 the quarter in which the ultragas transaction was concluded and a further increase in q4 2021 which takes into account the full quarterly earnings from the ultragas vessels as well as a doubling of the net income from the terminal on the graph on the right hand side of slide 11 we outlined with the bar on the left of that graph the annualized ebitda based on q1 june 2022 thereafter each bar moving right shows the potential of ebitda if the average charter rates across the fleet were to rise by 1 000 per day giving ebitda of 260 million if the charter rates were to rise to approximately 25 000 a day and 350 million of charter rates climbed to 30 000 a day and with that i ll hand you over to oeyvind for his remarks oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer thank you niall and good morning everyone the macroeconomic stars are finally starting to align for navigator we are in an environment where gas and its derivatives are in high demand due to disruptions to long standing trade flows and we are also experiencing a global realization that gas is the necessary lower carbon energy source as a stepping stone toward the future green transition in addition we are also seeing supercharged investments in north american natural gas liquids production and infrastructure especially from the midstream companies one factor pointing to the ngl production environment is the rig count u s rig count has gone from a low in march 2020 of 244 to 728 today a dramatic increase in connection with this we are seeing renewed interest in debottlenecking european import infrastructure to enable reliable seaborne imports across the atlantic for all gases being lpg petrochemicals and ammonia all of the products we carry in addition the tonnage situation is restricted to prolonged squeeze on supply chains and commodity prices such as steel leaving at least the handysize segment with only 7 fleet growth over the next three years all of these factors set the stage for a robust freight environment going forward we expect america to go from strength to strength as a reliable producer and exporter of competitively priced gas products and derivatives and navigator is perfectly positioned to benefit from these positive developments we can clearly visualize this growth on page 13 it shows natural gas liquids production in north america and exports u s propane production for the month of april set a record of approximately 2 400 barrels per day ethane is closely linked to increasing natural gas liquids production and is also on the rise domestic demand remains relatively stable and hence any new incremental volume reinforces continued u s competitive pricing compared to other parts of the world and continuing demand for seaborne transportation the east coast export terminals are also increasing exports with marcus hook reaching record levels of lpg throughput in april and repauno export terminal in new jersey has recently commenced their lpg export program once again the demand for handysize shipping is reflected in third party brokers time charter assessments we can see that the market sentiment for shipping rates is strengthening on page 14 our core handysize ship types be it ethylene capable semi refrigerated or fully refrigerated vessels have steadily improved since the low in september 2021 and are now showing between 900 000 per month to a range of 650 000 a month depending on the ship type we have recently extended four semi refrigerated vessels for 10 month time charters above the assessed rate quoted by third party brokers meaning that the curve takes a little while to reflect current market dynamics our employment mix is continuously changing to the needs of our customers the graph on page 15 illustrates our earnings days our first quarter is showing two trends first 13 of our earnings days are in ammonia this is the highest proportion in navigator s trading history and we believe this is set to continue as we go forward the world has woken up to the opportunity of blue and green ammonia for in the first instance carbon free feedstock for more efficient crop production and food security and secondly is potential for carbon free vessel fuel blue ammonia ties nicely in with americas unique position with cheap natural gas and easy access for carbon capture and storage geology the second trend is showing our earnings days on petrochemical time charters are up tremendously during the first quarter we had eight vessels on time charters employed in carrying propylene ethane and ethylene i think it s a reflection of the changing industry s appetite for reliable virtual pipeline service of these products as opposed to traditional petrochemical spot market in a way it is an extension of the american midstream business model reaching overseas to international markets provided u s ethane is priced competitively u s produced ethylene in turn should also be attractive to international consumers page 16 illustrates a continued arbitrage between america to europe and to the far east this arbitrage supports record volumes of ethylene being exported from the u s gulf and we expect a minimum of 250 000 tons of ethylene to flow through our morgan s point ethylene export terminal for the second quarter with the joint venture terminal now delivering on its potential and u s natural gas liquids fundamentals coming back into vogue we have started to look at the potential to expand the terminal together with enterprise we are currently evaluating visibility in terms of engineering costs timing customer appetite and various permits in order to get a better understanding of the project as a whole the tonnage situation in the handysize segment is fairly light on page 17 illustrates a mere as i mentioned before 7 increase for the segment over the next few years we are confident that incremental supply of products and thus demand for vessels should materialize to accommodate these additional units and bear in mind that 20 of handysize vessels on the water today are about 20 years of age and therefore the situation can further be balanced should these vintage vessels be recycled so all in all on the following page navigator is very well positioned with record quarter ebitda and robust liquidity situation which are directly influenced by 90 around about 90 utilization rates rising ethyl list rising charter market a strong ethylene export through the terminal way and all these things where we think is set to continue in the outlook there s limited vessel supply continued production increases in north america on all gas products and derivatives lot of investments in the infrastructure so we are set to we believe that the stars as i opened with are pretty much aligned for a positive environment for navigator to thrive going forward over the next couple of years thank you very much back to randy randy giveans thank you oeyvind so yeah we will now open the lines for some q a to raise your hand press star nine and then you ll have to unmute your self with star six or if using zoom just use the raise hand function so first question your line is open oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer i think he s on mute ben nolan stifel financial corp analyst randy can you hear me randy giveans can hear you now go for it ben nolan stifel financial corp analyst there we go this is ben nolan over at stifel hey so i have a couple oeyvind you mentioned recontracting some of the vessels and assume they were for canadian exports any sense and appreciating you might not want to say specifically but relative let s just say for the vessels that you do have on contract across the fleet any sense of sort of what the uplift is in rates on a percentage basis relative to where things are currently contracted oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer so these particular vessels that you re referring to are indeed the ones trading taking not a canadian product from the west coast to asia and the rate is 20 year on year up but they are higher than what some of the third party ship brokers are quoting for a 12 month time charter rate in that segment traditionally handysize rate assessment lags whether it goes up or down because there s not that many transactions happening from week to week so there is definitely the rates that are being done for those trades are up on what you see publicly published by some of these ship brokers ben nolan stifel financial corp analyst ok that s very helpful i appreciate that oeyvind and then moving over to the ethylene terminal obviously you guys are talking about the possibility of expanding and enterprise has been very vocal about that themselves just thinking about kind of the strategy i know when you did phase 1 the idea was to basically have almost everything fully contracted before making that final investment decision with this being an expansion in a good market are you thinking of it the same way or would the joint venture be willing to maybe move forward with the project if and if it was whatever 60 contracted or pick a number oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer one thing to keep in mind ben is one when we did the original joint venture phase 1 we can call refer to it as phase 1 the pipeline taking product from mont belvieu down to the terminal was upsized in anticipation of a potential expansion similarly the storage tank aboveground storage tank was upsized from 50 000 cubic to 60 000 cubic because we both felt enterprise and navigator that we should be prepared for a future for a potential phase 2 doubling capacity and then you needed those assets to be capable of doing that so that s all in place and that was an incremental cost at the time so when the assets are there for a potential expansion you would this strategy is that we probably don t need 94 95 throughput commitment for the project to go ahead what that level is what level is both enterprise and how we get comfortable with that is a different question which we are investigating at the moment ben nolan stifel financial corp analyst ok fair enough and then lastly for me and i ll turn it over as a lot of this new capacity is coming online whether it s from the ethylene terminal or other lpg and petrochemical exports coming out of the united states you talked about only a 6 order book it seems like there could be room for additional orders i guess i was first curious if you guys are be contemplating that and or is there any appetite on a part of navigator to maybe do m a or go out and as was the case last year increased the size of the fleet through existing assets oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer i think it s something that is on our mind we re looking at it continuously we always have the thing with ethylene is that it s competing with ethane so there will be competition between ethane and ethylene markets for shipping so we envision a situation whereby we will move some ships from ethane trade into ethylene so to give you an example today our ethylene luna pool is about 50 50 50 50 ethane ethylene so the tonnage is there depending just depends what the product is willing to pay but if all the ships that are trading today moves from ethane to ethylene there s enough but then the question is what will happen to the ethane trade so it s a bit of a dynamic situation between the two ben nolan stifel financial corp analyst right and then i guess the question is how do you resolve that is it through newbuildings is it you guys taking a bigger position through secondhand acquisitions perhaps oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer i think it s all on the spectrum but what we can do and what we can control is of course on where and who we contract with and what product we ship on existing assets ben nolan stifel financial corp analyst right right ok that s all good enough i will turn it over appreciate it thank you guys randy giveans thank you ben all right next caller we will open up your line now chris robertson jefferies analyst hi good morning gentlemen this is chris robertson at jefferies how are you dag von appen executive chairman thank you oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer howdy chris robertson jefferies analyst so throughput has been elevated in april and may at around 100 000 tons in the month can you talk about your expectations for june and how that might relate to any technical or operational capabilities or limitations there and then following up on that can you talk about any expectations for seasonality in the back half of the year oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer hi chris thanks for the question for the ethylene terminal q1 was 367 000 tons for q2 it will be above 250 000 so close to q1 so april and may about 100 000 tons june will be a little bit less why it s more of a tactical approach from the joint venture whereby it takes time or 125 tons an hour to fill the tank so we want to start july third quarter first of july with a full tank so at the back end of june the terminal is unlikely to have full export capability or throughput because you want to go out with the bang first of july so it will be a little bit less in june but overall similar to q1 chris robertson jefferies analyst ok yeah thanks for the color on that then so just looking at the ethylene terminal with the expansion plans but i wanted to ask more on the east coast operations so given the situation with russia and ukraine at the moment european is trying to source energy from different suppliers and maybe that being a more structural change in the long term have there been any plans or discussions around expanding operations in the northeast to supply europe oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer i think chris you re absolutely correct in the assessment that the europeans have woken up to the fact that they need to diversify supply reliable supply of all energy products including lpg including ammonia including petrochemicals so where do they look well there s not that many places they can look but the closest one is east coast of america so we have seen an increase of exports from the east coast on propane to europe and that is for sure set to continue in a bigger way than we have seen in the past because the europeans need it what is happening now is that post winter repauno has started export operations from new jersey marcus hook we have connected finally and commissioned mariner 3 or 2x so the east coast is set to help and support the european demand and the effect of that is longer the ships have to sail longer to dag s opening remarks is that the disruptions is happening and we see it and instead of sourcing product from closer locations then you have to look across the atlantic so for shipping demand this is generally a positive but the u s east coast absolutely will play a larger role in providing energy security for europe chris robertson jefferies analyst thanks for the color on that oeyvind appreciate the time guys thank you randy giveans thanks chris all right next caller climent molins value investor s edge analyst good morning gentlemen this is climent molins on from value investor s edge following up on the increasing rate environment in the sector i was wondering if you could provide some further commentary on the charter market has two year or three year contracts seen similar increases or have these increases mostly taking place on shorter term fixtures oeyvind lindeman chief commercial officer thanks for the question climent traditionally the handysize time charter market is around about 12 months that is the typical duration in our segment so at any given point of time if you have 12 month time charters they need to be renewed as you as we move through the year but depending on the market conditions at those particular points in time then they traditionally we are able to increase rates or drop rates in this current environment we are in an up cycle we talked about stars aligning there s a lot of there s many fundamental reasons why the shipping market our ship market is tighter or more balanced than it has been in the past so renewal of time charters that are coming off we have seen and we commented are at higher rates than we ve done four months ago so we re in an up cycle we believe and we feel it and we can show to an increasing average rate across the board climent molins value investor s edge analyst all right that s all for me thank you guys for taking my questions randy giveans thanks climent i see another raised hand here go ahead your line should be open just make sure you unmute yourself david cohen minerva advisors analyst hi this is david cohen from minerva advisors i d be interested in any commentary you could provide with regard to the linkage between the change in the accounting lives of the vessels down from 30 years and subsequent investment decisions you might make in the fleet is there a direct linkage is there an indirect linkage is there no linkage thanks niall nolan chief financial officer hi i think in general there is no or very little linkage the investment decision on vessels is made on its own merits and probably is a shorter timeline than either 25 or indeed 30 years i mean it s certainly not something that we have looked at in the past to make an investment decision based on 30 years so i don t think that s a critical component of that decision i think the decision made to move from 30 years to 25 was more about the evolution of the ships and the economics and the ecology of newer ships relative to older ships and as we ve had some and we mentioned that we sold the navigator neptune which is 22 years of age this year we can do a comparison between those ships and some of the new ones which can be rather dramatic and not just economically but also environmentally so there is minimal linkage in terms of our investment decision based on either 25 or 30 years david cohen minerva advisors analyst thank you best of luck niall nolan chief financial officer thank you randy giveans all right looks like no further questions so thank you again to all for joining us on this call and hearing and seeing again our optimistic outlook for the future if you have any other questions feel free to email me directly we ll talk soon dag von appen executive chairman thank you duration 44

a former us sanctions official says the united states is pushing russia toward default by blocking debt payments as washington ups the ante in its economic warfare against moscow over the conflict with ukraine the us treasury department on tuesday announced it would no longer allow russia to make debt payments owed to american bondholders the washington post reported moscow has so far successfully managed to make its international bond payments despite the us led sanctions that have hindered the process though russia has not defaulted on its external debt for more than 100 years it has several billions of international bonds and last month made overdue bond payments to avoid default however russia was facing a may 25 deadline when a us license allowing it to make payments is set to expire the treasury move will make it almost impossible for russia to avoid a default on may 25 when a us license allowing it to make payments is set to expire the russian government owes a total of about 20 billion worth of bonds mostly in dollars and it owes about 500 million in interest payments over the next month according to gerard dipippo a senior fellow with the economics program at the center for strategic and international studies this will make the likelihood of a default now significant said adam smith a partner at gibson dunn and a former obama administration sanctions official we ve never done this to an economy like this before the biden administration had decided last week against extending the waiver in order to increase financial pressure on moscow western countries have slapped unprecedented sanctions on russia since president vladimir putin declared a military offensive against ukraine on february 24 the temporary general license 9a issued by the us treasury department s office of foreign assets control on march 2 had made an exception for the purposes of the receipt of interest dividend or maturity payments in connection with debt or equity that measure has allowed russia to keep making payments to investors to avert a default on its government debt and allowed american investors to continue to collect coupon payments last week us treasury secretary janet l yellen downplayed the repercussions of a russian default pointing out that the country is already largely unable to raise funds from international creditors because of the existing sanctions and investor flight over the war russia is not able to right now to borrow in global financial markets it has no access to capital markets yellen told reporters in germany where she participated in a conference of economic officials from the group of seven western industrialized nations if russia is unable to find a legal way to make these payments and they technically default on their debt i don t think that really represents a significant change in russia s situation they are already cut off from global capital markets and that would continue the biden administration has imposed harsh economic and banking sanctions on russia in response to russia s military actions in ukraine us president joe biden said the sanctions would limit russia s ability to do business in dollars euros pounds and yen the us president claimed that the only other alternative to the sanctions would be to start a third world war

verrica has been advised that pai pre approval inspection was conducted at sterling and is not aware of any reported observations related to the pai of vp 102 operations review division had advised verrica that the review of nda was completed and label was ready to be communicated except for sterling s classification status verrica has been notified that sterling is on oai official action indicated status west chester pa may 24 2022 globe newswire verrica pharmaceuticals inc verrica nasdaq vrca a dermatology therapeutics company developing medications for skin diseases requiring medical interventions today announced that the u s food and drug administration fda has issued a complete response letter crl regarding its new drug application nda for vp 102 for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum molluscum the only deficiency listed in the crl was related to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection of sterling pharmaceuticals services llc sterling the contract manufacturing organization cmo that manufactures verrica s bulk solution drug product sterling advised verrica on may 20 2022 that it received notice that it is on oai status sterling s oai classification resulted from a week long reinspection of the cmo conducted by fda in february 2022 the reinspection was conducted approximately 90 days after sterling was originally classified by the agency as vai voluntary action indicated on november 17 2021 verrica understood that the vai classification did not indicate that a reinspection was required the crl did not identify any other deficiencies moreover none of the issues identified by fda during the reinspection were specific to the manufacturing of vp 102 additionally verrica was informed by the division that it had completed its review of verrica s nda and product label there were no open questions on the nda review and the vp 102 label was ready to be communicated however verrica has been informed that internal fda policy is preventing the agency from communicating the label and approving the nda when a cmo has an unresolved classification status or is placed on oai status based on the successful pai of vp 102 at sterling and our understanding that the division was ready to communicate our label we believe our nda meets the statutory standards for approval and that any issues at sterling do not impact the manufacturing quality efficacy or safety of vp 102 commented ted white verrica s president and chief executive officer however we recognize that the dermatology division s hands may be tied due to the reinspection issues at sterling and thank them for their efforts working with us to date in addition mr white noted that vp 102 is a non sterile topical dermatology product that is not systemically absorbed it is completely solvent based and has been demonstrated to have bactericidal and viricidal properties by comparison the observations cited at sterling which led to its oai classification status were predominantly related to its distinct sterile operations where higher risk sterile ophthalmic products are manufactured by sterling for among other distributors the u s government for additional quality control and oversight at sterling verrica proactively and responsibly maintains a person in the plant policy which requires qualified verrica personnel be present at sterling whenever vp 102 is manufactured to ensure verrica s product is in strict compliance with the validated process and cgmp in addition verrica independently tests the drug product manufactured at sterling on two separate occasions at alcami laboratories alcami after manufacturing at sterling has been completed first the bulk solution is tested by alcami after it is packaged into ampules then it is tested again by alcami after the ampules are assembled into finished vp 102 applicators the fda previously issued a crl for verrica s nda for vp 102 on september 16 2021 citing in part a deficiency related to the agency s general inspection of sterling likewise not specifically related to the manufacturing of vp 102 following the crl the fda classified sterling as vai the establishment inspection report eir issued on november 17 2021 in connection with the vai specifically stated that i fda would not take or recommend regulatory or enforcement action against sterling ii the vai classification would not directly negatively impact fda s assessment of any pending marketing application referencing sterling and iii approval of an application may depend on a pai based on the vai classification of sterling and the statements contained in the eir verrica was led to believe that any concerns at sterling had been resolved to fda s satisfaction and as specifically required in the crl for approval of its nda accordingly verrica resubmitted its nda on november 24 2021 which was accepted the nda submission was based on positive results from two identical phase 3 randomized double blind multicenter clinical trials camp 1 and camp 2 that evaluated the safety and efficacy of vp 102 compared to placebo in a combined 500 subjects two years of age and older diagnosed with molluscum in both trials a clinically and statistically significant number of patients treated with vp 102 met the primary endpoint of complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at the end of the trial vp 102 was well tolerated in both trials treating nearly 8 000 lesions with bulk solution manufactured at sterling with no serious adverse events reported and a dropout rate of less than two percent mr white stated that verrica is extremely disappointed in the agency s issuance of the crl under the totality of these circumstances however as verrica weighs all its options to bring the first fda approved treatment for molluscum one of the largest unmet needs in dermatology to the market as soon as possible it will continue to work collaboratively with the agency verrica currently intends to file a type a meeting request by the end of this week in the meantime verrica is working collaboratively with sterling and its regulatory and quality consultants to help sterling present multiple options to the agency to allow sterling to expeditiously satisfy the majority of the deficiencies resulting in its oai classification and which are the basis for the crl concurrently verrica is engaging an additional cmo to serve as an alternative supplier of vp 102 s bulk solution pbm capital has expressed its continued support of the company and based on these discussions verrica is confident that it will have access to adequate capital to fund operations through the potential approval of vp 102 for molluscum about vp 102 verrica s lead product candidate vp 102 is a proprietary drug device combination product that contains a gmp controlled formulation of cantharidin 0 7 w v delivered via a single use applicator that allows for precise topical dosing and

people in the united states primarily children if approved vp 102 will be marketed in the united states under the conditionally accepted brand name ycanth in addition verrica has successfully completed a phase 2 study of vp 102 for the treatment of common warts and a phase 2 study of vp 102 for the treatment of external genital warts about molluscum contagiosum molluscum there are

washington the united states will end an exemption allowing russia to pay foreign debt held by american investors with funds held in russia the us treasury said yesterday a move that could push vladimir putinâ s country closer to default the us treasury department said on its website yesterday it would not extend a licence set to expire at 0401 gmt today allowing russia to make payments on its sovereign debt to us persons the waiver had allowed moscow to keep paying interest and principal and avert default on its government debt russia has almost us 2 billion rm8 78 billion worth of payments falling due up to the year end on its international bonds the next one on friday is for â 100 million rm470 million in interest on two bonds one requires payment in dollars euros pounds or swiss francs only the other can be paid in rubles according to reports by reuters and the wall street journal on friday the russian finance ministry transferred funds out of the country early to make the payments and avoid default nearly us 400 million in interest is due in late june us treasury secretary janet yellen last week hinted at the move announced yesterday saying the exemption was put in place to allow financial institutions to adjust but that it was â time limitedâ punishing western sanctions on russia have largely severed the country from the international financial system including blocking moscowâ s ability to gain access to funds held in us banks to pay its foreign creditors the latest move scraps the final outlet which was forcing putinâ s government to drain its war chest of reserves to make payments yellen had signalled the default was the goal part of president joe bidenâ s efforts to intensify the pressure on putin as the war rages on â russia is not able right now to borrow in global financial markets it has no access to capital markets if russia is unable to find a legal way to make these payments they technically default on their debt â yellen told reporters last week the russian government has attempted to pay in domestic currency but many of the bonds do not allow repayment in roubles after a 15 to 30 day grace period following a missed payment the country likely would be declared in default further deteriorating its financial position and allowing creditors to take legal action to recover the funds however moscow is still bringing in vast amounts of cash from its energy exports and is forcing countries in europe to pay in rubles to avoid sanctions that situation could change if europe goes through with an oil embargo although eu officials have been discussing the issue for weeks without a resolution the russian finance ministry said the countryâ s foreign debt amounts to between 4 5 trillion and 4 7 trillion roubles rm341 billion and rm356 billion â or 20 of the total public debt â afp reuters

the call over to corie corie barry chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us i am proud of our team s strong execution and focus on providing amazing service for our customers throughout the quarter they navigated the uncertain macro environment and drove higher customer satisfaction scores while keeping energy and excitement going around the initiatives that we believe will drive longer term opportunities we grew our totaltech membership increased momentum in our health business launched new product categories and reached our fastest ever q1 average online sales delivery speed at our investor update in march we said we expected our fiscal 23 financial results to look different as we all lap stimulus and other government support our industry cycles the last two years of unusually strong demand and we leveraged our position of strength to continue to invest in our future in addition we said we expected promotional activity to increase and supply chain expenses to be a pressure as such we guided our annual comparable sales to decline 1 to 4 and our non gaap operating income rate to decline 60 basis points to approximately 5 4 therefore the drivers of our q1 financial results were largely as expected macro conditions worsened since we provided our guidance in early march including higher inflation and the war in ukraine which resulted in our sales being slightly lower than our expectations and supply chain costs a little higher than we planned our investment in totaltech at approximately 100 basis points of gross margin pressure was in line with our expectations and revenue from our credit card profit share was higher than anticipated overall i am proud of our team s ability to develop and execute plans to adapt to the changing environment over the past two years and to the more recent macroeconomic conditions our revenue and profitability remain much stronger than they were pre pandemic q1 revenue of 10 6 billion is 1 5 billion or 16 higher than q1 of pre pandemic fiscal 20 and while our non gaap operating income rate is currently being impacted by our investments it is still 80 basis points higher than fiscal 20 even with those investments and supply chain pressures our enterprise comparable sales declined 8 as we lapped particularly strong comparable sales last year the 37 comp sales growth in q1 of last year was driven by the timing of government stimulus payments lapping a quarter during which our stores were closed early in the pandemic and the heightened demand for stay at home focused purchases from a category standpoint the biggest contributors to the comp sales decline were computing and home theater although down from last year strong sales compared to q1 of fiscal 20 our computing revenue has grown more than 30 our domestic appliance business which has grown every quarter except for one for more than 10 years delivered comparable sales growth of 3 on top of 67 growth last year we aspire to help customers with all their technology needs in the most seamless way possible across all touchpoints and we are encouraged by the improvements in our customer net promoter scores we have been leveraging our omnichannel strength to serve and support our customers as their shopping behavior and expectations have evolved significantly over the past two years while customers have returned to physical stores to see and touch products and get advice our digital engagement with customers remains very high our online sales as a percentage of domestic sales are 31 still twice as high as pre pandemic levels and revenue from virtual phone and chat interactions continues to increase rapidly additionally we are expanding our engagement with customers in their homes as in home consultations and in home installations are up significantly during the quarter we saw higher nps overall and we saw our highest ever nps from in store purchasers and in store services i would like to take a moment to expand on the topic of inflation important in the current environment like other companies we have seen cost inflation in areas such as labor marketing and supply chain however this cost inflation was largely in line with our expectations and benefited from planning and execution over the previous two years as it relates to product pricing we have seen an increase in our average selling prices over the past two years due to a number of factors first our product sales mix has changed as customers have mix into premium products at higher price points this has been happening for years and accelerated during the pandemic additionally we have driven material growth in appliances which carry high asps and have become a larger part of our mix second there was overall lower promotional and markdown activity during much of the pandemic due to the shortage of product to meet demand and third our vendors are absorbing higher transportation and component costs and some of that has led to higher cost of goods sold for us in many cases we have passed through this higher cost of goods sold in the form of higher prices to customers importantly and fundamentally we aim to be competitive in our pricing we have seen a pickup in the promotional environment as we have consistently noted starting in july of last year as we entered fiscal 23 we expected the promotional environment to create margin pressure in q1 and throughout the year in q1 we did experience a more promotional environment for many of our products when compared to last year and some products were even more promotional than we expected coming into the quarter and were similar to pre pandemic levels turning back to our q1 results our ending inventory was up 9 compared to last year and essentially in line with the growth of our revenues since fiscal 20 our teams did an amazing job actively managing inventory levels as the quarter progressed in this evolving supply and demand environment pockets of inventory constraints still exist but are currently isolated to certain products and vendors overall our inventory remains healthy even though inventory availability in ce is much better than it has been for much of the pandemic the supply chain continues to be challenging with ongoing transportation disruptions and higher costs including containers labor and fuel we are of course not immune to the supply chain challenges in the world today and we are seeing some impacts on our business we have invested in many aspects of our supply chain over the last several years in ways that have helped us navigate the environment and mitigate the impacts we have employed a portfolio approach as it relates to carriers transportation partners and parcel delivery partners and we have built deep relationships across our supply chain including port carriers and deconsolidation operations in addition we strategically leveraged the use of both rail and over the road transportation modes to move product all of this has helped us to drive capacity avoid large scale disruption and mitigate cost increases importantly our contractual relationships have allowed us to limit our exposure to the more turbulent spot market the strong relationships we have cultivated with our vendors have also been crucial to our navigation of the supply chain environment working closely with our vendors we have a great deal of visibility into and can influence the status of product in the supply chain process additionally we actually handled transportation for many of our vendors meaning we take control in asia or mexico then we have full visibility and control of the inventory movement and cost we have invested in our distribution center network effectively bringing product closer to customers and implementing technology solutions that increase productivity and speed to customer we have also invested in our store base fulfillment including our ship from store customer fulfillment centers and implemented an effective employee delivery system these investments have allowed us to make dramatic improvements and speed of delivery to our customers even with the significant increase in volume in the past two plus years in addition we have many options for our customers to pick up their products themselves through in store pickup curbside pickup lockers and alternate pickup locations customers clearly appreciate the convenience as the percentage of online sales picked up in stores has remained relatively consistent over the past several years at approximately 40 even with the incredible improvements in shipping time as it relates to esg we remain encouraged by the recent recognition of our work to support the environment and our community both inside and outside best buy we are proud to be included on ethisphere s 2022 world s most ethical companies list we are one of only three retailers on it and it s our eighth time earning the honor we were also included on the 2022 forbes list of best employers for diversity as one of the top four retailers on the list it s our third consecutive year making the rankings that recognize leadership and commitment toward building a more inclusive workplace during the quarter we expanded our recycling program to include a new service for customers who are looking for our help recycling their large products for a fee we will go to customers homes to pick up large electronics and appliances as well as an unlimited number of small products and ensure they re responsibly recycled and kept out of landfills this service is an addition to our everyday recycling programs available at all best buy stores in our haul away service with the purchase of new products as i mentioned earlier our employees executed well in the evolving environment in many cases making hard decisions to run the business effectively and prioritize our customers even with the expected slowdown this year as we lap two plus years of pandemic impacts we continue to be in a fundamentally stronger position than we expected to be at this point we are confident in the strength of our business and excited about what lies ahead we have a compelling value creation opportunity and are investing now as we have successfully invested ahead of change in our past to ensure we re ready to meet the needs of our customers and retain our unique position in our industry as we provided a more detailed investor update in combination with our q4 results on march 3rd i m not going to outline all our initiatives but we d like to provide a few updates on our progress in march we spoke quite a bit about totaltech our unique membership program that includes member pricing discounts product protection free delivery and installation and 24 7 tech support fundamentally totaltech is designed to provide our customers with complete confidence in their technology buying it getting it up and running enjoying it and fixing it if something goes wrong during the quarter we continued to sign up more members as customers realize the great benefits of the program and we are encouraged by the higher engagement customer satisfaction and increased revenue we continue to see from customers who have signed up to become members we are pleased with the pace at which we are acquiring new members especially considering the macro environment we continue to see that totaltech has broad appeal across customer segments additionally we are improving our ability to gain members not only in retail stores but in our digital and in home channels as a reminder from a financial perspective totaltech is a near term investment to drive longer term benefits we expect year over year pressure on our gross profit rate to cease as we lap the launch in october and over time we expect the incremental spend we garner from members will lead to higher operating income dollars accordingly totaltech is a significant contributor to our fiscal 25 goals as we outlined in march we are optimizing our workforce and reimagining our physical presence in ways that serve our customers needs in our more digital world we are making investments that provide a better more seamless shopping experience as the customer moves from online shopping to visiting our stores to video chatting from their home this includes our virtual sales strategy early in the pandemic the volume of customers interacting with us via phone and chat skyrocketed the volume has remained high and we are actively working to increase the sales opportunity of these interactions through a number of efforts one we are leveraging a team of expert sales associates working from their homes many of whom have in depth store experience and are certified in multiple categories two we have staffed our virtual store with dedicated experts who can help you buy a video and demo a product just like they would in our store and three we are enhancing the training for our offshore call center agents help them feel like competent salespeople we are already seeing great results as revenue from these interactions more than doubled in q1 compared to last year enhancements to our technology platforms are in progress to further streamline our operations and enable these employees to chat video text share their screens and transact with this we will be able to accelerate the productivity and sales opportunity further we ve spoken quite a bit about our consultation service that provides customers with expert help and inspiration tailored to their unique tech needs often right in their homes this is growing and important as we continue to see very high customer satisfaction scores and increasing spend by customers who engage with the consultants we also have a team that is focused on providing tech products and solutions for businesses in specific industries including home building hospitality and healthcare we have been growing this aspect of our business for several years and more recent investments in our digital capabilities and fulfillment have led to strong growth momentum that we expect will continue for example q1 revenue from this team was up 15 over last year s q1 and up more than 70 from q1 of fiscal 20 as i step back to comment on our overall workforce we have been actively evolving the composition of our teams throughout the last two years as customer behavior changed and became even more digitally focused the result is that our overall headcount is actually lower than pre pandemic we feel like we are largely at the right number as it relates to the strategic evolution of our operating model the demand we are seeing and the nature of our customer interactions we will continue to learn evaluate and evolve the model in light of the way the business and shopping habits are changing at the same time we have invested and will continue to invest in flexibility training compensation and benefits for our associates we are incredibly proud that our field turnover rates remain significantly below the retail average and are near our pre pandemic turnover rates additionally our store general manager turnover is just 6 meaning rgms have the tenure and experience to effectively help their teams navigate this dynamic environment it is clear that we have store managers who are invested in their employees their career paths their well being and their communities and i thank them for their dedication of course as previously noted we are also reimagining our physical stores this year we expect to complete approximately 45 remodels to implement our experience store concept we are excited about these remodels as we continue to see higher revenue and nps in the pilot locations compared to the control stores especially as one of the pilots has been running almost two years we also continue to see strong results from our outlet stores and are on track to roll out more this year with new stores opening soon in chicago houston and phoenix our outlet stores assort open box clearance end of life and otherwise distressed large product inventory in major appliances and televisions that might otherwise be liquidated at significantly lower recovery rate we tend to see twice the recovery rate of our cost of goods sold when we sell this product at our outlets versus alternative channels additionally these locations can attract new and reengaged customers last year we estimate that approximately 16 of outlet customers were new to best buy and 37 where reengaged best buy customers in fiscal 23 we plan to double the number of outlets by opening 15 additional stores and we are expanding our assortment beyond major appliances and large tvs to include computing gaming and mobile phones we re already seeing increased performance in these new outlet formats as customers gravitate to the expanded assortment finally these outlet stores are an important element of our circular economy strategy by providing a second opportunity for products to be resold instead of ending up in the landfill and another important element of the circular economy strategy is our trade in program we have an extensive trade in program covering more major ce categories than anyone else in q1 we took in 135 000 trade in units from customers not only does our trade in program keep tech products out of landfills our customers typically spend three times the amount they receive on their trade in on new products at best buy we are continuing our category expansion strategy as well for example we re helping customers commute more sustainably with a new lineup of the best electric bikes scooters and mopeds over the next 18 months we ll be bringing a selection of these products to nearly every best buy store we re also rolling out charging devices perfect for our customers garages in several stores and geek squad can not only assemble the e bikes for customers but we re also beginning a pilot to test service and repair for each transportation products in some of our stores we also just recently announced further expansion into the health and beauty category by launching new skin care technology products online and in 300 of our stores in our best buy health business we are pleased with our first quarter momentum in q1 we saw strong growth in new signups for our active aging business that offers health and safety solutions to enable adults to live and thrive at home in our emerging virtual care business we connect patients with their physicians to enable care at home last november we acquired current health a technology company with an fda cleared monitoring platform for care at home to help us accelerate our strategy the combination of current health offerings and our scale presence and geek squad in home capabilities is already resonating with the healthcare industry boosted by its affiliation with best buy current health had its best commercial booking quarter ever including expansion of its relationships with health systems such as mount sinai health system parkland health as well as the u k national health service and others i am excited to share that current health was awarded best hospital technology implementation in the 2022 medtech breakthrough awards program for its role in supporting health systems across the u s implement innovative care at home programs current health was also selected by frost sullivan as the 2022 company of the year in the global virtual home care platform industry in summary i am proud of how much we accomplished in the first quarter and excited about what lies ahead for us clearly there remains a great deal of uncertainty on one hand consumers still have relatively strong balance sheets they continue to spend wages are up and unemployment is at record lows on the other hand many consumers are lapping stimulus income they received last year and are also facing issues like higher gas and food prices rising interest and mortgage rates recession fears stock market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in ukraine underlying all that is the gradual shifting of spend from stay at home purchases to more experiential spend on services and the activities many were unable to enjoy during the pandemic as i mentioned at the start of my comments while the drivers of our results were largely as expected the comparable sales decline of 8 was on the softer side as inflationary pressures heightened throughout the quarter that trend has continued into the beginning of q2 and it does not appear that it will abate in the near term therefore as matt will outline we are revising our guidance and now expect fiscal 23 comparable sales decline in the range of 3 to 6 and we are correspondingly updating our non gaap operating income rate to a range of 5 2 to 5 4 we will continue to proactively navigate this rapidly changing environment balancing the day to day operations with our commitment to our long term strategy and growth initiatives before i turn the call over to matt for more details on q1 and our outlook i want to thank our employees for everything they do for our customers in all our channels i greatly appreciate your teamwork and perseverance i love the best buy culture and our commitment to enriching lives through technology and i will close by saying this we firmly believe that technology is more relevant today than ever every aspect of our lives has changed with technology and we uniquely know how to make it human in our customers homes right for their lives from our expertly curated assortment to in home consultations all the way to tech support when your tech isn t working the way you want or traded in recycling when you want to upgrade we believe we have an ability to inspire and support customers in ways no one else can with that i would like to turn the call over to matt matt bilunas chief financial officer good morning everyone hopefully you were able to view our press release this morning with our detailed financial results as corie mentioned we expected our q1 financial results to be softer on a year over year basis our enterprise revenue of 10 6 billion declined 8 on a comparable basis as we lapped a very strong 37 comparable sales growth last year our non gaap operating income rate was 4 6 compared to 6 4 last year if you compare it to the first quarter of fiscal 20 before the pandemic our non gaap operating income rate increased 80 basis points our revenue growth has clearly played a role in our improved sg a rate but i would also like to highlight a few other factors our investment in totaltech membership alone added more than 100 basis points of operating income rate pressure this quarter compared to the fiscal 20 period we are also investing in best buy health these are both areas that we know create near term pressure but we believe they will drive compelling financial returns over time as they scale i also want to note that since fiscal 20 our mix of revenue from our online channel has more than doubled we have efficiently evolved our operating model to support this shift in consumer shopping behavior while at the same time navigating higher wages and increased supply chain and technology costs let me now share more details on the first quarter performance versus last year in our domestic segment revenue decreased 8 7 to 9 9 billion driven by a comparable sales decline of 8 5 from a monthly phasing standpoint as expected the largest comparable sales decline was the five week fiscal march period as corie noted from a category standpoint the largest contributors to the comparable sales decline in the quarter were computing and home theater in addition services comparable sales declined 12 this quarter this was primarily the result of our totaltech membership which includes benefits that were previously stand alone revenue generating services such as warranty and installation in our international segment revenue decreased 5 4 to 753 million this decrease was driven by the loss of 19 million in revenue from exiting mexico and a comparable sales decline of 1 4 in canada turning now to gross profit where our enterprise rate declined 120 basis points to 22 1 the domestic gross profit rate declined 140 basis points which was primarily driven by lower services margin rate including pressure associated with totaltech in addition lower product margin rates which included increased promotional activity and the impact of higher supply chain costs also negatively impacted our rate during the quarter the previous items were partially offset by higher profit sharing revenue in the company s private label and co branded credit card arrangement lastly our international non gaap gross profit rate improved 130 basis points compared to last year which provided a weighted benefit of approximately 20 basis points to our enterprise results as a reminder the gross profit rate pressure from totaltech primarily relates to the incremental customer benefits and the associated costs compared to our previous totaltech support offer on a weighted basis the services category negatively impacted the domestic gross profit rate by approximately 100 basis points compared to last year which largely aligned with our expectations entering the quarter moving next to sg a our enterprise non gaap sg a decreased 100 million while increasing 60 basis points as a percentage of sales within the domestic segment the primary driver of the reduced sg a was lower incentive compensation of 130 million which included lapping 40 million for one time gratitude and appreciation awards last year partially offsetting the lower incentive compensation were increased expenses for advertising in our health initiatives during the quarter we returned a total of 654 million to shareholders through share repurchases of 455 million and dividends of 199 million our quarterly dividend of 0 88 was an increase of 26 and marked the eighth straight year our regular dividend increased at least 10 compared to the prior year consistent with our original guidance we expect to spend approximately 1 5 billion in share repurchases this year let me next share more color on our guidance for the full year many of the key assumptions driving our outlook from when we enter the year remain unchanged we still expect the first half of the year to be more pressured on a year over year basis for both revenue growth and our non gaap operating income rate in addition we still expect the non gaap operating income rate decline to be primarily come from lower gross profit rate with totaltech being the key driver let me next share some context on what has changed in our outlook entering the year we were cognizant of lapping the large levels of government stimulus actions last year as we already shared sales came in a little lower than our expectations for the first quarter and this trend has continued into the second quarter it is difficult to assess how much of the decline may be a longer tail associated with elevated stimulus spending last year or overall consumer spending slowing down due to inflationary concerns and the shift of consumer spending to experiences based on the trends we are seeing over the past several weeks we now feel it is more likely that we will be on the lower end of our original guidance expectations as a result we now expect comparable sales to decline 3 to 6 as corie discussed clearly there is still a lot of uncertainty in macro crosscurrents thus we will continue to assess the sales trends adjusting for our spend for variable items like advertising in store labor as well as discretionary areas as appropriate we also expect favorable trends at our private label credit card arrangement to partially offset higher costs in areas like supply chain for the remainder of the year at the same time we remain committed to progressing the initiatives we are confident will deliver compelling financial returns in the future as a result of the lower sales outlook our non gaap operating income rate outlook is now 5 2 to 5 4 based on these factors i have just outlined our guidance for the full year now represents the following enterprise revenue of 48 3 billion to 49 9 billion a comparable sales decline of 3 to 6 enterprise non gaap operating income rate of approximately 5 2 to 5 4 non gaap diluted eps of 8 40 to 9 we expect our non gaap effective tax rate to be approximately 24 and lastly we still expect capital expenditures to be approximately 1 1 billion as we shared on our last earnings call we no longer plan to provide quarterly guidance going forward however we d like to provide context on our expectations several of the key themes from the first quarter are expected to be consistent in the second quarter as a result we anticipate that our second quarter comparable sales and the year over year decline in our non gaap operating income rate will both be very similar to our first quarter results also as a reminder last year s second quarter includes a one time diluted earnings per share benefit of 0 47 from a lower effective tax rate i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions questions answers operator we take our first question today from zachary fadem of wells fargo please go ahead sam reid wells fargo securities analyst thanks so much it s actually sam reid pitching in for zach here i wanted to ask kind of a big picture question maybe could you sort of recast your fy 25 assumptions in the context of today s updated guidance you know obviously some of these macro headwinds you called out are maybe likely to be temporal that said does it put more pressure on your business to deliver in fy 24 and fy 25 and how should we be thinking about you know those 2 to 4 outyear comps in that 6 3 to 6 8 operating margin target in that context matt bilunas chief financial officer yeah thank you for the question obviously i think it s way too early for us to be updating our fy 25 goals at this point you re right i mean i think the lowering of the range this year does create a bit of a different picture but at the same time we very much believe in the strength of our industry and are very encouraged by the initiatives that we have that we outlined at the investor day totaltech and expanded assortment in our health initiatives those all remain the same and if anything we re even more excited about those as we look forward so obviously the ranges we gave this year they are pretty wide and the ranges for fy 25 is still pretty wide so there is a number of outcomes we already had contemplated in setting those goals back in march so we still remain pretty confident in those numbers sam reid wells fargo securities analyst awesome no that s super helpful and then maybe pivoting a little bit here to appliances obviously it s great to see you guys still delivering positive comps here especially given what you were up against last year kind of maybe you want to talk to the sustainability of the positive comps in the appliance segment especially as we really kind of you know continue to lap some of that stimulus and maybe face some of these macro pressures thanks so much matt bilunas chief financial officer yeah i think this appliances has been a place where we ve been sustaining growth for a long time it s been growing every quarter for 10 years except for one when we closed our stores so we are very confident in our team s ability to continue to drive sales up clearly there are some very elevated levels of comp that were coming over the last couple of years of spend but the team continues to drive the assortment and the experience changes that make it a very meaningful place to buy appliances and that includes both the majors and the small sites so we remain really excited and confident about the prospects there for the fifth straight year we received the j d power award for the highest customer satisfaction among appliance retailers so the team is giving the right experience that i think will help us drive sales higher as we look into the future sam reid wells fargo securities analyst awesome thanks so much guys really appreciate it corie barry chief executive officer thank you operator thank you we take our next question from steven forbes of guggenheim partners please go ahead steven forbes guggenheim partners analyst thank you and good morning corie i wanted to focus on totaltech and i appreciate the color but i was hoping if you can provide us a little more details around how membership is framing relative to expectations maybe in the context of churn and or retention and then just a broader comment on what part of the value proposition do you think is resonating most with your customer in the current sort of environment corie barry chief executive officer yes so i m just going to start by taking a little bit of a step back here obviously what we re aiming to do here is take our deep knowledge of the customer combined with our history of a multitude of membership programs and our unique abilities to create a very unique paid membership offer with very broad reach that broad appeal means we see more different types of demographics that this appeals to and by the way it is also more comfortable to sell because our associates just have a lot of passion around the multitude of offers to specifically your question about what s resonating the truth is all aspects are resonating but different pieces seem to resonate with different demographics certainly the included warranty aspects especially the apple care resonates with some of our younger demographics the pricing and discounts actually resonates across all and then the support we give resonate with some of our older demographics so the point here is actually this broad reach of a multitude of pieces of the offer that will actually appeal to many the purpose as we said is to drive frequency and share of wallet over time the reason we re not updating right now is we are just starting to lap our beta test from last year if you remember we actually launched in april with the full rollout in october and so we are literally just getting a feel now for what retention looks like it remains in line with as we ve converted customers remains in line with what we had expected but right now we re just we want to actually start to lap some of those new customers who actually opted into the program before we comment too much on retention what i will say is look the goal here is to create a moat around the consumer and to make it kind of inconceivable for them to buy ce anywhere else and we know we re growing our share of wallet with those that are shopping us so we know it s doing what we want it to do but we re using this time period to continue to learn and iterate on the acquisition the usage that we re seeing right now and then ultimately those retention figures steven forbes guggenheim partners analyst thank you i ll keep it to one best of luck corie barry chief executive officer thank you operator thank you joe feldman of telsey has our next question please go ahead joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question back on the promotions you mentioned some products are starting to get more promotional and i guess i was just wondering which areas you are seeing more of that pressure and your view of promotions maybe the balance of this year you know will it accelerate or do you think it will just be kind of normalized relative to a year ago thanks matt bilunas chief financial officer sure thanks joe you know as we outlined back in march we expected to see promotions be pressured this year compared to last year and we also commented that we that eventually they would return to closer to fy 20 levels at some point as we have got into the quarter we actually started to seeing a little bit more pressure on the promotion side than we expected again that was offset by a little bit of credit better credit card profit share from the arrangement we have but we did see a little bit more promotionality and i think it s pretty broad across most of our categories we are starting to increase in terms of the amount of discount and the mix on promotion tvs was a place where we did see more promotions on a year over year basis computing has been starting more promotional all the way back to july of last year so that continued as well so those are the areas i would probably highlight but there are also even just some very iconic type of products to in specific categories that are very promotional even though in some cases inventory is constrained and so overall we know it s returning as we expected it would it isn t quite back to fy 20 levels but it is heading in the same heading to that path as we expected joe feldman telsey advisory group analyst that s great thank you and i will also keep it to one and good luck this quarter matt bilunas chief financial officer thank you corie barry chief executive officer thanks joe operator thank you moving now to mike baker of davidson please go ahead mike baker d a davidson analyst hi thanks guys a couple of related questions one you said march was the worst part of the quarter so can you talk a little bit about april it sounds like you said the weakness is continuing but a little bit more detail there and then related to that it looks like and this is similar to your previous guidance but the back half is much better in terms of year over year changes versus the implied front half what gives you that confidence is it simply just different comparisons or why are we expecting a significantly better back half thanks matt bilunas chief financial officer sure yeah so we are not going to comment on specific months but march was the biggest decline in q1 and you know as the sales pressure continued as we exited q1 actually it was a little more pressure than on sales than we expected if you remember last year too as we got into the second quarter we talked about how we were still doing about a 30 comp in the first few weeks of may so we are still lapping those stimulus payments that kind of came in starting in march of last year and so that s what s driving the lion s share of that sales decline as you think about the back half of the year i mean there is a number of things we believe as you get to the back half you know most of that stimulus impact a lot of it will have left in terms of a comparison we also know as we look to the back half of the year we do expect product availability and certain products and categories to improve compared to the first part of this year and also if you look at compared to last year in q4 there was some notable product shortages in iconic areas that we talked about not getting that did have an impact on sales we also in q4 shortened our store hours in january as we were lapping some of the omicron variant impacts and then lastly i comment is we do expect our initiatives to start to continue to drive more impact to our sales outlook as you get further down into the trajectory of those ramps so those are the reasons i d highlight mike baker d a davidson analyst ok thank you for the color matt bilunas chief financial officer thank you operator next we will move to karen short of barclays please go ahead karen short barclays analyst hi thanks very much i actually just wanted to push a little harder and follow up on the 2025 guide with respect to where you are at today and obviously as you were just asked you know you did elaborate a little bit on what the second half and why the second half will look better but maybe a little more color on why you feel confident in the 2025 guide about 6 3 to 6 8 in light of the fact that obviously 2q will be much weaker than expected and then just on that same note are you factoring in a recessionary environment with respect to your guidance for the year and with respect to your 2025 guide corie barry chief executive officer yes so i will start with the fiscal 25 guidance i am going to reiterate what matt said it is still really early in the long range guide that we gave and there are many moving parts and pieces as i outlined in some of the prepared comments and so we remain confident in the initiatives and the roadmap that we have put together to deliver that 25 guide and as matt said it s a pretty wide range so what we are going to use this year to do is to continue to understand how those initiatives develop how this year plays out obviously and then how the implications for all of that in that longer term guide but i think it warrants giving it some time to see how the year is going to play specific to your point about recession i want to take one step back here for a second i think i want to start with a reminder that this is a very stable industry consumer electronics over time is a stable industry and the last two years have clearly underscored the importance of tech in people s lives so i think it s important for us to have that as a backdrop and the fact that we were obviously already planning for our industry to decline this year and then we have adjusted based on what we are seeing in the recent results it s fair to say that we are factoring in elements of softer demand but we are not planning for a full recession or guide we will not assume a full recession at this point you know obviously if that were the case we will continue to update the performance and the expectations but i think i would characterize our guide more as a softer environment not a full recession matt bilunas chief financial officer and i might just add i think also i think you made a question around the rate guide as well i think as you think about the rate this year we are actually not too far off from our original guidance expectations for this year from 5 2 to 5 4 just acknowledging a little bit of softer on the sales side but all of the structural things that are included in that expectation are kind of coming in as we expect it s nothing that s too dissimilar at this point and we have already built those into what we see this year and what we see in the out years to be confident in addition to sales but also being able to achieve some of those rate expectations for fy 25 karen short barclays analyst ok thank you very much matt bilunas chief financial officer thank you operator thank you seth basham of wedbush securities has our next question seth basham wedbush securities analyst thanks a lot and good morning i would like to follow up on the promotional environment if you could give us some sense as to what you are planning for in terms of promotions this year relative to pre pandemic levels and how much is embedded in terms of gross margin pressure relative to your prior guide that would be helpful matt bilunas chief financial officer yes so i would say it s fair to say we expect like i said earlier that promotions returned closer and closer to fy 20 throughout this year exactly when that happens you know we are not commenting on but we would expect it to increase as the year progresses importantly as you look to the back half of this year though we are starting to lap where promotions increased last year starting in july in computing so we have baked into our plans a slow increase of promotionality in most categories as you get toward the back half of this year exactly where that lands exactly at fy 20 we are it s hard to exactly say but we have baked that into the plans corie barry chief executive officer and i think it s worth noting and i know all of you know this but just to reiterate obviously promotions are not just a function of best buy they are a function of relationships with our vendors as well we are interested in you know ensuring that their newest and greatest products are out there for the world to see and priced appropriately so this is not just a function of best buy promotionality it s a function of the overall industry promotionality in partnership with our vendors seth basham wedbush securities analyst understood thank you operator thank you we will now move to jonathan matuszewski of jefferies please go ahead jonathan matuszewski jefferies analyst great thanks for taking my question matt a lot of our clients are focused on the ability of companies to flex expenses in an environment of slowing demand potentially persisting could you just update us you know on the fixed and variable split in your p l and priorities for reduced discretionary spend if the backdrop does worsen thanks so much matt bilunas chief financial officer sure yes so as we started the year we even the guide that we gave at 5 4 on a range of sales outcomes we there is a level of implied already trying to understand the levers you do to keep within the 5 4 rate in terms of the original guidance so it s something that we do as a normal course of business as we see sales slide up or slide down from our expectations there are a number of areas where you can that simply happen because they are variable to like check lane tender but you also start to adjust areas like marketing or store labor associated with the lower volumes if it does happen so those are the variable things that we look at to adjust to as the sales trends change in addition to that there are even some more discretionary areas that you can start to look at in addition to variable items but in some cases or even additional marketing to the extent that you are comfortable or even simple areas like travel or adjusting your capital spend which can adjust depreciation depending on when you do that during a year so there are variable and then more discretionary and you know as corie noted we are not really planning for a recession this year to the extent that we did there is obviously more fixed cost areas you can look at if business trends down even more right now we are not planning for that you can imagine if that had happened we would look at some of those areas as well but we would in any event we are trying to hold dear to us the strategic investments that we are making that provide that long term growth to get to our fy 25 goal so that s the last place that we will look at reducing as we look to this year in terms of how we see it now corie barry chief executive officer i do think it s fair to say the team has obviously navigated this softening environment quite well up to this point and obviously the factors that we use as we are trying to adjust to that softer demand obviously overlap with the considerations that you would take into account if you are managing for a recession so you can imagine behind the scenes you are running through a bunch of scenarios and i think the team has done a nice job flexing with a rapidly changing environment and it s that same type of kind of mindset and considerations you would take if that were to flex down even further jonathan matuszewski jefferies analyst it makes sense thanks guys best of luck corie barry chief executive officer thank you matt bilunas chief financial officer thank you operator thank you next we will move to brad thomas of keybanc please go ahead brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst hi good morning just want to ask about inventory a bit corie i think you characterize inventory as being overall healthy but just wondering if you could put that into a little more context talk about some of the levers you may be able to pull if the consumer continues to weaken here and then maybe if you could just help us think a little bit more about how much inventory levels were up just because of inflation and asps thanks so much corie barry chief executive officer yeah first just some gratitude to the team who has really done amazing work carefully managing our inventory levels and then importantly leveraging some of the investments that we have made in our supply chain some context is helpful here our inventory balance was unusually low last year so again if you remember how much demand there was in the marketplace at 37 comp we had an unusually low balance last year and that inventory balance right now is almost perfectly in line with the sales growth versus pre pandemic so if you went back to kind of normalized pre pandemic now sales growth and inventory growth are almost perfectly in line and i think that s a true testament to our vendor partnerships and proactively managing those levels in line with what we have been seeing behind the theme as you can imagine actually units in some of the key categories are down as we have seen asp shifting from the variety of factors that i noted whether it s premium and the mix shift in our business or inflation so that s even what underscores the confidence that i have in the statement around our inventory being healthy feeling very much like it s in the right place i think it is important to note there is still some spotty constraints in very isolated areas for specific vendors and some of the more iconic skus that matt mentioned but over archingly we feel very strongly that we are in a good inventory position and that s very much in line with how we have managed inventory historically brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst that s great corie and any context on how much inflation has your inventory up and thank you so much corie barry chief executive officer yes we haven t sized it specifically as i kind of alluded to the fact it s really hard because back to when about the different pieces that are driving our asps up you ve got mix shifts in the business as people have skewed more premium you ve got more appliances which tends to skew to higher asps you ve got over archingly over the last couple of years fewer markdowns less promotions and then you also have inflation so all of those pieces add into the asp increases we have been seeing that s why the color i am trying to give is we have actually seen in many of the key categories at the unit levels of our inventory are actually down versus some of the pre pandemic comparisons and a lot of that is being driven by this kind of confluence of asp increase brad thomas keybanc capital markets analyst got you very helpful thanks corie corie barry chief executive officer yeah thanks operator scot ciccarelli from truist security has our next question please go ahead scot ciccarelli truist securities analyst good morning guys scott ciccarelli so corie and matt we ve heard that several other retailers that had a pretty tough march and april have indicated that sales have started to improve in may but your comments on 2q would suggest you really haven t seen that so i guess my question is you know why do you think your business hasn t necessarily seen the kind of recovery we have seen in some other retail verticals and related to that would your cadence comments be any different if we are looking at stock trends thanks corie barry chief executive officer i ll start and then matt can clean up anything that i miss but you have to also look back to last year and matt alluded to this we have that really high sustained growth into may like we posted the 37 comp in q1 and then that sustained 30s into may so we were unlike some others we are lapping very sustained high growth both stimulus related stay at home related from last year which is a different cadence i also think you have heard other retailers comment on the weather and some of the and that s not going to impact our business nearly as much as others so i think from a like when we you almost have to go back to kind of a three year look at the business it s relatively consistent and actually pretty strong as we are heading into q2 on that three year stack scot ciccarelli truist securities analyst got it thank you corie barry chief executive officer yup operator thank you moving now to scott mushkin of r5 capital please go ahead scott mushkin r5 capital analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question so i want to get back to profitability a little bit and the question is basically if and i know it s a big if sales or revenues would fall back to where they were pre pandemic do you guys believe the business even with that is structurally more profitable and if so you know why would you believe that thanks matt bilunas chief financial officer yeah i think we believe that it is structurally more profitable than it was pre pandemic as you think about some of the actions and work we have done over the last two years to adjust our model with the very heavy shift to digital sales almost doubling from pre pandemic we have taken appropriate action to understand the cost structures whether they are to support digital or in our stores or just to support a different type of customer fulfillment need we have taken the right actions over that period of time to adjust our model our cost model to understand to account for the changing sales and margin structure our gross margin structure so we fundamentally do believe that that s in how we actually decide to fulfill product to customers that s on how many associates we have in our stores it s a number of things that we have thoughtfully looked at over the last couple of years to change the structure of cost between gross margin rate and sg a so we do believe that fundamentally in q1 we were up 80 basis points compared to q1 pre pandemic and that is to account for even though we do have investments like totaltech at 100 basis points in q1 and have a doubling of the e com business which is a higher parcel cost we are still getting sg a leverage considerably better over in q1 to offset some of those gross margin investments that we are actually making in our business so we fundamentally do believe that the structure of our business is fundamentally more profitable and that s also underlying in our commitment our goal is to get to the fy 20 goals of 6 3 to 6 8 scott mushkin r5 capital analyst thanks that was great matt i appreciate it operator we will move next to peter keith of piper sandler please go ahead peter keith piper sandler analyst hey thank you good morning you know one area i was hoping you could address was the best buy ads initiative my understanding was that should be accretive to gross margin and obviously there seems to be some change or evolution of the ad spending backdrop so maybe address any changes to the outlook of that program and separately just sticking on gross margin matt should that 100 basis points of totaltech pressure that you saw in q1 should that continue with q2 matt bilunas chief financial officer sure i will start with the totaltech pressure as you look toward the back half of the year we started to lap the launch of totaltech so we expect the q2 drivers to be similar to q1 that would include totaltech pressure of around 100 basis points but as you look to q3 and q4 we begin to lap it we launched totaltech in october of last year so we don t lap until the end of this q3 so there is still a little pressure from totaltech in q3 then by q4 the pressure on a year over year basis essentially goes down to zero if you will because we have lapped the launch of it so that s how the cadence of totaltech pressure goes corie barry chief executive officer and just a quick reminder on the ads business obviously this is us selling advertising to brands that want to reach our customers both on our own channels and then on some external sites i think what s important here is that our leadership in ce retail remains very very valuable high customer traffic and engagement and it s that first party data that we have which can allow our advertisers to reach really unique audiences because we see people all along their purchase journey which means you can target them at various points in the purchase journey we haven t shared specific financial details but we did see growth in the ads business in q1 not material enough to highlight for the quarter but even entering the year we knew this would be a favorable contributor to the gross profit rate but a little bit more weighted toward the second half of the year as this ramp continues and then obviously this is something that provides that ongoing growth and incremental profitability over time that gives us confidence in those longer term targets peter keith piper sandler analyst ok thank you very much corie barry chief executive officer thank you peter and with that i want to thank you all for joining us today i hope that many of our investors who are listening today will be able to join us at our annual shareholder meeting which will be held virtually on june 9th thanks everyone and have a great day duration 59 minutes call

its review of verrica s nda and product label there were no open questions on the nda review and the vp 102 label was ready to be communicated however verrica has been informed that internal fda policy is preventing the agency from communicating the label and approving the nda when a cmo has an unresolved classification status or is placed on oai status based on the successful pai of vp 102 at sterling and our understanding that the division was ready to communicate our label we believe our nda meets the statutory standards for approval and that any issues at sterling do not impact the manufacturing quality efficacy or safety of vp 102 commented ted white verrica s president and chief executive officer however we recognize that the dermatology division s hands may be tied due to the reinspection issues at sterling and thank them for their efforts working with us to date in addition mr white noted that vp 102 is a non sterile topical dermatology product that is not systemically absorbed it is completely solvent based and has been demonstrated to have bactericidal and viricidal properties by comparison the observations cited at sterling which led to its oai classification status were predominantly related to its distinct sterile operations where higher risk sterile ophthalmic products are manufactured by sterling for among other distributors the u s government for additional quality control and oversight at sterling verrica proactively and responsibly maintains a person in the plant policy which requires qualified verrica personnel be present at sterling whenever vp 102 is manufactured to ensure verrica s product is in strict compliance with the validated process and cgmp in addition verrica independently tests the drug product manufactured at sterling on two separate occasions at alcami laboratories alcami after manufacturing at sterling has been completed first the bulk solution is tested by alcami after it is packaged into ampules then it is tested again by alcami after the ampules are assembled into finished vp 102 applicators the fda previously issued a crl for verrica s nda for vp 102 on september 16 2021 citing in part a deficiency related to the agency s general inspection of sterling likewise not specifically related to the manufacturing of vp 102 following the crl the fda classified sterling as vai the establishment inspection report eir issued on november 17 2021 in connection with the vai specifically stated that i fda would not take or recommend regulatory or enforcement action against sterling ii the vai classification would not directly negatively impact fda s assessment of any pending marketing application referencing sterling and iii approval of an application may depend on a pai based on the vai classification of sterling and the statements contained in the eir verrica was led to believe that any concerns at sterling had been resolved to fda s satisfaction and as specifically required in the crl for approval of its nda accordingly verrica resubmitted its nda on november 24 2021 which was accepted the nda submission was based on positive results from two identical phase 3 randomized double blind multicenter clinical trials camp 1 and camp 2 that evaluated the safety and efficacy of vp 102 compared to placebo in a combined 500 subjects two years of age and older diagnosed with molluscum in both trials a clinically and statistically significant number of patients treated with vp 102 met the primary endpoint of complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at the end of the trial vp 102 was well tolerated in both trials treating nearly 8 000 lesions with bulk solution manufactured at sterling with no serious adverse events reported and a dropout rate of less than two percent mr white stated that verrica is extremely disappointed in the agency s issuance of the crl under the totality of these circumstances however as verrica weighs all its options to bring the first fda approved treatment for molluscum one of the largest unmet needs in dermatology to the market as soon as possible it will continue to work collaboratively with the agency verrica currently intends to file a type a meeting request by the end of this week in the meantime verrica is working collaboratively with sterling and its regulatory and quality consultants to help sterling present multiple options to the agency to allow sterling to expeditiously satisfy the majority of the deficiencies resulting in its oai classification and which are the basis for the crl concurrently verrica is engaging an additional cmo to serve as an alternative supplier of vp 102 s bulk solution pbm capital has expressed its continued support of the company and based on these discussions verrica is confident that it will have access to adequate capital to fund operations through the potential approval of vp 102 for molluscum about vp 102 verrica s lead product candidate vp 102 is a proprietary drug device combination product that contains a gmp controlled formulation of cantharidin 0 7 w v delivered via a single use applicator that allows for precise topical dosing and

people in the united states primarily children if approved vp 102 will be marketed in the united states under the conditionally accepted brand name ycanth in addition verrica has successfully completed a phase 2 study of vp 102 for the treatment of common warts and a phase 2 study of vp 102 for the treatment of external genital warts about molluscum contagiosum molluscum there are

cnn wcco wftv by jen christensen cnn more baby formula is expected on store shelves as soon as this weekend through a variety of government efforts on wednesday 60 tons of formula landed at dulles international airport in washington from ramstein air base in germany the second shipment from europe as part of the biden administration s operation fly formula that effort was started to address the nationwide shortage that was exacerbated by the closure of formula maker abbott nutrition s plant in february after several inspections by the us food and drug administration found insanitary conditions chris calamari who leads abbott s nutrition division apologized for his company s role in the shortage wednesday at a hearing before the house energy and commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigation on behalf of everyone at abbott i want to express our extraordinary disappointment about the shortage we are deeply deeply sorry calamari said abbott said tuesday that it plans to restart work at its sturgis michigan plant on june 4 with the first batches of new formula expected to be available to consumers on or around june 20 when the plant is up and running it will be able to increase capacity by 40 according to calamari on wednesday calamari outlined abbott s additional plans to boost supply by bringing in more formula on nearly 50 flights a week to 12 airports across the country abbott has also converted some of its manufacturing facilities to make formula and is working with us department of agriculture wic agencies to make sure program participants get formula for free calamari said by the end of june we expect we will be supplying more formula to americans than we were in january before the recall he said more formula from companies made overseas is scheduled to arrive in the coming days according to us health and human services secretary xavier becerra first lady jill biden and us surgeon general dr vivek murthy were on hand to greet wednesday s shipment i ve been heartbroken to hear the stories of parents searching for formula as a mom and a nana it s impossible to hear stories of children suffering and not imagine your own children in the same position biden said there is more to do we know that joe knows that the latest shipment contains hypoallergenic nestle gerber good start extensive ha formula the company said the formula will head to a nestle distribution center in pennsylvania and will immediately be sent to hospitals wic families and retailers nationwide for the past few months nestle said it has stepped up production and accelerated how it gets product to market and to hospitals gerber vice president of technical production scott fitz testified at wednesday s hearing that his company is also working tirelessly to help parents and caregivers get the formula that they need our factories run 24 7 to produce formula as efficiently as possible while maintaining our high safety standards we are prioritizing the manufacture of products that are most in demand as well as specialty formulas that have been in critically short supply he said robert cleveland a senior vice president at the other big formula maker in the us mead johnson nutrition a reckitt subsidiary that makes enfamil and nutramigen said that his company has increased the supply of infant formula by more than 30 compared with this time last year the company also has trucks ready to load as soon as the products are complete and has reduced the types of products it makes to get the formula out faster we re taking all of these measures while keeping a close eye on quality and safety to ensure that we always meet the near pharmaceutical grade safety requirements that apply to infant formula production we will take no shortcuts cleveland said the usda announced wednesday that it will temporarily cover the costs of alternative brands sizes and forms of formula for low income families in states that have wic contracts with manufacturers reckitt or gerber abbott is covering the cost difference in other states state agencies contract with one of the three main makers of baby formula to provide product to infants in the special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children also known as wic typically people who use wic benefits can buy only the brand of formula made by the company that the state has contracted with for that purpose there are also restrictions on the sizes they can buy about half of us states and territories have contracts with abbott according to the usda but because the company had to recall some of its products it has created an increased demand for other brands and families are having a hard time finding those too just clarifying that the non abbott states can be adding new brands as well is a big piece which is a position that neither the companies nor usda had been in a place to say before said brian dittmeier senior director of public policy with the nonprofit national wic association that really makes a lot more options for those states he said those states aren t seeing the greatest need necessarily but it is definitely an area that we need more support wic is the largest purchaser of formula in the us with more than half going to infants in the program the access to baby formula act which biden signed saturday gives the government this ability to be more flexible we encourage states and their formula manufacturers to work together to maximize access to infant formula for wic participants and usda will provide the funding to make that possible agriculture secretary tom vilsack said in a news release wednesday the fda said tuesday that it is doing everything in our power to make sure there is enough baby formula for parents and caregivers who need it including discussions with other manufacturers and suppliers about bringing other formulas to the us the agency is allowing kendal nutricare a company based in the uk to import some of its baby formula to the us and 2 million cans will be on us store shelves starting in june the government is working with the company to fast track its efforts to immediately send more than 40 000 cans that are now in stock going forward though the country will need to take a closer look at why one plant can shut down and cause such shortages dittmeier said the abbott plant in michigan for example is the only one of its facilities that produces specialty formulas like the ones given to infants who are allergic to milk how do we spread this out a bit more dittmeier asked frankly a national security concern here has been exposed this is is an essential product for the country he said this has exposed a weakness in our essential supply line and that needs to be remedied quickly the cnn

enforcement partners in holding criminals accountable who try to enrich themselves by undermining the forces of supply and demand the fcpa case according to the information filed in the southern district of new york statements made in court as well as other publicly filed documents in this case glencore acting through its employees and agents engaged in a conspiracy for over a decade to pay more than 100 million to third party intermediaries while intending that a significant portion of these payments would be used to pay bribes to officials in several countries including nigeria cameroon ivory coast equatorial guinea brazil venezuela and the democratic republic of the congo drc between approximately 2007 and 2018 glencore and its subsidiaries caused approximately 79 6 million in payments to be made to intermediary companies in order to secure improper advantages to obtain and retain business with state owned and state controlled entities in west africa including nigeria cameroon ivory coast and equatorial guinea glencore concealed the bribe payments by entering into sham consulting agreements paying inflated invoices and using intermediary companies to make corrupt payments to foreign officials for example in nigeria glencore and glencore s u k subsidiaries entered into multiple agreements to purchase crude oil and refined petroleum products from nigeria s state owned and state controlled oil company glencore and its subsidiaries engaged two intermediaries to pursue business opportunities and other improper business advantages including the award of crude oil contracts while knowing that the intermediaries would make bribe payments to nigerian government officials to obtain such business in nigeria alone glencore and its subsidiaries paid more than 52 million to the intermediaries intending that those funds be used at least in part to pay bribes to nigerian officials in the drc glencore admitted that it conspired to corruptly offer and pay approximately 27 5 million to third parties while intending for a portion of the payments to be used as bribes to drc officials in order to secure improper business advantages glencore also admitted to bribery of officials in brazil and venezuela in brazil the company caused approximately 147 202 to be used at least in part as corrupt payments for brazilian officials in venezuela glencore admitted to conspiring to secure improper business advantages by paying over 1 2 million to an intermediary company that made corrupt payments for the benefit of a venezuelan official in july 2021 a former senior trader in charge of glencore s west africa desk for the crude oil business pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the fcpa and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering under the terms of the plea agreement which remains subject to court approval glencore pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the fcpa agreed to a criminal fine of 428 521 173 and acknowledged criminal forfeiture liability in the amount of 272 185 792 glencore also had charges brought against it by the u k s serious fraud office sfo and reached separate parallel resolutions with the brazilian ministério público federal mpf and the commodity futures trading commission cftc under the terms of the plea agreement the department has agreed to credit the company over 256 million in payments that it makes to the cftc to the court in the u k as well as to authorities in switzerland in the event that the company reaches a resolution with swiss authorities within one year the department reached its agreement with glencore based on a number of factors including the nature seriousness and pervasiveness of the offense conduct which spanned over a 10 year period in numerous countries and involved high level employees and agents of the company the company s failure to voluntarily and timely disclose the conduct to the department the state of glencore s compliance program and the progress of its remediation the company s resolutions with other domestic and foreign authorities and the company s continued cooperation with the department s ongoing investigation glencore did not receive full credit for cooperation and remediation because it did not at all times demonstrate a commitment to full cooperation it was delayed in producing relevant evidence and it did not timely and appropriately remediate with respect to disciplining certain employees involved in the misconduct although glencore has taken remedial measures certain of the compliance enhancements are new and have not been fully implemented or tested to demonstrate that they would prevent and detect similar misconduct in the future necessitating the imposition of an independent compliance monitor for a term of three years the commodity price manipulation case according to court documents filed in the district of connecticut glencore ltd operated a global commodity trading business which included trading in fuel oil between approximately january 2011 and august 2019 glencore ltd employees including those who worked at chemoil corporation which was majority owned by glencore ltd s parent company and then fully acquired in 2014 conspired to manipulate two benchmark price assessments published by s p global platts platts for fuel oil products specifically intermediate fuel oil 380 cst at the port of los angeles los angeles 380 cst bunker fuel and rmg 380 fuel oil at the port of houston u s gulf coast high sulfur fuel oil the port of los angeles is the busiest shipping port in the u s by container volume the port of houston is the largest u s port on the gulf coast and the busiest port in the u s by foreign waterborne tonnage as part of the conspiracy glencore ltd employees sought to unlawfully enrich themselves and glencore ltd itself by increasing profits and reducing costs on contracts to buy and sell physical fuel oil as well as certain derivative positions that glencore ltd held the price terms of the physical contracts and derivative positions were set by reference to daily benchmark price assessments published by platts either los angeles 380 cst bunker fuel or u s gulf coast high sulfur fuel oil on a certain day or days plus or minus a fixed premium on these pricing days glencore ltd employees submitted orders to buy and sell bids and offers to platts during the daily trading window for the platts price assessments with the intent to artificially push the price assessment up or down for example if glencore ltd had a contract to buy fuel oil glencore ltd employees submitted offers during the platts window for the express purpose of pushing down the price assessment and hence the price of the fuel oil that glencore ltd purchased the bids and offers were not submitted to platts for any legitimate economic reason by glencore ltd employees but rather for the purpose of artificially affecting the relevant platts price assessment so that the benchmark price and hence the price of fuel oil that glencore ltd bought from and sold to another party did not reflect legitimate forces of supply and demand according to court documents between approximately september 2012 and august 2016 glencore ltd employees conspired to manipulate the price of fuel oil bought from and sold to a particular counterparty company a through private bilateral contracts by manipulating the platts price assessment for los angeles 380 cst bunker fuel between approximately january 2014 and february 2016 glencore ltd employees also undertook a joint venture with company a which involved buying fuel oil from company a at prices artificially depressed by glencore ltd s manipulation of the platts los angeles 380 cst bunker fuel benchmark finally between approximately january 2011 and august 2019 glencore ltd employees conspired to manipulate the price of fuel oil bought and sold through private bilateral contracts as well as derivative positions by manipulating the platts price assessment for u s gulf coast high sulfur fuel oil a former glencore ltd senior fuel oil trader emilio jose heredia collado of lafayette california pled guilty in march 2021 to one count of conspiracy to engage in commodities price manipulation in connection with his trading activity related to the platts los angeles 380 cst bunker fuel price assessment heredia s sentencing is scheduled for june 17 2022 glencore ltd pleaded guilty pursuant to a plea agreement to one count of conspiracy to engage in commodity price manipulation under the terms of glencore ltd s plea agreement regarding the commodity price manipulation conspiracy which remains subject to court approval glencore ltd will pay a criminal fine of 341 221 682 and criminal forfeiture of 144 417 203 under the terms of the plea agreement the department will credit over 242 million in payments that the company makes to the cftc glencore ltd also agreed to among other things continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the underlying misconduct to modify its compliance program where necessary and appropriate and to retain an independent compliance monitor for a period of three years a number of relevant considerations contributed to the department s plea agreement with glencore ltd including the nature and seriousness of the offense glencore ltd s failure to fully and voluntarily self disclose the offense conduct to the department glencore ltd s cooperation with the department s investigation and the state of glencore ltd s compliance program and the progress of its remediation a sentencing control date was scheduled in the southern district of new york on october 3 2022

summer approaches and it s traditionally a time when a marylander s fancy turns to a dozen number one jimmies steamed the bad news is that chesapeake bay blue crabs are running especially scarce this year a combination of a cool spring that reduces crab movement and thus prevents watermen from catching them following a bad year for reproduction the official word on this came recently from the maryland department of natural resources the state agency announced that overall crab stocks are at their lowest ever recorded by the winter dredge survey which was started in 1990 but that surely proved no surprise to consumers fully aware of the current high prices for crabs or perhaps recall that last year s juvenile crab survey also produced historic lows this spring s crabs are simply last year s modest population of young crabs grown up now here s the good news do not despair crabs and crab meat remain available for a price local chefs and seafood dealers don t always like to mention it to their customers but the chesapeake bay is not their only source right now states along the gulf of mexico including louisiana are producing a steady inventory so one can eat guilt free assuming you can afford it obviously the local supply will improve over the summer but don t expect a bonanza of affordable crabs or crabmeat at our doorstep is there something that can be done to improve the outlook in the future absolutely but let s start by acknowledging that the issue can be complicated maryland s crab population varies greatly from year to year in the best of times water currents temperatures and tides near the mouth of the chesapeake bay at the crucial larval stage of the life cycle can have a major impact on juvenile recruitment in any given year layer on top of that the level of fishing pressure allowed by maryland and virginia and the state of the crab habitat where water quality and certain environmental hazards can make a big difference too some threats are straightforward like the rise of invasive catfish that gobble up young crabs others are much larger like the growing dead zones of oxygen deprived water and the broad loss of submerged aquatic vegetation which provides cover for young crabs from predators like those catfish so here s where joe and jane registered maryland voter can come in first we must hold the maryland dnr accountable the state needs to double down on conservation efforts that spare female crabs overfishing may not be the greatest concern here watermen harvest around one in four of the target population but it is the one most readily controlled bay states should err on the side of caution secondly and perhaps more importantly the states in the chesapeake region and we re particularly looking at you pennsylvania need to take greater action to meet promised water quality goals principally to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loadings maryland and virginia ought to set the example here yet there is concern that neither will make promised pollution reduction goals under the chesapeake clean water blueprint by 2025 jane and joe should be asking all those folks running for state and local office this year what they plan to do about water quality for maryland that includes holding the agricultural community accountable and taking greater steps to control stormwater runoff two pollution sources where the state is underachieving we can t let them get away with the usual deflections like i support a healthier chesapeake bay but then refuse to provide specifics or simply blame baltimore s underperforming sewage infrastructure and certainly not we re already making progress given so much evidence to the contrary including the drop in blue crabs maryland has shown a willingness to take action in the past the u s department of commerce declared the blue crab fishery a disaster in 2008 but it bounced back to some extent prevent overfishing and clean up the water that s the tried and true recipe we need to follow to keep one of maryland s most prized species on the menu for future generations to enjoy baltimore sun editorial writers offer opinions and analysis on news and issues relevant to readers they operate separately from the newsroom

brainerd while taxpayers across crow wing county continue to digest an average 35 spike in residential and seasonal property values the state says the county didn t go high enough in some cases land services director gary griffin told the county board tuesday may 24 an evaluation of the county s 2022 property assessments showed the value of rural vacant land fell about 5 short of the state s required 90 105 median sales ratio this ratio measures the relationship between assessed values and the actual sales price or how close assessments are to market value on an overall basis according to the minnesota department of revenue just a point to i guess help refresh or remind you guys that this is a state prescribed process griffin said i ve been doing this for 12 years for crow wing never had a state board order and this is the closest we ever came in the case of a county out of compliance with the state s acceptable range the state board of equalization issues a corrective order to raise or lower property values accordingly griffin said although crow wing s rural vacant land values sat at an 85 ratio the board will not issue a correction instead the revenue department offered a strong recommendation for the county to increase its values appropriately for 2023 griffin said the report comes despite an average 31 32 increase in the value of rural vacant land in crow wing rural vacant land per state law consists of parcels of property or portions thereof that are unplatted real estate rural in character and not used for agricultural purposes including land used for growing trees for timber lumber and wood and wood products that is not improved with a structure advertisement griffin said the land services department counted more than 2 000 individual contacts with concerned residents since it mailed property valuations in march meetings of local boards of appeal and equalization which provide the opportunity to appeal values or tax classifications saw unusually high attendance this spring and the next step for those still dissatisfied the county board of appeal and equalization meeting set for next month will require six days to include everyone wishing to appear on the agenda this is typically accomplished in one day griffin noted much of this frustration is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between property values and property taxes many of those with concerns believed if their property value rose by 50 for example their taxes would increase at the same rate he said what residents pay in property taxes is determined by many factors most importantly how much money local governments decide to collect as part of their property tax levies to cover their spending the recent valuation notices apply to the 2023 tax year for which county commissioners and other jurisdictions will not set levy amounts until december values on the other hand are based on the real estate market and sales of nearby similar properties more crow wing county coverage the news of the revenue department s warning appeared to strike a nerve with commissioners who also reported being inundated by calls from constituents frustrated by the increases we re already at an average of 35 and the state thinks they need more than that and it s their process said commissioner steve barrows it s their process we have to adhere to that s unacceptable and i know they were trying to do something at the legislature and they can t get their job done that s on them that s not on us and it penalizes every one of our taxpayers in crow wing county and that is unacceptable well i don t think there s any of us that disagree with you added commissioner rosemary franzen barrows criticism of the legislature comes as the state body missed a late sunday deadline before the end of the session meaning a number of major spending bills including a wide ranging proposal to provide tax relief to minnesotans were not accomplished earlier this month commissioners voted unanimously to send a letter to lakes area legislators asking them to support changes to state law that would expand the impact of the homestead market value exclusion and make more people eligible for the homestead credit refund commissioner paul koering asked what would happen if crow wing county refused to comply with an order from the state advertisement what s the penalty if we re not the good child and we don t do our don t do what they tell us to do koering asked griffin said the state would take valuation into its own hands increasing or decreasing values as it sees fit county administrator tim houle added laws requiring local governments to comply with various state mandates often carry the threat of a loss of state aid if those mandates are ignored so they ve got a pretty good hook in ya houle said how property valuation works and what that means for taxes county officials last month sought to clarify the relationship between valuation and taxes while also presenting statistics to show crow wing county is not alone in its steep value increases even though it appears to be experiencing some of the biggest climbs in the state residential and seasonal recreational property values in crow wing rose at an average rate of 35 just topping cass at 31 and aitkin at 29 based on data griffin said was gathered from other county assessor s offices the estimated market value as a whole in crow wing including all types of properties was 17 1 billion more than 66 higher than the value in 2016 the rise in values is a direct reflection of the housing market which indicates people are willing to pay higher prices for a tight inventory of housing stock and real estate changed hands last year in crow wing county at levels not seen since before the great recession griffin said sales of comparable properties are the basis of the property valuation process which is conducted by county government officials but is driven by rules set by the state legislature and there s a lag built into the system property values as of january 2022 are based on sales between october 2020 and september 2021 a frequent metaphor employed by houle and other county officials in explaining the relationship between values and taxes is to envision the property tax levy as a pie each county taxpayer is responsible for a slice of the pie and the size of that slice is determined by one s property classification and value relative to others no matter what happens to values overall however the size of the pie itself does not change once the county board sets the dollar amount of its final levy the same pie metaphor applies to school districts cities townships and other special taxing districts the levies for which combine to impact one s overall tax bill advertisement five main reasons exist for why a property owner might see a higher tax bill one year to the next a land services news release explained these include increases in government spending a property s market value decreasing less than other properties or increasing more than other properties a change in property classification or changes to state rules this happened in 2011 for instance

verrica pharmaceuticals verrica has been advised that pai pre approval inspection was conducted at sterling and is not aware of any reported observations related to the pai of vp 102 operations review division had advised verrica that the review of nda was completed and label was ready to be communicated except for sterling s classification status verrica has been notified that sterling is on oai official action indicated status west chester pa may 24 2022 globe newswire verrica pharmaceuticals inc verrica nasdaq vrca a dermatology therapeutics company developing medications for skin diseases requiring medical interventions today announced that the u s food and drug administration fda has issued a complete response letter crl regarding its new drug application nda for vp 102 for the treatment of molluscum contagiosum molluscum the only deficiency listed in the crl was related to the deficiencies identified at a general reinspection of sterling pharmaceuticals services llc sterling the contract manufacturing organization cmo that manufactures verrica s bulk solution drug product sterling advised verrica on may 20 2022 that it received notice that it is on oai status sterling s oai classification resulted from a week long reinspection of the cmo conducted by fda in february 2022 the reinspection was conducted approximately 90 days after sterling was originally classified by the agency as vai voluntary action indicated on november 17 2021 verrica understood that the vai classification did not indicate that a reinspection was required the crl did not identify any other deficiencies moreover none of the issues identified by fda during the reinspection were specific to the manufacturing of vp 102 additionally verrica was informed by the division that it had completed its review of verrica s nda and product label there were no open questions on the nda review and the vp 102 label was ready to be communicated however verrica has been informed that internal fda policy is preventing the agency from communicating the label and approving the nda when a cmo has an unresolved classification status or is placed on oai status based on the successful pai of vp 102 at sterling and our understanding that the division was ready to communicate our label we believe our nda meets the statutory standards for approval and that any issues at sterling do not impact the manufacturing quality efficacy or safety of vp 102 commented ted white verrica s president and chief executive officer however we recognize that the dermatology division s hands may be tied due to the reinspection issues at sterling and thank them for their efforts working with us to date in addition mr white noted that vp 102 is a non sterile topical dermatology product that is not systemically absorbed it is completely solvent based and has been demonstrated to have bactericidal and viricidal properties by comparison the observations cited at sterling which led to its oai classification status were predominantly related to its distinct sterile operations where higher risk sterile ophthalmic products are manufactured by sterling for among other distributors the u s government story continues for additional quality control and oversight at sterling verrica proactively and responsibly maintains a person in the plant policy which requires qualified verrica personnel be present at sterling whenever vp 102 is manufactured to ensure verrica s product is in strict compliance with the validated process and cgmp in addition verrica independently tests the drug product manufactured at sterling on two separate occasions at alcami laboratories alcami after manufacturing at sterling has been completed first the bulk solution is tested by alcami after it is packaged into ampules then it is tested again by alcami after the ampules are assembled into finished vp 102 applicators the fda previously issued a crl for verrica s nda for vp 102 on september 16 2021 citing in part a deficiency related to the agency s general inspection of sterling likewise not specifically related to the manufacturing of vp 102 following the crl the fda classified sterling as vai the establishment inspection report eir issued on november 17 2021 in connection with the vai specifically stated that i fda would not take or recommend regulatory or enforcement action against sterling ii the vai classification would not directly negatively impact fda s assessment of any pending marketing application referencing sterling and iii approval of an application may depend on a pai based on the vai classification of sterling and the statements contained in the eir verrica was led to believe that any concerns at sterling had been resolved to fda s satisfaction and as specifically required in the crl for approval of its nda accordingly verrica resubmitted its nda on november 24 2021 which was accepted the nda submission was based on positive results from two identical phase 3 randomized double blind multicenter clinical trials camp 1 and camp 2 that evaluated the safety and efficacy of vp 102 compared to placebo in a combined 500 subjects two years of age and older diagnosed with molluscum in both trials a clinically and statistically significant number of patients treated with vp 102 met the primary endpoint of complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at the end of the trial vp 102 was well tolerated in both trials treating nearly 8 000 lesions with bulk solution manufactured at sterling with no serious adverse events reported and a dropout rate of less than two percent mr white stated that verrica is extremely disappointed in the agency s issuance of the crl under the totality of these circumstances however as verrica weighs all its options to bring the first fda approved treatment for molluscum one of the largest unmet needs in dermatology to the market as soon as possible it will continue to work collaboratively with the agency verrica currently intends to file a type a meeting request by the end of this week in the meantime verrica is working collaboratively with sterling and its regulatory and quality consultants to help sterling present multiple options to the agency to allow sterling to expeditiously satisfy the majority of the deficiencies resulting in its oai classification and which are the basis for the crl concurrently verrica is engaging an additional cmo to serve as an alternative supplier of vp 102 s bulk solution pbm capital has expressed its continued support of the company and based on these discussions verrica is confident that it will have access to adequate capital to fund operations through the potential approval of vp 102 for molluscum about vp 102 verrica s lead

america has been shaken once again by mass shootings on may 14 a gunman killed 10 people in a supermarket in buffalo on tuesday at least 19 children and two adults were killed in uvalde texas it was the deadliest shooting at an elementary school since the 2012 massacre at sandy hook elementary this essay originally ran in 2017 after a shooter killed 26 people in a texas church but the issue is still tragically relevant and will remain so until america tightens its gun safety policies america has more guns than any other country the first step is to understand the scale of the challenge america faces the u s has more than 300 million guns roughly one for every citizen and stands out as well for its gun death rates at the other extreme japan has less than one gun per 100 people and

automobiles gun enthusiasts often protest cars kill about as many people as guns and we don t ban them no but automobiles are actually a model for the public health approach i m suggesting we don t ban cars but we work hard to regulate them and limit access to them so as to reduce the death toll they cause this has been spectacularly successful reducing the death rate per 100 million miles

2020 source national highway traffic safety administration note data for 2021 is preliminary the liberal approach is ineffective use a public health approach instead frankly liberal opposition to guns has often been ineffective and sometimes counterproductive the 10 year ban on assault weapons accomplished little partly because definitions were about cosmetic features like bayonet mounts and partly because even before the ban such guns were used in only 2 percent of crimes the left sometimes focuses on gun control which scares off gun owners and leads to more gun sales a better framing is gun safety or reducing gun violence and using auto safety as a model constant efforts to make the products safer and to limit access by people who are most likely to misuse them what would a public health approach look like for guns if it were modeled after cars it would include background checks 22 percent of guns are obtained without one protection orders keep men who are subject to domestic violence protection orders from having guns ban under 21s a ban on people under 21 purchasing firearms this is already the case in many states safe storage these include trigger locks as well as guns and ammunition stored separately especially when children are in the house straw purchases tighter enforcement of laws on straw purchases of weapons and some limits on how many guns can be purchased in a month ammunition checks experimentation with a one time background check for anybody buying ammunition end immunity end immunity for firearm companies that s a subsidy to a particular industry ban bump stocks a ban on bump stocks of the kind used in las vegas to mimic automatic weapon fire research smart guns smart guns fire only after a fingerprint or pin is entered or if used near a particular bracelet if someone steals my iphone it s useless and the same should be true of guns gun manufacturers made child proof guns back in the 19th century before dropping them and it s time to advance that technology today some combination of smart guns and safe storage would also reduce the number of firearms stolen in the u s each year now about 200 000 and available to criminals we also need to figure out whether gun buybacks often conducted by police departments are cost effective and help reduce violence and we can experiment more with anti gang initiatives such as cure violence that have a good record in reducing shootings fewer guns fewer deaths it is true that guns are occasionally used to stop violence but contrary to what the national rifle association suggests this is

life critics will say that the kind of measures i cite wouldn t prevent many shootings the 2017 shooting in las vegas for example might not have been prevented by any of the suggestions i make that s true and there s no magic wand available yet remember that although it is mass shootings that get our attention they are not the main cause of loss of life much more typical is a friend who shoots another a husband who kills his wife or most common of all a man who kills himself skeptics will say that if people want to kill themselves there s nothing we can do in fact it turns out that if you make suicide a bit more difficult suicide rates drop here are the figures showing that mass shootings are a modest share of the total and the same is true of self defense despite what the n r a might

gets access to them a car or gun is usually safe in the hands of a 45 year old woman with no criminal record but may be dangerous when used by a 19 year old felon with a history of alcohol offenses or domestic violence protection orders yet our laws have often focused more on weapons themselves such as the assault weapons ban rather than on access in many places there is more rigorous screening of people who want to adopt dogs than of people who want to purchase firearms in these two states the laws affected access and although there s some indication that other factors were also involved in connecticut and correlations don t prove causation the outcomes are worth pondering there is a shocking lack of research on guns there s simply a scandalous lack of research on gun violence largely because the n r a is extremely hostile to such research and congress rolls over when the centers for disease control and prevention did try to research gun violence congress responded by cutting its funding here is the american toll from four diseases and firearms over the years 1973 2012 and the number of national institutes of health research grants to explore each problem over that same time n

abuse of guns is better training as a 13 year old farm boy in oregon i attended a n r a gun safety class which came with a one year membership to the n r a making me an n r a alum who despises what that organization has become these classes can be very useful and audits found that more than 80 percent cover such matters as checking the gun to see if it s loaded keeping one s finger off the trigger until ready to fire and being certain of the target yet the audits also suggest that trainers are more likely to advocate for the n r a or for carrying guns than for say safe storage this is a missed opportunity for all classes should cover the risks of guns and alcohol the risks of abuse with suicide and domestic violence the need for safe storage and so on here s what researchers found

could actually buy a tank or an anti aircraft gun as well as fully automatic weapons and that area s now embroiled in a civil war but fortunately in america we have agreed to ban those kinds of weaponry so the question isn t whether we will restrict firearms but where to draw the line and precisely which ones to restrict check out these polling numbers as a basis for action on gun safety agree with the following households with no guns gun households 50 background checks for all gun buyers 93 96 preventing mentally ill from buying guns 89 89 nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes 88 85 barring gun purchases by people on no fly or watch lists 82 84 background checks for private sales and at gun shows 77 87 federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases 72 89 ban on modifications that make a semi automatic gun work like an automatic gun 67 79 a ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence 61 75 new gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns 57 71 congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence 56 81 creating a federal database to track gun sales 54 80 a ban on the sale of high capacity magazines 10 bullets 52 77 households with no guns gun households agree with the following 50 93 background checks for all gun buyers 96 89 preventing the mentally ill from buying guns 89 nationwide ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes 88 85 barring gun purchases by people on no fly or watch lists 82 84 background checks for private sales and at gun shows 77 87 federal mandatory waiting period on all gun purchases 72 89 a ban on modifications that make a semi automatic gun work like an automatic gun 67 79 a ban on the sale of guns to people convicted of violent crimes would reduce gun violence 61 75 new gun laws will not interfere with the right to own guns 57 71 congress is not doing enough to reduce gun violence 56 81 creating a federal database to track gun sales 54 80 a ban on the sale of high capacity ammunition magazines 10 bullets 52 77 sources pew research center survey conducted in march and april questions on mental illness no fly lists background checks for private sales and federal database quinnipiac university national poll conducted oct 5 10 all other questions a pew research center survey found only 44 percent of gun owners favored such a ban looking ahead i m optimistic that there can be progress at the state level and some of the necessary research funding will come from private foundations maybe some police departments will put in orders for smart guns to help create a market but the real impetus for change will come because the public favors it in particular note that 93 percent of people even in gun households favor universal background checks for gun purchases this is the blunt damning truth the latest shooting was 100 percent predictable after each such incident we mourn the deaths and sympathize with the victims but we do nothing fundamental to reduce our vulnerability some of you will protest that the immediate aftermath of a shooting is too soon to talk about guns or that it is disrespectful to the dead to use such a tragedy to score political points yet more americans have died from gun violence including suicides since 1970 about 1 4 million than in all the wars in american history going back to the revolutionary war about 1 3 million and it s not just gang members in a typical year more pre schoolers are shot dead in america about 75 than police officers are yes making america safer will be hard there are no perfect solutions the second amendment is one constraint and so is our polarized political system and the power of the gun lobby it s unclear how effective some of my suggestions will be and in any case this will be a long uncertain uphill process but automobiles are a reminder that we can chip away at a large problem through a public health approach just as auto safety improvements have left us far better off it seems plausible to some gun policy experts that a sensible politically feasible set of public health steps could over time reduce firearm deaths in america by one third or more than 10 000 lives saved each year so let s not just shed tears for the dead give somber speeches and lower flags let s get started and save lives
cpec bri beacon of hope and beasts of humanity in the era of imperalistic globalization and so called modern dollar democracy the doctrine of hybrid war has now replaced notions of cold war in the world the forces of resistance resolution restructuring and refinement i e china and its allies have been directly or indirectly confronting with western onslaught the tug of war between supporters of asian century and proponents of capitalism colonization have been battling out for dominance thus mega projects of the 21st century bri and cpec have been in the line of fire however chinese leadership has been following ancient philosophy of services to humanity through xi s shared properity and global development initiative and trying to reach out and rescue the suffering humanity from poverty unemployment disease discrimination and above all economic exploitation around the world sudden increase in terrorist attacks against chinese teachers engineers technicians and workers in various projects of the cpec in pakistan cleraly indicates that schemers of darkness and destruction do not want immense socio economic prosperity and greater regional connectivity of cpec with afghanistan and afterwards with central asian region car high velocity of balochistan liberation army bla terrorist activities and activation of the ttp has sparked elements of displeasure and dissatisfaction among main stakeholders of both the countries however political leadership personal intervention and consultation assured bulletproof security arrangements for all the chinese working in the country proved a face saving the negative role of bbc and voa about this terrorist operator highly qualified baloch woman have also started a hot debate in the country both global media outlets also operating in pakistan categorically correlated so called poor socio economic conditions chinese economic exploitation unpleasant role of the state apparatus political marginalization and social stigmas against balochistan and its people for this tragic incident the mastery of their spine doctrine methods blamed cpec and its ongoing projects for these terrorist attacks which have ultimatelly maligned pak china iron clad friendship all the so called investigative journalism facts finding mission and magic box of their false and fake propaganda have no credibility and accuracy their planted interviews with the deceased family sheri bano woman terrorist were intentionally titled and fabricated towards the state and china to counter their media onslaught prime minister shehbaz sharif and federal minister for planning ashan iqbal paid personal visits to balochistan and met with all the stakeholders and tried to ratify security lapses moreover western media especially cnn bbc fox tv and al jazeera international tv channels have been illustrating the political bedlam and economic meltdown of sri lanka maldives keyena and many other african countries as the ultimate result of so called debt trap of chinese bri unfortunately the land of prophet adam and tropical heaven of southeast asia sri lanka has become an easy victim to forces of imperialism and hegemony now sri lanka vividly reflects invisibility of the hybrid war of 5th generation in which some regional schemers and some world movers shakers have been physically instigating its common people and youth alike to stand against the incumbent government and its economic supporter china the rest is now a bitter reality the economic charisma of bri has been crusaded by forces of imperialism through the help of hybrid war nevertheless china said that it firmly supported sri lanka in defending its national sovereignty and offered to upgrade the belt and road projects as the two countries celebrated the 65th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties another strategically important country of southeast asia maldives had the same replications because of its growing socio economic ties and cooperation with china the western media outlets propagated fairy tales instead of actual facts and thus disseminated false and fake news items against china and its projects political instability was sponsored and social unrest was intrigued and ultimately the national economy had to face difficult times thus the same patterns of delusion disinformation and dissatisfaction were followed and circulated among the people against the incumbent government and of course china in which india the uk and us played a nauseating role now let us talk about the chinese bri role and engagement in the african continent critical analysis reveals that china has re shaped sub saharan africa through befitting trade investment and strategic diplomacy it has now developed strong economic ties with africa s largest economies and chinese firms dominate infrastructure construction projects accoridng to the latest official data january 2022 nearly one third of infrastructure projects in africa were built by chinese companies in addition china is in many areas replacing the united states and europe as trade partners with africa as usual some western so called political commentators and pseudo intellectuals have observed china s growing economic footprint in africa especially its bri with skepticism and concern they argue that chinese investment is a debt trap that will eventually lead to neo colonialism they feared that the so called chinese debt trap is likely to surface even in nigeria kenya or ethiopia but despite this criticism china s influence on the continent continues to rise it seems that critical infrastructure is key to africa s economic development and in the absence of loans or assistance from european or us governments countries like kenya have adopted a look east policy kenya has deliberately favored china rather than traditional american and european trade partners the export import bank of china provided two subsidized loans for the sgr railway china offered these loans far below market value both parties agreed to a five year grace period from 2015 to 2020 after this kenya would repay the loan in increments over fifteen years thus there is no chance of a so called economic meltdown in keyena because of the chinese bri to counter the chinese bri the european union has announced its own bri global gateway to help africa and other developing countries moreover the g 7 led by the us has also announced the build back better world b3w initiative to counter the chinese bri economic influence around the world thus economic war is now spreading like a jungle fire which has already burnt the souls of common people living around the globe deliberately the bbc voa and cnn have not been projecting the economic cost of the us and eu subsidized new war project in the black sea in the shape of russia and ukraine conflict it has devastating socio economic geopolitical and geostrategic consequences it has disturbed international food energy markets it has caused serious dents in global stocks and commodity exchanges foreign exchanges are tumbling and teetering energy markets are behaving like a dead man walking and world economic prospects and outlook has been compromised because of the us and the eu obsession of nato eastern encroachment the expected inclusion of finland and sweden in nato have serious spillover ramifications for even turkey and russia in the days to come egypt tunisia lebanon jordan sudan yemen syria and oman and many african countries and eastern european countries are facing the hardest economic recession and stagflation thus it is not a wise thing to blame mere china s bri for this unprecedented economic meltdown the chinese announcement to include pakistan indonesia turkey and malaysia in the brics would be a counter strategy to stimulate regional as well as world economy in the days to come

as prepared hello and good morning to you all i would like to begin with a round of thank yous to the faculty who guided us in our academic journeys and to the staff who worked tirelessly to keep us healthy and safe to the generations of student activists both past and present who ve fought for justice inclusion and progress at this university and of course to our families and friends whose love and support kept us afloat over the past four years as i understand it my task today is one of closure i am to celebrate to synthesize and to send off the past four years and all that they ve contained the first of these objectives is easy in your time here you ve successfully navigated the 12 week semester traversed eight whole dean s dates and conquered the independent work process you ve made cool art you ve told groundbreaking stories you ve advocated for change and explored systems from the microscopic to the human to the cosmic i feel very lucky to have crossed paths with you all and i can t wait to watch you guys save the world congratulations synthesis as it turns out is a harder goal the multi day extravaganza of graduation with all of its processions and ceremonies and funny hats positions this moment as a kind of temporal inflection point in the narrow space between past and future we are invited to stand together and to reckon with our collective experience of this place this shared reflection is valuable but it is also complicated in prescribing a particular emotional arc of celebration and nostalgia the rituals of commencement sometimes miss the complexity and diversity of student experiences at this university when halfway through sophomore spring the pandemic scattered us across time zones and continents princeton came unmoored from geography for some students it re formed at kitchen counters in childhood homes for others it took shape in quiet dorm rooms or at odd hours of the night abruptly everyone s university experience felt acutely visibly unique but even outside of pandemic times there is no such thing as a universal student experience this is partly a matter of differences in the social and academic spaces that each of us inhabits it is also a function of structural inequality since princeton and institutions like it often fall short when it comes to supporting students of marginalized backgrounds in other words i suspect that we all have complicated relationships to this place and to the idea of leaving it and i suspect that no two students feelings are entirely symmetric and so in lieu of synthesis i want to offer reassurance that there is no wrong way to feel about this process maybe for some of you today is a turning point a gateway to the real world a final celebration or maybe today is just a late spring tuesday morning in central new jersey spent among friends whatever this day means for you i hope that you get to hold space for your emotions and experiences as well as for those of others and i hope you find happiness within it this brings me to my final task the valediction or the act of farewell i ve never been especially good at dealing with transience as a child i had this theory that the more times you revisited a memory the further it would warp from its original shape to avoid this i kept meticulously detailed written records of everything from class field trips to my middle school graduation in hopes of keeping the past as fixed as possible as i got older i stopped doing this but even now i keep catching myself trying to memorize the grandeur of fine hall in late afternoon light or the mid air acrobatics of the bees near first college or the exact spatial layout of my thesis lab i think that my impulse to capture these things to freeze time is tied to my desire to build a clean and linear account of my time as an undergrad to somehow make sense of it taking stock of how you understand your relationship to princeton right now is important and worthwhile but memory is not a static representation of the past for most of us the past four years have been messy and complicated and formative our relationship to princeton and our experience thereof can and probably will change with time and distance we will re access re interpret and re synthesize these memories and that s okay dynamic and critical self reflection can and should be a big part of belonging to any institution as complicated as this one but this also means that today s act of farewell is not so much a send off of the past as it is the beginning of new interpretive process a farewell is a noun but it is also a directive fare as in to travel or to be well as in safely successfully and in good health if faring well is an active process then the act of valediction is less a closing of the past than a forward looking prayer tomorrow we will disperse along highways and jet streams in our new homes across countries and continents we will continue drifting forward together through time from our current vantage point the future towards which we travel is uncertain and honestly pretty bleak the earth is warming and the oceans rising the legal frameworks meant to protect marginalized communities are swaying under pressure globally autocracy is on the rise and the free press under threat at the same time activists journalists and artists are bravely working to dismantle oppressive systems while scientists and engineers combat public health crises and environmental challenges in other words there is space for hope for action and for change and so here is my valediction i wish you safe travels and gentle landings i wish you time for rest and time for joy i wish you the space for critical reflection complexity and change more than anything i wish you hope even and perhaps especially in the face of uncertainty i hope that wherever you end up you get to build communities founded on empathy and radical compassion i hope you find healthy and sustainable ways to advocate for progress and change and i hope things get better i hope that someday soon we all fare well thank you congratulations again class of 2022
the used car dealership chain delivered a strong earnings report what happened shares of america s car mart crmt 1 98 were soaring tuesday after the car dealership chain posted better than expected results in its fiscal fourth quarter earnings report as of 12 40 p m et the stock was up 22 9 while the broader market was down so what america s car mart owns 154 dealerships in the southern and central u s and focuses primarily on selling older used models for its fiscal q4 2022 which ended april 30 it posted record revenue of 352 million up 26 from the year ago period that easily beat analysts consensus estimate of 297 2 million the company also said that its interest revenue which has high margins increased by 39 to 42 million its top line growth was driven by a 24 increase in average selling price to 17 860 while unit volume fell by 1 adjusted earnings per share actually fell slightly as the company s cost of sales jumped 32 reflecting that it also paid more for its inventory for the quarter it booked earnings of 4 01 per share down from adjusted earnings of 4 54 per share in fiscal q4 2021 though that still beat estimates of 3 10 per share we are increasing market share while facing challenges stemming from ongoing supply and demand imbalances in the used car market inflation and declining consumer confidence said ceo jeff williams we expect to see additional productivity improvements as we leverage our investments and competitive strengths now what used car prices have remained elevated though prices have begun declining on a month over month basis the company should benefit from the year over year increase in used car prices for at least the next quarter or two higher interest rates could also be a boon helping the company collect more interest income but they could also cool off demand still after over a year in which new car production was impaired by supply chain issues and shutdowns leading to shortages and sky high used car prices there s a healthy backlog of demand in the vehicle market a normalizing environment wouldn t necessarily be a bad thing for dealers like america s car mart and the stock trades at a price to earnings ratio of less than 7 as such it looks like a good value if it can hold on to most of these profits
since the start of the year the s p 500 index is down 18 the nasdaq 100 has lost 27 and a bloomberg index of cryptocurrencies has plunged 48 that all amounts to a wealth shock that is set to drag on growth in the coming year jpmorgan economists led by michael feroli wrote in a note friday billionaires were the biggest winners of 2020 and 2021 now they re losing more than almost everyone else the bloomberg billionaires index a daily measure of the wealth of the world s 500 richest people has dropped 1 6 trillion since its peak in november leading the way are the americans on the index who have lost 797 billion since their peak perhaps the most humbled by it all is the world s richest person elon musk he s lost 139 1 billion or 41 of his wealth since november when his net worth briefly surpassed 340 billion amazon com inc founder jeff bezos the second richest person lost 82 7 billion or 39 of his peak wealth citing estimates from jpmorgan over the weekend bloomberg wrote that courtesy of a biden administration terrified of what soaring inflation will mean for the democrats in the midterms and a fed that is determine to do anything even crash the market and spark a recession to do joe biden s kill inflation bidding the us faces a new scary threat a plunge in wealth which jpm estimates at least 5 trillion and could reach 9 trillion by year end in short the world s richest nation is waking up to an unpleasant and unfamiliar sensation of course this is not news to regular readers who have known about this one unpleasant side effect of biden s phobia for higher prices we pointed out as much almost two weeks ago we do however disagree with jpmorgan that only 5 trillion has been lost so far as the following chart shows us household net worth which consists almost entirely of financial assets and a smattering of real estate tracks the s p with an almost 1 000 correlation well that means that with the s p briefly entering a bear market on friday and sliding approximately 20 from its all time high reached just a few days into 2022 when us net worth hit 150 trillion one reason why biden hasn t freaked out over this record crash in us household net worth is thatthe richest americans have borne the brunt with us billionaire fortunes down 800 billion since their peak amid the sharp losses in stocks crypto and other financial assets but that s just the beginning and surging interest rates are also starting to rattle the housing market where middle and working class families have the bulk of their wealth it all adds up to the sudden removal of a major prop to confidence ever bigger nest eggs which of course is on purpose in its attempts to stamp out the highest inflation in decades the fed needs americans to curb their spending even if it requires an economic slowdown to get there however it still remains unclear just how the fed hopes to snuff out supply side inflation which the fed s actions have no control over in any case neither the rich nor the poor are happy it s painful to get back to normal after really being in a fantasy world last year said john norris chief economist at oakworth capital bank it s going to feel a lot worse than it actually is maybe but it s already feeling quite terrible for most and according to the latest biden approval poll things have never been worse with nearly 70 saying the economy is bad that the senile president is slow to react when issues arise and that the state of the country is uneasy and worrying all we can add here is just wait another 2 5 years of biden rule and while the wealth losses among the top 0 001 do in fact reduce inequality that won t be much comfort to most people who worry about the u s s widening disparities especially those who onlyto worry and in the case of nancy pelosi putting on some quite profitable trades in a relative sense it s going to make the inequity a little lower but in an absolute sense everyone suffers said reena aggarwal director of georgetown university s psaros center for financial markets and policy like many aggarwal is concerned that falling markets will create problems for the broader economy and while the rich may be a little less rich they will certainly survive the problem is when the trickle down pain hits the middle class a downturn in housing made likely by a surge in mortgage rates to the highest since 2009 as we described in is the housing crash starting over the last decade the robust real estate market added 18 trillion in market value to owner occupied home valuations meanwhile us spending has been lifted in recent years by owners tapping the values of their homes for cash courtesy of helocs as expected the practice of home equity extraction likely came to a jarring halt this year after more than 40 of refinancings in the final quarter of last year saw homeowners pull cash out of their homes and since real estate is more evenly distributed than financial wealth while the top 1 owns more than half of u s holdings of stocks and mutual funds in real estate the bottom 90 owns more than half of the total while the top 1 holds less than 14 the pain of the coming housing crash will be felt far more widely than just that of the faamgs higher home prices and sharply higher mortgage rates have reduced buyer activity lawrence yun national association of realtors chief economist said in a statement thursday it looks like more declines are imminent in the upcoming months worse due to lagged home prices it could take a while before americans realize that their even the stock market selloff could take a while to translate into spending in a way that could tip the u s into recession a general selloff in the equity market may have a dampening effect said chris gaffney president of world markets at tiaa bank but there s a lag for investors they look at their statements on a quarterly basis and all of a sudden they say oh my goodness my stock market portfolio is down 20 maybe i shouldn t take that vacation or maybe i shouldn t buy that larger tv or a new car
i the wooded hills and pastures of eastern massachusetts are so close to boston that from upper windows of the city looking westward you can see the tops of pine trees and orchard boughs on the high horizon there is a rustic environment on the landward side there are old farmhouses at the back of milton hill and beyond belmont which look as unchanged by the besieging suburbs of a great city as if they were forty miles from even its borders now and then in boston streets you can see an old farmer in his sleigh or farm wagon as if you saw him in a berkshire village he seems neither to look up at the towers nor down at any fashionable citizens but goes his way alike unconscious of seeing or being seen on a certain day there was an old man driving along beacon street who looked bent in the shoulders as if his worn fur cap were too heavy for head and shoulders both this type of the ancient new england farmer in winter twitched the reins occasionally like an old woman to urge the steady white horse that plodded along as unmindful of his master s suggestions as of the silver mounted harnesses that passed them by both the horse and driver appeared to be conscious of sufficient wisdom and even worth for the duties of life but all this placidity and self assurance were in sharp contrast to the eager excitement of a pretty redcheeked girl who sat at the old man s side she was as sensitive to every new impression as they were dull her face bloomed out of a round white hood in such charming fashion that those who began to smile at an out of date equipage were interrupted by a second and stronger instinct and paid the homage that one must always pay to beauty it was a bitter cold morning the great sleighbells on the horse s shaggy neck jangled along the street and seemed to still themselves as they came among the group of vehicles that were climbing the long hill by the common as the sleigh passed a clubhouse that stands high on the slope a young man who stood idly behind one of the large windows made a hurried step forward and his sober face relaxed into a broad delighted smile then he turned quickly and presently appearing at the outer door scurried down the long flight of steps to the street fastening the top buttons of his overcoat by the way the old sleigh with its worn buffalo robe hanging unevenly over the back was only a short distance up the street but the pursuer found trouble in gaining much upon the steady gait of the white horse he ran two or three steps now and then and was almost near enough to speak as he drew closer to the pavement by the state house the pretty girl was looking up with wonder and delight but in another moment they went briskly on and it was not until a long pause had to be made at the blocked crossing of tremont street that the chase was ended the wonders of a first visit to boston were happily continued to miss nancy gale in the sudden appearance at her side of a handsome young man she put out a most cordial and warm hand from her fitch muff and her acquaintance noticed with pleasure the white knitted mitten that protected it from the weather he had not yet found time to miss the gloves left behind at the club but the warm little mitten was very comfortable to his fingers i was just thinking i hoped i should see you when i was starting to come in this morning she said with an eager look of pleasure then growing shy after the unconscious joy of the first moment boston is a pretty big place is n t it we all think so said tom aldis with fine candor it seems odd to see you here uncle ezra this is mr aldis that i have been telling you about who was down at our place so long in the fall explained nancy turning to look appealingly at her stern companion mr aldis had to remain with a friend who had sprained his ankle is mr carew quite well now she turned again to ask oh yes answered tom i saw him last week he s in new york this winter but where are you staying nancy he asked eagerly with a hopeful glance at uncle ezra i should like to take you somewhere this afternoon this is your first visit is n t it could n t you go to see rip van winkle to morrow it s the very best thing there is just now jefferson s playing this week our folks ain t in the habit of attending theatres sir said uncle ezra checking this innocent plan as effectually as an untracked horse car was stopping traffic in the narrow street he looked over his shoulder to see if there were any room to turn but was disappointed tom aldis gave a glance also and was happily reassured the street was getting fuller behind them every moment i beg you to excuse me sir he said gallantly to the old man do you think of anything else that miss gale ought to see there is the art museum if she has n t been there already all the pictures and statues and egyptian things you know there was much deference and courtesy in the young man s behavior to his senior uncle ezra responded by a less suspicious look at him but seemed to be considering this new proposition before he spoke uncle ezra was evidently of the opinion that while it might be a misfortune to be an old man it was a fault to be a young one and good looking where girls were concerned miss gale s father and mother showed me so much kindness tom explained seizing his moment of advantage i should like to be of some use it may not he convenient for you to come into town in this cold weather our folks have plenty to do all the time that s a fact acknowledged uncle ezra less grimly while nancy managed to show the light of a very knowing little smile i don t know but she d like to hava a city man show her about anyways t ain t but four miles an a half out to our place the way we come but while this weather holds i don t calculate to get into boston more n once a week i fetch all my stuff into the quincy market myself an i ve got to come in day after tomorrow mornin but not till late with a barrel o nice winter pears i ve been a savin i can set the barrel right for ard in the sleigh here and i do know but i can fetch nancy as well as not but how d ye get home nancy could n t you walk over to our place from the milton depot or could ye why of course i could answered his niece with a joy calmed by discretion t ain t but a mile an three quarters t won t hurt a maine girl said the old man smiling under his great cap so that his cold shrewd eyes suddenly grew blue and boyish i know all about ye now mr aldis i used to be acquainted with your grandfather much obliged to you yes i ll fetch nancy i ll leave her right up there to the missionary building corner o somerset street she can wait in the bookstore it s liable to be open early after i get through business to day i m goin to leave the hoss an let her see faneuil hall an the market o course and i don t know but we shall stop in to the old south church or you can show her that an tell her about any other curiosities if we don t have time nancy looked radiant and tom aldis accepted his trust with satisfaction at that moment the blockade was over and teams began to move not if it rains said uncle ezra speaking distinctly over his shoulder as they started otherwise expect her about eight or a little but the last of the sentence was lost nancy looked back and nodded from the tangle to tom who stood on the curbstone with his hands in his pockets her white hood bobbed out of sight the next moment in school street behind a great dray good gracious eight o clock said tom a little daunted as he walked quickly up the street as he passed the missionary building and the bookstore he laughed aloud but as he came near the clubhouse again in this victorious retreat he looked up at a window of one of the pleasant old houses and then obeyed the beckoning nod of an elderly relative who seemed to have been watching for his return tom said she as he entered the library i insist upon it that i am not curious by nature or by habit but what in the world made you chase that funny old horse and sleigh a pretty girl said tom frankly ii the second morning after this unexpected interview was sunshiny enough and as cold as january could make it tom aldis being young and gay was apt to keep late hours at this season and the night before had been the night of a harvard assembly he was the kindest hearted fellow in the world but it was impossible not to feel a little glum and sleepy as he hurried toward the missionary building the sharp air had urged uncle ezra s white horse beyond his customary pace so that the old sleigh was already waiting and uncle ezra himself was beating with his arms and tramping to and fro impatiently cold mornin he said she s waitin for you in there i wanted to be sure you d come now i ll be off i ve got them pears well covered but i expect they may be chilled nancy counted on it an i just as soon she d have a nice time her cousin s folks ll see her to the depot he added as he drove away and tom nodded reassuringly from the bookstore door nancy looked up eagerly from beside a counter full of gayly bound books and gave him a speechless and grateful goodmorning i m getting some presents for the little boys she informed him they re great hands to read this one s all about birds for sam and i don t know but this life o napoleon ll please asa as much as anything when i waked up this morning i felt homesick i could n t see anything out o the window that i knew i m a real home body i should like to send the boys a present myself said tom what do you think about jack knives asa d rather have readin matter he ain t got the use for a knife that some boys have why you re real good said nancy and your mother can t i send her something that she would like asked tom kindly she liked all those things that you and mr carew sent at christmas time we had the loveliest time opening the bundles you ought n t to think o doing anything more i wish you d help me pick out a nice large print bible for grandma she s always wishing for a large print bible and her eyes fail her a good deal tom aldis was not very fond of shopping but this pious errand did not displease him in nancy s company a few minutes later when they went out into the cold street he felt warm and cheerful and carried under his arm the flat parcel which held a large print copy of the scriptures and the little boys books seeing nancy again seemed to carry his thoughts back to east rodney as if he had been born and brought up there as well as she the society and scenery of the little coast town were so simple and definite in their elements that one easily acquired a feeling of citizenship it was like becoming acquainted with a friendly individual tom had an intimate knowledge gained from several weeks residence with nancy s whole world the long morning stretched before them like a morning in far cathay and they stepped olf down the street toward the old south church which had been omitted from uncle ezra s scheme of entertainment by reason of difficulty in leaving the horse the discovery that the door would not be open for nearly another hour only involved a longer walk among the city streets and the asking and answering of many questions about the east rodney neighbors and the late autumn hunting and fishing which with some land interests of his father s had first drawn tom to that part of the country he had known enough of the rest of the world to appreciate the little community of fishermen farmers and while his friend carew was but a complaining captive with a sprained ankle tom aldis entered into the spirit of rural life with great zest in fact he now remembered some boyish gallantries with a little uneasiness and looked to nancy to befriend him it was easy for a man of twentythree to arrive at an almost brotherly affection for such a person as nancy she was so discreet and so sincerely affectionate nancy looked up at him once or twice as they walked along and her face glowed with happy pride i d just like to have addie porter see me now she exclaimed and gave tom a straightforward look to which he promptly responded why he asked nancy drew a long breath of relief and began to smile oh nothing she answered only she kept telling me that you would n t have much of anything to say to me if i should happen to meet you anywhere up to boston i knew better i guess you re all right are n t you about that she spoke with sudden impulse but there was something in her tone that made tom blush a little why yes he answered what do you mean nancy we won t talk about it now while we re full of seeing things but i ve got something to say by and by said the girl soberly you re very mysterious protested tom taking the bundle under his other arm and piloting her carefully across the street nancy said no more the town was more interesting now that it seemed to have waked up and her eyes were too busy everything proved delightful that day from the recognition of business signs familiar to her through newspaper advertisements to the great organ and the thrill which her patriotic heart experienced in a second visit to faneuil hall they found the weather so mild that they pushed on to charlestown and went to the top of the monument which tom had not done since he was a very small boy after this they saw what else they could of historical boston on the fleetest and lightest of feet and talked all the way until they were suddenly astonished to hear the bells in all the steeples ring at noon oh dear my nice mornin s all gone said nancy regretfully i never had such a beautiful time in all my life she looked quite beautiful herself as she spoke her eyes shone with lovely light and feeling and her cheeks were bright with color like a fresh bloomed rose but for the first time that day she was wistful and sorry oh you need n t go back yet said tom i ve nothing in the world to do uncle ezra thought i d better go up to cousin snow s in revere street i m afraid she ll be all through dinner but never mind they thought i d better go there on mother s account it s her cousin but i never saw her at least not since i can remember they won t like it if i don t you know it would n t be very polite all right assented tom with dignity i ll take you there at once perhaps we can catch a car or something i m ashamed to ask for anything more when you ve been so kind said nancy after a few moments of anxious silence i don t know that you can think of any good chance but i d give a great deal if i could only go somewhere and see some pretty dancing you know i m always dreamin and dreamin about pretty dancing and she looked eagerly at tom to see what he would say it must be goin on somewhere in boston she went on with pleading eyes could you ask somebody they said at uncle ezra s that if cousin abby snow wanted me to remain until to morrow it might be just as well to stay she used to be so well acquainted with mother and so i thought i might get some nice chance to look on to see some dancing repeated tom mindful of his own gay evening the night before and of others to come and the general impossibility of nancy s finding the happiness she sought he never had been so confronted by social barriers as for nancy s dancing at east rodney in the schoolhouse hall or in jacob parker s new barn it had been one of the most ideal things he had ever known in his life it would be hard to find elsewhere such grace as hers in seaboard towns one often comes upon strange foreign inheritances and the soul of a spanish grandmother might still survive in nancy as far as her light feet were concerned she danced like a flower in the wind she made you feel light of foot yourself as if you were whirling and blowing and waving through the air as if you could go out dancing and dancing over the blue sea water of the bay and find floor enough to touch and whirl upon but nancy had always seemed to take her gifts for granted she had the simplicity of genius i can t say now but i am sure to find out said tom aldis definitely i ll try to make some sort of plan for you i wish we could have another dance ourselves oh not now answered nancy sensibly it s knowing most all the people that makes a party pleasant my aunt would have asked you to come to luncheon to day but she had to go out of town and was afraid of not getting back in season she would like to see you very much you see i m only a bachelor in lodgings this winter explained tom bravely you ve been just as good as you could be i know all about boston now almost as if i lived here i should like to see the inside of one of those big houses she added softly they all look so noble as you go by i think it was very polite of your aunt you must thank her mr aldis it seemed to tom as if his companion was building most glorious pleasure out of very commonplace materials all the morning she had been as gay and busy as a brook by the middle of the afternoon he knocked again at cousin snow s door in revere street and delivered an invitation mrs annesley his aunt and the kindest of women would take nancy to an afternoon class at papanti s and bring her back afterward if cousin snow were willing to spare her tom would wait and drive back with her in the coupé then he must hurry to cambridge for a business meeting to which he had been suddenly summoned nancy was radiant when she first appeared but a few minutes later as they drove away together she began to look grave and absent it was only because she was so sorry to think of parting i am so glad about the dancing class said tom i never should have thought of that they are all children you know but it s very pretty and they learn all the new dances i used to think it a horrid penance when i was a small boy i don t know why it is said nancy but the mere thought of music and dancin makes me feel happy i never saw any real good dancin either but i can always dream what it ought to be there s nothing so beautiful to me as manners she added softly as if she whispered at the shrine of confidence my aunt thinks there are going to be some pretty figure dances to day announced tom in a matter of fact way there was something else than the dancing upon his mind he thought that he should have told nancy of his engagement not that it was quite an engagement yet but he could not do it just now what was it you were going to tell me this morning about addie porter was n t it he laughed a little and then colored deeply he had been somewhat foolish in his attentions to this young person the beguiling village belle of east rodney and the adjacent coasts she was a pretty creature and a sad flirt with none of the real beauty and quaint sisterly ways of nancy what was it all about he asked again nancy turned away quickly that s one thing i wanted to come to boston for that s what i want to tell you she don t really care anything about you she only wanted to get you away from the other girls i know for certain that she likes jo brown better than anybody and now she s been going with him almost all winter long he keeps telling round that they re going to be married in the spring but i thought if it was so she d ask me to get some of her best things while i was in boston i suppose she s intendin to play with him a while longer said nancy with honest scorn just because he loves her well enough to wait but don t you worry about her mr aldis i won t indeed answered tom meekly but with an unexpected feeling of relief as if the unconscious danger had been a real one nancy was very serious i m going home the first of the week she said as they parted but the small hand felt colder than usual and did not return his warm grasp the light in her eyes had all gone but tom s beamed affectionately i never thought of addie porter afterward i m afraid he confessed what awfully good fun we all had i should like to go down to east rodney again some time oh shan t you ever come cried nancy with a thrill in her voice which tom did not soon forget he did not know that the young girl s heart was waked he was so busy with the affairs of his own affections but true friendship does not grow on every bush in boston or east rodney and nancy s voice and farewell look touched something that lay very deep within his heart there is little more to be told of this part of the story mrs annesley tom s aunt being a woman whose knowledge of human nature and power of sympathy made her a woman of the world rather than of any smaller circle mrs annesley was delighted with nancy s unaffected pleasure and self forgetful dignity of behavior at the dancing school she took her back to the house and they had half an hour together there and only parted because nancy was to spend the night with cousin snow and another old friend of her mother s was to be asked to tea mrs annesley asked her to come to see her again whenever she was in boston and nancy gratefully promised but she never came i m all through with boston for this time she said with an amused smile at parting i m what one of our neighbors calls all flustered up and she looked eagerly in her new friend s kind eyes for sympathy now that i ve seen this beautiful house and you and mr aldis and some pretty dancin i want to go right home where i belong tom aldis meant to write to nancy when his engagement came out but he never did and he meant to send a long letter to her and her mother two years later when he and his wife were going abroad for a long time but he had an inborn hatred of letter writing and let that occasion pass also though when anything made him very sorry or very glad he had a curious habit of thinking of these east rodney friends before he went to europe he used to send them magazines now and then or a roll of illustrated papers and one day in a bookstore he happened to see a fine french book with colored portraits of famous dancers and sent it by express to nancy with his best remembrances but tom was young and much occupied the stream of time floated him away from the shore of maine not toward it ten or fifteen years passed by his black hair began to grow gray and he came back from europe after a while to a new boston life in which reminiscences of east rodney seemed very remote indeed iii one summer afternoon there were two passengers middle aged men on the small steamer james madison which attended the comings and goings of the great boston steamer and ran hither and yon on errands about penobscot bay she was puffing up a long inlet toward east rodney landing and the two strangers were observing the green shores with great interest like nearly the whole stretch of the maine coast there was a house on almost every point and headland but for all this there were great tracts of untenanted country dark untouched forests of spruces and firs and shady coves where there seemed to be deep water and proper moorings the two passengers were on the watch for landings and lookouts in short this lovely lonely country was being frankly appraised at its probable value for lumbering or for building lots and its relation to the real estate market just now there appeared to be no citizens save crows and herons the sun was almost down behind some high hills in the west and the landing was in sight not very far ahead it is nearly twenty years since i came down here before said the younger of the two men suddenly giving the conversation a personal turn just after i was out of college at any rate my father had bought this point of land with the islands i think he meant to come and hunt in the autumn and was misled by false accounts of deer and moose he sent me down to oversee something or other i believe he had some surveyors at work and thought they had better be looked after i got my chum carew to come along and we found plenty of trout and had a great time until he gave his ankle a bad sprain what did you do then asked the elder man politely keeping his eyes on the shore i stayed by of course i had nothing to do in those days answered mr aldis it was one of those nice old fashioned country neighborhoods where there was plenty of fun among the younger people sailing on moonlight nights and haycart parties and dances and all sorts of things we used to go to prayer meetings nine or ten miles off and sewing societies i had hard work to get away we made excuse of carew s ankle joint as long as we could but he d been all right and going everywhere with the rest of us a fortnight before we started we waited until there was ice alongshore i remember daniel r carew was it of the new york stock exchange asked the listener he strikes you as being a very grave sort of person now does n t like it if he finds anybody in his chair at the club and all that i can stir him up said mr aldis confidently poor old fellow he has had a good deal of trouble one way and another how the landing has grown up why it s a good sized little town i m sorry it is so late he added after a long look at a farm on the shore which they were passing i meant to go to see the people up there and he pointed to the old farmhouse dark and low and firm rooted in the long slope of half tamed ledgy fields warm thoughts of nancy filled his heart as if they had said good by to each other that cold afternoon in boston only the winter before he had not been so eager to see any one for a long time such is the triumph of friendship even love itself without friendship is the victim of chance and time when supper was over in the knox house the one centre of public entertainment in east rodney it was past eight o clock and mr aldis felt like a dim copy of rip van winkle or of the gay tom aldis who used to know everybody and be known of all men as the planner of gayeties he lighted a cigar as he sat on the front piazza of the hotel and gave himself up to reflection there was a long line of lights in the second story of a wooden building opposite and he was conscious of some sort of public interest and excitement there is going to be a time in the hall said the landlord who came hospitably out to join him the folks are going to have a dance the proceeds will be applied to buying a bell for the new schoolhouse they d be pleased if you felt like stepping over there has been a considerable number glad to hear you thought of coming down i ain t an east rodney man myself but i ve often heard of your residin here some years ago our folks is makin the ice cream for the occasion he added significantly and mr aldis nodded and smiled in acknowledgment he had meant to go out and see the gales if the boat had only got in in season but boats are unpunctual in their ways and the james madison had been unexpectedly signaled by one little landing and settlement after another he remembered that a great many young people were on board when they arrived and now they appeared again coming along the street and disappearing at the steep stairway opposite the lighted windows were full of heads already and there were now and then preliminary exercises upon a violin mr aldis had grown old enough to be obliged to sit and think it over about going to a ball the day had passed when there would have been no question but when he had finished his cigar he crossed the street and only stopped before the lighted store window to find a proper bank bill for the doorkeeper then he ran up the stairs to the hall as if he were the tom aldis of old it was an embarrassing moment as he entered the low hot room and the young people stared at him suspiciously but there were also elderly people scattered about who were meekly curious and interested and one of these got clumsily upon his feet and hastened to grasp the handsome stranger by the hand nancy heard you was coming said mr gale delightedly she expected i should see you here if you was just the same kind of a man you used to be come let s set right down folks is crowding in there may be more to set than there is to dance how is nancy asked tom feeling the years tumble off his shoulders well as usual poor creatur replied the old father at that moment the orchestra struck up a military march with so much energy that further conversation was impossible near them was an awkward looking young fellow with shoulders too broad for his height and a general look of chunkiness and dullness presently he rose and crossed the room and made a bow to his chosen partner that most courtiers might have envied it was a bow of grace and dignity pretty well done said tom aldis aloud mr gale was beaming with smiles and keeping time to the music with his foot and hand nancy done it he announced proudly speaking close to his companion s ear that boy give her a sight o difficulty he used to want to learn but long at tlie first he d turn shame red if he much as met a sheep in a pastur the last time i see him on the floor i went home an told her he done as well as any you can see for yourself now they re all a movin the fresh southerly breeze came wafting into the hall and making the lamps flare if tom turned his head he could see the lights out in the bay of vessels that had put in for the night old mr gale was not disposed for conversation so long as the march lasted and when it was over a frisky looking middle aged person accosted mr aldis with the undimmed friendliness of their youth and he took her out as behooved him for the lancers quadrille from her he learned that nancy had been for many years a helpless invalid and when their dance was over he returned to sit out the next one with mr gale who had recovered a little by this time from the excitement of the occasion and was eager to talk about nancy s troubles but still more about her gifts and activities after a while they adjourned to the hotel piazza in company and the old man grew still more eloquent over a cigar he had not changed much since tom s residence in the family in fact the flight of seventeen years had made but little difference in his durable complexion or the tough frame which had been early seasoned by wind and weather yes sir he said nancy has had it very hard but she s the life o the neighborhood yet for excellent judgment i never see her equal why once the board o selec men took trouble to meet right there in her room off the kitchen when they had to make some responsible changes in layin out the school derestricts she was the best teacher they ever had a master good teacher fitted a boy for bowdoin college all except his greek that last season before she was laid aside from sickness she took right holt to bear it the best she could and begun to study on what kind o things she could do first she used to make out to knit a layin there for the store but her hands got crippled up with the rest of her t is the wustkind o rheumatics there is she had me go round to the neighborin schools and say that if any of the child n was backward an slow with their lessons to send em up to her now an then there d be one an at last she d see to some class there was n t time for an here year before last the town voted her fifty dollars a year for her services what do you think of that aldis manifested his admiration but be could not help wishing that he had not seemed to forget so pleasant an old acquaintance and above all wished that he had not seemed to take part in nature s great scheme to defraud her she had begun life with such distinct rights and possibilities i tell you she was the most cut up to have to stop dancin said mr gale gayly but she held right on to that same as to other things i can t dance myself she says so i m goin to make other folks you see right before you how she s kep her word mr aldis what always pleased her the most from a child was dancin folks talked to her some about letting her mind rove on them light things when she appeared to be on a dyin bed david he danced afore the lord she d tell em an her eyes would snap so they did n t like to say no more aldis laughed the old man himself was so cheerful well sir she made em keep right on with the old dancin school she always took such part in i guess t was goin warn t it that fall you stopped here but she sent out for all the child n she could get and learnt em their manners she can see right out into the kitchen from where she is an she has em make their bows an take their steps till they get em right an feel as good as anybody there s boys an girls comin an goin two or three times a week in the afternoon it don t seem to be no hardship there ain t no such good company for young or old as nancy she ll be dreadful glad to see you the proud father ended his praises oh she s never forgot that good time she had up to boston you an all your folks could n t have treated her no better an you give her her heart s desire you did so she s never done talkin about that pretty dancin school with all them lovely little child n an everybody so elegant and pretty behaved she d always wanted to see such a lady as your aunt was i don t know but she s right she always maintains that when folks has good manners an good hearts the world is their n an she was goin to do everything she could to keep young folks from feelin hoggish an left out tom walked out toward the farm in the bright moonlight with mr gale and promised to call as early the next day as possible they followed the old shore path with the sea on one hand and the pointed firs on the other and parted where nancy s light could be seen twinkling on the hill iv it was not very cheerful to look forward to seeing a friend of one s youth crippled and disabled beside tom aldis always felt a nervous dread in being where people were ill and suffering he thought once or twice how little compassion for nancy these country neighbors expressed even her father seemed inclined to boast of her rather than to pity the poor life that was so hindered business affairs and conference were appointed for that afternoon so that by the middle of the morning he found himself walking up the yard to the gales side door there was nobody within call mr aldis tapped once or twice and then hearing a voice he went through the narrow unpainted entry into the old kitchen a brown comfortable place which he well remembered oh i m so glad to see you nancy was saying from her little bedroom beyond come in come in he passed the doorway and stood with his hand on hers which lay helpless on the blue and white coverlet nancy s young eyes untouched by years or pain or regret looked up at him as frankly as a child s from the pillow mother s gone down into the field to pick some peas for dinner she said looking and looking at tom and smiling but he saw at last that tears were shining too and making her smile all the brighter you see now why i could n t write she explained i kept thinking i should i did n t want anybody else to thank you for the books now sit right down she begged her guest father told me all he could about last night you danced with addie porter i did acknowledged tom aldis and they both laughed we talked about old times between the figures but it seemed to me that i remembered them better than she did addie has been through with a good deal of experience since then explained nancy with a twinkle in her eyes i wish i could have danced again with you said tom bravely but i sawsome scholars that did you credit i have to dance by proxy said nancy and to this there was no reply tom aldis sat in the tiny bedroom with an aching heart such activity and definiteness of mind such power of loving and hunger for life had been pent and prisoned there so many years nancy had made what she could of her small world of books there was something very uncommon in her look and way of speaking he felt like a boy beside her he to whom the world had given its best luxury and widest opportunity as he looked out of the small window he saw only a ledgy pasture where sheep were straying along the slopes among the bayberry and juniper beyond were some balsam firs and a glimpse of the sea it was a lovely bit of landscape but it lacked figures and nancy was born to be a teacher and a lover of her kind she had only lacked opportunity but she was equal to meeting whatever should come one saw it in her face you don t know how many times i have thought of that cold day in boston said nancy from her pillows your aunt was beautiful i never could tell you about the rest of the day could i why it just gave me a measure to live by i saw right off how small some things were that i thought were big i told her about one or two things down here in rodney that troubled me and she understood all about it if we mean to be happy and useful she said the only way is to be self forgetful i never forgot that the seed fell upon good ground it seems to me said mr aldis with a smile he had been happy enough himself but nancy s happiness appeared in that moment to have been of another sort he could not help thinking what a wonderful perennial quality there is in friendship because it had once flourished and bloomed no winter snows of maine could bury it no summer sunshine of his foreign life could wither this single flower of a day long past the years vanished like a may snowdrift and because they had known each other once they found each other now it was like a tough little sprig of gray everlasting the new england edelweiss that always keeps a white flower ready to blossom safe and warm in its heart they entertained each other delightfully that late summer morning tom talked of his dear wife and of their children as he had seldom talked to any one before and afterward explained the land interests which had brought him back at this late day to east rodney i came down meaning to sell my land to a speculator he said or to a real estate agency which has great possessions along the coast but i m very doubtful about doing it now that i have seen the bay again and this lovely shore i had no idea that it was such a magnificent piece of country i was going on from here to mount desert with a half idea of buying land there why is n t this good enough that i own already with a yacht or a good steam launch we should n t be so far away from places along the coast you know what if i were to build a house above sunday cove on the headland we should be neighbors should n t we i have a friend who might build another house beyond we came home from abroad at about the same time and he s looking for a place to build this side of bar harbor tom was half confiding in his old acquaintance and half thinking aloud these real estate brokers can t begin to give a man the value of such land as mine he added it would be excellent business to come and live here yourself if you want to bring up the value of the property said nancy gravely i hear there are a good many lots staked out between here and portland but it takes more than that to start things there can t be any prettier place than east rodney she declared looking affectionately out of her little north window at the sheep it would be a great blessing to city people if they could come and have our good rodney air the friends talked on a little longer and with great cheerfulness and wealth of reminiscence tom began to understand why nobody seemed to pity nancy though she did at last speak sadly and make confession that she felt it to be very hard because she never could get about the neighborhood to see any of the old and sick people some of them were lonesome and lived in lonesome places i try to send word to them sometimes if i can t do any more said nancy we re so apt to forget em and let em feel they are n t useful i can t bear to see an old heart begging for a little love i do sometimes wish i could manage to go an try to make a little of their time pass pleasant do you always stay just here asked tom with sudden compassion after he had stood for a moment looking out at the gray sheep on the hillside oh sometimes i get into the old rocking chair and father pulls me out into the kitchen when i m extra well said nancy proudly as if she spoke of a yachting voyage or a mountaineer s exploits once a doctor said if i was only up to boston her voice fell a little with a touch of wistfulness perhaps i could have had more done and could always have got about with some kind of a chair but that was a good while ago i never let myself worry about it i am so busy right here that i don t know what would happen if i set out to travel v the east rodney shore looked as green as ever and the untouched wall of firs and pines faithfully echoed the steamer s whistle a year from the time when mr aldis had first come up the hay after a long absence in the twelve months just past he had worked wonders upon his long neglected estate and now was comfortably at housekeeping on the sunday cove headland nancy could see the chimneys and a gable of the fine establishment from her own little north window and yet the sheep still fed undisturbed on the slopes that lay between more than this there were two other new houses to he occupied by tom s friends within the distance of a mile or two it would be difficult to give any idea of the excitement and interest of east rodney or the fine effect and impulse to the local market tom s wife and children were most affectionately befriended by their neighbors the gales and with their coming in midsummer many changes for the better took place in nancy s life and made it as bright as it possibly could be she lost no time in starting a class where the two eldest for the first time found study a pleasure and little tom was promptly and tenderly taught her best bow and made to mind his steps with such interest and satisfaction that he who had once roared aloud in public at the infant dancingclass now knew both confidence and ambition there was already a well worn little footpath between the old gale house and sunday cove it wound in and out among the ledges and thickets and over the short sheep turf of the knolls and there was a scent of sweetbrier here and of raspberries there and of the salt sea and the pines and the juniper and bayberry all the way nancy herself had followed that path in a carrying chair and joy was in her heart at every step she blessed tom over and over again as he walked broadshouldered and strong between the forward handles and turned his head now and then to see if she liked the journey for some reason she was much better now that she could get out into the sun the bedroom with the north window was apt to be tenantless and wherever nancy went she made other people wiser and happier and more interested in life on the day when she went in state to visit the new house with her two sober carriers and a gay little retinue of young people frisking alongside she felt happy enough by the way but when she got to the house itself and had been carried quite round it and was at last set down in the wide hall to look about she gave her eyes a splendid liberty of enjoyment mrs aldis disappeared for a moment to give directions in her guest s behalf and the host and nancy were left alone together no i don t feel a bit tired said the guest looking pale and radiant i feel as if i did n t know how to be grateful enough i have everything in the world to make me happy what does make you and your dear family do so much it means a great deal to have friends does n t it answered tom in a tone that thanked her warmly i often wish he could not finish his sentence for he was thinking of nancy s long years and the bond of friendship that absence and even forgetfulness had failed to break of the curious insistence of fate which made him responsible for something in the life of nancy and brought him back to her neighborhood it was a moment of deep thought he even forgot nancy herself he heard the water plashing on the shore below and felt the cool sea wind that blew in at the door nancy reached out her bent and twisted hand and began to speak then she hesitated glanced at her hand again and looked straight at him with shining eyes there never has been a day when i have n t thought of you she said sarah orne jewett
