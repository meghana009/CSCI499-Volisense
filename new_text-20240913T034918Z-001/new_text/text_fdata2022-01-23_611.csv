six months candidates in the worst performing industries can often represent good shorting opportunities as their industry performance provides a headwind to any rally attempts recent earnings and future estimates over the past three years htht has missed earnings estimates in seven of the twelve quarters the company has posted a trailing four quarter average earnings miss of 48 29 consistently

the recent price decline the stock is still relatively overvalued which could hurt performance in the short term final thoughts a variety of headwinds including the continued covid 19 pandemic will

want to give this stock the cold shoulder or perhaps include it as part of a short or hedge strategy additional content iidon t waste this opportunity to buy these 3 bank laggards after an impressive 2021 this year is turning out to be a bit disappointing for the stock markets all the three major indices the s p 500 the dow jones industrial average and the nasdaq are in deep red since the beginning of 2022 so what s fueling the sell offs well there has been increasing speculation that the federal reserve will be more aggressive in its efforts to tackle inflation and likely announce more than 25 basis points hike in interest rates in its march fomc meeting this has driven the benchmark u s treasury yields up with the 10 year yields touching the highest level since january 2020 moreover the ongoing q4 earnings are turning out to be lackluster many banks that have reported results so far haven t been able to meet market expectations both in terms of quarterly performance and management guidance thus this weighed heavily on the major indexes and bank stocks but with interest rate hikes imminent and the u s economy remaining strong you can turn this scenario into a buying opportunity we have chosen amerant bancorp inc live oak bancshares inc and triumph bancorp inc as these will benefit from the hawkish fed stance and robust economy since march 2020 banks have been witnessing contraction of the net interest margin nim owing to the central bank s accommodative monetary policy and near zero interest rates so sooner and bigger than expected rate hikes will come as a breather for banks and improve margins and net interest income nii which constitutes a major portion of the revenues further robust economic growth and a decent rise in loan demand are set to drive nim and nii banks are also undertaking initiatives to restructure operations to diversify their footprint and revenue base efforts to focus on non interest income are likely to bolster banks top line

multipliers indicated that total spending in 2021 would go up a lot while production constraints suggested that output would not increase by as much the difference was unexpectedly higher inflation in 2008 as the global financial crisis was ravaging economies everywhere queen elizabeth ii visiting the london school of economics famously asked why did nobody see it coming the high inflation of 2021 especially in the united states where the year on year increase in consumer prices reached a four decade high of 7 in december should prompt the same question inflation is not nearly as bad as a financial crisis particularly when price increases coincide with a rapid improvement in the economy and whereas financial crises may be inherently unpredictable forecasting inflation is a staple of macroeconomic modelling why then did almost everyone get the us inflation story so wrong last year a survey of 36 private sector forecasters in may revealed a median inflation forecast of 2 3 for 2021 measured by the core personal consumption expenditures price index the us federal reserve s de facto target gauge as a whole the group put a 0 5 chance on inflation exceeding 4 last year but by the core pce measure it looks set to be 4 5 the fed s rate setting federal open market committee fared no better with none of its 18 members expecting inflation above 2 5 in 2021 financial markets appear to have missed this one as well with bond prices yielding similar predictions ditto the international monetary fund the congressional budget office president joe biden s administration and even many conservative economists some of this collective error resulted from developments that forecasters did not or could not expect fed chair jerome powell among many others blamed the delta variant of the coronavirus for slowing the reopening of the economy and thus driving inflation higher but powell and others had earlier argued that the increase in inflation in the spring of 2021 was spurred by an overly rapid reopening as vaccination reduced case numbers it is unlikely that both of these excuses are correct the emergence of delta like the pandemic in 2020 probably kept inflation lower than it otherwise would have been supply chain disruptions were another unanticipated development that allegedly blew up inflation forecasts but while the pandemic has caused some genuine bottlenecks in production networks most are churning out much more than last year with both us and global manufacturing output and shipping up sharply this brings us to a more important source of forecasting error not taking our economic models seriously enough forecasts based on extrapolation from the recent past are nearly always as good as or better than those based on more sophisticated modelling the exception is when there are economic inputs that are well outside the realm of recent experience for example the extraordinary 2 5tn in fiscal support for the us economy in 2021 amounting to 11 of gdp was far larger than any previous fiscal package since world war ii a simple fiscal multiplier model would have predicted that average output in the last three quarters of 2021 would be 2 5 above pre pandemic estimates of potential to think that a stimulus of this magnitude would not cause inflation required believing either that such a huge adjustment was possible within a matter of months or that fiscal policy is ineffective and does not increase aggregate demand both views are implausible economic models also gave us substantial reason to believe that several factors would reduce the us economy s potential in 2021 these included premature deaths reduced immigration foregone capital investment the costs of hardening the economy to covid 19 pandemic induced exits from the workforce and all of the difficulties of rapidly reassembling an economy that had been torn apart such constraints made it very likely that additional demand would push inflation even higher a final set of errors arose because our models were missing key inputs or interpretations to the degree that people relied on economic models they often used a phillips curve to predict inflation or changes in inflation based on the unemployment rate but these frameworks had difficulty reckoning with the fact that the natural rate of unemployment likely rose at least temporarily as a result of the covid 19 crisis more important unemployment is not the only way to measure economic slack estimates from before the pandemic show that the quit rate and the ratio of unemployed workers to job openings are better predictors of wage and price inflation these other indicators of slack were already tight at the beginning of 2021 and were very tight by the spring in retrospect the mental model i find most useful for thinking about 2021 is to apply fiscal multipliers to nominal gdp use them to predict how much of the fiscal stimulus will be spent and then try to predict real gdp by understanding what the economy s productive capacity is the difference between the two is inflation multipliers indicated that total spending in 2021 would go up a lot while production constraints suggested that output would not increase by as much the difference was unexpectedly higher inflation where does this leave us in understanding inflation in 2022 instead of making inertial forecasts that the future will resemble the past taking our models seriously means accounting for high levels of demand continued supply constraints and ever tighter labour markets with rapidly rising nominal wages and higher inflation expectations some types of inflation notably in goods prices are likely to decline this year but others including services inflation will likely increase i therefore expect another year of significant us inflation maybe not as high as in 2021 but plausibly in the 3 4 range but the most important forecasting lesson from last year is humility we should all be adding some large error bands around our expectations and be prepared to update our outlooks as the economic situation unfolds project syndicate jason furman professor of the practice of economic policy at the harvard kennedy

roku s push into original content could someday put it on a similar footing with netflix netflix nflx 2 52 started as a mail order service for renting dvd movies but its pivot into streaming content was the big step that made the company the top content provider it is today history doesn t always repeat itself but it often rhymes roku roku 1 60 has built a reputation for its streaming dongles and tv software however it s in the early stages of pivoting from being a neutral streaming platform to becoming its own source of original content it s currently just one tenth of netflix s size but here s why roku could someday grow up to be as big making a clear push into original programming media streaming is all about gaining and keeping the attention of your users for netflix it s been an original content story since it moved into streaming slowly transitioning from licensing other people s content to replacing more and more of its catalog with its own productions roku began as a neutral platform for streaming its dongles would convert tvs into smart tvs and it partners with tv oems to put its operating software on them to make them streaming capable out of the box roku has steadily built up its user base over time growing from 16 7 million active accounts in the third quarter of 2017 its first quarter as a public company to 56 4 million accounts in q3 2021 its most recent quarter but roku decided that at some point it needs to be more than just a means for watching netflix or hulu it s been steadily investing in its own original programming this effort started with launching the roku channel an ad supported free streaming service built within the roku platform the early content was licensed but roku has now begun bolstering it with original programming the company bought content from failed streaming service quibi and is now producing shows and movies and recently signed a massive 240 000 square foot building lease in new york city for content production purposes roku had to wait until the right time to attempt this if it were to try this too soon and alienate existing streaming platforms they might leave roku hurting roku s appeal to users however roku s skirmishes with companies like at t and alphabet over contract negotiations have shown that it s become large enough to have leverage via its user base and the time was right to evolve in other words roku has started thinking these streaming companies need me so i m not too worried anymore about stepping on their toes different approaches to generating revenue i ll repeat it streaming is about maintaining engagement on the platform but monetizing those streaming eyeballs can be done in different ways netflix has always been ad free charging its viewers for the right to access the platform roku is taking a different approach becoming an advertising business underneath its streaming service in other words rather than generating revenue from consumer pockets roku is tapping advertisers a recent pixelate report estimated that a whopping 45 of ads on connected tv devices that support video streaming went to roku devices in the first half of 2021 the report also stated that ad spending grew 50 year over year so roku is capturing a large chunk of this revenue pie that keeps getting bigger the company s average revenue per user arpu grew 49 year over year to 40 10 in q3 2021 and the arpu expansion is roku s primary revenue growth driver a company like netflix that charges the consumer must now be conscious of competing streaming platforms and growth is more reliant on user growth i think that roku s ad tech business is a stronger model because it seems more consumer friendly to give users a free product like the roku channel with targeted ads versus charging them monthly fees is roku a buy today roku s user growth has been affected by the global supply chain issues along with a marketwide sell off of technology and growth stocks and roku s fallen a long way from its previous highs however it s given investors a much more attractive valuation on the stock the price to sales ratio has come down from more than 30 to less than 10 about on par with its pre pandemic valuation meanwhile the company is arguably much stronger today revenue continues chugging higher while the business is becoming increasingly free cash flow positive analysts are looking for 35 year over year revenue growth in the 2022 fiscal year which works out to nearly 3 8 billion with the stock s valuation at these affordable levels i think investors could reasonably expect it to appreciate at a similar rate to how the business grows making roku a compelling investment idea
bloomberg investors should avoid the temptation to buy the dips in expensive high growth stocks because once the fever breaks it lasts a long time according to andrew slimmon senior portfolio manager at morgan stanley investment management slimmon joined the what goes up podcast to discuss what he s investing in these days he also explains how the msif u s core portfolio fund he co manages beat the s p 500 with a 36 gain in 2021 below are the condensed and lightly edited highlights of the conversation click here to listen to the full show and subscribe on apple podcasts spotify or wherever you listen q you wrote to us before the show saying avoid the temptation to step in and buy into the selloff in high growth stocks you said my experience is once the fever breaks it s done for quite a while historically is there any precedent you could point to is it too simple to point to the dot com bubble as a fair comparison a so first of all i just want to make sure it s understood i m not a value manager or a growth manager i m not trying to you know spin what works or what my investment philosophy is at all times i m just looking at what the fat pitch is and as it pertains to this group the reason why i believe once the fever breaks it lasts a long time is if you wind the clock back if you look at some of these uber growth funds back to where they were in early fall of 2020 that means a lot of people haven t made money right because they chased into them after they peaked and the reason why the dot com analogy is correct is that that means that every time they start to go up there s someone that can get out even and so there s tremendous selling resistance at higher levels because so many people have lost money and that to me is very similar to the dot com bubble and other bubbles once a very speculative bubble breaks it s not a v bottom because there s too many people looking to get out q so what cohort would you look at could you see the nasdaq 100 going down as much as it did then or more like a cathie wood type of fund a that s the difference to 2000 in 2000 the nasdaq had obscene prices you also had some of these very big cap tech stocks trading at triple digit multiples and when i look at these uber growth stocks they re expensive as they were in 2000 but the main tech stocks the nasdaq 100 the big stocks they re not as expensive so i don t think the comparison to the nasdaq break of 2000 is quite accurate because i don t think the really big tech stocks are as vulnerable q one thing i always think about along these lines is that there s something in human nature that is always going to make that instinct to chase the high flyers come back at some point a greed q yeah right as simple as that but what are the conditions you would look for to be in place to bring that trade back a well i think it s first seller exhaustion where stocks stop going down on bad news because there s no one left to sell them and i m just not sure we re there yet i haven t seen big capitulation i mean the stocks are down a lot but there hasn t been big capitulation in these stocks the other way i think about it is when no one believes that they can buy the dip anymore that s when the bottom happens right when people say i don t wanna touch them these are uninvestible that s when i get interested but when people are saying hey well what do you think because the memory of making a lot of money is too recent and that leads people to try to bottom fish i ve been in this business a long time human behavior doesn t change and so when this type of bubble breaks you get counter trend rallies and they go up a little bit and then they go down low and then they go up and they go down until people say don t ask me one more thing about it i don t want to talk about it moving on and then i go oh that s kind of interesting that means maybe they re getting to a bottom q your fund was up 36 last year everybody at home is wondering what exactly you might be favoring this year and how they should be positioning as the year unfolds a the reason why we had a good year last year is simply that we played the playbook the playbook is that when you re coming out of recessions cyclical stocks do well right because in recessions people sell anything that s economically sensitive and they hold on to things that they perceive as not economically sensitive so the spread between the cyclical stocks and the non cyclical stocks it s extreme and boy oh boy did it really get extreme so it was kind of a fat pitch to own financials and energy stocks in 2021 and so that worked the other thing that really worked is just listening to companies and follow earnings now just to be clear earnings growth doesn t drive stock prices it s surprises right a stock price embeds all future expectations so if companies are doing better than what is expected they go up so going into this year i think we re in an environment where central bank policy is willing to accept higher levels of inflation for faster growth that will lead to more wage growth now right now the fed is starting to pivot a little bit because real wages aren t going up so i think they re going to make a move to bring down inflation but i think we re moving into an environment where we re going to have higher growth at the expense of higher inflation and that s an environment where you want to own some value stocks again i m not saying throw away all your growth stocks to buy all value because i believe in technology long term but i do think that we ve come out of a decade of slow growth and we re moving into a faster growth environment and i think you want to own a few more value stocks and i don t think this year will be any different than last year q you sent us a list of some stocks that you really like alphabet microsoft and danaher could you walk us through why you like these picks in particular a our biggest overweights are financials reits and energy stocks the however of that is those stocks are red hot right now financials and energy have done really well this year so i think we re into an environment where you have to be careful going into earning season given how strong they ve been and so i m just a little bit wary of owning those stocks or buying those stocks right here and again those growth stocks haven t done as well microsoft google danaher they haven t done as well because they re not hot stocks right now and those companies are reporting very good earnings q you re bullish on microsoft you have it in both the international and the u s core fund curious what you think of this activision blizzard takeover this week and what does that signal to you a it s a sign that companies are flush with cash which oh by the way what s the roi on cash right now so i think it s going to be a i m no investment banker but i think it s going to be a big year for m a because companies have very strong balance sheets and they got a lot of cash on hand and they re going to be looking for bolt on acquisitions so to the extent that things are immediately accretive i think you re going to see companies jump at it and not a lot of people talk about that but i really think that the story is that corporate fundamentals are not getting the press they deserve i really do we talk about the fed a lot and geopolitical risk but i just don t think what s happening in corporate america gets enough positive press these were just the highlights click here to listen to the full podcast 2022 bloomberg l p
bloomberg bond traders who ve built careers on anticipating how federal reserve policy shifts will play out for short and long dated treasury yields are stumped with scant hope that next week s policy meeting will clear things up as expectations mounted for at least four fed rate increases this year short dated yields rose the most flattening the curve a typical pattern during monetary policy normalization periods the trend stalled when the central bank broke with tradition saying its balance sheet might start shrinking shortly after the first rate hike that s viewed as likely to steepen the curve bets on a narrowing gap between five and 30 year treasury yields have been winning since early 2021 after reaching a multi year high of 167 basis points in february it collapsed to below 50 basis points this month a level last seen during the market mayhem of march 2020 fed policy aimed at throttling inflation is manna for the flattener trade except to the extent that balance sheet management foists a bigger share of the supply of treasury notes and bonds onto private investors at lower prices and higher long term yields for steepening to really have legs it would take the fed relying more heavily on its balance sheet to convey monetary policy as opposed to the fed funds target rate said zachary griffiths strategist at wells fargo securities he predicts the curve will end the year flatter as the fed relies mostly on rate hikes to tighten financial conditions fed policy makers slated to conclude a two day meeting on wednesday are expected to signal they ll raise rates in march for the first time in more than three years and start shrinking the balance sheet soon after the primary mechanism for balance sheet reduction is curbing reinvestment of cash from existing holdings of treasuries as they mature the last time the fed undertook so called quantitative tightening or qt from 2017 to 2019 it had been raising rates for more than a year that s left bond market participants unsure what to expect interest rate futures are pricing in a peak of around 1 75 in the fed s policy rate but the forecast is vexed by uncertainty about the interplay between rate hikes and qt the implications for the yield curve have been complicated in the past week by speculation that the fed could kick off the hiking cycle with a half percentage point increase something it hasn t done in more than two decades wagers on that outcome didn t last long and a 25 basis point increase is heavily favored the yield differential between two and 10 year notes more sensitive to immediate fed policy shifts narrowed to around 75 basis points as two yield yields topped 1 for the first time during the pandemic the market is getting way ahead of itself in terms of pricing in hikes said peter yi director of short duration fixed income and head of credit research at northern trust asset management he expects the yield curve to keep flattening led by long dated yields declining as fed tightening curbs growth and inflation begins to moderate part of the rationale for starting qt sooner than in the past is the curve itself fed communications show the minutes of the most recent policy meeting in december revealed concern that a relatively flat yield curve posed financial stability risks to lenders and could be averted by relying more on balance sheet contraction than on rate hikes beyond the uncertainties about how the hiking cycle and balance sheet reduction will unfold this year yield curve calculations are muddled by the extraordinary conditions the fed is laboring under the central bank s balance sheet is approaching 9 trillion roughly double its size during the previous qt episode there s a chance the fed will eventually move beyond securities runoff to outright sales strategists at bmo capital markets say with inflation rates also at historic levels the prospect that the policy rate will need to rise more than expected and possibly exceed 3 to have an effect is a key threat to the curve flattening trend said don ellenberger senior portfolio manager at federated hermes which manages about 634 billion in assets this will be a tough year for investors ellenberger

alan fram associated press washington staring at midterm elections that could cost them control of congress democrats are trying to sculpt a 2022 legislative agenda that would generate achievements and reassure voters that they re addressing pocketbook problems and can govern competently last year president joe biden and congressional democrats notched two massive accomplishments a 1 9 trillion covid 19 relief bill and a 1 trillion infrastructure package yet also imprinted on voters minds are the months of democratic infighting over priorities that saw holdouts embarrass biden and party leaders by scuttling two top goals their roughly 2 trillion 10 year social and environment measure and voting rights legislation resurrecting the social and environment bill tops the 2022 wish list for house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y it s a risky endeavor because sen joe manchin d w va has already derailed the legislation once but biden has conceded he d accept a smaller package and democrats could still claim victory with a more modest version people want to see government work and expect us to help move things forward said rep suzan delbene d wash chair of the new democrat coalition a house centrist group she said voters will assess democrats agenda for the impact it has on their communities on their families that s going to be what people think about when they vote in november to achieve that democrats are looking to claim election year wins in a congress they steer with almost no votes to spare often against solid republican opposition they re also debating the value of crafting other popular bills and essentially daring gop lawmakers to defeat them producing fodder for campaign ads but reminding constituents of democrats 2021 failures other pelosi priorities include benefits for veterans who served near toxic burn pits in iraq and afghanistan that could cost hundreds of billions of dollars a measure addressing the computer chip shortage and other competitiveness issues and a bill combating russia s threatened invasion of ukraine with sanctions and other steps an early focus will be a 1 5 trillion bill financing government through september and perhaps providing further aid to cope with omicron the highly contagious covid 19 variant agency budgets run out feb 18 and bipartisan cooperation will be needed for a deal but revisiting the social and environment measure which initially contained popular programs to restrain prescription drug prices send monthly checks to families with children and curb global warming is seen as a political imperative by many democrats we have to put everything to the metal for the next six weeks to rewrite and pass that bill said rep pramila jayapal d wash who leads the congressional progressive caucus she said biden should issue executive orders easing pharmaceutical prices and student debt and house democrats should send popular bills to the senate where republican inflicted defeats would let people understand that democrats are fighting on these particular issues party leaders expect to renew talks on the social and environmental bill soon and hope to have a deal or be near one by biden s march 1 state of the union address biden has predicted big chunks of the original bill will be enacted including money for free pre kindergarten and over 500 billion for climate change efforts after months of talks pitting progressives against moderates democrats had squeezed a compromise social and environment bill through the house in november over gop opposition but in a 50 50 senate where democrats can afford no defectors manchin shot it down in december arguing it was too costly lawmakers have already begun positioning over the renewed effort underscoring how long and difficult such bargaining may be manchin said rather than resuming where negotiations left off we just start with a clean sheet of paper and start over no 3 house democratic leader james clyburn of south carolina wants the package to keep its aid for affordable housing and three northeastern democrats want retention of federal tax breaks for people from places like theirs with high state and local levies crafting an agenda that produces legislative success not just setups for failure to expose republican intransigence could be crucial for democrats in a year with political headwinds blowing against them in a poll released thursday by the associated press norc center for public affairs research biden hit a low for his year old presidency with more people disapproving than approving of his job performance 56 to 43 democracy seems under attack on every front the democratic trifecta can t get things across the finish line adam green cofounder of the progressive change campaign committee said of democratic control of the white house senate and house he said that s put many on the left in a funk and while the economy job creation and the stock market have been strong and covid 19 vaccines widely available concerns are widespread over inflation the persistent pandemic and russia s threat to ukraine all this in a year of midterm elections when lower turnout puts a premium on voting by each party s most ideological loyalists they re seeing things biden put political capital behind fail sean mcelwee cofounder of the liberal research group data for progress said of democratic voters they need to see things biden puts political capital behind succeed history bodes ill for democrats the party holding the white house has lost house seats in 17 of the 19 midterm elections since world war ii averaging 28 losses per election republicans would grab house control in november by gaining five seats this puts a premium on honing a forward looking legislative agenda i m not going to spend all my time talking about what didn t happen because we ve got three more years of biden s presidency said clyburn his term does not end tomorrow in one microcosm of democrats differences manchin has shown little enthusiasm for extending the enhanced child tax credit and its monthly checks for recipients dampening its prospects and prompting biden to express doubts about its survival but the credit is a top priority for many and schumer and others have promised to try retaining it this tax cut for families is just something we should go right back to said rep tim ryan d ohio who is running for senate and says democrats communicated their working class priorities poorly last year if we do these things boom boom boom boom we can start reclaiming the narrative house budget committee chairman john yarmuth d ky said democrats would benefit politically by rescuing the child tax credit because it s one of the few components of the social and economic bill voters would feel before november the irs could quickly resume the now expired monthly checks others say it s time to recalibrate when there s no path forward then you work on other things that will have very strong impact said democratic rep susan wild who represents a competitive pennsylvania district she said democrats should compromise with manchin and put omitted initiatives into separate bills such as capping insulin costs at 35 monthly if we can t get that pushed through on a bipartisan basis then something is truly wrong with our colleagues across the aisle wild said

roku s push into original content could someday put it on a similar footing with netflix netflix nflx 2 52 started as a mail order service for renting dvd movies but its pivot into streaming content was the big step that made the company the top content provider it is today history doesn t always repeat itself but it often rhymes roku roku 1 60 has built a reputation for its streaming dongles and tv software however it s in the early stages of pivoting from being a neutral streaming platform to becoming its own source of original content it s currently just one tenth of netflix s size but here s why roku could someday grow up to be as big making a clear push into original programming media streaming is all about gaining and keeping the attention of your users for netflix it s been an original content story since it moved into streaming slowly transitioning from licensing other people s content to replacing more and more of its catalog with its own productions roku began as a neutral platform for streaming its dongles would convert tvs into smart tvs and it partners with tv oems to put its operating software on them to make them streaming capable out of the box roku has steadily built up its user base over time growing from 16 7 million active accounts in the third quarter of 2017 its first quarter as a public company to 56 4 million accounts in q3 2021 its most recent quarter but roku decided that at some point it needs to be more than just a means for watching netflix or hulu it s been steadily investing in its own original programming this effort started with launching the roku channel an ad supported free streaming service built within the roku platform the early content was licensed but roku has now begun bolstering it with original programming the company bought content from failed streaming service quibi and is now producing shows and movies and recently signed a massive 240 000 square foot building lease in new york city for content production purposes roku had to wait until the right time to attempt this if it were to try this too soon and alienate existing streaming platforms they might leave roku hurting roku s appeal to users however roku s skirmishes with companies like at t and alphabet over contract negotiations have shown that it s become large enough to have leverage via its user base and the time was right to evolve in other words roku has started thinking these streaming companies need me so i m not too worried anymore about stepping on their toes different approaches to generating revenue i ll repeat it streaming is about maintaining engagement on the platform but monetizing those streaming eyeballs can be done in different ways netflix has always been ad free charging its viewers for the right to access the platform roku is taking a different approach becoming an advertising business underneath its streaming service in other words rather than generating revenue from consumer pockets roku is tapping advertisers a recent pixelate report estimated that a whopping 45 of ads on connected tv devices that support video streaming went to roku devices in the first half of 2021 the report also stated that ad spending grew 50 year over year so roku is capturing a large chunk of this revenue pie that keeps getting bigger the company s average revenue per user arpu grew 49 year over year to 40 10 in q3 2021 and the arpu expansion is roku s primary revenue growth driver a company like netflix that charges the consumer must now be conscious of competing streaming platforms and growth is more reliant on user growth i think that roku s ad tech business is a stronger model because it seems more consumer friendly to give users a free product like the roku channel with targeted ads versus charging them monthly fees is roku a buy today roku s user growth has been affected by the global supply chain issues along with a marketwide sell off of technology and growth stocks and roku s fallen a long way from its previous highs however it s given investors a much more attractive valuation on the stock the price to sales ratio has come down from more than 30 to less than 10 about on par with its pre pandemic valuation meanwhile the company is arguably much stronger today revenue continues chugging higher while the business is becoming increasingly free cash flow positive analysts are looking for 35 year over year revenue growth in the 2022 fiscal year which works out to nearly 3 8 billion with the stock s valuation at these affordable levels i think investors could reasonably expect it to appreciate at a similar rate to how the business grows making roku a compelling investment idea

as he enters his second year in office the president should provide fresh motivation for his administration which badly needs some with an approval rating languishing in the same depths as that of his predecessor the president is facing a difficult period according to his many critics joe biden must change everything from a to z if he wants to avoid an electoral rout if you judge by his press conference wednesday there will be no radical change of direction in any case there are deep reasons for biden s political difficulties and it would be unrealistic to bet on a rapid fix a mixed bag biden has major achievements to his credit the recovery plan he adopted when he took office has had a significant positive impact which will extend beyond the short term economic growth jobs and the financial markets are showing solid results the covid 19 vaccination campaign has been a success although it was hampered by republican resistance massive investment in infrastructure is a colossal success something which his predecessor lamentably failed to achieve there are a few shadows hanging over the picture a politically disastrous withdrawal from afghanistan inflation that is affecting everyone a tenacious and capricious pandemic the persistence of undocumented immigration and an upsurge of urban violence a little realism some criticize biden for projecting weakness fueled by incessant personal attacks from his opponents and amplified by media fond of this sort of shallow thinking biden s apparent inability to rally his party behind a principal legislative plan does nothing to counter this kind of image breaking this deadlock may allow him to pass in whole or in part his massive plan for social and environmental intervention but neither his recent actions nor his declarations yesterday allow one to predict with confidence that he will do so even if biden can push his plan through congress nothing guarantees that it will make a major difference in the approval ratings or at the ballot box biden has more to gain from a significant improvement in the two problems that preoccupy voters above all the pandemic and inflation and these challenges depend only in part on what the white house does getting back on track when asked what he intends to do differently during his second year the president promised to better defend his achievements and to be more in touch with and engage more deeply in his party s election campaigns doing these things will not really help him if inflation and the pandemic persist to get back on track politically biden will obviously have to make sure that his messages get across and that voters understand and remember what his administration has succeeded in accomplishing but his fate will depend above all on the objective conditions that affect everyone and he will thus have to enact the proper policies and hope on his lucky stars that inflation and the pandemic don t continue through november the other thing that is needed to ensure his presidency is a political success is making sure voters remember that even if his performance and his party s performance are far from perfect the republicans offer no concrete alternative as they sink further into trumpism generally midterm elections are a referendum on the president s performance if that holds true this year the democrats will have a very hard time getting back on track fortunately for them the semi retired resident of mar a lago can t resist hogging political center stage if voters perceive the election as a choice between donald trump and biden it could rekindle chances for a democratic comeback

high inflation of 2021 especially in the united states where the year on year increase in consumer prices reached a four decade high of 7 in december should prompt the same question inflation is not nearly as bad as a financial crisis particularly when price increases coincide with a rapid improvement in the economy and whereas financial crises may be inherently unpredictable forecasting inflation is a staple of macroeconomic modelling why then did almost everyone get the us inflation story so wrong last year a survey of 36 private sector forecasters in may revealed a median inflation forecast of 2 3 for 2021 measured by the core personal consumption expenditures price index the us federal reserve s de facto target gauge as a whole the group put a 0 5 chance on inflation exceeding 4 last year but by the core pce measure it looks set to be 4 5 the fed s rate setting federal open market committee fared no better with none of its 18 members expecting inflation above 2 5 in 2021 financial markets appear to have missed this one as well with bond prices yielding similar predictions ditto the international monetary fund the congressional budget office president joe biden s administration and even many conservative economists some of this collective error resulted from developments that forecasters did not or could not expect fed chair jerome powell among many others blamed the delta variant of the coronavirus for slowing the reopening of the economy and thus driving inflation higher but powell and others had earlier argued that the increase in inflation in the spring of 2021 was spurred by an overly rapid reopening as vaccination reduced case numbers it is unlikely that both of these excuses are correct the emergence of delta like the pandemic in 2020 probably kept inflation lower than it otherwise would have been supply chain disruptions were another unanticipated development that allegedly blew up inflation forecasts but while the pandemic has caused some genuine bottlenecks in production networks most are churning out much more than last year with both us and global manufacturing output and shipping up sharply this brings us to a more important source of forecasting error not taking our economic models seriously enough forecasts based on extrapolation from the recent past are nearly always as good as or better than those based on more sophisticated modelling the exception is when there are economic inputs that are well outside the realm of recent experience for example the extraordinary 2 5tn in fiscal support for the us economy in 2021 amounting to 11 of gdp was far larger than any previous fiscal package since world war ii a simple fiscal multiplier model would have predicted that average output in the last three quarters of 2021 would be 2 5 above pre pandemic estimates of potential to think that a stimulus of this magnitude would not cause inflation required believing either that such a huge adjustment was possible within a matter of months or that fiscal policy is ineffective and does not increase aggregate demand both views are implausible economic models also gave us substantial reason to believe that several factors would reduce the us economy s potential in 2021 these included premature deaths reduced immigration foregone capital investment the costs of hardening the economy to covid 19 pandemic induced exits from the workforce and all of the difficulties of rapidly reassembling an economy that had been torn apart such constraints made it very likely that additional demand would push inflation even higher a final set of errors arose because our models were missing key inputs or interpretations to the degree that people relied on economic models they often used a phillips curve to predict inflation or changes in inflation based on the unemployment rate but these frameworks had difficulty reckoning with the fact that the natural rate of unemployment likely rose at least temporarily as a result of the covid 19 crisis more important unemployment is not the only way to measure economic slack estimates from before the pandemic show that the quit rate and the ratio of unemployed workers to job openings are better predictors of wage and price inflation these other indicators of slack were already tight at the beginning of 2021 and were very tight by the spring in retrospect the mental model i find most useful for thinking about 2021 is to apply fiscal multipliers to nominal gdp use them to predict how much of the fiscal stimulus will be spent and then try to predict real gdp by understanding what the economy s productive capacity is the difference between the two is inflation multipliers indicated that total spending in 2021 would go up a lot while production constraints suggested that output would not increase by as much the difference was unexpectedly higher inflation where does this leave us in understanding inflation in 2022 instead of making inertial forecasts that the future will resemble the past taking our models seriously means accounting for high levels of demand continued supply constraints and ever tighter labour markets with rapidly rising nominal wages and higher inflation expectations some types of inflation notably in goods prices are likely to decline this year but others including services inflation will likely increase i therefore expect another year of significant us inflation maybe not as high as in 2021 but plausibly in the 3 4 range but the most important forecasting lesson from last year is humility we

misrepresented the safety profile and efficacy for gardasil from the beginning says attorney nicole maldonado the company told doctors that women who don t receive the vaccine will go on to develop cancer even though there isn t a single study that proves gardasil prevents cancer they shamefully played on people s fears to increase profits skylee butler was 13 years old when she received the gardasil vaccine at the time she had straight a s and sat on the student council of her middle school she was a typical teenager who loved to read listen to music browse the internet and spend time with friends skylee s mother crystal butler consented to allow her daughter to receive the vaccine because she saw marketing from merck that maintained gardasil is very safe that gardasil prevents cancer and that teenagers must get the gardasil vaccine within a few weeks of receiving gardasil skylee experienced back pain going up and down her spine because her pain never subsided her mother took her to see her doctor while x rays showed no signs of any abnormalities skylee s doctor recommended physical therapy skylee s health continued to decline over the following weeks she started experiencing headaches dizziness pain all over her body vision problems and fatigue around this time she was referred to a rheumatologist that diagnosed her with chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs her symptoms soon began to affect her schoolwork skylee found it very difficult to read and developed sensitivity to light prompting her to wear sunglasses in classrooms her teachers would accommodate her by having her take exams in the classroom storage closets as they were the darkest areas around skylee s headaches made focusing in class incredibly difficult in january of 2014 skylee was rushed to the emergency room after experiencing abdominal and chest pain while there she had a seizure the doctors checked her heart through electrocardiography ekg and the results were normal by march of 2014

go for a bike ride i dream about feeling normal gardasil lawsuit allegations against mercklawsuits against merck include the following causes of action 1 negligence2 breach of implied warranty failure to warn 3 breach of implied warranty manufacturing defect 4 breach of express warranty5 common law fraudmerck has a long history of bringing controversial products to market including fosamax a purported bone density drug that caused bone fractures and nuvaring a birth control device associated with life threatening blood clots and death merck s most infamous drug is vioxx a pain medication the company had to pull from the market due to cardiovascular risks tens of thousands of patients filed lawsuits against merck alleging they suffered heart attacks and other cardiovascular injuries as a result of ingesting the medication the litigation revealed that merck knew early on that vioxx was linked to fatal cardiovascular adverse events but intentionally chose to conceal the risks from the public and medical community lawsuits accused merck of orchestrating a scheme to downplay the severity of the risks misrepresenting the results of its clinical trials failing to undertake the clinical trials that would reveal risks and blacklisting medical professionals who dared to publicly criticize the safety of vioxx merck paid nearly 5 billion to settle the tens of thousands of vioxx personal injury actions and an additional 1 billion to settle a securities class action the company was also forced to pay 950 million in civil and criminal fines to the department of justice and other governmental entities as a result of various criminal activities merck had engaged in with respect to vioxx attorneys in the gardasil litigation allege merck has engaged in similar corporate malfeasance with its hpv vaccine according to merck s marketing gardasil provides lifetime immunity to cervical and other hpv associated cancers plaintiffs in the gardasil litigation however say merck s marketing claim that gardasil prevents cancer not to mention lifetime immunity is unproven the allegations state that gardasil may actually be more likely to cause cancer in those previously exposed to hpv than prevent it lawsuits allege that merck knows and actively conceals the fact that gardasil can cause a constellation of serious adverse reactions and side effects including autoimmune diseases and death in some recipients according to the complaints gardasil contains numerous hazardous ingredients including at least one ingredient that merck failed to disclose to regulators and the public studies have shown that one of gardasil s ingredients amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate aahs binds to non vaccine proteins triggering autoimmune disorders and other serious conditions plaintiffs say merck in designing and conducting its clinical trials for gardasil concealed the risks to falsely enhance the vaccine s safety profile just as the company did years prior with vioxx in order to obtain its gardasil license merck designed its clinical trial studies to purposefully conceal evidence of chronic conditions such as autoimmune diseases while exaggerating the vaccine s purported efficacy the lawsuits allege this wholesale fraud and dishonesty in the clinical tests led many physicians to recommend the vaccination under false assumptions attorneys say by december 2019 gardasil had more reported adverse events than any other vaccine the u s food and drug administration s fda vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers had received more than 64 000 hpv vaccine adverse event reports by that time it s not surprising then that the vaccine injury compensation program vicp has paid out millions of dollars in damages for injuries and deaths as a result of merck s fraud gardasil is wreaking havoc on a substantial swath of an entire generation of children and young adults on a worldwide scale the gardasil lawsuits allege about baum hedlund aristei goldmanthe

political scientist and philip wasielewski a former cia paramilitary officer in a january 13 analysis for the center for strategic and international studies but can this be done getting serious about sanctions if they actually do what they re capable of doing with the forces amassed on the border it is going to be a disaster for russia if they further invade ukraine president biden warned thursday if any russian military forces move across the ukrainian border that s a renewed invasion and it will be met with a swift severe and united response from the united states and our allies us president joe biden speaks about russia and ukraine on january 20 2022 picture saul loeb afp he wasn t able to define what that response would be while it s unclear what new sanctions the us might unleash early reports suggest they may target russia s financial system including its biggest banks and ability to convert roubles into dollars says university of notre dame director of policy studies david cortright such sanctions would be meant to punish russia s economy putin allies and the country s wealthier residents but putin may believe based on experience that this is a hollow threat in terms of their impact on the global economy tough financial sanctions on russia could well be the largest use of sanctions since the united states targeted japanese finance and oil imports before world war ii says assistant professor chris miller of the american enterprise institute this is why russia may think the united states is bluffing when it threatens dramatic sanctions the kremlin believes it has a far higher tolerance for risk than its american or european counterparts russian stock markets have barely budged despite the growing array of economic threats the markets collective shrug mirrors the kremlin s view that the united states will not follow through on the harsh sanctions it has discussed miller says russian policymakers know that many of the tactics that could seriously hurt russia such as curbing russian commodity exports or black listing russian banks would be costly to the west too it s just business russia is the european union s fifth largest trading partner the eu is russia s biggest the us barely registers on russia s accounts book put simply moscow can merely source the stuff banned by the us elsewhere moscow s extensive commercial ties with states in the eu would allow it to mitigate the impacts of sanctions that do not have full european support and co operation cortright argues russia supplies europe with much of its natural gas assuring access to trade and revenues regardless of us measures recent sanctions efforts have not been successful they ve been imposed in retaliation for global cyber attacks the military seizure of the crimean state of crimean and ongoing support for pro russian rebels in the crimean state of donbas but the west has rarely had a unified response and such divisions have again emerged in talks among european union and nato states germany and france are resisting a european union effort to specify which sanctions they d impose if putin in fact invades ukraine miller says and that s what president putin expected russia s foreign minister sergey lavrov has called the idea of withdrawing troops from the ukraine border absurd this handout video grab released on january 20 2022 by belarus defence ministry shows russian infantry fighting vehicles upon their arrival for the joint drills in belarus picture ministry of defence republic of belarus afp russian leaders certainly perceive biden as weak distracted by america s internal political schisms and the need to outline a coherent approach to its competition with china says australian national university defence studies fellow matthew sussex second russia s brinkmanship also helps reveal potential fault lines among nato members this is intended to wheedle out those who are more risk averse like germany from those such as poland who see russia as a clear threat to their territorial integrity divided we fall he s never seen sanctions like the ones i promised will be imposed if he moves president biden warned recently that includes severing moscow from all us financial institutions and anything that involves dollar denominations white house officials have suggested isolating moscow from the society for worldwide interbank financial telecommunication swift such a move would severely affect its ability to trade in international currencies but it needs european union support and that s yet to emerge but as the attempts to appease adolf hitler in the 1930s show doing nothing comes with its own cost moscow may interpret that as tacit approval to seize other former soviet union states such as latvia lithuania and estonia and it s always coveted the access to the baltic sea offered by finland and sweden but latvia lithuania and estonia felt compelled to join nato because of russia s coercive tactics sweden and finland are nurturing stronger ties though they are yet to sign on the dotted line the rest of europe however is does not feel as threatened it s very important that we keep everyone in nato on the same page president biden said thursday that s what i m spending a lot of time doing and there are differences there are differences in nato as to what countries are willing to do depending on what happens us president joe biden and russian president vladimir putin picture mandel ngan and mikhail metzel various sources afp that candid admission was music to putin s ears it left ukrainian officials aghast it s precisely the kind of division moscow is expert at exploiting an anonymous white house official later told us reporters that nato members did not have the same list of sanctions targets but insisted any response would remain highly unified and provide a force multiplier to actions we take market forces unleashed russia seized crimea and occupied part of ukraine s donbas region in 2014 the us and europe retaliated by imposing sanctions on selected russian firms the international monetary fund imf estimates this cut some 1 5 per cent out of russia s annual gdp the kremlin concluded this was a fair price to pay for crimea and the donbas and has no plans to give either territory back no matter how long these sanctions remain in place miller says if the kremlin thought one per cent of its own gdp was a fair price for crimea and the donbas it would surely be willing to pay more to acquire the rest of the country there are other sanctions weapons in washington s arsenal such as black listing moscow s banks there s no doubt the united states could obliterate russia s connections with the global financial system us officials have discussed black listing major russian banks preventing banks from converting roubles into dollars and disconnecting russia from the swift interbank communication network but implementing any of these measures would be costly to allies in europe it would also directly affect china the largest consumer of russian commodities if beijing chooses to oppose washington s directives as it has indicated it will it could result in a global trade war it s a similar problem if the us severs its supply of semiconductors smartphones and other advanced technology smartphones are mostly produced in china for example so any export controls on smartphone components would work only if china were willing to enforce them beijing could buck us sanctions and dare washington to retaliate which would open a second front in a great power financial war alternate actions president biden promised that acts of russian aggression would be met with a decisive reciprocal and united response it doesn t have to be monetary it could be a price in blood retired nato commander in europe general philip breedlove says the us has no compulsion to send troops into ukraine instead washington and nato should help ukraine defend itself those are things we should be considering as an alliance and as a nation he said if mr putin is allowed to invade ukraine and there were to be little or no consequence we will see more of the same such support is emerging the uk and us have this week been rushing hundreds of thousands of javelin antitank missiles to ukraine anti aircraft missiles are also among the mix on thursday washington declared it would give kiev another us200 million in military aid that s on top of the us2 5 billion supplied since russia seized the ukrainian state of crimea in 2014 president biden is aware of the option the cost of going into ukraine in terms of physical loss of life for the russians they ll be able to prevail over time but it s going to be heavy he told media on thursday it s going to be real it s going to be consequential putin has a stark choice either de escalation or diplomacy confrontation and consequences fight or flight response the western allies are sending dangerously contradictory messages about their willingness to impose anything beyond a financial slap on the wrist warns miller he says that repeated targeted sanctions against russia s powerful oligarchs won t cut it russia s business elite would prefer to continue travelling to the west and keep their foreign bank accounts but they don t decide russia s foreign policy putin does with advice from a small circle of security service chiefs most of whom are already under sanction cortright argues big stick sanctions may not be the answer but perhaps the carrot of lifting them may be the offer to lift sanctions can be an effective bargaining chip for persuading the targeted regime to alter its policies he says in an increasingly globalised world economy unilateral sanctions face huge obstacles even when imposed by the world s largest economy whatever the case president biden s sanctions threat isn t likely to have much effect without international support this is not all just a cakewalk for russia president biden said they ll pay a stiff price immediately near term medium term and long term if they do it the problem is how if biden is serious about using sanctions to shape russia s calculus his administration needs to sharpen its messaging says miller the administration should name the russian banks it would blacklist the specific transactions it would prohibit and the companies that would be in danger of going under then the kremlin might start taking its sanctions threats more seriously but putin believes the dollar speaks louder than principles in washington just as it does in moscow if diplomacy fails the us and its nato partners will need to do more than rely on cycles of sanctions and dialogue to counter russia says sussex more importantly if they really do seek to uphold the principles they espouse they may find they can speak louder with actions than with words jamie seidel is a freelance writer jamieseidel

the drought of 2021 has not had a significant effect on north dakota s deep aquifers said the state s department of water resources director of water appropriation although some shallow aquifers that are used for watering livestock were drawn down during the drought the deep aquifers that are used for irrigation and other uses such as municipal water were not chris bader said the shallow wells used for stock water didn t have a large supply of water to begin with and are first to show the effects of drought he said deep aquifers however are more resilient and the water level in those typically don t drop during the first year of a drought north dakota s water management plan is focused on long term protection of the supply so it is conservative in its approach to approving irrigation permits bader said from the beginning north dakota laws were implemented to protect the state s water supply there are 2 270 water permits in north dakota including conditionally approved perfected and those held in abeyance advertisement conditionally approved permits are ones that have fulfilled administrative criteria undergone hydrological review and have been approved to begin applying water for beneficial use according to the north dakota department of water resources the permit holder has until a specified date to develop the project and can request an extension to put water to beneficial use perfected permits meanwhile are those in which the water was appropriated under a conditional use permit and have been inspected by the natural resource department to verify the permit conditions have been met applicants of permits held in abeyance have met administrative criteria undergone hydrologic review and been partially approved to begin applying water but the remaining are temporarily suspended typically portions are held in abeyance while the approved portion of the permit is being developed additional hydrological data is being collected or there is concern about the sustainability of the water source according to the north dakota department of water resources besides the 2 270 water permits in north dakota there are 186 applications for permits bader said fifty three of the permit applications were made this year which is nearly double the number of 2019 and 2020 combined interest in irrigation ebbs and flows typically increasing during drought years said tom scherer north dakota state university extension specialist department of biosystems and engineering when i first got here in 1991 there was quite a bit of interest because we had just got through the dry period of the late 1980s scherer said interest in irrigation was piqued then because companies such as simplot which had seen its potato supply shrink during the drought in the late 1980s wanted their growers to ensure they had a stable supply of water the north dakota department of water resources continuously monitors aquifer levels and in the event of a long term drought like the one in the 1930s would take steps to maintain them bader said advertisement if aquifers show signs of stress the department of water resources would first shut down junior applicators or those who have the newest water permits he said

chaudhrymali88 washington urdupoint pakistan point news 23rd jan 2022 capitol hill has begun to debate whether to ban us lawmakers from trading stocks but despite some rare bi partisan unity on the question it is far from settled legislation introduced earlier this month by democratic senators jon ossoff of georgia and mark kelly of arizona would require members of congress their spouses and dependent children to place their investments in a blind trust members of congress should not be playing the stock market while we make federal policy and have extraordinary access to confidential information ossoff said republicans are also active on the issue with senator josh hawley of missouri introducing similar legislation to ossoff and kelly s and house minority leader kevin mccarthy saying he could push for a ban on stock trading if the republicans take control in the november 2022 midterm elections i think any member of congress who actively trades stock is crazy republican senator marco rubio of florida told afp let s say the price of that stock skyrockets people are going to suspect you have insider information potential conflict of interest under the stock act which took effect in 2012 lawmakers are required to publicly report transactions within 45 days but critics say the law is neither adequately policed nor sufficient for addressing the obvious problem of conflict of interest the current problem is that the law is not enforced and it s not enough said kedric payne general counsel for the campaign legal center an ngo you see time and time again that members of congress don t even disclose their stock trades on time but even when members disclose their stock trades we still see conflicts of interest with their transactions the financial news website business insider found that 54 members of congress and 182 congressional staff members had violated the stock act with members of both parties failing to report transactions in early 2020 four us senators came under scrutiny for selling stock just before the market plunged as much of the us economy shuttered due to covid 19 the justice department ultimately closed an investigation without charging lawmakers the issue also surfaced in recent months at the federal reserve where two regional presidents and a fed vice chair resigned or departed earlier than planned following revelations over financial trades as they helped set monetary policy a september investigation by the wall street journal showed that 130 federal judges violated us law and judicial ethics by overseeing court cases involving companies in which they or a family member owned stock the fed has announced stricter investment rules following the revelations while the supreme court has promised to bolster judicial ethics opposed to a ban but the outlook for a proposed ban on capitol hill looks murky due to opposition from powerful figures including house speaker nancy pelosi who has made known her personal opposition to a ban on stock trades we are a free market economy they should be able to participate in that pelosi said at a recent press conference at which she called for better enforcement of existing rules but pelosi who has noted that the justice department can prosecute members of congress for insider trading under existing law has said in recent days she is open to a ban if it is supported by the democratic caucus while pelosi herself has avoided trading stocks her husband has been an active investor the pelosis in 2021 invested some 19 million in technology companies such as microsoft alphabet and nvidia according to the website capital trades while the outlook for a ban looks uncertain washington insiders think the odds could improve suddenly if the issue emerges as a major focus of the november campaign a poll released earlier this month by the conservative convention of states action found that 76 percent of voters say members should not trade stocks while serving in washington

wages in the hospitality and leisure industry rose an average 14 last year making it the only sector where pay increases outpaced inflation matt mcclain washington post ty stehlik who works the front desk at a hotel in milwaukee pleaded for a raise all through the pandemic and finally got an extra 1 an hour in the fall to make 15 but higher prices for rent and food have completely negated that 7 bump stehlik who identifies as nonbinary says they re still relying on family for help covering rent and groceries that raise meant nothing said stehlik 23 whose roommate also works at the same hotel i ve got student loans my roommate s got medical debt most of my co workers work two or three jobs and they re still having difficulty making ends meet after years of barely budging wage growth is finally at its highest level in decades a global pandemic combined with swift government stimulus and unexpected labor shortages have put workers in the drivers seat giving them the kind of negotiating power they d never imagined but in an unexpected twist the same strong economic recovery that is emboldening workers is also driving up inflation leaving most americans with less spending power than they had a year ago although average hourly wages rose 4 7 last year overall wages fell 2 4 on average for all workers when adjusted for inflation according to the labor department the only sector where pay increases outpaced inflation last year was in the leisure and hospitality industry where workers generally make the lowest hourly wages of any sector workers there saw a 14 average raise from about 17 an hour to more than 19 50 according to an analysis of labor department data in interviews with more than a dozen workers many said that despite considerable pay raises as much as 33 in some cases they were still struggling to cover basic expenses several workers said they had taken second jobs to keep up with rising costs for groceries gas and rent and many said their budgets will be even more strained once student loan payments resume in may devon norris works as a culinary arts high school teacher and in the months since the pandemic began his annual salary has increased by more than 20 to 47 500 norris says it s still next to impossible to find an apartment in jacksonville fla that he can afford on his own his basic expenses food gas utilities car insurance have all ballooned in the past year he pays 950 in monthly rent for a 2 bedroom house but he has been asked to move out so his landlord can sell the house comparable rentals in the area he says easily cost double what he was paying norris a former restaurant manager has begun taking extra part time jobs at restaurants to make ends meet i make the most money i ve ever made but i m still broke and struggling he says i never saw myself being 37 and needing a roommate inflation rose 7 last year to its highest level in four decades as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages collided with growing demand from u s consumers gas prices are up 50 from a year ago while the price of meat fish and eggs is up nearly 13 according to the u s consumer price index but inflation and wage growth can become intertwined most economists consider this round of wage growth a natural result of the strong economic recovery as well as competition for workers but some worry the cycle of high inflation and demand for higher wages can become self reinforcing as they were during the late 1970s and early 1980s if consumers and businesses start expecting inflation to continue for a long time each side will keep trying to outbid the other businesses by charging higher prices and workers by asking for higher pay fueling yet more inflation federal reserve chair jerome powell said last week that he is not yet seeing evidence of such a wage price spiral but that the fed is watching these trends closely as it prepares to combat inflation with interest rate rises this year and more critically the big question is whether overall wage growth amounted to a one time increase or the start of a period of more sustained wage growth particularly for the economy s lowest paid workers the question is how much of a deceleration will we see in wage growth this year said nick bunker an economist at indeed hiring lab a lot of those very strong gains were driven by the reopening a surge of demand following the rollout of vaccines last spring and households strong balance sheets but the outlook for 2022 is very unclear while the lowest earning workers have seen the fastest wage growth in recent years partly the result of cities states and major employers raising their minimum wages economists say that dynamic could change this year wages are beginning to tick up in white collar industries that rely heavily on foreign workers and are struggling to recruit enough employees given the slowdown in immigration during the pandemic according to nela richardson chief economist for payroll software provider adp a recent report by the conference board found that u s businesses plan to raise wages by an average 3 9 this year the fastest rate since 2008 with higher pay for new hires and inflation being cited as the main reasons behind those hikes where we re starting to see wage pressures now is in professional business services finance and information technology where the talent war is strong and growing she said adding that wages are growing fastest in the northeast and along the west coast where finance and tech workers tend to be concentrated those workers she said are also more likely to receive noncash compensation like restricted stock or stock options which have benefited from the stock market boom in forest city pa the helmet factory where jennifer matarese works recently raised wages from about 14 an hour to 20 to keep up with other warehouses in the area we worked for two years through this pandemic but they only gave out pay raises once they realized oh no everyone is going to leave if we don t give them more money said matarese 44 who also works part time at a dog camp and is using the extra money to pay down credit card debt she s amassed during the pandemic it s really hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel nicole chociej a graphic designer in west virginia makes 7 more than she did before the pandemic but her costs have gone up too she s spending 100 more on groceries each month and an extra 25 to fill up her tank every week the mortgage on the home she shares with her husband near steubenville ohio has also ticked up thanks to higher insurance costs our house payment insurance food gas all of those things have gone up by at least 7 the 45 year old said i m in a situation where i m able to survive but there s no extra money for vacations or to spend on our nieces and nephews to offset soaring meat costs she and her extended family are planning to pool their money to buy an entire cow to keep them from buying meat at the grocery for months it s going to cost us 1 200 to 1 800 for the cow plus we ve got to buy a freezer she said but that s the kind of thing we re having to do to save a couple of pennies here and there

bruce chadwick lectures on history and film at rutgers university in new jersey he also teaches writing at new jersey city university he holds his phd from rutgers and was a former editor for the new york daily news some of the fun of seeing plays about the past that are part of the annual summer fringe festival in new york is that you can literally chase history over the sidewalks of the city fringe fans use the festival program and city maps to see whichof the 197 plays they can see almost back to back sometimes if the play and subway times match you can see three plays in one day i picked two history dramas in the cooper square area of the city five blocks apart and caught one hour long play at noon and a ninety minute play at 2 the trick move fast chagrin lamama theater 74a e fourth street new york n y you remember the child geniuses they were the ten and eleven year old kids with extraordinary mental powers that the media loved they read the novels of hemingway at four were piano prodigies at eight invented things at twelve and went to college at fifteen you read about them in newspapers and magazines and saw them on television everybody was startled by their mental powers and fearful that they could never lead a normal life pablo picasso painted his first portrait at eight jeremy bentham was a freshman at oxford at twelve ludwig van beethoven was a famous composer at fifteen blaise pascal wrote his first math theorem in 1633 at eleven and bobby fischer won his first u s chess championship at fourteen we saw them and forgot about them whatever happened to all those geniuses anyway chagrin by michael ross albert a fringe festival play that opened last weekend is the story of four of them and how their skyrocketing iqs did not do much for them later in life a generation ago the four kids all from chagrin falls ohio were the stars of a television show about gifted kids they became nationally famous and a quartet of history s darlings now some fifteen years later they are back in town for a re union television show and trading stories they are not pretty the four all have problems they arrive to learn that their leader boy genius seymour heath carr has been hospitalized they go to see him and he complains that he has written them letters over the years that they did not answer francis played by suzy kimball has become a little strange as she aged evie melissa rosenberger has had an on again off again relationship with another genius asher marco agnolucci and asher himself seems pretty lonely they trade insults crush hopes and dreams and learn a secret at the end of the play that startles all chagrin is a good start towards a solid play but it is rather incomplete as an example the re union television show the point of the drama is forgotten the play just ends without it there is little in the play about the lives of the geniuses when they were apart what happens to people that smart there is nothing in the play to indicate how the young peoples parents must have prodded and pushed them how the media made stars of them or how other kids hatred or loved them we are given the four in a bit of a vacuum you cry out for more albert has written a decent play and adam levi held it together as the director but it seems more of an outline or first draft than the finished product production produced by outside inside in partnership with hubo productions costumes lara de bruijn sets and lighting brandon stock directed by adam levi when chagrin concluded we ran down the street to catch a one man show about one of history s most publicized mass murderers jeffrey dahmer jeffrey dahmer live bowery poetry club 308 bowery street new york n y the stage at the bowery poetry club in new york is pitch black except for a small video screen suddenly very quietly a tall stocky man dressed in a bright orange prison jumpsuit walks out introduces himself as serial killer jeffrey dahmer and begins to sing a grisly song titled i am sick oh he is everybody remembers dahmer the deranged wisconsin serial killer who slew seventeen people from 1978 1991 dismembered their bodies and ate some for lunch and dinner they tasted like filet mignon he says in the play dahmer became one of the most famous serial killer of all time and had his life and crimes chronicled in movies books news articles and television documentaries in jeffrey dahmer live a fringe festival one man show that opened last weekend playwright avner kam who also plays dahmer tries to understand what motivated the milwaukee madman an alcoholic most of his life in his gruesome and murderous career kam a large frightening man with short gray hair tells you a lot about dahmer s life and abnormal desires but can never quite explain why he murdered so many people he talks about dahmer s different homes his life with his grandmother his jobs his time in the u s army honorable discharge by the way his relatives and his friends he relates astoundingly how the police continually let him slip through their fingers as he continued his string of macabre murders like all serial killers dahmer just can t explain why he did it again and again and again kam uses some really silly songs to try to do this and they all fail and fail badly the videos are a bit grainy sometimes his descriptive stories are flat and sometimes they don t illustrate the story at all he does not set dahmer in his historical context living in the age of other historic serial killers such as ted bundy john wayne gacy and juan corona and yet there is something very personal and absolutely haunting riveting about kam as dahmer as he goes on and on for ninety minutes you grow more and more comfortable with him in front of you and yet at the same time terrified he achieves that traditional and always surprising quietness of the killer murderers in real life are not the ugly two headed hyenas depicted in film and on television they are ordinary people with twisted minds and overly violent tempers this why it has always been difficult for historians as well as the police to come to grips with them kam captures that and he does it slowly year by year and body by body there is a hollowness to his tale because dahmer like most serial killers is a psychotic who does not feel remorse for what he does kam tells the story in gripping detail and adds some wonderful bits of humor such as his efforts to find a book on cannibalism in the self help section of the bookstore there is chilling detail too such as kam s lengthy cold incredibly detailed description of his first murder told as if he was looking through a window at someone else committing the crime and there is the irony no matter where he went no one ever quite connected him with the disappearances of people in the end the police arrested him by accident you never feel sorry for dahmer but you do feel frustrated that for hundreds of years law enforcement science and medicine have been unable to understand and detect serial killers before they strike and of course as the drama unwinds you feel badly for the victims and their families the audience cheered lustily for kam at the performance i attended the play gets to you within ten minutes or so and you can t pull yourself away from it this is because the story itself is intriguing americans are fascinated by murderers and kam manages to stitch together dahmer s personality even if he does not look like him a big plus are news clips of dahmer during investigations and trials at the end of the show there is a clip of a woman whose brother has been murdered by dahmer she confronts him in the courtroom and howls at him losing all self control it is jarring you may not totally understand jeffrey dahmer after sitting through this one show but you will gain a new perspective about him and actor kam will scare you to death production music peter fish lighting and videos brad peterson directed by jonathan warman oh actor s kam s last one man play cowboy star roy rogers how s that for an historical pair bruce chadwick can be reached at bchadwick njcu edu

in the previous column i tried to highlight a propensity apathy that has pervaded the pakistani society to the very core i underlined four facets physical instinctual intellectual moral and aesthetic which constitute the human personality of an individual as well as that of a collective complex intersections of these facets not only lay the foundation of a human civilisation they are also vital instruments in the evolution of the society my observation is that the pakistani society is stuck with physical instinctual facet i tried to discuss three of these facets in the previous column in this piece i will start by underscoring the importance of aesthetics with respect to its appreciation or disregard by our society aesthetics is a branch of philosophy that deals with the nature of beauty and taste as well as the philosophy of art it examines values often expressed through judgments of taste aesthetics covers both natural and artificial sources of aesthetic experience and judgment it considers what happens in our minds when we engage with aesthetic objects or environments such as viewing visual art listening to music reading poetry experiencing a play or exploring nature the philosophy of art specifically studies how artists imagine create and perform works of art as well as how people use enjoy and criticise art thus an artwork with which we engage at a contemplative level as opposed to performing a practical task is what originates in us an aesthetic experience in urdu and in arabic aesthetics is translated as jamaaliat a derivation from the word jamaal which is translated as beauty ironically jamaaliat has never been a part of our mainstream national narrative at the levels of decision making there is hardly any appreciation of the fact that aesthetics is one of the primeval faculties that plays a vital role in cultivating the sensitivity essential for anybody to qualify as human the society at large demonstrates same sort of inanity towards both the art and the artists besides abdul rahman chughtai very few artists have been feted socially or academically art exhibitions are rare and theatre is in an utter shambles so that there is little hope of its revival the film industry has been unable to re invent itself after the zia regime virtually muzzled it out of existence all these factors have rendered us unable to appreciate beauty balance and proportion even television channels after having made politics and political debate that signifies preposterous exchange of fiddlesticks into a form of entertainment have rendered great disservice to the cause of art the consequences of indifference to such an important facet are dire our people across the caste and class divides have developed a thick skin and social myopia that prevents them from seeing anything beyond their own selves a society is atomised where voluntary associations have not evolved the edhi foundation has been an exception but it attained recognition after several decades of unflinching resolve of one man one instance proves the point felling of age old trees to widen roads is not something that baffles us in lahore lawrence garden bagh i jinnah has been squeezed to make more space for the vehicles to pass by the same has been done to the shalimar gardens the projects several critics call them monstrosities like the metro bus and orange train are a disaster for the environment and have thrown lahore s beauty into jeopardy we can see a mindset at work that is totally devoid of the aesthetic sense the mindset is dominated by a concept of development that has no idea of taste or sense of proportion that probably is the reason that the practical aspects of development have added shabbiness to our urban spaces our apathy towards nature and various objects of nature is a big cause of our social malaise closely concerned is our environment and our carefree attitude towards it aesthetic sense involvement with nature and concern for the environment are intertwined and complement one another renowned polymath jared diamond attaches extraordinary significance to the environment as a factor in the organic growth of the society but now i will turn to another important facet the scant presence of social capital in our midst this is a big cause of our societal degeneration but first let me define social capital with utmost brevity social capital is the equivalent of what used to be called public spirit defined more precisely in terms of trust norms and networks informal social links that may be mobilised to get some things done this concept became a focus of scholarly interest in the1990s because of theoretical formulation of the american political scientist robert putnam while studying italy he described north italy where institutions worked better because there was more co operation and less mistrust the characteristics were conspicuously absent in southern italy he also studied the united states and argued that its stock of social capital measured by participation in voluntary associations had steadily declined over several decades when it comes to pakistan mutual trust among the countrymen is abysmally low this leads to a deficient level of cooperation therefore the social fabric is inherently weak and unsustainable mutual mistrust and lack of cooperation is quite pronounced in the urban spaces thus the society is atomised and voluntary associations have not evolved the edhi foundation has been an exception but it attained recognition after several decades of unflinching resolve of one man which is hard to emulate by ordinary humans to conclude i assert that with the institution of family in a state of steady erosion the need for social capital becomes even more imperative pakistani intelligentsia must play an active role to provide moral anchorage to our social formation social movement with an explicit aim to create a social ethos may enable pakistanis to trust one another one must be mindful of the fact that not everything can be left to the government to attend to the society has an equally important role to perform not only to sustain itself but also to keep

last week british american tobacco p l c lon bats insiders who had purchased shares in the previous 12 months were rewarded handsomely the shares increased by 3 5 last week resulting in a uk 2 4b increase in the company s market worth as a result the stock they originally bought for uk 1 6m is now worth uk 1 9m while we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares view our latest analysis for british american tobacco the last 12 months of insider transactions at british american tobacco in the last twelve months the biggest single purchase by an insider was when independent chairman of the board luc jobin bought uk 1 2m worth of shares at a price of uk 25 98 per share even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price uk 31 38 we still think insider buying is a positive because the shares were purchased at a lower price this particular buy doesn t tell us much about how insiders feel about the current share price while british american tobacco insiders bought shares during the last year they didn t sell you can see the insider transactions by companies and individuals over the last year depicted in the chart below if you click on the chart you can see all the individual transactions including the share price individual and the date british american tobacco is not the only stock insiders are buying so take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying does british american tobacco boast high insider ownership looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders usually the higher the insider ownership the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term it s great to see that british american tobacco insiders own 8 2 of the company worth about uk 5 9b most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders so what does this data suggest about british american tobacco insiders it doesn t really mean much that no insider has traded british american tobacco shares in the last quarter but insiders have shown more of an appetite for the stock over the last year judging from their transactions and high insider ownership british american tobacco insiders feel good about the company s future so these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock but it s also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company to help with this we ve discovered 2 warning signs 1 is concerning that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in british american tobacco but note british american tobacco may not be the best stock to buy so take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high roe and low debt for the purposes of this article insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body we currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions but not derivative transactions have feedback on this article concerned about the content get in touch with us directly alternatively email editorial team at simplywallst com this article by simply wall st is general in nature we provide commentary based on historical data and analyst forecasts only using an unbiased methodology and our articles are not intended to be financial advice it does not constitute a recommendation to buy or sell any stock and does not take account of your objectives or your financial situation we aim to bring you long term focused analysis driven by fundamental data note that our analysis may not factor in the latest price sensitive company announcements or qualitative material simply wall st has no position in any stocks mentioned

the ambiguous designation of longtime local around here is a badge of honor for many but few families can claim a status that spans 43 years as operational manager of sundance liquor gifts the beloved snowmass town center store his parents barbara and steve opened in 1979 andrew wickes is leading a new business legacy in the colorado cannabis industry with a soft opening on dec 21 2021 just three months after wickes signed a lease on the second floor space adjacent to sundance which needed a full build out the snowmass dispensary is officially up and running the cannabis store marks the second adult use retail license the town of snowmass village has issued since lifting its notorious marijuana moratorium but wickes has been a vocal and involved advocate from the beginning over the past five years he s regularly attended town council meetings and commented in development discussions although he initially applied the title of snowmass first ever dispensary was granted to high q which has been successfully operating on the upper level of the snowmass mall since 2019 on a recent morning errand run i m a snowmass village resident and couldn t be happier that i can now stock up on groceries wine and weed all in one stop i swung by the snowmass dispensary where i took a tour and a seat at the cannabis counter to catch up with wickes katie shapiro congratulations are obviously in order how do you feel now that you ve finally come full circle in cannabis andrew wickes after colorado first legalized cannabis it just didn t really make sense that snowmass wasn t open at all to offering sales as a service which is why i wanted to be a part of the movement early on it was definitely an interesting process watching it unfold at the town council level hearing the negative concerns and learning why there was pushback but having our liquor store downstairs we were sending people to aspen or downvalley all the time for cannabis it s a big part of the colorado experience for a lot of visitors renee grossman at high q did a great job showing the town of snowmass village hey look we can run these establishments in snowmass and it s not going to ruin anyone s family fun it is something that most visitors and locals want access to in their towns it s why coloradans voted for it in the first place shapiro since the snowmass dispensary is a retailer only where do you source your flower wickes because we re not directly affiliated with growing the idea is that we re always going to be a farmer s market type of concept where we re always in search of the freshest flower from best organic cultivators in colorado for our initial supply we are working exclusively with four growers the local guys at silverpeak the award winners at bloom county denver s mighty tree and lastly boulder built shapiro the store has such an epic view of snowmass mountain and i ve never seen a counter service concept like this before how did you decide to incorporate this into the design shop the snowmass dispensary 16 kearns rd suite 202 2nd floor snowmass town center 970 452 2167 smvdispensary com hours monday sunday 10 a m 8 00 p m grand opening promos mighty tree 65 for a

through jan 21 pax buy one get one 50 off all pods from jan 21 23 wickes we wanted to have two separate counters one for one on one consultations and one for express service advance ordering online is coming soon we want our customers to feel comfortable asking as many questions as they have about cannabis and they can set up an appointment through our website with one of our connoisseurs shapiro how did you approach staffing wickes our timeline was a little absurd we had to complete both state and local licensing order inventory and make hires in three months we have eight employees right now and two more who are sort of flex between here and sundance and everyone is legit a mega expert with decades of combined experience from other dispensaries in aspen and the roaring fork valley going through the whole process we couldn t have done it without this great team and a lot of people that worked with us and for us whether it s been the landlords my family s support or our staff it s been such a long road and it s just amazing to be at the point where we re actually operational shapiro what else sets the snowmass dispensary apart wickes we strive to provide an approachable way for people to browse cannabis products whether you re an expert looking for double black diamond level potency or totally new to it and want to start with microdosing or nonintoxicating wellness products we also carry leading brands like xiaolin willie s reserve 1906 wyld mary s medicinals etc and just like at sundance if you need a quick gift or gear we are building on our boutique section with accessories from volcano higher standards malin goetz carta and more we ll also have a loyalty program that our locals love downstairs but instead of a punch card it ll be through our point of sale flowhub to earn points and rewards honestly after being a part of this conversation for so many years we are proud to be the snowmass dispensary our plan isn t to build a bunch of stores around the state it s cool to be the little guys and be doing the only thing i know which is family owned local retail this is home and i definitely want to be a part of this valley forever katie shapiro can be

fayetteville differing guidance has emerged for when college students testing positive for covid 19 should be able to break their isolation one question is whether to test with a national health organization recommending a negative rapid antigen test if a student wants to return to class before the end of a 10 day isolation period this goes against guidance from the university of arkansas fayetteville where the medical director for the campus health center on wednesday said that after students complete an isolation period a minimum of five days at ua fayetteville they do not need to retest for negative to return to class or the lab covid 19 recommendations and guidance have changed rapidly in recent weeks all during an unprecedented surge in new infections colleges across the state now have shifted their approach to certain protocols for responding to the coronavirus while some campuses are buying and distributing large numbers of kn95 masks considered to offer better protection than some other face coverings many of the state s largest universities have shortened their recommended minimum isolation period to five days from 10 days for those testing positive for covid 19 dr huda sharaf medical director for ua fayetteville s health center said wednesday in a campus forum that if a rapid antigen test comes back positive then there s no need for a second test and isolation should begin as seeking a confirmation test strains resources the other thing that i want to make very clear is that if you have someone who s had covid and they have successfully completed their isolation period and met all the criteria for ending their isolation period they do not need to retest for negative to return to class or the lab sharaf said again this is not a good use of resources but the american college health association on wednesday stated that if colleges are using a shortened five day minimum isolation period then acha recommends students test out of isolation using a rapid antigen test isolation could end at least five days after the start of symptoms with a negative test but if the test is positive then additional testing on day seven or eight can be performed with a negative test ending isolation prior to 10 days the group stated colleges that have shortened their minimum isolation periods have cited new guidance for the general public from the u s centers for disease control and prevention which on dec 27 shortened the recommended isolation period to a minimum of five days instead of 10 days so long as individuals are without fever for 24 hours prior to breaking their isolation and also spend the next five days wearing masks when around others the cdc has said most coronavirus transmission occurs early in the course of illness generally in the 1 2 days prior to onset of symptoms and the 2 3 days after also at issue is whether a college campus setting should affect recommendations asked about recommended isolation periods for colleges danyelle mcneill spokeswoman for the state department of health said officials have been awaiting cdc guidance specific to higher education institutions we have not issued any recommendations because we are waiting for cdc guidance mcneill said in an email thursday the american college health association also has recommendations for if colleges cannot test or choose not to do testing as a condition for release ua fayetteville spokesman mark rushing on friday said the university s guidance basically matches the national group s recommendations for colleges not telling students to test out of isolation both state that isolation should not be broken unless a student has been free from fever for 24 hours without the use of medicines ua fayetteville is the state s largest university among other schools in the top six by enrollment the university of arkansas at little rock continues to tell its students and workers that they should isolate for at least 10 days a ualr spokeswoman said thursday referring despite mcneill s statement to state guidance ua little rock received guidance on jan 18 2022 from the arkansas department of health to continue using a 10 day isolation period with limited exceptions spokeswoman angie faller said in an email a shortened isolation period strikes a balance said patrick desrochers chair of the university of central arkansas department of chemistry and biochemistry i appreciate that uca s 5 day policy based on cdc guidance is one that is trying to thread the difficult line of getting covid people back to class as efficiently as possible while minimizing impact on the whole uca community desrochers said in an email adding that he sees nothing wrong with the american college health association recommendation to test out of isolation but tests cost desrochers added in response to arkansas democrat gazette questions none of the state s six largest universities stated that they planned to tell students to test negative on a rapid antigen test prior to returning from isolation before 10 days sam strasner a spokesman for arkansas tech university referred to an internal covid 19 working group in this case due diligence by the atu covid 19 task force would include assessing rapid antigen testing capacity strasner said in an email mask plans the university of arkansas at fort smith has a plan to provide kn95 masks to students returning from isolation after five days a spokeswoman said uafs with an enrollment of about 4 300 non high school students is currently sourcing 10 000 kn95 masks reserving a portion of that quantity to provide five kn95 masks to all students faculty and staff as they exit isolation on day 5 spokeswoman rachel putman said in an email thursday five hundred kn95 masks were in hand last week for distribution to those exiting quarantine putman said the american college health association recommended that masks and instructions on how to wear them be provided to students emerging from isolation after less than 10 days the term asymptomatic does not always mean not contagious the group stated therefore any individuals leaving isolation prior to day 10 should be provided with and instructed on the appropriate use of a well fitted n95 kn95 or surgical mask which should be worn at all times in public indoor settings and crowded outdoor settings where distancing is not feasible the uafs plans are not directly attributed to the health association s recommendations putman said the state s six largest public universities all have indoor mask requirements at the university of central arkansas some kn95 masks have been available upon request since the spring 2021 semester desrochers said in uca s department of chemistry some of our students are choosing not to use these preferring instead to use their own mask cloth single layer surgical etc desrochers said in an email i tell my students the kn95 are the best that we can offer under the circumstances and that if they must wear a mask as thankfully our president continues to make clear we must it should be a kn95 ualr recently obtained about 6 000 kn95 masks faller said and the masks will be encouraged in front line service settings where there is a high amount of interaction with others at ua fayetteville about 6 000 kn95 masks were delivered last week and an additional 25 000 masks are on order with varying delivery times rushing said in an email for now deans and department or unit heads are being asked to request masks only for faculty staff and graduate assistants that are public facing or those who interact with a large variety of people on a regular basis rushing said he said the cost is about 22 000 with federal coronavirus relief funds expected to cover the expense bill smith a spokesman for arkansas state university referred to federal efforts to provide masks for our essential workers and those with a specific need they can request a 95 style masks we have purchased stocks to hand out to those who request smith said in an email with state and federal agencies making 95 style masks more widely available to the general public ordering large stockpiles to distribute may be repetitious strasner with arkansas tech said in an email that the university is reviewing options to improve campus access to such masks as more details about the 400 million n95 masks the federal government is providing become available that information will be communicated to the university community strasner said

the final feature of the great superbubbles has been a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks many of which fall as the blue chip market rises this occurred in 1929 in 2000 and it is occurring now he wrote in an investor note dancing off a cliff a plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks this is why at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up sometimes quite slowly to the blue chips other analysts point out there could be another factor that explains the growing correlation between the performance of cryptocurrencies and tech shares they point out that the growing popularity of digital currencies has meant that more investors hold these assets in their investment portfolios advertisement however it also means that investors could be tempted to sell off their crypto assets when tech stocks fall and they face pressure from brokers to post extra cash to cover possible losses on trades made with borrowed money but not all investors are convinced that the prices of global shares and bonds will suffer the same brutal decline as the cryptocurrencies instead they argue that two events this week will be pivotal in deciding the fate of markets in coming months the first is this week s meeting of the us federal reserve now senior fed officials openly concede that the united states has an inflation problem at their december meeting us central bank officials decided to scale back their monetary stimulus more quickly by ending their bond purchases by march many commentators now expect the fed will go even further at this week s meeting and end the bond buying program in february advertisement that would clear the way for the fed to start raising interest rates at their march meeting financial markets are expecting at least three and possibly four us interest rate hikes this year already futures markets have fully priced in a 25 basis point rise in the us central bank s key interest rate in march the fed s challenge but this leaves the fed with a difficult balancing act can it find a way to tighten monetary policy and combat inflation without triggering a rout in financial markets the fed s challenge is exacerbated by the growing anxiety over us inflation which has pushed the yield on benchmark us 10 year bonds as high as 1 88 per cent last week before it dipped back to 1 76 per cent at the beginning of the year us 10 year bonds were trading on a yield of 1 63 per cent higher yields on ultra safe assets such as us government bonds means that investors have less incentive to pay high prices for tech companies that are expected to deliver strong earnings in the distant future advertisement still long term us bond yields could inch lower if the fed manages to convince investors that it is acting promptly to tame inflationary pressures the risk however is that markets start to fear that the fed will use overly aggressive tactics to stamp out rising price pressures what s more some analysts argue that the tech stocks could be vulnerable to a major correction as the fed and other major central banks move towards reining in their bond purchases the prices of the big us tech stocks such as meta platforms formerly known as facebook amazon apple and google parent alphabet have soared in tandem with the growth in the size of the balance sheets of the world s major central banks as a result their share prices could come under pressure as the fed not only ends its bond purchases but starts to work out plans for shrinking its nearly us9 trillion balance sheet by allowing bonds to mature without replacing them still the fed is still some time away from any decision to start shrinking its balance sheet and some investors are hopeful that us tech stocks microsoft apple and tesla are all due to report this week will get a boost from stronger than expected fourth quarter earnings advertisement the big us tech giants were huge beneficiaries from the pandemic as companies and individuals shifted their activities online as both work and school went virtual people spent more on ipads and macs while companies invested in upgrading their software what s more the tech giants enhanced their earnings by cutting spending on items such as travel and entertaining while investing in areas to cement their market dominance as a result the share prices of companies such as microsoft apple and amazon have soared over the past two years but investors enthusiasm for the seemingly invincible tech giants has faltered this year as rising bond yields have forced investors to apply a higher discount rate to their future cash flows investors however could rediscover their enthusiasm if the tech giants unveil stronger than expected sales and earnings for the holiday quarter an impressive financial performance in the quarter will reassure jittery investors and help to insulate tech stocks from rising bond yields

a way to present your order to the blockchain for the currency in question the simplest way to do that is to use an exchange such as the ones operated by binance and coinbase these are the cryptocurrency equivalent of a shopping mall offering access to many cryptocurrencies typically these sites will provide a digital wallet that acts a lot like a checking account except that it s secured by a personal cryptographic key instead of a pin you deposit cash or cryptocurrency into the wallet and it funds your purchases keeps track of your holdings and stores the digital receipts that track what you ve bought and sold los angeles times a different kind of atm is popping up in stores supermarkets and malls across southwestern pennsylvania these however are not intended to spit out dollars they offer cryptocurrency a decentralized digital currency that has no government backing or regulation its value is volatile fluctuating like a stock it relies primarily on how much investors will pay and speculation on its future worth in the past year dozens of cryptocurrency atms have gone live throughout the region to make it more convenient for people to buy and sell digital money operators such as american crypto bitcoin depot bitcoin of america coinflip freedom gateway getcoins rockitcoin and others have installed machines in businesses mostly convenience stores the atms also can be found inside giant eagle stores ross park mall and pittsburgh international airport others can be found across westmoreland county and the alle kiski valley in downtown pittsburgh and lawrenceville in bethel park and mt lebanon a corporate competitor such as coinstar asset holdings of bellevue wash has had crypto atms in the pittsburgh region since 2019 atlanta based bitcoin depot has its machines scattered in about 100 businesses across the state nationwide there are about 30 200 crypto atms according to atm marketplace we re expanding almost every week said neil bergquist

coinstar kiosks such as those located at giant eagle stores to convert change into cash gift cards and now cryptocurrency o hara based giant eagle turned to coinstar when it introduced crypto atms in 2019 including at a store in north huntingdon the majority of the country is crypto curious said bergquist who estimates about 15 of americans own digital currency some 86 of americans have heard about cryptocurrencies according to the pew research center but estimates of how many americans have put their money into the digital currency and how many people truly understand it vary widely about 21 million americans about 14 of the nation s adults own a piece of the cryptocurrency world according to gemini a cryptocurrency exchange regulated by the new york state department of financial services other surveys put the number at closer to 60 million either way more americans in the past two years have been investing in the crypto market which consists of about 17 000 options across more than 400 exchanges and holds a worldwide value of 1 8 trillion that followed a crash of more than 500 billion on friday alone after russia said it might ban cryptocurrencies china did the same last fall in all the cryptocurrency market has lost 1 2 trillion in value since nov 8 when it topped 3 trillion according to bloomberg that plays into longstanding warnings from skeptics such as steve h hanke a professor of applied economics at johns hopkins university in baltimore investing in cryptocurrency does not make sense for any size of transaction he said it s very similar to going to vegas and rolling the dice said hanke one of the world s leading experts on hyperinflation without a balance sheet and assets to generate cash flow the highly speculative asset has a fundamental value of zero whales the name given to investors who own large amounts of cryptocurrency manipulate the market hanke said on friday alone some 700 million worth of cryptocurrency was liquidated worldwide crypto s rise and fall cryptocurrency rose from the fallout of the 2008 global economic crisis at a time when the jobless and disenfranchised protested established financial systems this new currency promised a digital form of money that was bulletproof to bank regulations and government control the currency a creation of digital code though some physical coins have been developed is based on blockchain technology that uses a worldwide computer network to store and update transactions though not names addresses or other identifying information as the los angeles times recently reported each bitcoin started as the payment some person awarded him or herself for doing the computer intensive cryptographic work required to record transactions into the blockchain an activity called mining blockchain technology in essence etches a digital record that is publicly accessible and is touted as eliminating the need for a secretive centralized system cryptography is supposed to make it impossible for digital currency to be counterfeited or spent more than once like cash though it can be lost or stolen in 2021 thieves stole a record 14 billion in cryptocurrency worldwide reported chainalysis those losses driven by theft and scams were up about 80 from 2020 according to the singapore based blockchain analytics firm bitcoin the most popular cryptocurrency was created in 2009 by anonymous inventors in 2010 as bitcoin s value was rising from 9 cents to 40 a florida man traded 10 000 units for two pizzas that would be worth about 384 million today on friday the value of one bitcoin fell to below 40 000 its lowest level in six months it still remains the shining star of digital currencies accounting for nearly 40 of the market according to coinmarketcap bitcoin had a record value of more than 69 000 in november at the time some analysts predicted it could reach a 100 000 valuation the next most valued cryptocurrency ethereum is worth less than 3 000 down from a high of nearly 5 000 just 10 weeks ago it holds just less than 20 of the market the other cryptocurrencies some worth fractions of pennies account for 3 of the market most of them will not survive said kenneth dupre a former money manager who is director of business data analytics at saint vincent college near latrobe hitting main street green tree based fort pitt capital group gets questions about investing in cryptocurrency on a daily basis said carter henderson a portfolio manager the challenge for investors is the volatility henderson said the rise and sudden fall in the value of bitcoin is one example for those reasons henderson said he advises clients to invest only 1 to 2 of their wealth in crypto that conservative path gives them exposure to the developing market without endangering the majority of their assets henderson said he sees more crypto investors being institutions which are more willing to take the risks and can ride out the highs and lows but henderson said he believes in the crypto market one hundred percent he said cryptocurrency is here to stay the likelihood of bitcoin maintaining its value is stronger because the supply has been capped at 21 million of which about 19 million have been mined bitcoin is here to stay dupre said with a limited supply it s like digital gold sheila reed of plum an allegheny valley school district teacher who previously worked with retirement accounts helps connect people who want to invest in crypto with novatech a caribbean based firm that has trading expertise in the market that is safer she said than trying to go

said antony davies associate professor of economics at duquesne university s school of business in the crypto world there is federal deposit insurance corp backing as with money kept in a bank bergquist s advice purchase it and forget about it most crypto users of coinme which has partnered with coinstar in its atm network are first time investors with their meager holdings in virtual wallets they can use debit or credit cards to turn dollars into cryptocurrency most who own cryptocurrency have invested about 1 000 on average according to a survey last summer by finder an online information platform the median amount is about 200 in a digital wallet which safely stores passwords for owned cryptocurrencies and makes the currency accessible to send and receive a top company executive last week said google pay could become a comprehensive digital wallet including for crypto payments the online brokerage company robinhood markets also said it will provide digital wallets

in the fall jeff bezos tweeted praise for rivian a startup under contract to make 100 000 electric delivery vans for amazon and its founder r j scaringe calling him one of the greatest entrepreneurs i ve ever met then bezos worked in a jab now rj where are our vans the comment may have been in jest but the problem he raised is serious amazon has an insatiable appetite for electric vans thanks to a ballooning logistics operation and a pledge that half of its deliveries will be carbon neutral by 2030 but that hunger is running into the reality that the auto industry barely produces any of the vehicles yet although consumer electric cars are finally hitting their stride tesla delivered almost a million cars last year the market for commercial electric vehicles is still nascent with their heavier loads multiplying the technology challenges amazon would not say if rivian delivered the first 10 production vans in december as was expected and other automakers are not manufacturing at scale yet either even though amazon owns nearly 20 of rivian it has also put in orders with other automakers to lay claim to as many vans as it can before they are even under production this month amazon said it would buy thousands of electric ram vans from stellantis the company formed last year after the merger of fiat chrysler and the french automaker peugeot it has also ordered 1 800 electric vans from daimler in europe and it has formed a partnership with mahindra an indian automaker as part of its goal to have 10 000 electric three wheeled vehicles on the road by 2025 the scale and speed at which we re trying to do this requires a lot of invention testing and learning and a completely new playbook ross rachey who oversees amazon s global fleet said in a statement amazon expected to have roughly 175 000 of its vans on the road by the end of 2021 according to an internal document from late 2020 nearly all of which burned fossil fuels that number is growing quickly amazon is several years and tens of billions of dollars into a huge push to deliver packages shifting away from relying on large carriers such as ups to begin the expansion amazon ordered 20 000 diesel sprinter vans from mercedes benz through its network of contractors amazon now delivers more than half of its orders globally and far more in the united states amazon has six times as many delivery depots now as it did in 2017 with at least 50 more new facilities set to open this year according to data from mwpvl a logistics consultancy that logistics boom accelerated by the pandemic s shift to online shopping multiplies the challenges the company faces in meeting its pledge to reduce its climate effect its vow to make half of its deliveries carbon neutral by 2030 is part of the company s broader pledge to be net carbon neutral by 2040 electrification of their delivery fleet is a really important part of that strategy said anne goodchild who leads the university of washington s work on supply chain logistics and freight transportation delivery vans are well suited to electric propulsion because they usually travel 100 miles or under in a day which means they don t need large battery packs that add to the cost of electric cars delivery trucks are often used during the day and can be recharged overnight and usually require less maintenance than gasoline trucks electric vehicles don t have transmissions and certain other mechanical components that wear out quickly in the heavy stop and go typical in delivery routes in september 2019 when bezos announced amazon s rivian order the largest ever order of electric vehicles he positioned it as central to amazon s commitment to reduce its carbon footprint at the time he said he expected the 100 000 vans to be on the road by 2024 amazon invested at least 1 3 billion in rivian which amazon says is supposed to make 10 000 vans as early as this year amazon also locked up exclusive rights to rivian s commercial vans for four years with the right of first refusal for two years after that the companies have been testing the vans for almost a year in regulatory disclosures in november rivian said it would make the full delivery to amazon by 2025 last week rachey said amazon expected to have the vehicles on the road no later than 2030 rivian declined to comment amazon is not the only delivery company interested in the burgeoning market fedex in pursuit of its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2040 is preparing to buy tens of thousands of electric vans over the next eight years the company hopes that battery powered vehicles make up half of all of its van purchases by 2025 and 100 by 2030 the company has its sights on eventually building a fleet of perhaps 250 000 small and midsize electric vans electrifying our pickup and delivery fleet is critically important and makes sense from a service and financial standpoint richard smith president and ceo of fedex s operations in the americas said this month in a video address at the ces tech trade show we are going to need to add a lot of commercial vehicles by 2040 infrastructure willing of course fedex like amazon is just at the beginning of the transition it recently took delivery of five electric trucks from brightdrop a division of general motors developing battery powered vans walmart a key amazon competitor also plans to buy vans from brightdrop to help expand its delivery services the company has put in reservations for 5 000 brightdrop vans and expects them to go into service in 2023 that demand coupled with tesla s success in sales and on the stock market has spurred heavy investment in electric vans ford motor co which has a large share of the gas powered delivery van business in both the united states and europe recently started production of an electric version of its transit van and plans to start deliveries to dealers and customers in the next few months arrival a startup in london that is backed by ups plans to make electric vans and buses and aims to start production in the united states this year another startup canoo which said in november that it will headquarter in northwest arkansas intends to start producing electric delivery vans at a plant in oklahoma next year workhorse group in loveland ohio has been in business for more than a decade and is trying to transition into electric vans but it has run into difficulties it delivered 41 vans last year but had to take them back from customers because they were sold before the company had finished making sure its design met federal safety standards in october workhorse s ceo said its van design was neither robust nor profitable the company is deciding whether to continue making it or develop a new vehicle a year ago workhorse failed to win a contract to supply vans to the united states postal service which was a blow to its stock the securities and exchange commission and the justice department opened an investigation last year into trading in workhorse shares around the time the news of the postal service contract was released getting the vans is just part of the challenge keeping them charged is another job postings at amazon say it is building the largest ev fleet and charging network in the world rachey said the infrastructure for charging the vehicles had some of the longest lead times in the entire effort requiring work with utilities charging operators and the physical warehouses where the vans are based amazon is also looking into delivery routes and other factors that reduce battery efficiency such as driving uphill and running air conditioning things that could require charging in the middle of a worker s shift and not just overnight it is very normal now for trucking and logistics companies to talk about sustainability not as some peripheral thing but as a fundamental shift goodchild said adding that amazon by making commitments upfront is helping to create a market

there is a great whittling going on it is a pastime as old as mankind it is not the sort practiced by retired codgers sitting on front porches with pocket knives carving wooden artifacts for their grandchildren the great whittling is the relentless shaving away of mankind s free agency as i watch the tv series 1883 unfold i am impressed how deep our need for freedom truly is and how the world seems to go out of its way to ankle our best efforts to live our lives on our own terms actor sam elliot as the world worn wagon master seemed perplexed as the german pioneer with wretched humility described that where they came from there were laws against swimming of all things it is true that in germany people were whipped put in the stocks and fined for swimming as was also the case in parts of england people in medieval europe and into the enlightenment generally did not swim they did not know how swimming was not a leisure art or a bathing practice overall getting in water over one s head was considered too dangerous it is roughly estimated that 2 000 to 3 000 drowned annually in britain it is always a general tendency for those in authority to want to protect people from themselves how else to explain the age old refrain of there ought to be law against that to revisit 1883 faith hill playing a pioneer mother rehearses life lessons on the subject of freedom as she and her daughter swim and bathe freely in the river one is that freedom isn t free it comes with fangs two as the world packs more and more people together inevitably more rules and more laws will follow ponder how covid 19 mandates stand uniquely illustrative of those two principles a recent economist yougov poll found that half of the country does not support the concept that businesses should be allowed to mandate that their customers be vaccinated thirty eight percent thought businesses should be able to mandate customers being vaccinated twelve percent were unsure that is thirty eight percent who are comfortable with businesses curtailing customer free agency that is the thirty eight percent that make up the there ought to be a law against that crowd it is easy to point out that businesses are private entities but the notion of them assuming a quasi government role as bureaucratic health surrogates is just the sort of camel nose government relishes getting under the private tent as of today even government can t mandate vaccinations the hill reported that a federal judge in texas blocked biden s vaccine mandate for federal workers judge jeffery brown answered the question whether the president can with the stroke of a pen and without the input of congress require millions of federal employees to undergo a medical procedure as a condition of their employment hats off to judge brown for halting that particular whittling of our free agency in the spirit of 1883 a friend introduced me to a quote by the 19th century religious leader joseph smith who astutely observed we have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men as soon as they get a little authority as they suppose they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion i immediately noted that this is where freedom comes with fangs spruce fontaine is an artist and retired college art instructor image clem onojeghuo via stocksnap
