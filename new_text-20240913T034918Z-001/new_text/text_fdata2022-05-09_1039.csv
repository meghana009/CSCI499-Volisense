you cannot grow a turnip in a pile of dollar bills unless you let them rot first depending on the road the fed takes that could become the dollar s highest value and the best the fed can do to reduce food shortages by david haggith on the great recession blog whether the dollar decays depends in good part on whether the fed chooses to fight inflation or chooses to fight the recession that is already bogging us down it cannot do both it never has and whichever it does of one will worsen the other it seems to be broadly accepted now that we have both of the ingredients for persistent high inflation fully in full play the federal reserve created a whole pile of money beyond anyone dreamed it would do prior to covid and the federal government helped distribute it to numerous businesses including many that didn t need it and to almost all americans we have massive shortages due to earlier and current covid lockdowns and now we add shortages from the war in ukraine and from the sanctions imposed to combat the war in other words we have a demand side inflation problem created by all that money enabling companies and human beings to buy more stuff and a supply side problem that the fed can do nothing about leaving humans without all the stuff they want or need to buy such as food how money moves and prices rises the only inflation front the fed can battle is the demand side the monetary equation where it can diminish demand by pulling money back out of the economy via quantitative tightening qt as it did back in 2018 we all remember that went over like a lead zeppelin because markets had grown dependent on deep money but that is what the fed must do if it intends to do anything at all about inflation that is fueled by the slosh of deep and wide money supply and stock and bond and housing markets will just have to quiver and shiver into the dust of the earth if the fed is going to pursue that route hard enough to attempt to drive inflation back to its 2 target of course when it was in their favor to say so the fed told everyone repeatedly that it was going to pursue a symmetrical target of 2 inflation if it were actually to honor its word then it should try to erase the overage that has stripped us all of some wealth by going for a year about seven points below 2 just as it is now that far above 2 something tells me we symmetrical is off the plan for good as the fed is now raising interest bear this in mind all the money the fed has already created is going to keep floating around the economy until the fed actually sucks it back out with qt for example just because you spend all your savings that doesn t mean there is less money in the economy all of your expenditures just moved that money into other people s pockets you have less money while someone else has more money supply doesn t go down from people losing money people can spend money endlessly and lose money on their investments and not lower us savings and hence money supply at all even if they turn their cash into gold that just makes it someone else s cash that means all that money can keep causing inflation even if no new money is created via loans it is the movement of that money that drives inflation it s just the more money floods the system the freer it generally moves the more that money is spent back and forth as businesses pay their service providers and their employees and buy more supplies and equipment from other businesses and those employees spend the money again the more velocity the money is said to have and this velocity of money is the big accelerator of inflation on the monetary side the faster the cycle turns over the more it empowers inflation like a generator so until the fed starts qt and begins to actually vacuum money out of the economy we will see more inflation fed from the demand side of the economy even if the fed is lowering interest because there is simply too much money already in the monetary system raising the cost of interest often called the price of money doesn t remove any money it just slows the creation of even more money because banks all have the government granted power to create new money every time they issue a loan by writing out a check they create the money that they loan out of nothing under our fractional reserve banking system see my ancient article the us federal reserve for dummies what is the federal reserve system and what is the gold standard we call it fiat money because banks all over the nation are decreeing money into being with every loan they write rarely if ever are those loans fully backed with cash somewhere the banks only have to reserve fractional coverage the banks just sign a check to disperse loan funds and there is new money voilà obviously raising interest slows down new loan issuances so it slows down the expansion of money but it doesn t drain any money out of the system which is overcharged right now it just stops loosening it up even more so for as long as the excess liquidity in the system is sloshing back and forth from one bank account to another and to the extent the cycle picks up any speed you re going to have higher inflation and so long as interest remains fairly low loans will keep happening and banks will keep creating even more money in the system that is why it can take a lot of clamping down to get inflation under control it is however likely to take far less clamping this time because the other thing that causes demand destruction is an economic recession which greatly slows the velocity of money as people hunker down on what they have and pay out money in a stingier fashion they take out fewer loans as well we have just seen that we are already sliding into recession with gross domestic production receding 1 4 this past quarter where does money go when stock values crash we talk about the destruction of wealth but does 80 of the money in stocks evaporate if stocks crash and get written down in market value by 80 no stock prices are largely based on a perception of value largely anchored in belief about income streams that haven t even happened yet people will spend some of their share of the nation s money supply to buy stocks if they perceive them as having increasing future value giving some of their share of the money supply to someone else to buy the stock if they take out a loan to buy the stock then money supply increases to make the stock purchase possible but that money never goes away if they sell the stock or its perceived value drops to where others will pay less to get it to really drive up stocks the fed creates more money making it easier for stocks to attract more money and rise more in value because people are looking for places to store the new money in investments others will be willing to pay more for in the future as the stock markets and bond markets collapse they can destroy demand without destroying money when stocks crash all the money invested in stocks all along their journey up is still in the system it just moves imagine a small island with only three people and one company all the company owns and consists of is a small grove of coconut palms each person stranded on the island jumped off a ship naked with nothing but 10 00o each person brought to the island in a plastic bag when their ship wrecked a total of 30 000 in island money supply and the islanders have agreed to use that as their vehicle for trades person a we ll call him mitch mcconnell also owns the one stock share of the one company that owned the only small grove of coconuts on the island because that was in his bag go figure that mitch would own all the stock person b we ll call her tulsi wants the share badly enough that she ll pay 1 000 for it out of her bag because as an hawaiian she not only sees future food value but she recognizes the value of the coconut oil for protection of one s skin in the island sun mitch loves money and believes he ll be rescued during the next election so he exchanges the stock share with her which says she owns all rights to trees owned by the coconut company and she gives him 1 000 mitch now has 11 000 and tulsi has only 9 000 plus a piece of paper that gives her ownership in the coconut company which consist of nothing but the trees not even the land under them the total money supply on the island remains the same person c whom we ll call sleeply joe still has his original 10 000 because he was drifting away under one of the coconut palms when the deal was made island money supply is still 30 000 coconuts are the only vegetation growing on the island in order to keep our example simple mitch tulsi and sleepy joe are to keep it fun so as people get hungry and tired of eating starfish and limpets the desire for the limited coconut supply grows coconuts become hot commodities especially as skin starts to turn red and chapped but the only one who can harvest and sell them is tulsi sleepy joe s burning skin wakes him up desperate he now says he ll pay 5 000 of the dollar bills he brought to the island in his plastic bag for ownership of the coconut stock because he wants to make sure he controls the supply chain the total stock s market value on the island just soared from 1 000 to 5 000 because stock s value in terms of money is only perceived even though coconuts have real intrinsic value to feed you and help your skin tulsi sells her stock to sleepy joe because her natural island skin is doing quite well on its own now mitch has 11 000 tulsi has 14 000 and uncle joe has only 5 000 plus the stock and coconut trees money supply on the island remains 30 000 it didn t change a bit just because the island s only stock soared in value where did the money come from to support the soaring stock value it just moved it didn t move into the stock it moved from one person s storage bag to the next how high the stock went up had something to do with how much money papa powell had packed in the bags before the ship wrecked he died in the shipwreck he created by the way obviously the stock cannot rise higher than 30 000 in value in this closed system if it can only be traded for money obviously if papa powell had only packed ten one dollar bills in each person s bag the island stock would have only sold for something like 1 and instead of getting 1 for each starfish you collected and sold for food as was happening under the 30k monetary supply you d expect to have to collect a lot more starfish to get a dollar out of someone with money supply so tight as ten bucks each people would be stretching their money quite carefully to make it last getting the most starfish to eat they could out of their limited funds because the fed isn t creating any more dollars on that island than those fed bucks that were brought there so money supply is stable under that situation it would take an extreme shortage of seafood to raise the price of barely edible starfishes above a buck each then comes a hurricane that blows down all the coconut trees and they float irretrievable far out to sea cononutco s stock since the company s capital was all wiped out now consists of nothing of intrinsic or perceived value so it s stock price crashes to zero it s a total wipeout no one on the island will ever be willing to pay for the stock again was any money wiped out no mitch still has 11 000 tulsi has 14 000 and c has 5000 we ll leave out any change in the money flow form their starfish and tilapia trades to keep things simple money supply remains exactly 30 000 all that has changed is sleepy joe is both a lot poorer in dollars and in coconuts and the little island has less intrinsic value to anyone because it now can t feed anyone anything but seafood joe tosses his stock share into the sea as something that will never again have value and goes to sleep his losses off finding himself even more disgruntled than he usually is because he now has no coconut palm for shade and no source of oil in the future for his tired skin money of course continues to get exchanged for limpets and starfish and other marine niceties that the people obtained from the sea but all that changed the whole time was where the available money supply was held if someone s bag was getting a little flat they started getting a little selfish with the starfish a little more reluctant to use their few remaining dollars to buy a pointy thing called a fish that was not a fish the story ends when mitch was teetering on a rock to scrape off a star fish beneath him and a big wave swept him away tulsi saw him go by but didn t go out to save him even though it was election day when he was certain he d be saved because he looks like yurtle the turtle so she simply thought he was a huge turtle swimming in the wave and sleepy joe it turned out was dead but tulsi didn t know because well who could tell fortunately tulsi was alive and well because she loved dining on tilapia and starfish and drinking fish egg wine and she remained on the island until some wise soul came along and scooped her up oh but she had already thrown all her money away because when there is no one left who will trade with you your money loses all its worth because it has zero intrinsic value some say a lesson the us should learn with respect to its trading partners but that is a story for another day on a bigger island a coconut however could become worth all the money in your little world if there were someone to trade with as it is far nicer to drink than fish egg wine and the container it is packaged in serves as its own handy drinking cup it has in other words intrinsic value that money doesn t have tulsi would not throw the island s last coconut away even if there were no one to trade with she d eat it but she can t eat money finding another bag of it floating in on the sea won t create more coconuts to end the new coconut shortage if two albatrosses came along and landed on the shore with one clenching the bag of mitch s money it had found floating on the sea and other clutching a coconut it had found on a drifting palm tulsi would run for the one with the coconut not the one with the bag full of money because more money doesn t end a shortage that wasn t caused by lack of money the moral of the story is if you re going to be in the democrat majority be tulsi if you re going to be a republican minority don t look like a turtle so money supply is never increased or decreased by any amount by the rise and fall in stocks all that changes is where the money is stored who or what entity has a claim on portions of the total money supply that exists it s no different than if you buy a house as an asset instead of a stock if you spend all your cash on a house and the house blows up no money was lost from money supply it s just that the money isn t in your pockets anymore and you re not in a houseanymore recessions and stock crashes can create demand destruction while neither a recession nor a stock market crash change money supply by one cent they can destroy demand or supply because for one thing they tend to destroy barely solvent companies like the hurricane that wiped out the coconuts employees are laid off so the money cycle slows because those people are not getting paid and they are thus tighter about paying anyone else for anything thus the velocity of money drops and that s deflationary as we saw on the island the more money there is in the system the more freely people move it around to get what they want so it cycles up with more velocity and becomes worth less as there is more and more of it when the money s tight people cling to their bags and it has to squeak out between the lips of the bag one bill at a time you better have a lot more starfish to sell if you re going to get any of the money supply into your bag in a recession fewer people are earning money so they don t have as much to spend so money becomes more prized even though there is the same amount of money in the system it s tending not to flow but to be locked away in vaults or computers or plastic bags valuations of stocks in companies that are failing are written down but all the money is still there somewhere it just doesn t move to employees and others so circulation slows way down prices deflate meaning it takes fewer dollars to get what you want the perceived value of money in the bag which has no intrinsic value rises because everyone has agreed to use it as the vehicle of exchange for all goods thus recessions tend to be deflationary even though they don t change money supply on their own they just reduce the velocity of money they reduce the willingness of banks to loan money etc however they are not always deflationary companies going out of business don t produce supply either so you can have a recession where inflation continues because of extreme shortages on the supply side that s where the lesser amount of money in circulation same amount in total supply finds a lot fewer goods to chase so goods become more precious imagine the island economy as measured in dollars exchanged gdp slowed to a crawl one year because the coconuts got wiped out and fish supply plunged too there was almost no successful fishing and certainly no coconut harvesting so the economy was deep in recession compared to prior years if a coconut washed up on shore with the money supply still being at 30 000 can you imagine what it would be worth as everyone started bidding over who gets the coconut we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us it s not a given then that a recession will cause deflation because of how it also changes the supply side it curtails demand but also cuts back supply it is even less likely that a recession causes deflation if th recession is caused by supply problems like the wipe out of coconuts and fish harvest when inflation continues during a recession meaning a time when the movement of dollars has slowed because there isn t much to trade for we call that stagflation which is the only thing we have to thank former treasurer larry summers for the handy word he created we have a stagnant or receding economy with continuing inflation if shortages get bad enough and the fed creates a lot more money to try to raise gdp welcome to the weimar republic to go all weimar you have to reach hyperinflation and here is how that can happen if inflation in prices still exists as the economy recedes because goods are becoming scarcer even as money is not circulating as quickly the fed has two ugly options curb the inflation by cutting money supply to make money even more scarce but that will turn the recession into an all out depression by making people cling even tighter to their money so the fed may choose to fight the recession instead of the inflation and will want to print more money to loosen up the flow however without an increase in supply that money only raises prices imagine if the fed made a helicopter drop of money on the island but nothing else suddenly the island was awash in more cash than waves but the number of people fishing for tilapia remains the same those that don t want to fish like sleepy joe will just shell out a few more shells and get their fish the easy way so they can keep sleeping under the coconut palms not a safe place to sleep by the way as fully loaded a ripe coconut in its husk weighs a solid five pounds or more which might be how sleepy joe died because tulsi did see a coconut in its husk right beside him though who could tell normally easy money might goose production and jump start employment and supply but not if the supply issues are causing the recession and not being caused by a recession the fed increasing money doesn t get anything produced if the fish and nuts aren t there to harvest in the kind of recession the world is now moving into businesses are shutting down because trade routes are closing and parts and materials are not available and because people would rather sleep under coconut palms than go back to work the old school thinking of creating more helicopter money in that case will just drive inflation up without reopening businesses that can t use the money to get parts anyway and it will keep the people sleeping since their work only gains them money that the government drops from the sky and voilà weimar republic or something equally bad from a return to loose money in that kind of situation the fed s weapon of mass destruction the fed is hoping to avoid the recession part of the demand destruction that it has to engineer if its going to curb inflation by taking away money supply it almost always fails to avoid that because you cannot reduce money supply without shutting down the weakest businesses reducing supply further for the most part fed tightening achieves its effect against inflation bycreating a recession it s almost impossible to take down the money supply and not take out the weakest hands in business writing down stock values laying off employees and creating knock on effects to the people and companies all of those businesses did business with or owed money to making a soft landing in a lead zeppelin meaning an economy that can t fly is not easy right now it s likely to exacerbate supply shortages in a shortage driven recession the fed believes it can finesse such a landing this time though it has a terrible flight record even when there have been no shortages papa powell says he can do that because there is a surplus of jobs so supposedly his plan shouldn t create any significant unemployment because those fired from the weak hands that go out of business can go right out and find a new job but we know that works on the drawing board while failing in reality due to mismatched skills mismatched locations early retirement choices and now it increases supply problems just like we saw when we reopened the economy after the covid lockdowns and many did not return and supplies ran short closing production facilities that were already marginal because they can no longer afford the credit that was keeping the able to make payroll isn t likely to help avoid recession so recession is going to finally win the day and do its dirty work of clearing out the excesses and the dead wood but it s likely to be a rough one because of how we tried to solve everything with more money for so long and because we keep damaging our already badly damaged supply lines with needless and destructive wars and sanctions and continued covid lockdowns humanity is doing this to itself the real world is messy and rarely looks like the battle plan does on the drawing board but the fed is hoping to seriously take down demand without creating a lot of battle scars it has the power for certain to back down or all out destroy demand but it is highly questionable based on its own history whether or not it has the finesse to do that in this present environment filled with major hostilities a plague and droughts and hard winters and trade routes that have been getting damaged for several years now and not create mass demand destruction at a time when the economy is already receding it s qt may turn out to be a weapon of such mass destruction in a mess of explosives situations that the fed has made it clear it is not backing off from that path well until their stock holding bankster buddies all hate them and all the people feel the fed s normal weapons of mass deflation used to battle inflation take effect in this unchartered volatile environment to where the masses start pressing their members of congress to beat on the fed s door for some relief or maybe actually storm the eccles building the fed s aptly named ecclesiastical temple now that storming government buildings is the new politic then the fed may risk qe and throw more money into the fire to raise the flames higher because their kind of money does burn in that case repeat the word weimar after me the picture i m trying to paint is one that shows stopping this roaring inflation is a multi dimensional mess because the fed has no control over the global supply problems that are rapidly proliferating and causing recession and it cannot both goose an economy that is slowing due to supply side recession and cut money supply to curb demand and reduce inflation those goals are mutually exclusive there is no path here that works in the past decade if the fed s tightening caused problems it rushed back in with astronomical amounts new money because it couldn t seem to cause inflation to save its soulless self anyway because it was giving all the money to banksters and their supremely wealthy friends to save stocks and bonds from falling in value but none to the average person while pretending that would trickle down to the average person through the clenched fists of bankers so all inflation happened in the assets people stored the money in where inflation was wanted this time the masses will be banging the fed s door down for money because they re hungry and food is pricy or because their stocks are falling in a time when the fed cannot go back to that kind of general qe distributed either via the federal government or via new federal reserve individual bank accounts as we talked about in a much earlier patron post when it has to fight inflation that people are also going to be screaming about i keep hearing investors claim the fed will rush back to qe based on its history but it s not as easy as that this time this time truly is much different because of the supply problems all over the world and i think the fed knows that the fed believe it or not cannot grow corn there may be a few fed banksters who grew up on farms and have the know how and who own enough land to grow some but that isn t going to make a dent in the corn shortage and that is the best the fed can do to solve supply problems throwing out free money to farmers does not plant fields that are covered in snow or strewn with missiles that were duds now punched into the soil that you surely don t want to hit with your plow lest you leave a crater in the place where you and your tractor once were or fields that were for all the farmer knows seeded with mines the fed cannot take away sanctions which spread around the earth to create even more shortages raising prices through scarcity it can give free money to farmers to buy fertilizer that has become expensive because the fertilizer isn t there to be purchased but that only drives up the price of fertilizer by fueling the demand side without boosting production supply transport of fertilizer these are political problems largely created by a hostile humanity at war with itself and at war with disease and at war with the environment damaging it in some cases or at war with each other over the environment to save it the hostility in humanity and inability to agree on wise solutions or even longstanding basic ideas we once held in common has grown to such extremes that we re killing ourselves without using weapons of mass destruction there is no monetary solution to a supply side inflationary problem wars have to end sanctions have to end forced economic lockdowns have to end midwest fields must be freed of their burden of late spring snows and then dry out fields in europe s breadbasket have to be cleared of explosives people must go back to productive work water supplies have to stop being overused by overpopulated areas that keep insisting on bringing in more people if global warming is adding to droughts that s on us too even if we re not the cause of droughts we still have to deal with them and have economic resiliency to do so switching to all electric vehicles in states that are already crying out about electrical shortages this year certainly will be an electrical shortage disaster in the near future that no one is being realistic about it will require more hydro more nuclear generation more petri fuel generation more windmills beating the birds and more solar panels starving the soil and taking up habitat and where all of those problems exist they re clearly not getting resolved this year by rancorous people who cannot compromise on anything in government anymore who are enraged by government shutdowns of free speech and draconian health laws and with each other over those things the fed isn t going to solve a crisis that all of humanity is creating together where families increasingly hate each other over politics left and right can no longer meet and discuss because both sides have worked up their masses dishonesty in media abounds more than ever people read only what they want to hear races are being baited to hate each other male and female don t even exist as rational distinctions or words that even have an agreed meaning anymore so we ve lost common ground at the most basic levels of human understanding children are told they cannot tell what they are by looking and must all figure it out and we pretend that is somehow kinder to the children to foist that quandary on them when most never gave it a thought all their lives long they take the dilemma as for truth because the adults ought to know not all of that is cause of the depression we are going into but it certainly doesn t bode well for our solving this financial crisis rather than making it worse because we have to agree on numerous tough economic decisions that put more equity and less greed in the system if we want it to function smoothly and we can t seem to agree on basic concepts once prized like free speech or even on what a man or woman is the fed can t fix stupid with money the fed is stupid with money that s because it needs to be stripped down to one sole task manage the currency for zero inflation in all environments that would disempower it in a major way it is not the fed s job to save the economy but we ve led it to believe it must and it can the fed s sole job should be to manage the money supply so that money supply remains as neutral as possible in the equations between us the fed should never be attempting to manage gdp recession v growth the fed is a banker not a central economy planner it should be focused on managing the dollar for inflation v deflation and nothing else not even employment other problems are best solved by difficult political choices and laws that appropriately restrict known greedy behavior such as the kinds of speculation that turn stock markets into nothing but casinos where businesses are mere playing chips where greedy people are allowed to toy with our companies and our economy we need to create and enforce laws that level business playing fields so older businesses don t have undue advantage over new ones rather than throwing money at the problems we need to make things that are too big to fail smaller and stop allowing endless conglomeration of corporations into larger corporations that dominate everyone and stomp out the little guy we don t have to let things like blackrock or jpmorgan come into existence at the dominant scale they have corporations are artificial entities created by law in the first place their conglomeration can be limited by the very laws that allow them to exist there is a point where their dominance is more threatening than efficiently beneficial to a vibrant society their artificial creation that is created via corporate laws can be changed those are the kinds of economic fixes we need to focus on if inflation or deflation is a supply problem the fed cannot do anything about it so it shouldn t even try it shouldn t even be empowered to try we have to solve the causes of supply shortages as the only way to truly rectify inflation due to scarcity and we especially have to stop creating supply problems which is something hyper reactive control obsessed governments and leaders are doing stop overreacting with entire metropolitan lockdowns or by killing tens of millions of chickens or pigs because only one or two were sick gas the one chicken house that had the sick bird to put the chickens to sleep and light it on fire if you must and quarantine the one farm but don t kill half the chickens in the upper midwest over a couple of birds government needs to stop overreacting so do people the fed cannot fix the many reasons we are sliding into collapse not even economic collapse we want an easy one stop solution there isn t one we have to stop pretending there is or recession will grind us down until we are forced to face that and make some major changes we may not solve everything but right now we re not solving anything my next article will be a patron post in which i ll show how much inflation is already on the producer supply side of the economy that has not been passed along to consumers in prices yet i ll lay out more of the forces that will add to those supply problems i ll also point out some areas of the consumer price index that are already grossly understating actual price increases that have happened to consumers much more than they are normally understated because they are not in the cpi headline number now they may be added to it later regardless they re digging into most people s pocket books a lot deeper than cpi is letting on i ll show you why the vast supply side problems that are part of today s kind of inflation are not going away this year so the fed can helidrop all the money on our little island it wants but it s not going to restore the coconut economy it won t float edible and desirable bananas into our republic either even if it turns us into a banana republic by trying if the fed falls back to the easy money path to avoid resetting the economy when all markets crash through a recession that is likely to run as deep as a depression or just to save stock valuations that are bloated far above intrinsic worth of the companies owned via those stocks learn to say weimar or zimbabwe or venezuela or argentina because somewhere along that continuum of collapsed currencies is where we end up by going down that road this supply side recession remains but the currency crashes so in my next patron post i ll go back to analyzing the supply side problems that are coming and that must be solved with something other than fed policy

some contrarian thoughts about elon musk and the purchase of twitter francis menton the news of the past few weeks has been all aflutter over elon musk s purchase of twitter the main issue for discussion has been what does this mean for the future of free speech in the american public square that s an important issue to which i don t have the answer i think that there are reasons for both optimism and pessimism more on this issue later a second issue is what musk s twitter venture signals as to progressive fantasies about net zero utopia this second issue has been little discussed let alone recognized at all in the recent press coverage so let me open the door the most logical way to look at what musk is up to is that he is getting money out of tesla in advance of an almost certain huge decline in its value while placing his next bet on something else with a much better chance for major future growth i think that he has recognized that the net zero utopia necessary for tesla to have continuing exponential growth is impossible and not going to happen according to forbes musk is currently the richest man in the world with net worth in the range of 255 billion that puts him far ahead of the next richest who could be either jeff bezos or bernard arnault each at around 140 billion depending on current stock prices for amazon or lvmh but the problem for musk is that his wealth may be mostly a market bubble that could burst literally overnight most of musk s wealth derives from the very speculative values of two companies tesla and spacex according to barron s here on april 21 musk owns about 17 of tesla even after recent market declines tesla has a market cap of close to 1 trillion which would thus account for about 170 billion of musk s net worth the other big contributor spacex is not traded publicly but barron s says that it is valued at about 100 billion based on its recent capital raises musk owns between 40 and 50 of spacex the entire revenue not earnings of spacex in 2021 was about 1 6 billion which should give you an idea of how speculative that 100 billion valuation is so let s consider how solid is the approximate 1 trillion current value of tesla in january tesla reported earnings for the full year 2021 as 5 5 billion that s quite an increase from only 721 million of profit in 2020 but still compared to a market cap of 1 trillion the 5 5 billion in earnings makes for a price earnings ratio of around 180 for comparison the average p e ratio for the s p 500 is running around 18 based on yesterday s close of 4128 and 2022 projected earnings of 228 there s nothing inherently crazy about a p e ratio of 180 for a company with excellent prospects for huge and rapid growth in the next few years indeed all of google facebook and amazon went public at huge valuations before they had much or any earnings at all the markets bet that they would shortly show large earnings acceleration and in each of these cases the markets were right there are plenty of other examples where the markets placed big bets on companies and turned out to be wrong are tesla s prospects really that good for massive growth within just a few years i m willing to concede that the tesla is a great car i ve never driven one and that musk is a genius but the truth is that even tesla s current sales are heavily dependent on government subsidies and to believe that tesla s sales will shortly mushroom by a factor of 50 or 100 you need to believe a series of increasingly implausible things that government subsidies will continue at current or even increasing levels this one is plausible if a bad idea that more and more people will be willing to pay premiums of 10 000 or 20 000 or more to get a vehicle that shows off climate virtue even if it has limited range and other performance shortcomings much less plausible than the previous proposition but not yet completely ridiculous that tesla and others will be able to ramp up battery production by orders of magnitude over the next very short number of years without running into supply constraints for things like lithium and cobalt that either limit production to much lower levels or alternatively drive prices through the roof the amounts of production of things like lithium and cobalt that are implicit in plans to electrify automotive transport are complete fantasies and finally that sufficient amounts of electricity supplied almost entirely by wind and sun will emerge to power a mostly electric automotive fleet to electrify the automotive fleet will require by itself almost doubling the current supply of electricity the idea that this can be done with wind and sun is completely ridiculous i have little doubt that musk himself has figured out that the value of the tesla company is ready for a big fall musk sold something in the range of 18 billion of tesla stock at the end of 2021 and now just sold another 8 5 billion in connection with raising equity for his purchase of twitter clearly he is limited in his ability to just walk away from tesla but he is certainly doing his best to diversify for the diversification project twitter is an inspired choice twitter has an excellent chance of seriously enhancing its future growth in new hands for reasons that i think are obvious over the past several years in the grip of its woke young staff twitter has intentionally driven away or limited the reach of easily half of its potential users now if musk follows through it can be fully open to everybody but is musk actually committed to free speech musk has recently said that he is close to a free speech absolutist but his record is not so clean tesla has long been the subject of a group of financial skeptics who have pointed out its inflated valuation and even recommended shorting the stock one of the most severe and long time critics of tesla s valuation is a guy who has written under the name montana skeptic at a site called seeking alpha montana skeptic using that same name has also been a commenter at this site from time to time montana skeptic also corresponded with me personally several times but requested that i not reveal his identity because he suspected that he might become the subject of retaliation and that his job as a money manager might be at risk it turns out that exactly that happened according to this piece at mediaite on april 26 in 2018 musk figured out the identity of montana skeptic and called his boss and threatened to sue a colleague relayed the billionaire s message elon musk says that you re a very bad person and you re writing bad things about him recalled the colleague explaining he s going to have to sue you and he s going to have to drag our boss into it after the phone call told his employer he would stop writing at seeking alpha and deactivate his twitter account he stated that while musk had no valid claim i m not going to drag my boss into a lawsuit he shouldn t have any part of with one weird but nevertheless heavy handed phone call musk silenced a prominent online critic it s just not in the nature of narcissistic big ego people to enjoy getting criticized so will elon musk turn twitter into an upstanding free speech platform it s hard to imagine that he will do a worse job than the prior management but there are limits to what we can hope for comments are closed
linda greenhouse reported on the supreme court for the new york times for 30 years since then she s appeared in the paper on a regular basis giving her fiercely pro choice opinions so it s no surprise she had a say about the shocking leak of a draft opinion that appears to overturn the supreme court s roe vs wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide sunday s edition featured greenhouse s the draft opinion s missing women yes the times headline is suggesting the abortion ruling is leaving out women this from the paper that has spent the last year or so often leaving out the word women in pregnancy related stories in order to appease radical transgenders but with the leak of justice samuel alito s opinion bizarre anti biological terminology like birthing persons has abruptly vanished from the paper s news coverage of roe v wade once again only women can get pregnant she began yes the leak of the draft opinion that would overturn roe v wade was a shock and it was shocking to read justice samuel alito s airy dismissal of a decision the supreme court has reaffirmed numerous times in the past 49 years as egregiously wrong from the start that was on page 6 of the draft opinion that politico published last monday and justice alito spent the next 61 pages explaining why in his view and perhaps ultimately in the view of four other justices the court needs to overturn roe now but the real shock to me was not what those 67 pages contain mostly warmed over stock phrases from the anti abortion playbook that read like a law clerk s cut and paste job but rather who is missing women the times casually mentioned near the end of a friday story about democrats in congress moving to codify roe into law that the democrats had scrapped from the bill the part about every person becoming pregnant greenhouse certainly didn t fool around talking about breastfeeding people or pregnant people but went all in in support of abortion in the name of women s rights the alito draft whitewashes decades of progress on women s rights it fails for example even to cite justice ginsburg s landmark 1996 majority opinion in united states v virginia that rejected the exclusion of women from the state supported virginia military institute perhaps this is ideological muscle memory at work liberal reporters are used to portraying abortion restrictions as old white males imposing legislation against women so that supposedly obsolete binary has re emerged automatically while the times coverage has been reliably biased at least in this case the return of women means a slight shift back toward biological reality greenhouse concluded after a nod to the mortifying breach of the leak itself with a plea to defend democracy from the vagaries of the judicial branch if a half century of progress toward a more equal society painstakingly achieved across many fronts by many actors can be so easily jettisoned with the wave of a few judicial hands the problem to worry about isn t the court s it s democracy s it s ours but wouldn t removing abortion from the hands of nine justices in robes and handing the issue back to the people i e the states to decide be the truly democratic action here

ruidoso n m although the flames may be extinguished the scorched trees and damaged property from april s mcbride fire have not gone away mayor of ruidoso lynn crawford said the fire and its aftermath have been an emotional rollercoaster for his constituents it s certainly gone from fear and not knowing what s going to happen to the point of now that we ve seen what the devastation was and now what do we have to do for the recovery now for the folks that have been impacted most said crawford on thursday the state responded by holding a cabinet in your community event at the ruidoso convention center so those affected most by the fires could speak with the heads of different state agencies and learn about the relief and services available to them we ve asked the governor to send those folks that have the stroke that have the ability to make things happen crawford said the most pressing issue is to find housing for those who have lost their homes to the mcbride fire in which 207 houses were destroyed crawford said 50 families are still in need of long term housing he noted that some owners of short term housing units have converted them into longer term housing where individuals can stay for up to a year however crawford said more long term solutions have to be found such as increasing affordable housing stock and helping people rebuild their homes something made harder by high inflation workforce shortages and soaring home prices many of those who have lost their homes are those who can least afford to do so such as those who do not have insurance the homes were are talking about are people who work they re families they re neighbors their kids who go to school here crawford said additionally the village s often booming tourism economy took a hit from the fire we had a lot of cancelations on our hotels our short term rentals a lot of bookings with our off road vehicles things like that all have gone down so we re now in the process of letting everyone know that we are open for business crawford said despite the challenges though crawford said the village has also been the recipient of much generosity in the form of donated food water and hygiene products and cash assistance for those who have lost their homes we ve received over 200 000 that we ve had the lincoln county community foundation that is writing those checks directly and putting them in the hands of those people that are affected he said on wednesday u s president joe biden an emergency declaration for new mexico due to the abundance of wildfires crawford said he hopes that will provide the village with additional resources for the recovery
the agm is back with a vengeance during the pandemic most annual general meetings were held digitally no doubt to the secret delight of many a chairman so much easier to control the proceedings at a virtual gathering than having to deal in person with shareholders and their awkward questions even pre covid some companies seemed reluctant to encounter a real live investor put on the spot the great thing about agms is that any investor or member in the case of a mutual has an equal right to be heard gambling giant entain liked to hold its meeting in gibraltar making it far less accessible for small uk shareholders a disgraceful stance for a ftse 100 company the agm is a unique fixture in the corporate calendar and the current season has been full of fireworks results announcements are usually dry affairs but the annual meeting is often a mix of student demo and village fete woke young protesters mingle with elderly private shareholders and all can have their say at barclays activists barracked the chairman and some glued their derrieres to the seats to make it harder to throw them out there were pay rows at ocado and gsk and drama at just eat which announced the resignation of its chairman and a probe into an executive just before the meeting began big shareholders try to engage with boards behind the scenes so it s quite rare for a large institutional investor to speak out when it does happen as in 2018 when the then head of stewardship at aberdeen standard addressed the hall at the persimmon meeting over former boss jeff fairburn s bloated pay it can have a potent effect the great thing about agms is that any investor or member in the case of a mutual has an equal right to be heard ordinary savers such as john higgins a long term member of mutual insurer lv can mount a challenge against the board mr higgins has already garnered huge backing ahead of lv s meeting this year for a vote of no confidence in the chief executive for his chaotic attempt to flog the insurer to private equity there is of course no excuse for violent or rude behaviour by shareholders protest at an investor meeting is however usually a sign of a company that has failed to listen confronting directors at the agm is the theatre of last resort it would pay boards to listen better investors who look ahead in their assessment of risks to the world economy frequently front run concerns that have yet to permeate through to wider consciousness protests about pollution climate change and going back apartheid are now part of the mainstream but had an early airing in boycotts and action to influence corporates many us firms see the positive power of agms to build their brand and use the meetings as spectacular marketing events one of the most memorable i attended was for starbucks in seattle in 2016 shareholders were treated to a rock concert alicia keys gave a performance and a political rally with founder howard schultz inveighing against trump ist politics there is no british equivalent to warren buffett s berkshire hathaway agm in nebraska a weekend festival for investors like glastonbury with spreadsheets here boards seem to view agms as at best a bit of a nuisance where even if there are no protests they have to make small talk with pensioners over the buffet in fact agms are an opportunity for boards to gain valuable insights at m s the meetings are famous for small investors supplying critiques of the underwear and fashion private shareholders can pose penetrating questions that put city analysts to shame

texas region known as big bend country in this remote corner of texas near the spectacular big bend national park explorers will discover treasures like a white walled lodge created by the young men of the civilian conservation corps the shady courtyards and graceful arches of hotels designed by early 20th century architect henry trost and accommodations that originated as a retreat for the summer swallows who flocked to the davis mountains for its cool summer weather regardless of the history though the modern day reality is that remarkable stays are in store for those traveling the scenic ranchland and big blue skies of west texas one of the beauties of the region s historic hotels is that many are located within a few hours of one another making for a convenient road trip on my two recent drives through west texas i found the combination of fascinating texas ranching stories and the hotels luxurious touches hard to resist here are six incredible historic hotels in texas s big bend country the hotel el capitan was built in 1930 photo credit cindy barks 1 hotel el capitan van horn the most accessible of the quartet of trost hotels operating in big bend country the hotel el capitan is located a block or two off interstate 10 in van horn along the route between el paso and major texas cities to the east including austin and san antonio el capitan was built in 1930 a design of henry trost the el paso architect behind more than 550 buildings from texas to california in the early 1900s occupying a prominent spot on the main street of van horn el capitan is known as a stopping off point for people traveling between texas s two national parks guadalupe mountains national park to the north and big bend national park to the south the first thing i loved about el capitan was the shady courtyard that fronts the hotel s entrance when i arrived after a long day of driving i was met with the sweet sound of running water from the fountain that sits in the center of the small courtyard el capitan s lobby is also distinctive with its european style tile and log beamed ceiling the hotel has 49 rooms and 12 of them have french doors that open onto small balconies that overlook the courtyard the adjoining el capitan restaurant and gopher hole bar is a popular establishment in van horn so it s advisable to ask about a time for dinner or lunch when checking in house favorites include texas classics like the pistachio fried steak the 14 ounce hand cut ribeye and the homemade pecan pie pro tip van horn is a railroad town and the el capitan is located right across the street from the train tracks guests should expect some train noise throughout the evening and night although the passing trains didn t interrupt my sleep i was told that light sleepers

as the home of one of the most iconic bars in texas back in the 1920s early west texas pioneer alfred s gage decided the little town of marathon needed a hotel to serve as a base for overseeing his ranching operation the hotel s website says he commissioned henry trost to design it and the gage hotel was born in 1927 an excellent example of mission and spanish style design even if you don t stay

what to make of the markets right now last week brought more losses in what s been a volatile year for stocks the five straight weeks of market declines marked the longest such streak in over a decade more ominously they came in along with a number of other disturbing data points the april jobs numbers released on friday came to 428 000 jobs added for the month superficially strong and well above the 391 000 expected but the labor remains depressed and the total number of workers even after a year of strong gains is still 1 2 million below its pre pandemic peak worse the 5 5 wage gains in april the fifth month in a row that wages grew more than 5 did not keep pace with the 8 5 annualized inflation rate workers are getting paid more but are still falling behind on top of that the high inflation rate has spurred the fed to start boosting interest rates the last increase of 0 5 was the largest increase in more than two decades and is already being reflected in higher bond yields the 10 year treasury note is above 3 and increasing mortgage rates advertisement advertisement for investors however conditions are pointing toward bargain hunting finding the stocks that are running cheap but with the potential for high returns in the long term with that in mind we ve used the data at tipranks to pull up three stocks that are showing 50 or greater losses for the year so far but that also show strong buy ratings from the street and the potential to double or more in the coming year here s the lowdown kornit digital krnt we ll start with a tech firm in the textile industry kornit bills itself as a global digital printing company specializing in high speed industrial grade ink jet printers along with pigments and chemical products for the garment apparel home goods and decorating sectors the company s machines are capable of printing complex designs directly onto finished textiles allowing fabric workers to call up patterned textiles on demand this frees up

solid revenue numbers with the q4 figure of 87 5 million being a company quarterly record the full year top line for 2021 was 322 million up 67 year over year the company was profitable with a 2 cent gaap earnings per diluted share in the quarter and 13 cents for the full year despite these positive metrics the company s stock is down 58 so far this year however 5 star analyst james ricchiuti from

watch ricchiuti s track record click here backing his bullish stance ricchiuti writes we believe the long term secular drivers that underpin our positive investment thesis on kornit are intact we

3 million even though the financials were on the surface solid the stock fell by a third after the release investors were somewhat spooked by a slowdown in revenue growth quarter over quarter the top line expanded only 6 6 a far cry from the 34 q q growth in fiscal 2q22 and looking forward the company gave fiscal q4 guidance in the range of 182 3 million to 183 3 million which even at the high end would be q q growth of less than 10 to date this year the stock is down 51 nevertheless canaccord s 5 star analyst joseph vafi remains bullish he writes of this company while no one knows the future of the macro right now we see bill as being relatively well positioned against the current backdrop except for its standout valuation which has clearly already come in materially with over 70 organic

u s accounting regulators are discussing a potential deal with their counterparts in beijing that could pave the way for american officials to inspect audits of chinese companies according to people briefed on the matter financial times reported a deal that would allow officials from the us public company accounting oversight board access to the audits could help resolve a stand off between washington and beijing and prevent about 270 chinese companies from being delisted by new york exchanges one of the options being discussed as part of the possible protocol would involve us officials travelling to china and inspecting some of the audits in person after a period of quarantine in the country which has a zero covid policy one of the people said the pcaob denied earlier reports by the financial times and reuters that its personnel were already in china and said they had not travelled there since 2017 adding that speculation about a final agreement remains premature the tensions have hammered investor confidence in chinese companies a senior executive at a large investor in china said there has to be a solution or the us capital market will be closed to chinese firms for good it comes a month after beijing revised some of its audit secrecy rules in an attempt to halt the escalating dispute with washington which if unresolved could result in companies with a combined market capitalisation of about 2 trillion being delisted in 2024 companies including ecommerce giant jd com tech group pinduoduo and state owned oil company china petroleum chemical corp were added to a list of entities facing possible delisting this week the securities and exchange commission started naming companies in march kicking off a three year countdown on delistings after years of simmering tensions over the issue and prompting a sharp sell off of chinese stocks last month fang xinghai vice chair of the csrc said he expected the two regulators would reach a compromise and that recent talks with the pcaob had been very smooth adding we have confidence to reach a deal in the near term and we believe this uncertainty will fade away soon his comments were made after the csrc said it would relax confidentiality laws that prevent its overseas listed companies from providing sensitive financial information to foreign regulators it was a significant concession to pressure from washington over access to audit documents but left some areas of concern as the new draft rules explicitly prevented companies from sharing state secrets last week goldman sachs published a report citing a senior executive of consultancy china moon strategies who said they believed there was a 90 percent chance china and the us would reach a compromise that would prevent the delistings china tends to wait until the last minute but this time could be different as the market is pushing the goldman report said it added the chinese companies were still welcome to raise capital in the us despite an effective halt to dealmaking since the calamitous initial public offering of ride hailing app didi chuxing last june when beijing launched a regulatory crackdown that caused its share price to fall 90 percent amid the tensions some chinese companies listed in new york have attempted to mitigate the delisting risk by switching auditors or launching secondary listings in hong kong this week ke holdings an online estate agent was the latest to issue shares on the hong kong exchange beigene a biotech group last month replaced its auditor ey s chinese member firm with ey in the us in an attempt to comply with audit access rules
by ju min park and joe brock sangdong south korea reuters blue tungsten winking from the walls of abandoned mine shafts in a town that s seen better days could be a catalyst for south korea s bid to break china s dominance of critical minerals and stake its claim to the raw materials of the future the mine in sangdong 180 km southeast of seoul is being brought back from the dead to extract the rare metal that s found fresh value in the digital age in technologies ranging from phones and chips to electric vehicles and missiles why reopen it now after 30 years because it means sovereignty over natural resources said lee dong seob vice president of mine owner almonty korea tungsten corp resources have become weapons and strategic assets sangdong is one of at least 30 critical mineral mines or processing plants globally that have been launched or reopened outside china over the last four years according to a reuters review of projects announced by governments and companies these include projects developing lithium in australia rare earths in the united states and tungsten in britain the scale of the plans illustrates the pressure felt by countries across the world to secure supplies of critical minerals regarded as essential for the green energy transition from lithium in ev batteries to magnesium in laptops and neodymium found in wind turbines overall demand for such rare minerals is expected to increase four fold by 2040 the international energy agency said last year for those used in electric vehicles and battery storage demand is projected to grow 30 fold it added many countries view their minerals drive as a matter of national security because china controls the mining processing or refining of many of these resources the asian powerhouse is the largest supplier of critical minerals to the united states and europe according to a study by the china geological survey in 2019 of the 35 minerals the united states has classified as critical china is the largest supplier of 13 including rare earth elements essential for clean energy technologies the study found china is the largest source of 21 key minerals for the european union such as antimony used in batteries it said in the critical raw material restaurant china is sitting eating its dessert and the rest of the world is in the taxi reading the menu said julian kettle senior vice president for metals and mining at consultancy wood mackenzie have to have a plan b the stakes are particularly high for south korea home of major chipmakers like samsung electronics otc the country is the world s largest consumer of tungsten per capita and relies on china for 95 of its imports of the metal which is prized for its unrivalled strength and its resistance to heat china controls over 80 of global tungsten supplies according to cru group london based commodity analysts the mine at sangdong a once bustling town of 30 000 residents that s now home to just 1 000 holds one of the world s largest tungsten deposits and could produce 10 of global supply when it opens next year according to its owner lewis black ceo of almonty korea s canadian based parent almonty industries told reuters that it planned to offer about half of the operation s processed output to the domestic market in south korea as an alternative to chinese supply it s easy to buy from china and china is the largest trading partner of south korea but they know they re over dependent black said you have to have a plan b right now sangdong s tungsten discovered in 1916 during the japanese colonial era was once a backbone of the south korean economy accounting for 70 of the country s export earnings in the 1960s when it was largely used in metal cutting tools the mine was closed in 1994 due to cheaper supply of the mineral from china which made it commercially unviable but now almonty is betting that demand and prices will continue to rise driven by the digital and green revolutions as well as a growing desire by countries to diversify their supply sources european prices of 88 5 minimum paratungstate the key raw material ingredient in tungsten products are trading around 346 per tonne up more than 25 from a year ago and close to their highest levels in five years according to pricing agency asian metal the sangdong mine is being modernised with vast tunnels being dug underground while work has also started on a tungsten crushing and grinding plant we should keep running this kind of mine so that new technologies can be handed over to the next generations said kang dong hoon a manager in sangdong where a pride of korea sign is displayed on a wall of the mine office we have been lost in the mining industry for 30 years if we lose this chance then there will be no more almonty industries has signed a 15 year deal to sell tungsten to pennsylvania based global tungsten powders a supplier to the u s military which variously uses the metal in artillery shell tips rockets and satellite antennae yet there are no guarantees of long term success for the mining group which is investing about 100 million in the sangdong project such ventures may still struggle to compete with china and there are concerns among some industry experts that developed countries will not follow through on commitments to diversify supply chains for critical minerals supply chain diplomacy seoul set up an economic security key items taskforce after a supply crisis last november when beijing tightened exports of urea solution which many south korean diesel vehicles are required by law to use to cut emissions nearly 97 of south korea s urea came from china at the time and shortages prompted panic buying at filling stations across the country the korean mine rehabilitation and resources corporation komir a government agency responsible for national resource security told reuters it had committed to subsidise about 37 of sangdong s tunnelling costs and would consider further support to mitigate any potential environmental damage incoming president yoon seok yeol pledged in january to reduce mineral dependence on a certain country and last month announced a new resource strategy that will allow the government to share stockpiling information with the private sector south korea is not alone the united states european union and japan have all launched or updated national critical mineral supply strategies over the last two years laying out broad plans to invest in more diversified supply lines to reduce their reliance on china mineral supply chains have also become a feature of diplomatic missions last year canada and the european union launched a strategic partnership on raw materials to reduce dependence on china while south korea recently signed collaboration deals with australia and indonesia on mineral supply chains supply chain diplomacy will be prioritised by many governments in the coming years as accessing critical raw materials for the green and digital transition has become a top priority said henning gloystein director of energy and climate resources at the eurasia group consultancy in november china s top economic planner said it would step up exploration of strategic mineral resources including rare earths tungsten and environmental opposition investment globally of 200 billion in additional mining and smelter capacity is needed to meet critical mineral supply demand by 2030 10 times what is being committed currently kettle said yet projects have faced resistance from communities who don t want a mine or smelter near their homes in january for example pressure from environmentalists prompted serbia to revoke rio tinto nyse s lithium exploration licence while u s president joe biden s administration cancelled two leases for antofagasta lon s copper and nickel mines in minnesota in sangdong some residents are doubtful that the mine will improve their lives many of us in this town didn t believe the mine would really come back said kim kwang gil 75 who for decades lived off the tungsten he panned from a stream flowing down from the mine when it operated the mine doesn t need as many people as before because everything is done by machines

soya bean is often cited as one of the key contributors of greenhouse gas emissions ghgs from pig farms with all livestock sectors now facing moral and government driven pressures to reduce their ghgs many producers are now looking to move away from soya beans and replace them with lower emission sources of protein to date alternatives have been limited however there is a strong belief that protein from insects could now help fill that gap this was highlighted at the insects as food and feed conference 26 27 april 2022 hosted by the royal society of entomology res so what are the prospects the opportunities and the potential barriers for insect protein in pig diets see also how a layer producer is cutting carbon footprint with maggots prospects arnold van huis from wageningen university and research in the netherlands recently published an entomological research paper looking into the challenges and prospects for edible insects he says most insect production is targeted towards the pet food industry however growth is expected for use in pig and poultry feed over the coming years while a few species can be used as a protein source the one looking most promising for feed markets is the black soldier fly globally this insect can be fed as an adult fly protein meal or as larvae prof van huis says soya bean meal accounts for about 85 of the protein supplements fed to pigs and the black soldier fly has the potential to partially replace this black soldier fly larvae can be reared on a wide range of cheap feed sources and substrates including food waste and require much less space to grow than more traditional protein sources slaughterhouse products manure catering waste and supermarket products containing meat or fish cannot be used when rearing insects for animal feed as laid out in food hygiene legislation opportunities developments in insect genetics improved animal health as a result of feeding on insect protein and the potential to use insect by products such as frass the waste from insect larvae in wider agriculture are among potential opportunities insect production breeding insects suited to commercial production is a key focus for desmond cave of genetics firm beta bugs based at the roslin innovation centre in scotland he has been working on the development of the black soldier fly for the past two and a half years while the black soldier fly has been farmed commercially for some time mr cave says the genetic improvement to allow large scale production has not always been sufficient we re concentrating on improving this by selectively breeding the black soldier fly our larvae are heavier than the standard fly and grow more quickly and the adult flies produce more eggs one gram of eggs from a standard fly grown over a year could produce about 104kg of larvae in comparison a gram of genetically improved eggs could produce in the region of 226kg of larvae a year beta bugs is also aiming to improve mass development time hatch rate and the number of eggs laid by the adult fly he adds pig health various studies have shown beneficial health effects when animals are fed black soldier fly and or its larvae explains prof van huis they include less diarrhoea better immune response and improved small intestinal morphology which is linked with good gut health choi et al 2020 an antimicrobial effect on gram positive bacteria due to the lauric acid found in black soldier flies spranghers et al 2018 similar amino acid digestibility and growth compared with soya and fish meal veldkamp and vernooij 2021 reduced tail biting when fed live black soldier fly larvae ipema et al 2021 further research has shown feeding black soldier fly larvae can also potentially reduce ammonia pollution from livestock manure he adds barriers legislation and cost were the two biggest barriers highlighted at the conference under eu legislation insect processed animal proteins paps including the black soldier fly have been allowed in pig and poultry feed since 2021 this is not yet the case for uk farmers explains rachel o connor partner in the agricultural team at michelmores solicitors she says what is now uk domestic legislation is reflective of a snapshot of what eu law looked like on 31 december 2020 and does not encompass changes that have been made in the eu since then these include changes to feed ban rules which now allow the use of insects as feed in european pig and poultry production while this is not yet applicable to uk farmers this decision is reflective of where we could and should be going she adds the world wide fund for nature wwf is among the non government organisations driving a campaign to change this in its 2021 roadmap to accelerating insect protein in uk feeds pdf report the wwf urges the uk government to introduce legislation that permits the use of insect meal in pig and poultry feed and broadens the range of feedstocks that can be used to farm insects it also says pig and poultry sectors need to advocate for the legislative changes required feeding black solider fly larvae is however permitted for feeding to pigs under current uk legislation see understanding the black soldier fly prof van huis adds that the cost of insect meal is currently still higher than the comparable price of soya bean this presents another challenge to its wide scale adoption

the projections median forecast in bloomberg s survey was for cny6 6379 europe it almost seems that the bank of england goes out of its way to keep the market wrongfooted the boe delivered the 25 bp rate hike indicated that rates would likely rise further and said by the way the economy will contract sharply in q4 and 2023 as a whole before stagnating in 2024 and by the way a technical recession two quarters of shrinking output may be avoided the vote to hike was with a 6 3 majority despite the dour economic forecast the dissenters favored a 50 bp hike concerned about wage growth the swaps market has 30 bp of tightening priced in for the june 16 meeting the boe also announced it would sell its corporate bond holdings in september it has a more passive approach to its government bond holdings as they mature the proceeds will not be reinvested the boe estimates that it may cost 600k jobs to bring inflation under control reports indicated that boe governor bailey will not take a raise this year but the focus is on what the government says about the tips for employees in the queen s speech that lays out the parliamentary program the tories have long promised to ensure that employees keep the tips have not carried through with it the reduction of cash payments also means that the tips are increasingly charged taking it out of the employee hands the issue may also take on a larger political significance given the largest cost of living squeeze in a generation and in the face of regressive policies separately the votes are still being counted in the yesterday s local elections in which the tories appear to have lost many councils however the fact that the lib dems may emerge as the chief beneficiary rather than labour is notable following the sharp slide in factory orders yesterday germany reported that industrial output collapsed by 4 7 in march this is more than four times more than the median forecast in bloomberg s survey spain s industrial production was forecast to fall by 0 5 instead it contracted by 1 8 the aggregate figure for the eurozone will be reported at the end of next week and the 0 8 median forecast in bloomberg s survey will have to be re thought the euro came within about a tenth of a cent from the multi year low set in late april slightly above 1 0470 before bouncing in early european turnover to 1 0580 it stalled there the market may be hesitant to take it further ahead of the us jobs report there are options for almost 600 mln euros at 1 06 that expire today the high for the week was recorded yesterday near 1 0640 a move above there would target 1 07 after an outside up day on wednesday sterling reversed lower yesterday despite the boe s hike it collapsed 2 and fell to 1 2325 the losses were extended to nearly 1 2275 today a break of the 1 2250 area could spur losses toward 1 2075 on the way to 1 20 of note the lower bollinger band two standard deviations below the 20 day moving average is around 1 2235 now initial resistance is seen in the 1 2380 1 2400 area america the main narrative that seems to have emerged is that fed chair made what some have dubbed an unforced error in taking a 75 bp off the table but was it ever really on the table yes the fed funds futures market had thought it was possible in the coming meeting or two this was a fantasy of speculators and was not a policy signal the market and some in the media who cover them simply read the fed wrong and then blamed the fed the most hawkish fomc member is the st louis fed president bullard in the context of talking about how the central bank is not as far behind the curve as it may appear using his own calculation of the taylor rule which links the gdp and labor market output gaps to the overnight target rate bullard said 75 bp move could be considered at some juncture he quickly added that was not his base case it does not seem as if any other fed official endorsed a 75 bp hike and some pushed against it central bankers seem to be characterizing their challenge as threading a needle push the inflation genie back into the bottle without driving the economies into recessions powell is leading down the middle a steady and predictable course might be the best tactic now strategic ambiguity may be the more traditional approach but these are not traditional times it seems common at recent fomc meetings for the market to react one way initially and subsequently reverse it this time it was exaggerated in both directions the market corrected itself yesterday without a word from a fed official in fact the market has about a one in four chance that the fed hikes by 75 bp at the june 15 meeting we note that several fed presidents will be speaking today williams kashkari bostic and daly as the vice chair of the fomc ny fed president williams has a permanent vote he can also be expected to articulate the opinion of the leadership governor waller speaks with bostic and is seen as among the more hawkish governors solid but a bit slower job growth may be exactly to the fed s liking the median forecast in bloomberg s survey has slipped recently but at 380k it is still a good number at the same time it would the slowest since last april nonfarm payrolls rose by an average of 562k in the first quarter in q1 21 average job growth was 645k the risk may be on the downside after the ism and adp reports weekly jobless claims rose a little a rise in the participation rate is also something that the fed would like to see a greater participation rate would ostensibly help curb rising labor costs the participation rate was at 63 3 before the pandemic and was at 62 4 in march anecdotal stories suggest it ticked up canada which also reports its april jobs data has seen its participation rate nearly fully return to pre pandemic levels it was at 65 5 at the end of 2019 and 65 4 in march canada grew 70k jobs a month in q1 of which 44k were full time positions in q1 21 job growth averaged 114k a month and 88k of them were full time the market goes into the jobs data with 50 bp hike priced in for canada on june 1 after approaching cad1 27 yesterday the us dollar surged to nearly cad1 2870 as us stocks cratered the greenback s high recorded on monday was the high for the year by cad1 2915 it is consolidating ahead of the job reports and is holding above cad1 2800 a convincing break of cad1 2770 would weaken the us dollar s technical tone there is an expiring option for 1 4 bln at cad1 2840 the equity market performance may be just as important for the exchange rate today as employment reports the us dollar has been in a roughly mxn20 00 mxn20 31 range for the past two sessions it peaked on monday near mxn20 50 initial support is in the mxn20 10 mxn20 15 area april cpi will be released next week and it is expected to have accelerated but the highlight next week is the central bank meeting a 50 bp hike is widely expected and the risk is a 75 bp move rather than 25 bp

it was a turbulent week for markets after the us federal reserve raised interest rates by 0 5 at its may board meeting this outcome was expected by the market and economists and the market actually rose from comments by fed chair powell that 0 75 rate rises were not something that the committee is actively considering which alleviated fears of an extremely aggressive short term rate hike profile from the fed the market pushed out us interest rate hikes further over the next 1 2 years with us interest rates now expected to reach close to 4 in a year which looks too elevated we think rates will peak closer to 3 the initial post fed rally was more than reversed the next day with us shares still 0 4 higher over the week but about 10 below their march peak with the tech heavy nasdaq faring even worse down by 22 since its early 2022 high australian shares are 3 4 lower over the week but have outperformed over the past few months compared to global counterparts because of our lower relative

golden week and chinese shares were down by 0 7 although markets were also mostly closed because of the labor day public holiday in the short term the outlook for shares is still messy and there may be more downside as markets worry about a significant economic slowdown or hard landing and aggressive interest rate hikes but signs of us inflation peaking and solid economic fundamentals strong

dovetailed with equity markets which closed down last friday with tech heavy nasdaq sinking 1 4 a day after tumbling 5 the latter its worst performance since 2020 the s p 500 and dow jones industrial average fell in smaller increments but continued their downturn following the u s central bank s widely expected half point interest rate hike last wednesday a day later the bank of england boe continued its own more hawkish monetary path raising rates a quarter of a point to their highest level in 13 years it was boe s fourth straight interest rate increase since december central banks in other parts of the world have followed similar strategies to tame inflation that has reached 40 year highs and threatens to rise further amid the fallout from russia s invasion of ukraine meanwhile on friday the latest u s labor department jobs report which showed a better than expected gain of 428 000 jobs in april underscored concerns that a historically tight jobs market would increase wages and accelerate inflation during the first quarter of this year u s employers paid workers 1 4 more on average than during the prior three month period according to the report it was the biggest jump in two decades dipasquale expects bitcoin to decline further especially as monetary policy continues to contract but does not see the largest crypto by market cap falling below the 25 000 to 30 000 range even if a downturn reaches extreme proportions but he also noted that a bounce in the near term cannot be ruled out as may s options expiry of approximately 1 3 billion on the bitcoin futures exchange deribit approaches insights should the bitmex co founders have fought the case against them arthur hayes and bitmex both decided separately that they would plead guilty to the charges before them and pay fines to settle their respective cases with the feds with hayes and bitmex s other co founders each being ordered to pay a 10 million fine at the end of last week this as we ve discussed before is too bad because the case against them relied on a novel interpretation of the bank secrecy act and a confirmation that the commodity futures trading commission cftc really has extraterritorial authority this type of litigation is expensive and stressful and so it s understandable why someone might want to call it quits instead of going through with it but now as hayes awaits sentencing we are no further ahead in obtaining regulatory clarity than we were before terraform labs case against the u s securities and exchange commission is working its way through the legal system but it will be months if not longer before it s in front of a judge in the meantime as sam bankman fried the founder of the ftx crypto exchange pointed out in a recent interview the power struggle between the cftc and the sec has resulted in the regulatory environment being stalled we re not actually in a place with more federal oversight than we were in a year ago he told blockworks arguing that if the sec and cftc could agree on who is responsible for licensing cryptocurrency exchanges it would solve 60 of the problem the cftc claims that the commodity exchange act of 1934 gives it authority over crypto which it calls a currency and thus allows it to regulate the derivatives market for crypto which is what bitmex specializes in at the same time the sec s regulatory mandate comes from testing if a specific cryptocurrency or a product involving the coin constitutes a security the fact remains that digital assets like cryptocurrencies do not fit neatly into the sec s regulatory framework bo howell a ohio based securities lawyer wrote in a post explaining the contested authority over crypto in theory one should regulate the markets and one should regulate the commodity itself but a pathway needs to be set first sec chairman gary gensler said last month that it s a work in progress but hasn t given a road map of when something like a memorandum of understanding would be released for regulating the intertwined market ideally this would be through legislation in previous interviews ex cftc enforcement attorney braden perry has warned about the dangers of regulation by enforcement as opposed to a defined regulatory framework but another alternative would be via legal precedent if hayes or bitmex had decided to fight the feds they might have actually forced a resolution in the case of which agency takes the lead on regulating the crypto market technician s take bitcoin weekly price chart shows support resistance damanick dantes coindesk tradingview bitcoin

it would be a sad end to an amazing story an economic miracle one that lifted 300 million people from poverty and shifted the world s economic center of gravity collapsing under the weight of risky investments and a financial crisis this seems to be the theme about the chinese economy of many commentaries in the international media following the recent stock market turbulence and changes in the exchange rate mechanism growth collapse to as low as 1 to 2 percent has been suggested the volatility in the stock market seems to have confirmed the most pessimistic claims luckily the outlook of the real economy is not always well captured by stock price movement as paul samuelson famously quipped the stock market has called nine of the last five recessions the idea that the chinese economy is entering a deep slide just isn t supported by the totality of the evidence to be sure a slowdown in the country s gdp growth is real reflecting changes in domestic fundamentals including less favorable demographic forces and higher wage costs a shift toward service sector development and domestic consumption with less emphasis on exports and investment and lower demand from weak advanced markets however the recent turbulence in the stock market and the exchange rate movement are not a predictor of an imminent collapse in growth nor are they a harbinger of a global recession it s true that growth in china decelerated more than expected in the first half of 2015 growth in fixed investment and trade has looked particularly weak if one wants to look for reasons to be pessimistic one can find them but other important indicators show an uptick such as retail sales and housing perhaps most importantly labor markets remain healthy as shown by the 7 2 million net new urban jobs particularly in services in the first half of the year this has been coupled by strong uninterrupted wage growth for this reason while the growth rate for the whole year may end up somewhat lower than 7 percent i think it will not be too far from the authorities target of about 7 percent but can we ignore what the stock price is telling us about the real economy stock price movements generally do not tell a lot about the real economy over the medium term for example when the real economy in china was growing strongly during from 2010 to 2013 stock prices fell by contrast just as stock prices skyrocketed in the first half of 2015 the slowdown of the real economy was taking place the reasons are not hard to understand for one firms listed on chinese stock exchanges simply aren t very representative of the universe of chinese companies for example while a majority of state owned firms account for two thirds of listed firms in terms of market value they account for no more than one third of gdp and an even smaller share of employment moreover the market has substantially more retail investors and fewer institutional investors a sharp contrast to more developed markets in the united states or europe while many institutional investors look at long term fundamentals which help to stabilize the market most retail investors tend to focus on short term gains and momentum trading which tend to magnify the volatility markets with such an investor base tend to create more of a disconnect between stock price movements and real economic growth to understand the run up of stock prices one needs to look at the fact that chinese have limited investment options and that deposit interest rates were held down by a ceiling until recently this was coupled in the first half of the year by editorials in major chinese dailies that encouraged an optimistic view of stock prices when the alternatives are limited and they don t pay well a positive story about the stock market looks even more attractive by the same logic some of the stock price adjustment may be a consequence of several developments in the economy these include the talk of removal of the deposit interest rate ceiling which was eventually implemented more widely available shadow banking products that offer a better interest rate than traditional bank deposits and increased ease with which wealthy households can take their savings out of the country bundled with an anticipated increase in the u s interest rate by having more alternatives many with higher returns to investing in the stock market households would find it sensible to relocate part of their savings out of the domestic stock market leading to some downward pressure on prices in addition as harvard s jeffrey frankel has pointed out regulators increased margin requirements several times this year making it harder to buy stocks on borrowed money this also added a push factor to the previous list of pull factors while china has a good chance to continue to achieve relatively strong growth it is not automatic and would require vigorous policy reforms while the country has policy space to lower required reserve by banks and lower interest rates i favor other policy reforms that can simultaneously promote desirable structural changes in the economy reforms of state owned firms together with changes in the financial sector that would allow more resources to flow to the most productive firms would be very meaningful the time has also come for a fiscal reform that lowers the tax burden of firms including the payroll tax while china used to have one of the most flexible labor markets adjusting the workforce based on market needs has become more difficult for firms in recent years reforms that improve the flexibility of the labor market are also in order while labor market reform may not stimulate short term growth it will help the country to improve resilience to future negative shocks whether they originate at

technology being the worst performers the best performers were energy materials and utilities geopolitical conflict and corresponding economic consequences took the spotlight for the quarter russia invaded ukraine by attacking major cities such as kyiv kharkiv and mariupol as a result of the war many western countries imposed sweeping economic sanctions on russia including freezing the assets of russia s central bank and removed russian banks from the international financial messaging system swift russia s invasion of ukraine created a grave humanitarian crisis and exacerbated preexisting concerns surrounding inflation and global trade relations the war and subsequent sanctions have caused further supply chain disruptions spiked prices of commodities such as wheat and oil deflated global growth estimates and renewed tensions between the u s and china nevertheless central bank reactions to current global economic conditions and the conflict in ukraine have been mixed the european central bank stated that it will wait until the final months of the year before it raises interest rates for the first time in over a decade meanwhile the u s federal reserve has already completed its first rate increase since 2018 and has communicated its view that further hikes will be appropriate however the people s bank of china has taken the opposite approach by reiterating

rational amgen amgn nemetschek otcpk nemtf click to enlarge lennar one of the nation s largest homebuilders was a primary detractor for the quarter the combination of rising home values and higher mortgage rates in the u s has reduced homeownership affordability causing concern of a slowdown in the housing market while we recognize higher mortgage rates reduce affordability we also recognize there is a supply deficit caused by nearly 10 years of new home construction lagging demand despite rising construction and land costs lennar s profitability has increased with the company s year over year home sales gross margin expanding 190 basis points to 26 9 first quarter new orders and home deliveries also exceeded management s expectations and the firm raised its home delivery target for fiscal year 2022 with increased free cash flow as both margins and volume increased lennar continued to buy back shares and the board approved a 50 increase in the annual dividend as well as an additional 2 billion stock repurchase authorization over 8 of the current market cap lennar s conservative capital allocation and prudent inventory management have allowed and we believe will continue to allow the company to overcome higher interest rates cameco the world s largest publicly traded uranium producer was a primary contributor for the quarter after years of stringent operational discipline that included production cuts inventory reduction and market purchases the company has reported strengthening market fundamentals as industry wide supply concerns continue to abate the improving conditions can provide cameco significant leverage to drive higher prices under its market related contracts moreover the company has obtained 70 million pounds of additional long term contracts since the beginning of 2021 demonstrating cameco s strong position to capture increasing demand nevertheless management has reiterated its commitment to maintaining supply discipline while continuing to invest in operational efficiency through automation digitization and training as such the company expects to see significant improvements in cash flow generation as it ramps up to its 2024 planned production capacity we believe cameco s disciplined approach and conservative financial management continue to reinforce its long term position and its ability to return value to shareholders this was recently demonstrated when cameco s board approved a 50 increase to the company s annual dividend for 2022 recent portfolio activity during the quarter we sold our investments in axalta coating systems axta bank of america bac chubb cb dassault systã mes otcpk dasty and walgreens boots alliance wba and invested in brookfield asset management bam dolby laboratories dlb fmc and michelin otcpk mgddy although we were more active than normal this quarter we want to stress that this is not a reaction to the current economic conditions all portfolio activity is a reflection of our underlying investment philosophy and process buys sells brookfield asset management axalta coating systems dolby laboratories bank of america fmc chubb michelin dassault systã mes walgreens boots alliance click to enlarge we became owners of axalta a coatings provider primarily to the auto industry in the third quarter of 2016 during our more than five year holding period the company has successfully enhanced its free cash flow through cost reductions and low requirements of maintenance capital expenditures it has used this cash to in part participate in further industry consolidation the company has battled supply chain headwinds in recent years but we still think highly of axalta s competitive advantages which include its scale pricing power and strong oem relationships however we decided axalta was the best candidate for sale to fund what we believe is a more attractive investment in fmc in addition given this quarter s purchase of michelin we thought it prudent to balance our exposure to the auto industry we first invested in bank of america during the second quarter of 2013 during our near decade as investors bank of america closed the chapter on the legacy issues from acquired countrywide including mortgage write downs and substantial legal charges in addition it successfully turned the merrill lynch franchise into one of the leading u s brokerage and advisory firms thanks to what we consider to be a strong management team led by ceo brian moynihan the bank went through years of simplification improved its cost structure and efficiency ratio and reduced risk while we believe bank of america remains a much improved market leader we decided to exit our position and use the proceeds to invest in brookfield asset management our investment in chubb began in the fourth quarter of 2015 shortly after ace limited announced it would acquire the chubb corporation creating the largest global property and casualty insurance company by underwriting income during our nearly seven year holding period the company s combination progressed leading to the realization of main catalysts we had identified these included cost savings broadened product offerings and an expanded customer base as well as enhanced distribution capabilities and improved pricing due to scale in addition chubb successfully grew its profitable high net worth personal lines while we still consider chubb to be a high quality business few catalysts remain after what was in our opinion a remarkable run of successful business execution as such we decided to step aside in favor of what we believe to be a more optimal investment in blackstone we have owned dassault for the better part of a decade having invested in this business for our global equity portfolios in the third quarter of 2014 with 90 of all aircraft and 80 of all autos globally made via dassault software we believe the company will stay well entrenched in engineering teams catalysts still developing include continued adoption of its 3dexperience platform which connects much of dassault s offerings in one place in our view this will further drive already significant switching costs and network effects allowing the business to increase its platform revenue as such we continue to own the company in our international equity portfolios however we made the decision to sell dassault in our global equity portfolios to fund what we believe to be a more optimal investment in u s based dolby laboratories we first invested in walgreens boots alliance in early 2013 over our holding period walgreens merged with u k based boots alliance establishing itself as a global leading retail pharmacy chain ceo stefano pessina set the company on a path of pursuing strategic partnerships as opposed to vertical integration deals to increase store traffic and to over time transform the business into a neighborhood health destination around a more modern pharmacy using its strong free cash flow generation the company ramped up its investments in technology aiming to accelerate the digitalization of health information mr pessina was not successful however at turning around the firm s u s retail segment and had to deal with increasing prescription drug reimbursement pressures he stepped down as ceo in 2020 and in 2021 roz brewer took the reins of the firm we admire ms brewer s impressive track record at companies that include starbucks sbux and walmart sam s club however given management s decision to divest core cash generative businesses and redeploy capital to embryonic healthcare startups we prefer to step aside while we follow the company s progress brookfield asset management inc canada based brookfield asset management is one of the largest and most diversified private market investors in the world with 690 billion in assets under management aum brookfield is an owner and operator of infrastructure 19 of fee earning aum real estate 17 renewable energy 15 private equity 6 public securities 4 and more recently credit 39 by acquiring a majority interest in oaktree capital management in addition to managing client assets it invests capital from its own balance sheet alongside outside investors and though brookfield is a new purchase for our global equity portfolios we have been owners of brookfield in our international equity portfolios for more than a decade brookfield has a differentiated investing approach from many by taking on the challenge of improving operations at the companies it owns with less of an emphasis on altering capital structures the investments brookfield targets are ones they consider to be high quality assets under the surface but have otherwise run into significant operational headwinds such as poor management or tough industry dynamics this can allow brookfield to purchase assets at attractive valuations and subsequently work to improve them operationally the foundation of brookfield s investing platform is traditional private drawdown funds from which it earns management and performance fees in addition brookfield has partial ownership in four publicly traded investment vehicles from which it earns fees for managing the investments and pro rata distributions of corporate profits high quality business some of the quality characteristics we have identified for brookfield include strong positioning from its scale and brand power being either a leader in its respective asset classes real estate infrastructure renewable energy distressed credit or nimble enough in more competitive markets to meaningfully expand private equity skilled management with a long history of operating expertise which we view as a competitive advantage in bidding for deals and generating superior investment returns and demonstrated stable cash flows from long term fee streams as more than half of its capital is locked up for more than 10 years attractive valuation shares of brookfield are priced at a discount relative to our estimates of intrinsic value on a normalized basis it is our view that earnings will be greater than what is currently assumed by the market compelling catalysts catalysts we have identified for brookfield which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three to five year investment horizon include owing to its quality assets and efficiently run structure brookfield is well situated to take advantage of the continued institutional shift toward real assets high demand for capital in renewable energy feeds into brookfield s competencies and market position very few competitors have both the scale and expertise to capitalize on this trend brookfield s recognized leadership and experience investing in infrastructure can provide a strong competitive advantage to bid and operate assets that are increasingly sold by governments to pay down debt and improved penetration in retail channels as brookfield s scale can provide a distinct advantage in this still

consumer electronics 15 pc 12 and other 12 high quality business some of the quality characteristics we have identified for dolby laboratories include decades long market leadership in a near monopolistic environment as dolby s technologies are widely considered industry standards for example dolby has won the format war in spatial audio with dolby atmos and for hi def with dolby vision pricing power and sticky customers since licensing for dolby s technology represents a very low percentage of a product s total cost but is critical to a customer s buying decision and its 10 000 patents the very complex nature of its technology and its already firmly in place network effects create high barriers to entry for would be competition attractive valuation we believe shares of dolby laboratories are undervalued by the market given our estimates of higher normalized free cash flow from expanded adoption of its product suite and growing addressable market compelling catalysts catalysts we have identified for dolby laboratories which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three to five year investment horizon include continued market share gains for dolby atmos and dolby vision as more oems prioritize quality of sound and visuals in devices tvs phones headsets tablets pcs videogames etc and further adoption of dolby io a platform that enables

do not negatively impact their harvest headquartered in philadelphia pennsylvania the company has a rich history dating back to 1883 when inventor john bean set out to build a better insecticide spray pump over the decades through acquisitions fmc became a disparate collection of chemical companies fmc has transformed itself to solely focus on crop chemicals having acquired dupont s crop chemicals portfolio in 2017 and completed the separation of its lithium business in 2019 fmc is now one of the largest patented crop protection companies globally its presence is balanced both geographically around the world as well as from a crop exposure standpoint with soybeans being the largest at roughly 20 of total revenue in terms of products fmc s portfolio skews toward insecticides which account for over 60 of its revenue the remainder are herbicides 25 as well as fungicides and other crop chemicals 15 high quality business some of the quality characteristics we have identified for fmc include strong portfolio of brands allowing for differentiation outside of price as many customers refer to the brand name not the active ingredient strong competitive position with many products being either protected by patents or niche products perhaps unlikely to be targeted by generics oligopolistic industry as fmc is one of just five companies that collectively contribute the majority of research and development performed on crop protection chemicals and capable management team with operational experience and ability to commercialize new products attractive valuation we believe fmc s current stock price is offered at a discount to our determination of the company s intrinsic value given our estimates of both enhanced margins and higher earnings on a normalized basis compelling catalysts catalysts we have identified for fmc which we believe will cause its stock price to appreciate over our three to five year investment horizon include fmc is poised to benefit from its focus on crop chemicals as yield gains are needed to support rising food consumption in emerging markets continued margin improvements from its product pipeline these new products should be particularly effective against insects weeds and fungi that have grown resistant to traditional crop chemicals and further cross selling of fmc products to dupont customers for example in argentina 78 of the customers it gained from the dupont acquisition were unique to fmc providing cross selling opportunities compagnie gã nã rale des ã tablissements michelin founded in 1889 compagnie gã nã rale des ã

earnings power relative to the overall auto industry due to the critical need for tires attractive valuation given our estimates of normalized earnings we believe michelin s current stock price is offered at a discount to our estimate of the company s intrinsic value specifically we believe various initiatives will lead to higher market share and normalized margins for the business compelling

rule are to ensure the farm credit system s system capital requirements including certain regulatory disclosures reflect the current expected credit losses methodology cecl which revises the accounting for credit losses under u s gaap and ensure conforming amendments to other regulations accurately reference credit losses b background in 1916 congress created the system to provide permanent stable affordable and reliable sources of credit and related services to american agricultural and aquatic producers 1 as of january 1 2022 the system consists of three farm credit banks one agricultural credit bank 64 agricultural credit associations one federal land credit association several service corporations and the federal farm credit banks funding corporation funding corporation system banks including both the farm credit banks and the agricultural credit bank issue systemwide consolidated debt obligations in the capital markets through the funding corporation 2 which enables the system to extend short intermediate and long term credit and related services to eligible borrowers eligible borrowers include farmers ranchers aquatic producers and harvesters their cooperatives rural utilities exporters of agricultural commodities products farm related businesses and certain rural homeowners the system s enabling statute is the farm credit act of 1971 as amended act 3 footnote 1 the federal agricultural mortgage corporation farmer mac was chartered in 1987 as a farm credit system institution farmer mac operates secondary market activities for agricultural real estate mortgage loans rural housing mortgage loans rural utility cooperative loans and agriculture and rural development loans guaranteed by the united states department of agriculture usda the fca has a separate set of capital regulations at subpart b of part 652 that apply to farmer mac this rulemaking does not affect farmer mac and the use of the term system institution in this preamble and rule does not include farmer mac end footnote footnote 2 the funding corporation was established pursuant to section 4 9 of the farm credit act of 1971 as amended and is owned by all system banks the funding corporation is the fiscal agent and disclosure agent for the system the funding corporation is responsible for issuing and marketing debt securities to finance the system s loans leases and operations and for preparing and producing the system s financial results end footnote footnote 3 12 u s c 2001 2279cc the act is available at www fca gov under laws and regulations and statutes end footnote on september 23 2019 fca published in the federal register a notice of proposed rulemaking proposed rule or proposal seeking public comment on revisions to certain regulations to address

otherwise directed by statutory and regulatory requirements previously fca had issued an informational memorandum providing initial information on the new accounting standard see informational memorandum new accounting standard on financial instruments credit losses dated september 1 2016 end footnote footnote 5 fca regulation sec 628 2 defines system institution for capital rule purposes as a system bank an association and any other institution chartered by the fca that the fca determines should be subject to fca s capital rules end footnote asu 2016 13 introduces cecl which replaces the incurred loss methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost this update is discussed in more detail in the next section overview of changes to u s gaap fca proposed to revise the tier 1 tier 2 capital rule in part 628 to distinguish which credit loss allowances under the new accounting standard would be eligible for inclusion in a system institution s regulatory capital fca s tier 1 tier 2 capital rule in part 628 are similar to the standardized approach capital rules the federal banking regulatory agencies fbras 6 adopted for the banking organizations they regulate u s rule while taking into account the cooperative structure and the organization of the system fca s proposed cecl rule was similar to the fbras final cecl rule which was published in february 2019 7 footnote 6 the fbras are the office of the comptroller of the currency the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal deposit insurance corporation end footnote footnote 7 see fbra s final cecl rule at 84 fr 4222 february 14 2019 fca staff met with system representatives during the development of fca s proposed rule to seek their input on certain issues the questions discussed were similar to the questions asked in the preamble to the fbras proposed cecl rule 83 fr 22312 may 14 2018 fca staff considered this input in developing the proposed rule end footnote unlike the cecl rule adopted by the fbras fca did not propose a phase in of the day one impacts of cecl on regulatory capital ratios the cecl transition provision section below discusses why a transition period for system institutions is unnecessary and would create undue burden and complexity as part of efforts to address the disruption of economic activity in the united states caused by the spread of covid 19 the fbras adopted a second cecl transition provision 8 this second cecl transition provided banking organizations that were required to adopt cecl for purposes of u s gaap on january 1 2020 the option to delay for up to two years an estimate of cecl s impact on regulatory capital followed by a three year transition period i e a five year transition period in total footnote 8 see 85 fr 17723 march 31 2020 interim final rule 85 fr 61577 september 30 2020 final rule end footnote as discussed below fca received four comment letters on the proposed rule these comments together with fca s responses to those comments are addressed in the final rule section below fca is finalizing most provisions as proposed however fca is making changes to certain provisions in response to comments as discussed below c overview of changes to u s gaap in june 2016 fasb issued asu no 2016 13 topic 326 financial instruments credit losses 9 which revises the accounting for credit losses under u s gaap in pertinent part asu no 2016 13 footnote 9 asu 2016 13 covers measurement of credit losses on financial instruments and includes three subtopics within topic 326 i subtopic 326 10 financial instruments credit losses overall ii subtopic 326 20 financial instruments credit losses measured at amortized cost and iii subtopic 326 30 financial instruments credit losses available for sale debt securities end footnote introduces cecl which replaces the incurred loss methodology for financial assets measured at amortized cost introduces the term purchased credit deteriorated pcd assets which replaces the term purchased credit impaired pci assets modifies the treatment of credit losses on available for sale afs debt securities and requires certain disclosures of credit quality indicators by year of origination or vintage cecl differs from the incurred loss methodology in several key respects cecl requires system institutions to recognize lifetime expected credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost not just those credit losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date cecl also requires the incorporation of reasonable and supportable forecasts in developing an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses while maintaining the current requirement for system institutions to consider past events and current conditions furthermore the probable threshold for recognition of allowances in accordance with the incurred loss methodology is removed under cecl estimating expected credit losses over the life of an asset under cecl including consideration of reasonable and supportable forecasts results in earlier recognition of credit losses than under the existing incurred loss methodology in addition cecl replaces multiple impairment approaches in existing u s gaap cecl allowances will cover a broader range of financial assets than allowance for loan losses all under the incurred loss methodology under the incurred loss methodology in general all covers credit losses on loans held for investment and lease financing receivables with additional allowances for certain other extensions of credit and allowances for credit losses on certain off balance sheet credit exposures with the latter allowances presented as a liability 10 these exposures will be within the scope of cecl in addition cecl covers credit losses on held to maturity htm debt securities footnote 10 other extensions of credit includes trade and reinsurance receivables and receivables that relate to repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements off balance sheet credit exposures includes off balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance such as loan commitments standby letters of credit and financial guarantees note that credit losses for off balance sheet credit exposures that are unconditionally cancellable by the issuer are not recognized under cecl end footnote as mentioned above asu no 2016 13 also introduces pcd assets as a replacement for pci assets the pcd asset definition covers a broader range of assets than the pci asset definition cecl requires system institutions to estimate and record credit loss allowances for a pcd asset at the time of purchase the credit loss allowance is then added to the purchase price to determine the amortized cost basis of the asset for financial reporting purposes post acquisition increases in credit loss allowances on pcd assets will be established through a charge to earnings this is different from the current treatment of pci assets for which system institutions are not permitted to estimate and recognize credit loss allowances at the time of purchase rather in general credit loss allowances for pci assets are estimated after the purchase only if there is deterioration in the expected cash flows from the assets 11 footnote 11 the system currently holds limited pci assets which have generally been acquired through business combinations fca does not believe the amount of pcd assets in the system after the adoption of cecl will be materially different end footnote asu no 2016 13 also introduces new requirements for afs debt securities the new accounting standard requires a system institution to recognize credit losses on individual afs debt securities through credit loss allowances rather than through direct write downs as is currently required under u s gaap afs debt securities will continue to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value not related to credit losses recognized in other comprehensive income credit loss allowances on an afs debt security are limited to the amount by which the security s fair value is less than its amortized cost upon adoption of cecl a system institution will record a one time adjustment to its credit loss allowance as of the beginning of its fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference if any between the amount of credit loss allowance required under the incurred loss methodology and the amount of credit loss allowance required under cecl except for pcd assets the adjustment to credit loss allowance would be recognized with offsetting entries to deferred tax assets dtas if appropriate and to the fiscal year s beginning retained earnings the effective date of asu no 2016 13 varies for different financial institutions the original effective date for public business entities pbes that are not securities and exchange commission sec filers such as the funding corporation 12 was the fiscal year beginning after december 15 2020 including interim periods within that fiscal year and that was the timeframe in effect when fca published the proposed cecl rule after publication on october 18 2019 fasb amended the effective dates of certain major accounting standards including asu no 2016 13 specifically for entities such as the funding corporation asu no 2016 13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2022 including interim periods within those fiscal years 13 system institutions will implement the new standard on january 1 2023 and systemwide combined financial statements for the quarter ending march 31 2023 will reflect the new standard 14 footnote 12 a pbe that is not an sec filer includes 1 an entity that has issued securities that are traded listed or quoted on an over the counter market or 2 an entity that has issued one or more securities that are not subject to contractual restrictions on transfer and is required by law contract or regulation to prepare u s gaap financial statements including footnotes and make them publicly available periodically for further information on the definition of a pbe refer to asu no 2013 12 definition of a public business entity issued in december 2013 since as discussed above the funding corporation is the system s fiscal and disclosure agent the cecl effective date for the system is based on its effective date for the funding corporation the funding corporation satisfies the definition of a pbe that is not an sec filer end footnote footnote 13 see fasb asu 2019 10 financial instruments credit losses topic 326 derivatives and hedging topic 815 and leases topic 842 effective dates issued in november 2019 end footnote footnote 14 if fasb were to amend the effective date again system implementation may similarly be delayed end footnote d regulatory capital changes necessitated by cecl to a system institution s retained earnings dtas and allowances will affect the institution s regulatory capital ratios 15 specifically retained earnings are a key component of a system institution s common equity tier 1 cet1 capital 16 an increase in a system institution s allowances including those estimated under cecl generally will reduce the institution s earnings or retained earnings and therefore its cet1 capital 17 footnote 15 these capital ratios are specified in sec 628 10 end footnote footnote 16 fca s capital rules refer to unallocated retained earnings ure rather than retained earnings section 628 2 defines ure as accumulated net income that a system institution has not allocated to a member borrower this preamble uses the term retained earnings because that is the term used in cecl and in u s gaap more generally for purposes of this preamble retained earnings has the same meaning as ure end footnote footnote 17 however as discussed above allowances recognized on pcd assets upon adoption of cecl and upon later purchases of pcd assets generally would not reduce the system institution s earnings retained earnings or cet1 capital end footnote depending on the nature of the difference dtas arising from temporary differences temporary difference dtas are included in a system s institution s risk weighted assets or are deducted from cet1 capital 18 increases in allowances generally give rise to increases in temporary difference dtas that will partially offset the reduction in earnings or retained earnings 19 under sec 628 20 d 3 the all is included in a system institution s tier 2 capital up to 1 25 percent of its standardized total risk weighted assets as defined in sec 628 2 not including any amount of the all 20 footnote 18 dtas arising from temporary differences in relation to net operating loss carrybacks are risk weighted at 100 percent under sec 628 32 l 3 dtas that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards net of any related valuation allowances and net of deferred tax liabilities in accordance with sec 628 22 e are deducted from cet1 capital under sec 628 22 a 3 all other dtas are risk weighted at 100 percent under sec 628 32 l 5 dtas are immaterial at most system institutions end footnote footnote 19 see accounting standards codification topic 740 income taxes end footnote footnote 20 under sec 628 2 any amount of all greater than the 1 25 percent limit is deducted from standardized total risk weighted assets end footnote ii summary of the proposal a proposed revisions to the capital rules to reflect the change in u s gaap to address the forthcoming implementation of changes to u s gaap resulting from the fasb s issuance of asu no 2016 13 and to improve consistency between fca s capital rules and u s gaap fca proposed to amend the capital rules in part 628 to identify which credit loss allowances under the new accounting standard would be eligible for inclusion in a system institution s regulatory capital because fca s capital rules are generally similar to the u s rule fca s proposed cecl rule was generally similar to the fbras final cecl rule in particular fca proposed to add adjusted allowances for credit losses aacl as a newly defined term in its capital rules under the proposal aacl included credit loss allowances related to financial assets except for allowances for pcd assets and afs debt securities 21 aacl was eligible under the proposal for inclusion in a system institution s tier 2 capital subject to the current limit for including all in tier 2 capital under the capital rules 22 the proposed rule provided separate capital treatment for allowances associated with afs debt securities and pcd assets that would apply to system institutions upon adoption of asu 2016 13 unlike the cecl rule adopted by the fbras fca did not propose a phase in of the day one impacts of cecl on regulatory capital ratios footnote 21 this exclusion of credit loss allowances on pcd assets and afs debt securities is what differentiates aacl from the term allowance for credit losses acl which is used by the fasb in asu 2016 13 and which applies to both financial assets and afs debt securities consistent with the proposal and as described in the following sections the aacl definition includes only those allowances that have been charged against earnings or retained earnings end footnote footnote 22 see existing sec 628 20 d 3 end footnote fca s proposed rule also revised capital disclosure requirements that apply to system banks following their adoption of cecl 23 and made conforming amendments to other regulations so they refer to credit loss allowance and reflect the implementation of asu no 2016 13 footnote 23 section 628 63 requires system banks to disclose items such as capital structure capital adequacy credit risk and credit risk mitigation end footnote b summary of comments received on the proposal fca received four comment letters on the proposed rule one letter from the funding corporation on behalf of the system s accounting standards and cecl workgroups system workgroups letter 24 one letter from cobank acb cobank letter a system bank 25 and one letter each from northwest farm credit services an agricultural credit association northwest letter 26 and capital farm credit aca capital letter 27 both system associations all commenters generally supported many significant aspects of the proposed rule and expressed similar comments cobank expressly stated it supported the system workgroups letter the two associations offered comments consistent with certain aspects of the system workgroups letter footnote 24 system workgroups letter dated november 22 2019 end footnote footnote 25 cobank letter dated november 20 2019 end footnote footnote 26 northwest letter dated november 15 2019 end footnote footnote 27 capital letter dated october 18 2019 end footnote all commenters supported fca s new defined term adjusted allowances for credit losses and the modification to the definition of carrying value all the commenters also supported the existing limit on the inclusion of the allowance in tier 2 capital of 1 25 percent of risk weighted assets all commenters asked fca to follow u s gaap for disclosure and reporting requirements including the conforming amendments fca proposed rather than introducing specific disclosures different than those required by u s gaap in addition all commenters suggested the rule should contain a general reference to the effective date required by u s gaap rather than specifying an effective date all commenters believe fca should adopt an optional transition period for the day one impact cecl may have on institutions regulatory capital to align more closely with the approach taken by the fbras additionally all commenters asked fca to exclude any day one impact of cecl from the year over year change in cet1 capital referred to in sec 628 20 f 5 ii to avoid a negative impact on an institution s ability to make capital distributions including the payment of patronage iii final rule as discussed above fca s capital rules are similar to the u s rule while taking into account the cooperative structure and the organization of the system this final rule is similar in many respects to the fbras cecl rule a revisions to the capital rules to reflect the change in u s gaap 1 introduction of adjusted allowances for credit losses as a newly defined term fca is adopting as final without change from the proposal the proposed definition of the new capital term aacl as proposed fca is revising the capital rules to reflect the revised accounting standard for credit losses under u s gaap as it relates to system institutions calculation of regulatory capital ratios the new capital term aacl which replaces the existing term all applies to all system institutions fca is also adopting without change its proposal consistent with the treatment of all under fca s existing capital rules to make amounts of aacl eligible for inclusion in an institution s tier 2 capital up to 1 25 percent of the institution s standardized total risk weighted assets not including any amount of the aacl all commenters supported the new defined term aacl and the continuation of the existing limit on the inclusion of the allowance in tier 2 capital cecl allowances cover a broader range of financial assets than the all under the incurred loss methodology under fca s existing capital rules all includes valuation allowances that have been established through a charge against earnings to cover estimated credit losses on loans or other extensions of credit as determined in accordance with u s gaap under cecl credit loss allowances represent an accounting valuation account measured as the difference between the financial assets amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected on the financial assets i e lifetime credit losses thus aacl includes allowances for expected credit losses on htm debt securities and lessors net investments in leases that have been established to adjust these assets to amounts expected to be collected as determined in accordance with u s gaap aacl also includes allowances for expected credit losses on off balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance as determined in accordance with u s gaap as described below however credit loss allowances related to afs debt securities and pcd assets are not included in the definition of aacl as the fbras have said they are doing for the banking organizations that they regulate fca intends to monitor the impacts of this 1 25 percent limit on regulatory capital and system institution lending practices after the final rule is effective fca s ongoing monitoring will include the review of data including data provided by system institutions fca will also monitor the fbras actions in this area fca will consider the information it is monitoring in determining whether a further change to the fca s capital rules treatment of aacl might be warranted to the extent fca determines further revisions to the capital rules are necessary the agency would seek comment through a separate proposal 2 definition of carrying value fca is adopting as final without change from the proposal a revision to the definition of carrying value under the existing definition at sec 628 2 carrying value means with respect to an asset the value of the asset on the balance sheet as determined in accordance with u s gaap under the final rule and consistent with the fbras final cecl rule the definition of carrying value is revised to add a provision that for all assets other than afs debt securities and pcd assets the carrying value is not reduced by any associated credit loss allowance all commenters supported this proposed revision to the definition of carrying value i available for sale debt securities current accounting standards require a system institution to make an individual assessment of each of its afs debt securities and take a direct write down for credit losses when such a security is other than temporarily impaired the amount of the write down is charged against earnings which reduces cet1 capital and results in a reduction in the same amount to the carrying value of the afs debt security asu 2016 13 revises the accounting for credit impairment of afs debt securities by requiring system institutions to determine whether a decline in fair value below an afs debt security s amortized cost resulted from a credit loss and to record any such credit impairment through earnings with a corresponding allowance similar to the current regulatory treatment of credit related losses for other than temporary impairment under the final rule all credit losses recognized on afs debt securities will correspondingly affect cet1 capital and reduce the carrying value of the afs debt security since the carrying value of an afs debt security is its fair value which would reflect any credit impairment credit loss allowances for afs debt securities required under the new accounting standard are not eligible for inclusion in a system institution s tier 2 capital ii purchased credit deteriorated assets the final rule maintains the requirement that valuation allowances be fully charged against earnings in order to be eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital the final rule however excludes pcd allowances from being included in tier 2 capital rather a system institution will calculate the carrying value of pcd assets net of allowances under the new accounting standard pcd assets are acquired individual financial assets or acquired groups of financial assets with shared risk characteristics that as of the date of acquisition and as determined by an acquirer s assessment have experienced a more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination the new accounting standard will require system institutions to estimate expected credit losses that are embedded in the purchase price of a pcd asset and recognize these amounts as an allowance as of the date of acquisition as such the initial allowance amount for a pcd asset recorded on a system institution s balance sheet will not be established through a charge to earnings including allowances in tier 2 capital that have not been charged against earnings would diminish the quality of regulatory capital post acquisition increases in allowances for pcd assets will be established through a charge against earnings accordingly the final regulation provides that valuation allowances charged to retained earnings in accordance with u s gaap i e the allowances required at cecl adoption are eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital this treatment of pcd assets in effect will reduce a system institution s standardized total risk weighted assets similar to the proposed treatment for credit loss allowances for afs debt securities consistent with fca s proposal and with the fbras final cecl rule this final rule does not allow system institutions to bifurcate pcd allowances to include post acquisition allowances in the definition of aacl as discussed in the preamble to the proposed rule fca is concerned a bifurcated approach could create undue complexity and burden for system institutions and believes requiring system institutions to calculate the carrying value of pcd assets net of allowances appropriately accounts for post acquisition allowances in the calculation of regulatory capital 28 fca received no comments concerning not allowing a bifurcated approach footnote 28 84 fr 49684 49687 september 23 2019 end footnote b cecl transition provision unlike the fbras final cecl rule fca did not propose and is not adopting an optional phase in of the day one impacts of cecl on regulatory capital ratios the fbras included an optional transition period for banking organizations to reduce the potential day one adverse impacts cecl may have on a banking organization s regulatory capital ratios the fbras included this transition period because of concerns that some banking organizations might face difficulties in capital planning because of uncertainty about the economic environment at the time of cecl adoption 29 footnote 29 cecl requires consideration of current and future expected economic conditions to estimate allowances to an extent these conditions will not be known until closer to a system institution s cecl adoption date end footnote all commenters asked fca to adopt an optional transition period for the day one impact cecl may have on an institution s regulatory capital to more closely align with the approach adopted by the fbras 30 two commenters stated that fca should follow its own objective in the capital rules that became effective january 1 2017 which was to ensure the system s capital requirements were comparable to the basel iii framework and the u s rule 31 two commenters asserted that fca s statement in the preamble to the proposed rule that all institutions will be sufficiently capitalized to absorb the day one impacts of cecl is not supported by firm estimates 32 additionally all commenters stated that as of their comment submission date system institutions had not yet fully implemented cecl and were not able to definitively assess possible capital impacts of the implementation 33 footnote 30 in response to a specific question from fca on the matter none of the commenters asked fca to adopt a mandatory transition provision end footnote footnote 31 system workgroups letter and northwest letter end footnote footnote 32 system workgroups letter and capital letter end footnote footnote 33 no commenters provided analysis to support their position in the proposed rule fca requested analysis that would support a transition period or alternatives to a transition period that might accommodate institutions in their implementation of the cecl requirements end footnote fca disagrees with these commenters as when fca proposed this rule fca continues to believe a transition provision is unnecessary for any system institution first even without a transition period fca expects all institutions will be sufficiently capitalized to absorb the day one impact of cecl for the purpose of complying with regulatory capital requirements second fca s capital requirements are comparable to the basel iii framework and the u s rule even without an optional phase in period finally adopting an optional phase in period would create significant operational burden and complexity with no corresponding benefit to the safety and soundness of system institutions 34 footnote 34 for the same reasons fca declines to adopt the second covid related transition period the fbras adopted in 2020 in addition fca notes that transition period applied only to banking organizations that were required to implement cecl on january 1 2020 end footnote the first reason a transition period is not necessary is because even without one fca expects all institutions will be sufficiently capitalized to absorb the day one impact of cecl for the purpose of complying with regulatory capital requirements fca expects allowances estimated under cecl will likely increase at most system institutions causing cet1 capital including retained earnings to decrease and tier 2 capital to increase total capital which is generally the most constraining capital ratio for associations would remain largely unchanged for system banks where the tier 1 leverage ratio is generally the most constraining capital ratio fca expects credit losses under cecl to result in little to no change for bank allowance levels 35 fca continues to believe all system institutions will continue to comply with regulatory capital ratios and buffers without a transition period 36 footnote 35 while each system bank has different strategies and asset compositions in general the direct note to associations and investments comprise a majority of each banks assets given these assets held at system banks and their anticipated allowance levels under cecl fca anticipates all banks will maintain regulatory capital compliance end footnote footnote 36 as noted above fca issued an informational memorandum in 2016 titled new accounting standard on financial instruments credit losses this informational memorandum specifically encouraged system institutions to plan and prepare for cecl s potential impact on capital and included seven items for system institutions to consider for the measurement transition and implementation of cecl institutions that have heeded this planning guidance have had ample opportunity to prepare themselves for cecl s day one impact end footnote contrary to the commenters assertions fca s expectations for the day one impact of cecl are supported by firm estimates for the proposed rule fca analyzed allowance amounts from the uniform reports of financial condition and performance call report for all system institutions under various stress scenarios 37 for the final rule fca analyzed allowance amounts from updated call report data for all system institutions and completed a review of select system institutions model development and implementation of cecl 38 additionally since the proposed rule comment period closed regulatory capital levels remain satisfactory indicating the system is well positioned to absorb the day one impact of cecl in addition the credit quality of the system s combined loan portfolio remains strong as of december 31 2021 39 footnote 37 see call report schedule rc balance sheet end footnote footnote 38 fca also reviewed allowance ratios provided by the fbras as of june 30 2021 which compared allowances for banking organizations that had already adopted cecl and allowance ratios for banking organizations that were still under the incurred loss model end footnote footnote 39 the funding corporation reported strong credit quality in the combined system s loan portfolio with loans classified as acceptable and other assets especially mentioned at 98 1 percent on december 31 2021 compared to 97 5 percent on december 31 2020 see 2021 annual information statement of the farm credit system march 1 2022 end footnote based on these reviews unless existing and future expected economic conditions significantly deteriorate after publication of this rule and before the january 1 2023 effective date of this rule fca expects all institutions will be sufficiently capitalized to absorb the day one impact of cecl for the purpose of complying with regulatory capital requirements more specifically fca continues to believe the regulatory capital ratios of all system institutions cet1 tier 1 total capital and tier 1 leverage will remain above the regulatory minimums and buffers after the implementation of cecl even without a transition period fca considered this analysis as part of its determination not to provide an optional transition period for system institutions the second reason a transition period is not necessary is that fca disagrees with the commenters position that not adopting an optional phase in period would diverge from fca s capital rule objective to ensure the system s capital requirements are comparable to the basel iii framework and the u s rule fca views comparability as ensuring the overall regulatory outcome of fca s capital requirements are comparable with the u s rule as appropriate taking into account the differences between system institutions and banking organizations subject to the u s rule 40 while many requirements in fca s capital rules are similar or identical to requirements in the u s rule comparability does not mean every provision and requirement in the u s rule should be incorporated into fca s capital rules fca s minimum capital requirements ensure the quality and quantity of capital are comparable to that of the u s rule and reflect principles outlined in the basel iii framework ensuring an overall uniform standard of capital quality that is consistent and transparent footnote 40 as noted in fca s preamble to the proposed tier 1 tier 2 capital rule fca changed items from the u s rule as appropriate to account for the differences between system institutions and banking organizations regulated by the fbras see 79 fr 52814 september 4 2014 end footnote in adopting the tier 1 tier 2 capital rule in 2016 fca did not adopt the majority of phase in and transitional periods that were included in the u s rule 41 at the time fca determined most of these transitional and phase in periods were not needed to give system institutions sufficient time to come into compliance with the new rules 42 fca s analysis at the time evidenced that all system institutions would exceed the minimum regulatory capital ratios on the effective date of the rule since january 1 2017 the effective date of the rule as fca expected system capital levels have remained satisfactory and all system institutions have exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements as well as applicable capital conservation and leverage buffer requirements footnote 41 as an example the u s rule provided for phase in and transitional periods of certain regulatory deductions and adjustments minority interests and temporary inclusions of non qualifying instruments the fbras provided these transitional periods in part to provide banking organizations they regulate sufficient time to build capital to meet the new requirements see 79 fr 52814 september 4 2014 end footnote footnote 42 fca did provide a phase in period of 3 years for the 2 5 percent capital conservation buffer see 81 fr 49720 49721 july 28 2016 end footnote in general banking organizations regulated by the fbras may have a larger day one impact from adopting cecl and a phase in may be more appropriate to ensure their regulatory capital compliance the lending operations of many of these banking organizations including unsecured lending such as credit cards have historically caused banking organizations to experience higher credit losses as a percentage of loans than system institutions in contrast to many banking organizations the system lends primarily to agriculture and other eligible borrowers in rural areas approximately 50 percent of the system s combined loan portfolio is in real estate mortgage and rural residential real estate loans these real estate loans are generally long term and well secured and they are generally expected to have lower credit losses than commercial real estate loans the final reason an optional transition period is not needed is that it would lead to unnecessary complexity and operational burden an optional transition period would require changes to existing call report schedules that would require institutions to change existing reporting processes each year of the transition period for example new more complex calculations would be necessary for each year of the transition period based on the percentage of the transition amount allowed for the year for reporting items such as retained earnings average assets aacl and other assets the call report would also need to be updated to reflect new temporary line items such as the cecl transition amount 43 footnote 43 see federal financial institutions examination council supplemental instructions interim final rules and notice issued march 2020 revision 3 2020 cecl transition provision end footnote if system institutions were not sufficiently capitalized to absorb the day one impact of cecl fca believes the complexity and operational burden of an optional transition period might be warranted to provide relief from regulatory capital requirements however all system institutions are expected to be sufficiently capitalized to absorb the day one impact and comply with regulatory capital requirements without an optional transition period an optional transition period could also be difficult to implement and maintain for system institutions in districts that make use of common standardized applications for computing and reporting regulatory capital a transition period utilized by some institutions in such districts but not by others would appear to complicate supporting the common reporting platforms for those institutions in addition allowing an optional transition period would create a lack of comparability among system institutions capital levels the commenters asked fca to state in this final rule that the agency will work with individual institutions to provide regulatory relief similar to a transition period if the day one impacts of cecl cause a significant impact to an individual institution s regulatory capital ratios fca confirms the agency will work with individual institutions if the day one impact of cecl causes them not to comply with the regulatory capital requirements but does not commit to granting relief as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule if closer to the adoption of cecl its day one impact threatens regulatory capital compliance fca may consider options to reduce the unanticipated impacts of implementing cecl the type of action would depend on among other factors the significance of cecl s impact on an individual institution the institution s capital strategy business planning and implementation efforts 44 and how widespread the issue is throughout the system footnote 44 as noted above fca issued an informational memorandum in 2016 titled new accounting standard on financial instruments credit losses which included seven items for system institutions to consider for the measurement transition and implementation of cecl system institutions were specifically encouraged to plan and prepare for cecl s potential impact on capital end footnote for these reasons fca declines to adopt a transition period for the day one impact cecl may have on an institution s regulatory capital c safe harbor deemed prior approval to make cash distributions all commenters asked fca to exclude any day one cecl impacts from sec 628 20 f 5 ii section 628 20 f requires system institutions to obtain prior approval from fca before making any cash distributions of capital included in tier 1 or tier 2 capital fca s safe harbor deemed prior approval provisions at sec 628 20 f 5 provide that system institutions are deemed to have prior approval from fca to distribute cash payments as long as certain conditions are met one of the conditions in sec 628 20 f 5 ii stipulates that after any such cash payments have been declared and defined by resolution of the board the dollar amount of cet1 capital at quarter end equals or exceeds the dollar amount of cet1 capital on the same quarter end in the previous calendar year 45 footnote 45 note that amendments to the capital rule published at 86 fr 54347 october 1 2021 and effective on january 1 2022 made a minor revision to this provision that does not change the comment or fca s response end footnote commenters believe fca should exclude the day one impacts cecl will have on the dollar amount of cet1 capital from compliance with this condition so that cecl implementation would not impact a system institution s ability to make cash capital distributions including patronage payments under the safe harbor commenters seek this exclusion so the existing deemed prior approval process would continue without interruption fca disagrees with this request for several reasons first fca believes it is unlikely the day one impact would result in cet1 capital declining to the same level of cet1 capital on march 31 2022 the quarter end of the prior year the safe harbor essentially limits system institutions without express fca prior approval to distributing net income for the current quarter in which the distribution is declared and defined by resolution of the board and the prior 3 quarters in practice system institutions rarely make capital distributions including paying dividends on preferred stock making cash patronage payments or redeeming or revolving equities that equal net income for the current quarter and prior 3 quarters rather in the last three years system associations have reported on average distributing at least 40 percent of their net income in cash patronage 46 this means the overwhelming majority of associations have had sufficient capacity both to pay cash patronage and to build capital footnote 46 see call report schedule ri d changes in net worth end footnote fca continues to expect system boards to give significant thought to capital distribution decisions and how they impact overall capitalization of their institution especially regarding a cash payment that equals 12 months of net income in the unlikely event cecl s day one impact reduces cet1 capital to a level where an institution could not use the safe harbor to make a cash patronage distribution in line with prior years the appropriateness of making such a cash patronage distribution may be questionable second in the unlikely event cecl implementation would cause a system institution s cet1 capital to be less than the same quarter end in the previous calendar year that does not preclude the institution from paying patronage an institution that wants to pay cash patronage but that cannot satisfy the safe harbor deemed prior approval requirements under sec 628 20 f 5 may request the prior approval of fca for such distribution under sec 628 20 f 2 and 3 47 in addition a system institution may allocate equities to its member borrowers as a form of patronage without needing to satisfy any requirements that could be affected by any day one impacts from cecl footnote 47 section 628 20 f 2 and 3 provide that at least 30 days prior to the intended action a system institution must submit a request for approval to fca for a 30 day review period before it takes the intended action the request is deemed to be granted if fca does not notify the system institution to the contrary before the end of the 30 day review period while the prior approval provisions under sec 628 20 f 2 and 3 do not require any supporting documentation institutions that have material declines in cet1 capital due to the day one impact of cecl may want to provide the following supporting documentation in any prior approval request related to cecl s implementation 1 the institution s historical trends and current projections for capital growth through earnings retention 2 average cash patronage payments over the last 3 years 3 projected cash patronage payments over the institution s current planning horizon and 4 the most recent allowance analysis study under cecl end footnote d disclosures and regulatory reporting fca is adopting as final the proposed requirement for system banks to update their disclosures required under sec 628 63 to reflect the adoption of cecl section 628 63 imposes public disclosure requirements for system banks related to the capital requirements contained in part 628 the public disclosure requirements are designed to provide important information to market participants on the scope of application capital structure risk exposures risk assessment processes capital adequacy of the bank and techniques the bank uses to identify measure monitor and control risks the final rule replaces requirements to disclose all with requirements to disclose aacl additionally the final rule updates references to probable loan losses and loan losses with references to allowance for credit losses acl 48 or aacl as applicable fca did not receive any comments related to the proposed bank disclosure amendments in sec 628 63 footnote 48 asu no 2016 13 removes impairment approaches and related terminology including replacing the term all with acl end footnote to reflect changes in u s gaap concerning cecl fca anticipates revising the call reports in the first quarter of 2023 these revisions would specify the affected line items in the capital schedules and the newly defined term aacl in addition fca intends to update the call report instructions for all references to all e conforming changes to other fca regulations fca is not adopting the proposed requirement for system institutions to provide a vintage year credit loss analysis disclosure in sec 620 5 49 and 630 20 50 however the final rule adopts all the other proposed conforming changes footnote 49 governing the contents of the annual report to shareholders end footnote footnote 50 governing the contents of the annual report to investors end footnote 1 final rule change for vintage year disclosure existing fca regulations at sec 620 5 and 630 20 require that the discussion and analysis of risk exposures analyze the all 51 the proposal amended these disclosure requirements to update references to the all with the newly defined u s gaap term acl the proposal also required a new credit loss analysis disclosure by vintage year 52 footnote 51 see sec 620 5 g 1 iv b and 630 20 g 1 ii b end footnote footnote 52 see proposed sec 620 5 g 1 iv b and 630 20 g 1 ii b end footnote all commenters noted that a vintage year disclosure of the acl is not required by u s gaap the commenters requested fca not introduce specific disclosure requirements in sec 620 5 and 630 20 that may result in regulatory disclosures being different than those required by u s gaap the commenters believe removing the vintage year requirement would eliminate the need for fca to update regulations in the event of any subsequent changes in u s gaap because of the overlap of u s gaap disclosures and fca s requirement to disclose the allowance for credit losses to loans 53 the final rule removes the vintage year requirements for the allowance analysis in sec 620 5 g 1 iv b and 630 20 g 1 ii b as requested by the commenters however consistent with the proposal the final rule replaces the term all with acl and requires a discussion of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses given reasonable and supportable forecasts footnote 53 see sec 620 5 f 1 iii f and 630 20 f 3 v end footnote 2 conforming changes adopted as proposed the proposal made a conforming amendment to replace the key financial ratio allowance for loan losses to loans with allowance for credit losses to loans in the selected financial disclosure requirement for banks and associations in sec 620 5 f the commenters requested that fca retain the existing ratio the commenters believe retaining the existing ratio would avoid the need to reconcile financial data included in the regulatory financial disclosures with the u s gaap balance sheet the commenters stated a reconciliation would become necessary if the allowance for off balance sheet credit exposures which is a liability for u s gaap purposes were included within the definitions of allowance for credit losses in the proposed rule the commenters proposed as an alternative to require the denominator of the ratio loans be expanded to include total off balance sheet credit exposures to keep the ratios comparable fca disagrees with the commenters suggestion and continues to believe system disclosures should remain generally consistent with those of the financial services industry as they have been since at least 1986 fca s disclosure requirements in the annual report to shareholders and investors are similar to though not as extensive as those required by the sec and other financial regulators 54 the disclosure reporting requirements originally adopted by fca in 1986 were generally similar to the sec industry guide 3 statistical disclosure by bank holding companies industry guide 3 55 subsequent to fca s proposed cecl rule the sec updated and codified certain industry guide 3 disclosure requirements including requirements for a similar allowance for credit losses to loans ratio disclosure 56 the fca continues to believe that system institution shareholders should have access to comparable disclosures made to shareholders of other financial institutions in order to enhance the borrower ownership and control mandated by the act footnote 54 see 50 fr 34711 34712 august 27 1985 end footnote footnote 55 see 51 fr 8656 march 13 1986 end footnote footnote 56 see 85 fr 66108 october 16 2020 see also 17 cfr 229 1405 item 1405 allowance for credit losses end footnote similarly the proposal made a conforming amendment to replace the balance sheet line item allowance for losses with allowance for credit losses in the selected financial disclosure requirement for banks and associations in sec 620 5 f commenters s uggested fca retain the current sec 620 5 f 1 i d requirement to disclose the allowance for loan losses rather than adopting the proposed requirement to disclose the allowance for credit losses commenters stated the new requirement could result in regulatory disclosure requirements that are different than those required by u s gaap fca disagrees with the commenters suggestions regarding the usage of allowance for credit losses in sec 620 5 f 1 i d as fca believes it is important for users of the annual report to understand the amount of potential credit losses to which each bank and association may be exposed while certain regulatory disclosures such as the proposed sec 620 5 f 1 i d may require a reconciliation with u s gaap fca continues to believe shareholders should have access to comparable disclosures provided to shareholders of other financial institutions by retaining the conforming proposed financial disclosures in the final rule system institutions will be required to provide transparent and comparable disclosures similar to others in the financial services industry 57 footnote 57 commenters did not request changes to similar disclosure requirements in part 630 since the requirements are similar fca considered the comments in connection with those requirements as well and for the same reasons declines to amend them end footnote fca received no comments relating to any other proposed conforming change and adopts them as proposed a number of existing fca regulations outside of part 628 refer to all or to loan loss as discussed above asu no 2016 13 removes impairment approaches and related terminology including replacing the term all with acl accordingly most of the conforming changes outside of part 628 are to replace all or loan loss with acl or credit loss as appropriate in addition several existing regulations that refer to allowance for losses more appropriately refer to acl most of the conforming changes to regulations within part 628 as well as to regulations that refer to regulations within part 628 replace all with aacl in the capital disclosures at sec628 63 the final rule replaces references to probable loan losses and loan losses with acl or aacl as applicable the final rule makes conforming changes in the following parts part 611 organization part 615 funding and fiscal affairs loan policies and operations and funding operations part 620 disclosure to shareholders part 621 accounting and reporting requirements part 628 capital adequacy of system institutions part 630 disclosure to investors in systemwide and consolidated bank debt obligations of the farm credit system f effective date under u s gaap system institutions are required to implement the new standard for purposes of systemwide combined financial statements for the call report quarter ending march 31 2023 thus the final rule will be effective january 1 2023 for system institutions all commenters recommended that fca not adopt a specific effective date and instead include a more generic reference to the effective date required by u s gaap when fca s proposed rule was published in september of 2019 as discussed above cecl was scheduled to be effective for pbes that are not sec filers such as the funding corporation on january 1 2021 after fca s proposed rule was published fasb deferred the mandatory effective date of cecl for such entities to january 1 2023 58 fca agrees with system commenters that this final rule should be effective consistent with u s gaap if fasb changes the effective date of cecl for system institutions fca will update the effective date of this final rule consistent with the system s implementation date of cecl footnote 58 in november 2019 fasb issued asu 2019 10 financial instruments credit losses topic 326 derivatives and hedging topic 815 and leases topic 842 effective dates which amended the effective date of cecl end footnote g supervisory guidance on the acl fca expects to issue supervisory guidance on the acl and update existing guidance referencing all until that time many concepts processes and practices detailed in existing supervisory guidance on the all continue to remain relevant under cecl relevant guidance includes but is not limited to information related to management s responsibility for the allowance estimation process the board of directors responsibility for overseeing management s process and the need for institutions to appropriately support and document their allowance estimates 59 until new guidance is issued institutions should consider the relevant sections of existing all guidance in their implementation of the new accounting standard footnote 59 existing supervisory guidance includes fca bookletter 49 adequacy of farm

basf and uc berkeley extend alliance for another five years research advancements presented at spring review event notable research progress in inorganic and biobased materials florham park n j may 05 2022 globe newswire the california research alliance cara by basf has led to 100 research projects between the chemical company and the more than 10 universities that are part of cara since its establishment in 2014 the research projects in the areas of new functional materials catalysis chemical synthesis engineering processes biosciences formulations and digitalization have generated more than 30 patent applications and nearly 70 peer reviewed articles to continue this successful research approach basf and the university of california berkeley uc berkeley signed a five year extension of the cara collaboration at its spring review event the continuation of our partnership reinforces the importance of academic collaboration to support industry innovation for basf said dr detlef kratz designated president of group research basf se at basf tackling sustainability challenges requires innovation and collaboration with external partners as we have seen over the last eight years the combination of our research power with the strength of the cara network has led to many sustainability driven breakthroughs and we are eager to see how they evolve into commercial products in the next years the open relationship created between basf scientists and researchers in my group at uc berkeley and across the entire uc system have enabled discussions in many forms said professor john hartwig henry rapoport chair department of chemistry uc berkeley these discussions have led both sides to see opportunities for collaborative research on topics we never would have imagined alone and create opportunities to take academic research into new directions with an eye for practical outcomes with a positive effect on sustainability notable progress in inorganic material research to enable energy savings cara is a multidisciplinary research center headed by the college of chemistry at uc berkeley since cara began basf experts and researchers from uc berkeley uc san diego and several other leading universities in california have worked together on multiple research projects to test new materials evaluate new technologies and explore new processes that will help address key sustainability challenges a joint team in the field of inorganic material research is developing a stable ligand free semiconductor ink based on lead free halide perovskites which can potentially be used in coatings electronics and catalysis traditional semiconductor materials are usually not readily solution processable and result in complex and energy intensive fabrication processes based on its research the cara team has developed a novel semiconductor ink that can be patterned onto various materials and converted back to the pure solid phase in air the unique ability to rapidly transform back and forth between an easily processable semiconductor ink and the solid state perovskite crystalline systema potentially enables energy efficient fabrication processes said dr kerstin schierle arndt vice president of research for inorganic materials at basf and associate director of cara the deep know how on inorganic materials and applications from the cara team combined with the guidance provided by uc berkeley professor peidong yang is proving decisive for the development of this new material algae in focus for biobased and biodegradable polymeric materials professors steve mayfield and mike burkart at uc san diego aspire to develop novel biobased and biodegradable polymeric materials supported by cara they are working to develop aliphatic isocyanates from algae biomass using phosgene free flow chemistry and demonstrate their biodegradability in addition the project secured 6 million in funding from two department of energy grants professor burkart has demonstrated flow chemistry based production of aliphatic heptamethylene diisocyanate from algae sourced azelaic acid on bench scale while professor mayfield is working on engineering algae to produce new precursors basf expertise in polyurethane formulation and polymer biodegradation has been key to this project s continued success with the goal to identify and commercialize biobased and biodegradable

in the autumn of 1962 english banker george bolton went on a business trip to new york as chairman of a european bank in his case the bank of london and south america regular trips to the us were an essential part of the job since the world war ii the country had become the place for european governments and companies to raise the funds they needed in the years since the end of the conflict they had raised billions of dollars by selling bonds to us investors but during his business trip bolton made a startling discovery he learned that plans were afoot to cut off the europeans from this vital supply of dollars washington had quietly requested that the big us banks stop lending to european borrowers in a bid to stem the huge outflows of currency from the country that were threatening the stability of the us dollar if methods of persuasion fail i would not exclude legislation bolton wrote despondently on his return to london the discovery created an urgency to bypass new york and find an alternative way for european borrowers to access the dollars they vitally needed it kick started a race led by a group of jewish emigres who had fled the nazis and re established themselves in london but who were finding it difficult to break into the city s clubby networks spotting an opportunity to carve out their own niche they hit on the idea of tapping the growing piles of stateless dollars being built outside the us this is the story of how a small group of visionaries would transform global financial markets forever in the process these foreign outsiders would help london to regain its crown as the world s financial capital it s the story of how they convinced the relatively unknown italian motorway operator autostrade to take a gamble on their new idea the eurobond and in the process helped create a market that today is worth around us 30trn but to get there they had to overcome a host of problems first there were uk laws that prohibited residents from lending their money to foreigners which would massively restrict business in eurobonds there were rules against buying bearer securities the format of the deal there was also the problem of a listing most banks couldn t underwrite bonds unless they were listed on a major exchange but the creativity of the eurobond pioneers overcame these hurdles to make the deal a huge success and yet none of the pioneers were prepared for what would come next within two weeks of the deal being done the kennedy administration announced new bond market rules that were far stricter than anyone had imagined the announcement dropped a bombshell on the yankee market with that one measure the kennedy administration effectively killed the new york foreign bond market and pushed issuance to the new eurobond market in london as the news came through the chairman of morgan guaranty in new york henry alexander shared his concern with colleagues this is a day that you will remember forever he said it will change the face of american banking and force all the business off to london it will take years to get rid of this legislation he was right the cost of the vietnam war would mean that restrictions on foreign borrowers would remain until 1974 by then london was years ahead to hear this episode and more like it for free and in full click one of the links below or search your podcast provider of choice for ifr the syndicate

the recent resetting of ties with the usa in particular and with the west in general may or may not help pakistan attract more foreign investment it depends on how quickly islamabad can convince the world that it has no intention of becoming part of any power bloc it also depends on how soon the current turbulent phase of local politics is over and a new phase of stability takes hold apart from geopolitical considerations foreign funds traditionally land in the countries where doing business is easier fair market practices prevail dispute resolution system works smoothly intellectual property rights are protected policies affecting foreign investors remain consistent and above all where foreign investors can feel at home judged on these matrices pakistan remains a poor candidate for attracting foreign direct investment fdi according to the world bank net fdi inflows into pakistan equaled less than one per cent of gdp during the past 11 years between 2011 and 2021 and if the current trend persists net fdi inflows cannot reach 1pc of pakistan s projected gdp even in 2022 however recent interest rate tightening by the state bank of pakistan sbp followed by skyrocketing treasury bill rates should accelerate net inflows of foreign portfolio investment fpi why do net fdi inflows remain below 1pc of gdp even after the launching of the multi billion dollar cpec is a question that merits serious deliberations the sbp s dramatic unscheduled interest rate hiking by 250 basis points on april 7 coinciding with the last day of the pti government triggered large increases in t bills and bonds yields providing further incentives to foreign investors even before the 7th april increase in the sbp policy rate from 9 75pc to 12 25pc interest rates were high enough to lure foreign investment in zero risk t bills and pakistan investment bonds pibs foreign investors had already invested half a billion dollars in these bonds and bills in nine months of fy22 between july 2021 and march 2022 whereas during the same period of the fy21 they had not invested in the government debt papers sbp data shows why net fdi inflows into pakistan remain below 1pc of gdp even after the launching of the multi billion dollar china pakistan economic corridor cpec is a question that merits serious deliberations the structure of chinese funding of cpec projects includes loans and foreign investment made by the chinese state run agencies as well as private sector parties but since pakistan often struggles with balance of payments issues seeking the loan part of cpec related funding over and above the occasional forex support funds from china becomes a priority that said the bulk of pakistan s net fdi comes from china 751 million out of a total of 1 82 billion in fy21 other main sources include uae uk usa netherlands and hong kong now saudi arabia kuwait and turkey are also willing to make increased foreign direct investment in multiple sectors according to a late january update of the state department s office of investment affairs over the last two years us companies have pledged more than 1 5bn of investment in pakistan but only a small fraction of the promised investment has come in after the change of government in pakistan prospects for the faster materialisation of the old us investment pledges have brightened and us investors may even look for new investment opportunities according to a late january update of the state department s office of investment affairs over the last two years us companies have pledged more than 1 5bn of investment in pakistan only a small fraction of the promised investment has come in though the new government must ensure that those investment pledges materialise as early as possible the areas of interest for american investors include fast moving consumer goods agri business financial services franchising and information and communication technology pakistan has a dire need in each of these areas and enough scope for inward foreign investment in the financial sector particularly lots of foreign direct investment could flow into the proposed digital banks on a local foreign partnership basis sbp has received 20 applications for digital banks these applications include some moved by international investors others by local investors and yet others jointly new investment pledges could be sought easily not only from the us but from all over the developed world however it must be ensured that the impediments to the fast materialisation of old pledges are removed kuwait plans to invest 750m in the near future in pakistan s water management and financial sector kuwait investment authority s enertech holding co and pak kuwait investment co have already applied for a digital bank license in pakistan according to media reports the two entities are already working on a 200m water pipeline we need to diversify the main origins of fdi inflows with better economic diplomacy investment pledges from such countries as saudi arabia in the oil exploration and refining sector turkey construction and retail sector and kuwait must be pursued vigorously given the fact that pakistan often remains short of foreign exchange and exports and remittances fall short of meeting even the country s merchandise imports bill the importance of attracting as much foreign investment into the country as possible is obvious foreign investment coming into the government debt papers has a limitation such hot money which comes when the t bills and bonds rates are very high flies away within days and weeks once interest rates start falling foreign investment in the stock market is also often temporary in nature foreign direct investment is the real thing but to get this real thing in a big way pakistan needs to change in a country still seen by many in the world as one plagued by the menace of terrorism and extremism it would be too much to expect that large amounts of fdi would flow in unless we as a nation eradicate the twin evils can we do this published in dawn the business and finance weekly may 9th 2022

280 odd troubled us listed chinese companies pin hopes on solutions for the long term when chinese beverage chain luckin coffee was ejected from nasdaq in june 2020 after it had admitted a couple of months earlier that it had cooked its books little did market mavens realize the development will not only have serious implications for the 280 odd us listed chinese companies but cast a shadow on bilateral trade economic and diplomatic relations in the last 12 months the nasdaq golden dragon china index which tracks us listed chinese companies plunged more than 60 percent this market insiders said reflects downbeat investor sentiment made further dour by the us securities and exchange commission s penchant to subject such companies to potential punitive measures like delisting for allegedly failing to meet the local regulator s audit requirements altogether 128 us listed chinese companies including restaurant chain yum china holdings inc and technology giant baidu inc have been put on the provisional or conclusive lists of issuers identified under the holding foreign companies accountable act hfcaa so far with 23 of them already placed on the conclusive list a prelude to eventual delisting all this has forced market people to ponder the future consensus is fast emerging that things need to move beyond quick fixes like eyeing secondary listings in china and toward long term solutions like solid bilateral agreements only that experts said can help undo the damage inflicted by the june 2020 memorandum issued by former us president donald trump on protecting united states investors from significant risks from chinese companies that memo led to the hfcaa which became law on dec 18 2020 even since the law has been invoked mainly to prevent chinese mainland companies from listing on us exchanges and to target us listed chinese companies for allegedly not complying with the audit requirements of the public company accounting oversight board which oversees the audits of all us listed companies han hongling a professor from the school of management at zhejiang university said although us regulators have not exactly been neutral in their financial supervision the chinese authorities concerned have consistently displayed steely resolve to find workable and mutually fair long term solutions for instance the china securities regulatory commission the country s top securities watchdog said in mid march that agreements for cooperation should be forged as soon as possible to protect the lawful rights and interests of investors worldwide during the boao forum for asia annual conference 2022 in april csrc vice chairman fang xinghai said the pcaob in the us will be able to conduct inspections in china of chinese accounting firms that audit us listed chinese companies in a reasonable rational and legal manner a bilateral cooperation agreement is about to be reached in the near future he said without specifying a time frame experts said the need of the hour is the establishment of institutional mechanisms to create clarity on cross border supervision but that is not a terribly new idea because way back in april 1994 china and the us had signed a memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation consultation and the provision of technical assistance through exchange of information and securities materials the larger idea was to facilitate the implementation of securities laws of the respective markets but not much happened after that no detailed regulation was drafted said han of zhejiang university china and the us should therefore roll out a road map under which comprehensive cooperation in cross border supervision over securities trading can be made possible he said the first step china should take is to sign the enhanced multilateral memorandum of understanding concerning consultation and cooperation and the exchange of information which was released by the international organization of securities commissions in 2017 to offer securities regulators worldwide new enforcement powers for cross border cooperation supervision over auditing should kick in for the next phase of china us cooperation the chinese regulators can assist in providing audit working papers conduct joint inspections into audit firms programs or jointly look into the overall service quality of audit firms by taking such smaller steps the bilateral audit supervision agreement may be reached upon which an overall cross border securities cooperative agreement for the long term can be built he said until that becomes reality us listed chinese companies have no other alternative but to look for short term solutions as the time is ticking for them on the us bourses such companies will consider going private returning to the a share market or listing in hong kong going private may be least welcome to listed companies as it indicates they will have to give up the financial market in general morning whistle group a shanghai based industrial investment services provider estimated that 48 relatively smaller us listed chinese companies may opt to go private as categorized by citic securities analysts companies having major information security risks will return to the a share market or the hong kong stock market at a faster pace including those related to national defense military and energy companies possessing public data covering sectors like finance logistics ride hailing biology and medicine will also find a quicker way back one possible choice is to list part of the company s business or assets on the a share market which is allowed according to the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges regulations or these companies can seek a complete return to the a share market it has been made possible by the adoption of the registration based ipo mechanism in july 2019 as requirements on shareholding structure profitability or sales revenue have been largely relaxed with the registration based ipo mechanism returning companies do not have to change their red chip shareholding structure it helps them to hold or control onshore assets either directly or indirectly through the use of offshore special purpose vehicles incorporated outside the chinese mainland to make an ipo or issue depositary receipts on the a share market they need to obtain approvals from the csrc and other government departments such as the national development and reform commission and the ministry of commerce china resources microelectronics limited which went public on the star market in shanghai on feb 27 2020 is the first returning company that did not have to change its red chip structure ever since five other hitherto us listed companies returned to the a share market treading the same path with telecom juggernaut china mobile being the latest the problem however is that less passive investment will be directed to such returning companies although the a share market has been included in the world s major indexes such as the msci and ftse russell and some investment products do passively follow their choices of stocks a limited number of a share companies have been selected so far in such indexes at present the a share market s weighting in the msci emerging markets index is about 4 2 percent equal to 157 billion worth of foreign capital inflows into the a share market since the inclusion three years ago international investors however currently hold about 1 8 trillion worth of shares of us listed chinese companies said han of zhejiang university insiders are not sure if the a share market can attract that level of investment if us listed chinese companies return home in this context the hong kong stock market is perhaps better placed as calculated by ubs 19 us listed chinese companies have made a secondary listing in hong kong and their combined market value is as much as 60 percent of the total market value of all us listed chinese companies another 50 companies of the kind are expected to return to the hong kong bourse this year based on that the 70 odd returnees will likely account for 97 percent of the market value of all the us listed chinese companies the size and liquidity of the hong kong stock market have been frequently questioned its daily trading value is only one eighth of its us counterparts but a dynamic perspective should be taken to understand the current difference said hu yifan regional chief investment officer and head of macroeconomics for asia pacific with ubs global wealth management if investors still hold a positive outlook on china s economy and wish to continue their investment in us listed chinese companies they will come to the hong kong market anyway said hu the current average daily trading value of the a share market is about 200 billion which is quite considerable although the returned us listed chinese companies are not included in the stock connects linking shanghai shenzhen and hong kong at present it will not take long to make that change the capacity of the hong kong market will be thus increased she said the hong kong bourse effected a revision at the beginning of this year allowing non innovative chinese mainland issuers without a weighted voting rights structure to make secondary listings under more relaxed requirements as an international hub hong kong is ready to welcome quality us listed chinese companies said hong kong secretary for financial services and the treasury christopher hui ching yu in early april the market choices will be thus enriched and liquidity will be increased he said but once the regulatory disputes are settled by china and the us the outbound reach of chinese companies will resume

audiences last year garnering a loyal following almost as soon as it hit the disney streaming service so much so in fact that people were hoping to see its stars host the 2022 oscars ceremony now that the first season of the show has come to a erm dramatic close folks are naturally curious about what to expect from season 2 of only murders in the building here s what we know about the next chapter for the arconia and the shockingly unlucky tenants who call the building home what is only murders in the building only murders in the building or omitb is a hulu original series that is being distributed in australia through disney s star service the show comes from the brains of co creators and writers steve martin and john hoffman grace frankie looking martin and hoffman executive produced the series along with martin short selena gomez jamie babbitt dan fogelman and jess rosenthal here s a synopsis of the show from disney from the minds of steve martin dan fogelman and john hoffman comes a comedic murder mystery series for the ages only murders in the building follows three strangers steve martin martin short and selena gomez who share an obsession with true crime and suddenly find themselves wrapped up in one when a grisly death occurs inside their exclusive upper west side apartment building the trio suspects murder and employs their precise knowledge of true crime to investigate the truth as they record a podcast of their own to document the case the three unravel the complex secrets of the building which stretch back years perhaps even more explosive are the lies they tell one another soon the endangered trio comes to realise a killer might be living amongst them as they race to decipher the mounting clues before it s too late what do we know about season 2 if you caught the season finale of only murders in the building spoilers from season 1 coming you ll know that although charles haden savage steve martin oliver putnam martin short and mabel mora selena gomez solved the mystery of tim kono s murder they wound up as the prime suspects of another murder right after bunny the grumpy building manager who tried to get our beloved podcasters evicted wound up dead at the end of the season 1 finale of only murders in the building and seeing as charles oliver and mabel were found with her body things don t look great season 2 of only murders in the building will likely explore the case of bunny s death and our podcasters involvement we can assume this will be bad news for mabel in particular as she was caught covered in blood with her knitting needle in bunny s chest after telling the building manager she was the most hated person in the building cinda canning tina fey will also presumably be a central character in season 2 as she will be running her new podcast only murderers in the building in the background co creator and executive producer john hoffman said of the season 2 confirmation that everyone in our amazing building worked with such love and expertise through extraordinary times and with incredible support from disney hulu and 20th tv to create a first season that might live up to our legendary cast our beloved new york city and to make a show about connection to feel we ve connected with our audience and hit the mark enough already to have the chance to continue and to carry on our show s wild ride of mystery comedy empathy is too exciting for words so i ll shut up now and just say a huge thanks to all and i can t wait for more hoffman also mentioned in an interview with queerty that season 2 will take a closer look at oliver s relationship with his family most recently we ve been treated to a season synopsis from disney here s what it says following the shocking death of arconia board

see them again they are coming back season 2 is bigger and better than ever the remainder of the cast hasn t been officially announced yet but drawing from the close of season 1 we can assume season 2 of only murders in the building will see aaron dominguez oscar or tie dye tina fey and da vine joy randolph detective williams return also who knows though we know from season 1 that dead characters have a pretty prominent role in the show so we may see more familiar faces still in addition to that we know that cara delevingne suicide squad has been cast in season 2 of only murders in the

share buybacks are wrongfully under attack they have long been a punching bag for american politicians especially left leaning ones such as senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren critics of share buybacks claim these transactions which involve a company purchasing its own stock from shareholders divert resources away from employees investments as well as r d they point to moves like the one recently made by starbucks howard schultz who suspended buybacks on his first day back as ceo to invest in employees and stores the most recent strike against buybacks was made by president joe biden in his 2023 budget plan it comes in two forms a 1 percent stock buyback tax proposed by democrats and a ban on corporate executives selling company shares in the first three years after a buyback the commendable intent behind the proposed legislation is to align the incentives of executives with those of long run shareholders and to encourage companies to invest in long term growth and innovation but the problem the legislation is meant to fix companies manipulating stock prices to enable executives to dump stock may not exist of even greater concern if passed this legislation is unlikely to align the incentives of managers and shareholders instead it may accomplish precisely the opposite it would create incentives for companies to hoard cash or spend it wastefully rather than paying it to shareholders even worse it may lead companies to delink executive pay and stock price disrupting the alignment of interests between executives and long term investors this legislation aims to establish the myth of price manipulation politicians claim that companies use share buybacks to manipulate stock prices permitting executives to unload shares at inflated prices this claim is based on two assumptions first that buybacks are an effective tool to manipulate stock price second that executives purposefully take advantage of these inflated prices to unload stockholdings can companies actually manipulate prices with share buybacks a common misperception is that buybacks mechanically cause stock prices to increase by decreasing the number of shares outstanding in truth a share buyback also decreases the value of the company s equity by a proportional amount thus while shareholders own a larger piece of the pie the pie itself is smaller meaning prices should not change moreover although earnings per share may increase if the return on assets is higher than the return on cash used to buy back stock the earnings are now riskier and should therefore be discounted at a higher rate so the present value of earnings per share does not increase again there is no mechanical reason why a stock buyback should increase share prices the case of apple another argument is that companies buying pressure pushes prices upward yet the latest research shows that buybacks price impact is minimal they inflate prices by only 0 4 to 0 7 percent for about a month it is hard to believe such small increases would motivate managers especially after accounting for transaction costs and capital gains taxes finally if companies are manipulating stock prices through buybacks then prices should revert in the long run but research shows that following buybacks prices continue to climb outperforming expectations in fact one obvious reason for buying back stock is market timing companies repurchase shares when they believe the shares are undervalued these findings certainly hold true for apple one of the largest repurchasers in recent years over the prior three fiscal years apple bought back us 225 billion of its own stock its stock price rose 167 percent over the same period managers selling into these repurchase programmes would have missed out on these long term gains trading restrictions and dilution if not to take advantage of artificially inflated stock prices why do insiders often sell when companies buy back their stock there are two simple explanations corporate blackout windows and dilution blackout windows prevent both companies and insiders from selling before the public release of material events like earnings announcements research shows that when blackout windows are over both companies and insiders resume trading buybacks and insider selling also coincide because performance based compensation like restricted stock and stock options result in companies issuing new shares of stock diluting the positions of existing owners companies counteract this dilution by buying back stock in other words while insiders may sell around buybacks this does not constitute proof that companies buy back stock to enable selling at high prices trading restrictions and dilution are more likely explanations the real reason behind starbucks move but the bigger concern behind the proposed legislation is the adverse consequences that would follow taxing buybacks would discourage companies from using them deterring buybacks is obviously the intent of the legislation and on the surface may seem honorable after all starbucks cut buybacks to invest in employees and long term projects and it would be easy to assume that inhibiting other companies from buying back shares would lead them too to treat employees better starbucks investment in employees was first and foremost a shrewd business decision the world s largest coffeehouse chain is facing a tight labour market and increasing pressure from unions making investments in its workforce not only beneficial for employees but also necessary to maintain shareholder value schultz himself said as much announcing his move as the only way to create long term value for all stakeholders in other words starbucks did not invest more in employees because it cut buybacks rather the coffee company reduced buybacks because of the necessity to invest in employees misalignment of interests deterring buybacks on a wide scale is therefore unlikely to lead to more investments or better outcomes for workers instead it may entice companies to increase dividends stockpile cash and invest in pet projects or empire building acquisitions it may even lead them to pay executives more why this is because buybacks are paid from corporate profits which represent the money left over after all projects and investments deemed worthy are undertaken so if the company needed to hire new workers or pay workers more or had a promising project in which to invest it would have already done so before determining buyback amounts but the most destructive piece of the legislation by far is the proposal to prohibit executives from selling stock up to three years after buybacks if companies decide to maintain buyback programmes they are likely to shift managers compensation away from stock based pay since managers would not be able to cash out in a reasonable timeframe this shift away from performance based pay would align managers interests even less with those of long term shareholders running completely contrary to the stated goals of the legislation to accomplish the objective of the legislation policymakers would be better served by tweaking the tax code to further encourage long term investment horizons vilifying buybacks is not the answer

review and preview the u s economy saw solid job growth in april suggesting the labor market is still strong despite headwinds from rising interest rates soaring inflation a worsening labor shortage and fears of a slowdown employers added 428 000 jobs in april the labor department said in its monthly payroll report released friday beating the 391 000 jobs forecast by refinitiv economists it marked the 12th consecutive month that job gains topped 400 000 the unemployment rate meanwhile held steady at 3 6 the lowest level since february 2020 megan henney us economy sees healthy job growth in april as payrolls jump by 428 000 www foxbusiness com may 6 2022 it was the return of the taper tantrum last week as the next act of this dr jekyll and mr hyde stock market drama got underway is it going to finally slay the bull or will the bear finally go into hibernation and let the stock market come back to life last week it seemed to vacillate between both possibilities as the plot thickens or sickens depending on who you are rooting for the week began with fears that the fed might raise rates by ¾ points this led to a huge monday sell off on wednesday the fed announced the mostly expected rise of only a ½ point and the market had a bout of irrational exuberance with the djia rising over 900 points in its biggest daily rally since october 2020 but all that was completely forfeited the next day as the jekyll hyde taper tantrum resumed with the market down over 1000 points in fact three days last week witnessed price ranges exceeding 1000 points it was every bit as wild and crazy as the cosmos suggested with the moon in gemini monday wednesday and then the powerful conjunction of sun and uranus on thursday this was covered all week on our several twitter posts starting last monday may 2 through thursday may 5 last week s planetary lineup was a symbol of chaos an emotional earthquake the ground was not solid nor was any ceiling of resistance whatever appeared to be a boundary was broken and the result wasn t just a case of neptunian confusion but rather uranus mayhem it wasn t just in the u s either it was global in asia and the pacific rim the australian asx and india nifty indices continued their steepest declines since the important lows of january february for those who study chart patterns those early year lows represent the head of an inverse head and shoulders pattern in many indices like the nifty and the smi of switzerland in china hong kong and japan the recent lows of april 27 held up in last week s shortened trading in europe the decline of last week remained well above the recent lows of march 7 8 so this recent pullback is still just a corrective decline however in the u s it was a very different and more worrisome stock market performance both the nasdaq and s p took out their lows of january march for the s p it was its lowest mark since may 19 2021 the nasdaq plunged to its lowest level since november 24 2020 they look ominous but the djia continued to hold above its low of february 24 the day of the russian attack on ukraine as long as that low holds we have a case of intermarket bullish divergence in other markets bitcoin and ethereum followed the path of global stock indices which was basically lower into friday bitcoin tested 35 000 and ethereum 2700 but so far each continues to hold above their lows of january and february gold and silver continued their descent as well gold fell below 1850 intraweek and silver tested 22 00 only two months ago gold was testing its all time high at 2078 and silver was around 27 50 lately all that glitters is not gold on the other hand crude oil was strong rising above 111 during the day on thursday the bottom line is that we have a lot to talk about on sunday s special annual spring webinar on financial markets see announcements below short term geocosmics and longer term thoughts clarity is not apt to suddenly make an appearance this week we now have to contend with the return of the cosmic trickster mercury retrograde beginning may 10 and lasting through june 3 what a fine time for the white house to serve up this bright idea of creating a new ministry of truth with a new disinformation board it is a nice thought but who will determine the truth who will decide upon what constitutes disinformation doesn t google msnbc and fox already do this right now the debate is whether to name it the board of disinformation or misinformation the trickster is going to have a lot of fun with this one the trickster might also enjoy playing in the current market production of dr jekyll and mr hyde when mercury is retrograde many financial markets will start out one way and then suddenly reverse every 1 4 days at each interval it tends to give a buy or sell signal that is almost immediately negated in what we call fake outs just like last week s behavior under mercury s higher and more volatile octave of uranus if trading is an art this is when the abstract becomes the trend may 10 11 also begins the first phase of jupiter s entrance into aries which will last for five months until october 27 28 before briefly returning back to pisces until the end of the year then back again into aries until may 2023 on the one hand aries is the sign associated with mars the god of war aggressors are prone to act out with bolder initiatives especially when mars joins up with jupiter god of abundance and exaggeration in aries on may 29 however for stock markets of the world this may also indicate a more aggressive period for investors who will be looking for something to get more aggressive about i think of jupiter in aries as bold and adventurous which could be good for equities looking back in history wars are not always bad for equity markets after an initial plunge they are just bad for people who desire peace which is basically most of those who inhabit this planet nevertheless mars and jupiter together in aries is apt to be a muscular time when those garnering the most attention will be those who act out the most aggressively and perhaps most outrageously in their accusation of others they proclaim to be too weak to lead this will be just in time for the 2022 midterm elections it might be entertaining more than likely it will be obnoxious and embarrassing as the era of extremism and excess has its final hurrah a department of disinformation or misinformation will be overwhelmed if it gets off the ground during this period nothing is factual or provable everything may seem libelous insulting or offensive especially to those who are serious this is a time to not take things so seriously but that is difficult to muster when lives are at risk however jupiter in aries also has its benefits it wants its freedom and it will seek fun and be engaged in more activities it won t stand still and let life pass by it may be very competitive but that may only lead to superhuman feats many records in athletic events may be broken many new frontiers may open up in space and education it may seem like we are entering a new era of thought and activity fear may give way to greater bravado and confidence people will feel like taking more risks opening up new avenues for trade and business activity and i think that can be bullish for global stock markets

a visitor passes by the exhibition area of bilibili at an expo in shanghai on aug 1 the video platform has been added to a list of firms facing possible delisting in the us 280 odd troubled us listed chinese companies pin hopes on solutions for the long term when chinese beverage chain luckin coffee was ejected from nasdaq in june 2020 after it had admitted a couple of months earlier that it had cooked its books little did market mavens realize the development will not only have serious implications for the 280 odd us listed chinese companies but cast a shadow on bilateral trade economic and diplomatic relations in the last 12 months the nasdaq golden dragon china index which tracks us listed chinese companies plunged more than 60 percent this market insiders said reflects downbeat investor sentiment made further dour by the us securities and exchange commission s penchant to subject such companies to potential punitive measures like delisting for allegedly failing to meet the local regulator s audit requirements altogether 128 us listed chinese companies including restaurant chain yum china holdings inc and technology giant baidu inc have been put on the provisional or conclusive lists of issuers identified under the holding foreign companies accountable act hfcaa so far with 23 of them already placed on the conclusive list a prelude to eventual delisting all this has forced market people to ponder the future consensus is fast emerging that things need to move beyond quick fixes like eyeing secondary listings in china and toward long term solutions like solid bilateral agreements only that experts said can help undo the damage inflicted by the june 2020 memorandum issued by former us president donald trump on protecting united states investors from significant risks from chinese companies that memo led to the hfcaa which became law on dec 18 2020 even since the law has been invoked mainly to prevent chinese mainland companies from listing on us exchanges and to target us listed chinese companies for allegedly not complying with the audit requirements of the public company accounting oversight board which oversees the audits of all us listed companies han hongling a professor from the school of management at zhejiang university said although us regulators have not exactly been neutral in their financial supervision the chinese authorities concerned have consistently displayed steely resolve to find workable and mutually fair long term solutions for instance the china securities regulatory commission the country s top securities watchdog said in mid march that agreements for cooperation should be forged as soon as possible to protect the lawful rights and interests of investors worldwide during the boao forum for asia annual conference 2022 in april csrc vice chairman fang xinghai said the pcaob in the us will be able to conduct inspections in china of chinese accounting firms that audit us listed chinese companies in a reasonable rational and legal manner a bilateral cooperation agreement is about to be reached in the near future he said without specifying a time frame experts said the need of the hour is the establishment of institutional mechanisms to create clarity on cross border supervision but that is not a terribly new idea because way back in april 1994 china and the us had signed a memorandum of understanding regarding cooperation consultation and the provision of technical assistance through exchange of information and securities materials the larger idea was to facilitate the implementation of securities laws of the respective markets but not much happened after that no detailed regulation was drafted said han of zhejiang university
an investor checks share prices at a brokerage in fuyang anhui province despite all the fluctuations and uncertainties in the stock market in the first few months of the year the ipo scene is still worth investors closer look to figure out the market direction insiders said the a share market may prove to be one of the few highlights globally in terms of ipos in the first quarter although only 85 ipos were recorded during the period down 15 percent year on year total financing surged 136 percent year on year to 179 9 billion yuan 27 2 billion according to deloitte a global provider of audit consulting tax and advisory services the shanghai stock exchange was the world s largest listing venue for new shares in the first quarter recording 37 ipos whose total financing reached 116 6 billion yuan according to deloitte this can be largely attributed to the big ticket return of china mobile to the shanghai bourse at the beginning of the year the shenzhen bourse ranked third worldwide in terms of ipo value in the first quarter with 41 debuting companies raising 62 1 billion yuan the beijing stock exchange which commenced trading in november 2021 saw seven ipos that netted 1 2 billion yuan in all a share ipos which are not totally immune to geopolitical tensions and global uncertainties are still worth a close look since volatility has been rising in global stock markets said hu ke deloitte china s audit and assurance partner experts said the central government s economic plans could spawn growth opportunities for small to medium sized manufacturing technology medical and pharmaceutical companies which are expected to account for a bulk of this year s ipos the 14th five year plan 2021 25 for the development of china s pharmaceutical industry states that the industry s operating income and total profit should both register average annual growth of more than 8 percent during the period the ministry of industry and information technology said the majority of manufacturing companies with an annual sales revenue of at least 20 million yuan should realize digitalization by the end of 2025 the operating income from the robotics industry the miit said should grow at an average annual rate of over 20 percent when the monitoring period ends the tech heavy star market in shanghai will see up to 200 ipos this year with their proceeds estimated at 250 billion yuan up to 240 companies are likely to list on the tech heavy chinext in shenzhen guangdong province and may raise 180 billion yuan the main boards of the shanghai and shenzhen bourses will see 150 ipos by the end of this year and could raise over 230 billion yuan deloitte said the registration based ipo mechanism will help expand the market scale and drive up the size of each ipo this year said hu outside the chinese mainland the ipo scene in hong kong offers a contrast with only 15 new companies listing in the first three months of the year down from 32 during the same period of 2021 the 15 ipos raised hk 13 6 billion 1 73 billion down by as much as 90 percent from the 2021 level deloitte experts said the drastic contraction of hong kong s ipo market can be largely attributed to uncertainties and a not so optimistic outlook arising from the russia ukraine conflict and the resurgence of the covid 19 pandemic in some parts of the chinese mainland however deloitte said it still expects 120 ipos to raise hk 330 billion in hong kong this year investors will be more interested in ipos of companies from industries like medicine technology media and telecom or those related to the esg environment social and governance theme investors should closely watch the return of us listed chinese companies to the hong kong stock market which will become a major highlight in the following months experts from kpmg a professional services provider said the us securities and exchange commission has been targeting us listed chinese companies since the beginning of the year it added more than 80 companies to its list of entities facing possible expulsion from us exchanges on wednesday for allegedly failing to meet the us audit requirements stated in the holding foreign companies accountable act hfcaa with that altogether 105 us listed chinese companies have been put on a provisional list of issuers identified under the hfcaa although top regulators continued talks to settle the dispute these companies still face the risk of being delisted from the us stock market in 2024 yet the number of chinese companies dual listed in hong kong and the united states has been rising given the uncertainties for us listed chinese companies hong kong will continue to serve as the prime option for a return to the domestic market said kpmg another highlight of hong kong s ipo market in the first quarter has been the debut of aquila acquisition corp the first spac company a special purpose acquisition company a shell company listed on a stock exchange for the purpose of acquiring a private company aquila started trading on march 18 and raised hk 1 billion this was only two months after the spac listing mechanism took effect on the hong kong bourse deloitte estimated that there will be at least 20 flotations of spac companies in hong kong by the end of this year each raising at least hk 1 billion irene chu partner and head of new economy and life sciences at kpmg china said she expects the first spac acquisition to be completed before year end the spac mechanism has shown the hong kong bourse s resolve to further promote the city s competitiveness as a financing hub she said
listen to this article listen to this article eagle pharmaceuticals is emerging from the pandemic in solid shape the woodcliff lake based company boasts a robust pipeline and just added two commercialized products through its acquisition of acacia pharma in short eagle is ready to soar so what s next njbiz recently spoke with scott tarriff the company s founder president and ceo about how eagle has conducted business over the past several years and how its leadership plans to continue that success fortunately for us if you just look at the way we run our business over the last five or six years we ve been highly profitable relative to our size we ve generated a lot of cash we ve put it in the bank we bought back our stock and so we don t have debt to worry about tarriff said we don t have anything holding us down that we really had to be concerned about maybe we made a little bit less money and maybe our stock is down a little bit more than we would like it to be but at the end of the day we re right in the middle of launching two significant products we re generating a lot of revenue and profit from those we re in a position where cash is probably very important we don t need to raise money we re building cash every day and so we re in a great situation what follows is an abridged version of that conversation the questions and answers have been edited for length and clarity a video of the full interview is available at njbiz com njbizconversations njbiz there s a lot of i wanted to get to i wanted to start with some recent news though the company s acquisition of acacia pharma i know you added two commercialized hospital products in that deal was that something that was just sort of opportunistic because the target was struggling a bit and it just popped up or is this part of a strategy scott tarriff it s a little bit of both it s an exciting time as we try the best we can to be students of our own industry and right now we look historically companies like ours other companies in the space are trading at historic lows we ve been prudent over the years we ve been generating a significant amount of cash relative to our size we bought back a lot of our stock we don t have any debt and we have infrastructure that will allow us to bring several more products into the company without needing a lot of additional infrastructure and so after years of being focused on organic internal development we decided to start to acquire and the acquisition of acacia is i hope the first of a few acquisitions and we use this cash that we ve over the years to build out the value of our company q ok companies do deals for a lot of reasons to add scale add new technologies geographic or market reach are you just looking for specific products how would you evaluate potential targets a how we ve developed over the years is we portray ourselves as both a hospital company and an oncology company we ve developed products and we commercialize products in both categories so we built a nice extension here in our hospital portfolio and offerings with the two products barhemsys and bayfavo we re filing another emergency room product that s landiolol that we ll file next year i think going forward we re concentrating on oncology right now we re trying to stay away from clinical risk we re trying to stay away from regulatory risk and we are looking for products that are already marketed that could fit into our sales team where our focus is right now i think we re going to be successful q and you did say it was a combination of both so organic growth is still a part of what you re hoping to accomplish here a yes and the last few months we were in the middle of two launches keeping us very busy vasopressin and pemfexy vasopressin is a hospital product and pemfexy is an oncology product we re filing landiolol next month we were able to achieve an approval in japan recently for one of our products and so the organic growth is working pretty well now it s time to take the risk out of it we have quite a bit of faith in our commercial team bringing products into the market and that are already in the market q you mentioned a couple of products by name and i wanted to ask you about what s in the pipeline what can you tell us about first of all the two that you mentioned and anything else interesting that s coming along a the first product we call it calo2 is a novel product for severe pneumonia and we re very excited about it because it really could be a breakthrough therapy for severe pneumonia patients if all of it works out the way we hope and i think we struck a really strong deal for our shareholders we paid about 10 million up front for the asset and we ll start the study later this year for pneumonia season and then hopefully we ll have interim results sometime at the end of the summer next year we need about 25 million to get us to those interim results in addition to the 10 million that we outlayed so far so for 35 million of our shareholders cash we re going to find out when we see those interim results if we really have a blockbuster product on our hands or not and look it would be a tremendous value to these patients if it works then the second product that we have in development right now in fact we re going back into the clinic next week which we re really very excited about is a new version of faslodex the generic name being fulvestrant it s been a long road quite frankly for us we ve been in the clinic two or three other times hopefully we ve solved some of the issues that we ve seen formulation issues hopefully we re around them and we should have news about the success there or not in september there s a lot of good news flow and hopefulness coming up in the short term q as you know state officials here and people in your industry like to believe that new jersey is a good place for companies like yours to do business the medicine chest of the world that whole thing how do
