edited by dan rys livexlive s hedge fund problem livexlive chairman ceo rob ellin a 30 year veteran of the investment and turnaround industry is no stranger to lawsuits but a recent legal dispute by a former executive at his company has raised new questions about the relationship between the hedge funds ellin operates and livexlive on its face schuyler hoversten s 2 million lawsuit against the west hollywood company isn t that different from the half dozen lawsuits ellin already faces in california and new york for allegedly breaching agreements to pay various former employees and debtors with shares of livexlive that were never delivered livexlive ceo rob ellin speaks during the livexlive ces afterparty at catch on jan 8 2019 in las vegas isaac brekken getty images for livexlive but hoversten s suit is the first to take on ellin s trinad capital master fund a cayman islands hedge fund controlled by ellin with the purpose of financing ventures like livexlive trinad is marketed to investors as a diversified fund that focuses on small publicly traded companies according to its prospectus reporting 46 million in assets under management in 2021 according to public filings according to hoversten s complaint investing in trinad seemed like a good bet trinad s financial prospectus showed a 109 annualized return rate and while ellin usually required a 1 million investment to buy into the exclusive fund he allowed hoversten to buy in at 750 000 according to emails introduced as exhibits in the case but not long after wiring the money hoversten claims he became concerned about a lack of transparency at trinad on oct 2 hoversten emailed ellin asking how much exposure does the fund have to livexlive ellin responded telling schuyler his invitation to join the fund should be viewed as a gift and told hoversten to focus on getting deals done over the next six months while trinad did own 20 of livexlive s stock ellin promised hoversten that the livexlive investment represented a small fraction of the fund s holdings and said that all investments were capped at a 15 position hoversten s attorney ethan brown writes in the arbitration claim this would turn out to not be the case according to the lawsuit trending on billboard in january 2019 hoversten received an annual statement on his investment showing a 13 loss for the quarter and a 3 5 gain for the year when he protested ellin sent profanity laced responses accusing hoversten of stupidity and ungratefulness according to court documents when hoversten tried to liquidate his position in trinad in august 2019 ellin eventually admitted the fund was invested in many positions but livx heavily weighted months later he told hoversten to expect heavy losses in his investment if he pulled out at the time january 2020 hoversten had already seen his investment lose 230 000 hoversten s attorneys would go on to find out that as much as 90 of ellin s investment was used to buy up livexlive stock according to the lawsuit when hoversten asked why his portfolio had lost money while its main asset shares of livexlive were up more than 300 since his initial investment ellin responded we don t provide transparency to anyone and later told hoversten to lose my forever hoversten s lawyers claim ellin benefitted from the fund s heavily weighted asset concentration in livexlive and contend his role as chairman and chief executive is in substantial part due to the fund s holdings of livexlive stock they re asking for 2 million in damages and lost profits ellin did not respond to a request for comment dave brooks who will buy a 10 share of universal music group when vivendi announced on tuesday it may sell a 10 stake in universal music group to a u s investor speculation began about who would spend a few billion on the world s largest music company before it s spun off from its parent conglomerate in september the label publisher is valued at 33 billion euros 40 billion making a 10 investment worth at least 4 billion perhaps more for a motivated buyer asking around one name keeps popping up liberty media the majority owner of satellite radio provider siriusxm itself owner of music streamer pandora and 33 of concert promoter live nation liberty also owns 5 of terrestrial broadcaster iheartmedia and tried to buy 40 while iheartmedia was in chapter 11 bankruptcy and despite concerns a larger stake would result in anticompetitive behavior the department of justice approved liberty s request to increase its stake beyond 5 in july 2020 liberty media could take a piece of umg and add intellectual property to a full stack vertically integrated media company on paper at least universal could woo artists by offering exposure on liberty owned broadcasters and with concerts on live nation run tours and festivals it wouldn t be the first time a broadcast company owned a record label cbs owned a group of record labels including columbia records from 1938 until 1988 when it sold them to sony in the 2000s live nation dabbled with a short lived record label it signed zac brown band in 2008 but closed down soon after and brown signed with atlantic records and inked deals with jay z madonna shakira and nickelback that gave it a share of the artists revenue streams such as recorded music merchandise and licensing but never has an entertainment company stacked up a label publisher promoter and three broadcast formats terrestrial online and satellite under one roof in a lot of businesses where malone has exposure vertical integration doesn t really make sense says citi analyst jason bazinet but it does in the music space a business model that provides a movie channel to one company s cable customers isn t sensible he argues liberty owned starz encore a competitor to showtime and hbo wanted the widest distribution possible to reach the most potential subscribers but with a stake in umg liberty would own a piece of intellectual property that can add value to its entertainment properties at the very least liberty would come away with greater knowledge of the recording and publishing industries some sources say that since the music asset class has become attractive to institutional investors pimco the huge financial investment firm more formerly known as pacific investment management co has been investigating ways to get a piece of the action it joined with liberty media and franklin resource in the bid for iheartmedia with well over 1 trillion under investment it certainly has the deep pockets to invest in the umg deal even at 4 billion for a 10 piece meanwhile other executives speculate that such investment firms as fidelity investments or t rowe price might be considering the umg investment because both are known for taking positions in companies that are planning to or on the verge of going other possible investors have been in the market for music in the past institutional investors tpg dragoneer and goldman sachs bought 1 billion in spotify s convertible debt just two years before its direct listing on the new york stock exchange in 2018 the sony atv led consortium that acquired emi music publishing from citi in 2012 included mubadala capital the uae sovereign wealth fund one party to show interest in music in the past is ron burkle s yucaipa companies which tried to buy warner music group in 2011 and emi music in 2011 universal music group had the winning bid platinum equity led by tom gores and the gores group also bid on wmg which was ultimately acquired by current owner access industries vivendi sold 20 of umg to a consortium led by chinese tech giant tencent last year and plans to keep 10 for at least two years the company said tuesday it will float 60 of umg shares on the euronext amsterdam stock exchange by sept 27 glenn peoples ed christman ftc knocks back latest call for investigation of ticketmaster it s been more than a decade since live nation acquired ticketmaster and became the world s largest concert company but congressman bill pascrell d nj has refused to veer from his publicly stated goal of splitting the company up since the deal was approved in 2010 pascrell has made five separate calls for the company and the merger to be investigated by the department of justice and the federal trade commission so far without success in 2020 the ftc responded by commissioning a report on the ticketing industry that called for more transparency from ticketmaster but ultimately found that the ticket resale industry was most to blame for the majority of consumer complaints in ticketing the report also did not endorse a key provision of the boss act a ticketing reform package pascrell had been trying to pass since 2009 that provision would have banned companies like ticketmaster from forcing consumers to use digital tickets which pascrell described as an attempt by ticketmaster to choke out competitors conversely the report indicated digital only tickets could be useful for fighting scalpers on high demand shows u s representative bill pascrell michael brochstein sopa images shutterstock now pascrell is trying again hoping to have better luck with the biden administration he sent a letter on april 19 to acting ftc chair rebecca slaughter calling for live nation to be investigated for potentially unfair deceptive and anticompetitive practices as well as efforts to attempt to choke off competition during the pandemic slaughter s response was not what many expected while she acknowledged pascrell s concerns and outlined steps the agency had taken recently against illegal resale outfits she had her own request for pascrell for congress to act quickly to increase the ftc s budget and restore the agency s power after it was stripped away by the supreme court i would be remiss if i did not note two acute ftc specific challenges in carrying out the agency s mission slaughter wrote in a letter dated may 13 the first challenge was that ftc funding has not kept up with the increasing demand on our competition and consumer protection work the agency s 330 million 2021 budget was about 800 000 less than 2020 according to congressional records the second issue was much more serious on april 22 the u s supreme court unanimously ruled that the 40 year old law that created the ftc did not give it the power to force companies to pay restitution to consumers for unfair or deceptive acts or practices i look forward to working with congress to ensure that the commission has the resources and tools it needs to protect consumers and promote competition including by pursuing appropriate enforcement action to address ongoing concerns in the event ticketing industry slaughter wrote while pascrell s letter was sent prior to the april 22 ruling a source at live nation who did not wish to be identified said pascrell s constant calls for investigation ignore the fact that live nation is operating under a doj consent decree which essentially is a state of non stop government monitoring and investigation the consent decree instituted in 2010 and extended until 2025 significantly limits what live nation can be investigated for namely violations of competitive ticketing practices not scalping or digital ticketing without a legislative overhaul of the ticketing business pascrell s non stop calls for investigations are pointless because the agencies he s addressing don t actually have the power to do what he is asking them to do the source tells billboard dave brooks
officials at the federal reserve are working to make sure history does not repeat itself it has been eight years since the economy witnessed the infamous taper tantrum when the federal reserve hinted that it would reduce its bond purchases and triggered a minor panic in financial markets robert kaplan the president of the federal reserve bank of dallas warns it is time to start thinking about easing what is known as quantitative easing federal funds rate about to rise when and how mortgages other loans will be impacted i ve been saying pretty consistently for the last few weeks as it becomes clear that we are weathering this pandemic that it would be wise to begin talking sooner rather than later about adjusting our purchases kaplan told fox business edward lawrence during an interview on cavuto coast to coast kaplan comments came after the release of the federal open market committee s minutes from their late april meeting the readout from the april 27th meeting stated that several committee members suggested that if the economy continued to make rapid progress toward the committee s goals it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchases although kaplan admitted the issue needed to be confronted quickly he wouldn t commit to a timeline saying i m not put a calendar date on it sooner rather than later he stated these purchases were put in place last year were very appropriate then but as we are transitioning out i am concerned about excesses and imbalances in the economy in risk taking certainly in the housing market where i think we oughta begin discussing the efficacy of these purchases versus some of the side effects and unintended consequences the former senior associate dean at harvard business school noted fed signals improving economy may warrant policy review the fed is hoping to assuage recent anxiety after the labor department recently reported its consumer price index jumped 4 2 in april from a year earlier up from 2 6 for the year ended in march the news sent shock waves across wall street as u s stocks fell and government bond yields rose in the wake of the labor department s announcement i think we are seeing a wide range of supply demand imbalances said kaplan about inflation concerns we ve been expecting and warning a surge in prices not just over the summer months but for the remainder of this year and i think there is a lot of uncertainty among contacts i talk to about how this is gonna unfold click here to read more on fox business kaplan was also asked about the federal reserve s role in helping bring down inflation earlier than expected for me rather than trying to predict the future with certainty my job is to not get wedded to any one outcome and to realize there is a range of outcomes that are plausible i think about risk management and that s why i ve been saying maybe take the foot off the accelerator reducing the rpm s sooner rather than later might keep us from having to press on the brakes down the road said kaplan

the plunge in bitcoin helped sour the mood for all risk assets though the tech sector eked out a small gain for the past week the fed s preferred inflation measure the personal consumption expenditures price index will be released friday that report could affect the market if the number is hot earnings season is slowing down but there are still some important companies like costco and nvidia releasing reports the trading pattern of the past two weeks particularly alongside cryptocurrency s movements suggests stocks could continue to be volatile in the week ahead investors are watching the wild swings in bitcoin and trying to gauge whether technology shares can gain traction after a rally attempt in the past week the dow and s p 500 were lower in the past week but nasdaq was slightly higher helped by a positive move in tech as well as buying in biotech and big cap growth names like fang members alphabet facebook and netflix get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters a steep plunge in bitcoin after china announced new regulations soured the mood for risk assets during the past week the u s also called for stricter compliance with the irs further on friday china said it would crack down on bitcoin mining and trading what s interesting is the market is being bullied around by where bitcoin goes said peter boockvar chief investment officer with bleakley advisory group bitcoin plunged by as much as 30 on wednesday to about 30 000 though it recovered to above 42 000 it slid again on friday the cryptocurrency was down about 9 late friday hovering around 36 000 according to coin metrics bitcoin is a poster child for risk appetite said boockvar it tells you the stock market is more on uneven ground if we re getting dragged along by bitcoin there is some key data in the week ahead consumer confidence home price data and new home sales are out on tuesday durable goods will be released thursday and the consumer sentiment report is issued friday but the most important data will be the personal income and spending data which includes the personal consumption expenditure price deflator the fed s preferred inflation measure the key to next week is going to be the inflation numbers the inflation numbers are now becoming the new payroll numbers in terms of market performance said boockvar what will also be interesting is inside the consumer confidence numbers is where the inflation expectations go the consumer price index was surprisingly hot when released last week showing core inflation at a year over year pace of 3 in april the core pce price index was up 1 8 year over year in march in the week ahead earnings season is winding down but there continue to be reports from retailers like best buy costco and nordstrom nvidia and dell also report no correction yet as the market has chopped around this month dip buyers have stepped into the declines and snapped up perceived bargains some strategists do not see a correction just yet though pullbacks could continue for me my framework is we can only get a 10 correction when we have a liquidity set back when we have a policy tightening said barry knapp managing partner of ironsides macroeconomics in any of the little disturbances we are getting about a 4 to 6 pullback knapp said investors are fretting too much about higher interest rates being a problem for technology companies you should be in the cyclical parts of tech he said knapp noted that subsectors like semiconductors and software should do well with the economic reopening and global manufacturing rebound tech squeaked out a slight gain in the past week gaining 0 1 but semiconductors popped nearly 3 software was up 0 2 the nasdaq was 0 3 higher on the week to 13 470 while the dow was off a half percent at 34 207 the s p 500 was down 0 4 to 4 155 the best performing sector was real estate investment trusts up 0 9 followed by health care up 0 7 biotech was higher on the week with the ibb ishares nasdaq biotech etf up 1 1 it wouldn t shock me if we went straight back to new highs knapp said part of the reason i thought we would trade in a range was earnings season was done but net revisions is surging he said earnings for the s p 500 are now expected to be up 7 more for the year than when the first quarter reporting season began knapp expects the fed may discuss tapering its bond buying at its jackson hole meeting in late summer and that is the likely trigger for a correction back to world war ii he said the first correction after a recession was triggered by the fed normalizing policy last cycle we had eight of those he said every attempt they made to normalize policy caused one of these risk off events knapp said it s natural for investors to be focused on the fed now it s an uncertainty shock he said it will cause a correction and everyone is focused on it the fed has not really changed its policy since the depths of the pandemic knapp said treasury yields have drifted lower during efforts in washington to reach a bipartisan plan on infrastructure spending but he expects the market to react differently in the next two weeks since he expects those efforts will clearly fail and democrats will focus on a big spending program that will increase the deficit the bitcoin crypto mania was lifted by the idea of big spending from washington and the infrastructure spending could be positive the thing that was the surprise in 2021 that really drove the mania was the blue wave and then

at the california state capitol lawmakers have to decide how to spend a budget featuring huge infusions of cash from taxpayers and the american rescue plan editor s note last week we asked about a nearly 76 billion budget surplus that figure included money that is committed by law to be spent or saved as the legislature s budget analyst subsequently pointed out investing in desal will serve the most people once again our state faces severe drought conditions as in the past and for sure as we will in the future advertisement our governor and legislators can cement their legacies by utilizing a portion of the current budget surplus as well as some of the current additional federal funds by investing in 25 to 30 new desalination plants along our coast approximately 70 percent of our state s population lives within 30 miles of our coastline we have about 11 desal plants currently most are pretty small with a few more planned this is not enough with the addition of many more plants the population of our state will have a stable long term solution to reliable water supplies presently the largest desal plant in the u s is in carlsbad providing 8 to 10 percent of san diego county s water supply that plant produces about 50 million gallons a day new plants should be scaled up to 75 to 100 million gallons per day with the objective of supplying at least 70 percent of our population s water needs advertisement if coastal populations do not take water from the sierras or the colorado river then the ever important agribusiness in our state will benefit california s economy is very much dependent upon agriculture thousands of acres have gone fallow as a result of recent drought years this doesn t have to happen again in the future all californians know there will be future earthquakes and they can be most destructive to water supplies with a dispersed network of desal plants there is a reduced risk of widespread lack of water when the next big one hits next week george floyd a minneapolis police officer murdered george floyd a year ago how do you think the u s has changed since then what gives you hope or what gives you concern email your 500 word essay by wednesday to yoursay sduniontribune com and we may publish it in the newspaper and online please include your name community and a phone number we won t publish advertisement new and existing desal plants should turn to using renewable energy wind solar wave and tidal turbines to provide the power to run them if this is done then the cost of desal water will come down since the cost of energy to produce desal water has been an issue of concern we are blessed to have the pacific ocean at our doorstep let s take advantage of our proximity to this greatest of all sources of water this investment will benefit everyone in our state gary flynn carlsbad advertisement so many ways that money could be spent thanks for asking for our thoughts about the governor s 267 8 billion budget how about reducing state gasoline taxes or state sales taxes to put money right into the pockets of californians while i applaud the 8 billion for water and drought issues i would like to see more spending on permanent solutions to our water supply challenges advertisement clean up the problems at the department of motor vehicles and the employment development department and demand better accountability for those departments while i am not a fan of funds for the high speed rail project i do think transportation can be improved statewide i urge the governor to continue investing in a rainy day fund for california this year we were saved by the stock market and pandemic relief advertisement finally one thing i don t want to see in the budget is pay increases for elected officials laura impastato normal heights put money to work for small businesses the state of california windfall will grow even larger on the backs of small businesses that accepted federal paycheck protection program ppp funding the state taxes the ppp funds businesses received unless they had a drop in income of 25 percent or more while the federal government counts ppp as income taxes are only applied to the adjusted gross income advertisement but the state of california does not allow any business expenses to offset the ppp funds so in these cases the state is taxing ppp income as profit in other words taxing the top line not the bottom line the federal ppp money was designed to help businesses not enrich state government a company can lose 20 percent of its business post a loss and yet still be required to pay taxes on its ppp give that money back to businesses that need it glenn younger ramona advertisement let s get our beaches back in working order i m coming from a very selfish place i would like to see funds from the state budget surplus of 38 billion for an ongoing program for sand replenishment on san diego beaches this would obviously benefit residents businesses and tourists if we have no beach sand in which to stick our feet we become a far more ordinary place to live we are at the tipping point for losing our beaches over the winter of 1983 84 the north county shoreline was reduced to cobblestones by the waves and currents of large seasonal storms this winter we experienced a fairly normal storm cycle except for a late season two week period of medium high surf and that has caused the sand to all but disappear surf comes up to the riprap barrier at the base of homes in oceanside at low tide ponto state beach has no sand its parking lot holds more than 100 cars they generate more than 100 000 for the state each year the beaches north of cardiff have been chewed back creating steep slopes of cobblestones at high tide there is little to no sand at all a 6 foot plus high tide at south cardiff state beach seaside beach floods the parking lot which often fills to a capacity of more than 150 spaces at 8 per day these beaches serve as the canary in the coal mine for the san diego county shoreline we are at the tipping point advertisement i ve got a little bit of background in the study and love of sand i lived on the bluff at 245 pacific street in solana beach see phil diehl s recent article about the bluff from 1978 to 1997 i started tidelines tide calendars in 1981 i conceived of the surfrider foundation chapters and was president of the san diego chapter in 1991 i created the resandiego project a grass roots organization that educated on the topic of the need for beach sand replenishment and was instrumental in raising 10 million from the u s government ideally san diego beach sand is nourished by sediment flow from our local rivers over time these sources have all but been stopped by dams railroads roads and freeways and upriver sand mining our estuaries are being filled with sand that normally would reach the shore the natural order has been disrupted we have to manage our spectacular coastline other than the minimal addition of bluff erosion and some opportunistic soil excavation projects we are left with two options both are costly but necessary we can dredge our lagoons but we would have to pump long distances under roads to the shore we have dredged offshore sand deposits and pumped the sand onto the beaches in the past in 2001 2 1 million yards of sand was pumped onto our beaches at a cost of 17 7 million in 2012 1 5 million yards was pumped costing 22 5 million these projects have had satisfactory results in keeping our beaches healthy it s now time for another sand project advertisement there is no budget for the sand we need according to the sandag shoreline preservation committee but 38 million is 0 1 percent of the available funds this would suffice for a one time project of restoring our beaches and give our elected officials time to budget for future projects john conover encinitas take enough time to make the right deal i think a lot of people are wondering how any state can get a windfall the size that the state of california just received 38 billion dollars it is almost too much to wrap your head around gavin newsom and the state of california have some decisions to make the question is how should these funds be allocated advertisement i spent some time thinking about this question being a california state resident born and raised for 59 years how would i like to see it spent i ran through a list of ideas in my head and to be honest it is just endless infrastructure the environment education families the homeless marginalized groups of people or simply put it in a reserve fund all worthy of financial attention but there are questions that i simply cannot answer what are the restrictions on how this money is spent is it a free for all or is it designated for certain purposes who makes the decision is newsom at the helm or do we have a say and vote on this yikes what an open ended prompt so this is what i think let s make a deal what if we put the following options behind door no 1 door no 2 and door no 3 the options are greed maintenance and people yup i think that would cover it then we spin the wheel greed if we divided the entire amount by the population of california that is around 1 000 for every man woman and child not bad advertisement maintenance let s see where do we start how about those railroad tracks that go through del mar seems like a prudent way of spending our windfall roads schools cast iron pipes coastal lagoons earthquake proofing everything this feels a little more practical than just dividing it up people education is key to surviving in this world and the earlier we start investing in our people the more we gain overall the homeless the person with special needs the single parent the lgbtq community black lives matter cancer and alzheimer s research it is hard to argue with any of these causes i want them all to be funded and more my tongue in cheek response is both facetious and real at the same time i don t know where we should put our resources my hope is that wherever they end up it is the most fair and logical way to spend our funds while i find the prompt to be far too much for me to answer our government better take this surplus seriously and take its time making some very important decisions what a problem to have advertisement vicki hoffman rolando save it it for a rainy day before our eyes widen too far in excitement at the huge sum that has dropped out of nowhere into our collective laps let s recall the good example of our last governor governor moonbeam as jerry brown was disparagingly known during his first term in office learned and settled into a much more grounded leader in his second term of office he learned as democrats often do not seem to that fiscal prudence is a prime responsibility of state governance let s learn from jerry sure he got flak from the most liberal end of his party but resisted calls to take all the extra money and spend it on good causes no doubt but democrats have no difficulty finding good causes to spend money on almost everywhere i m a democrat i believe in social welfare but where are the limits we can t fix every social problem so let s be more narrowly directed with what we support with state monies and do it fully advertisement so first we establish a hefty rainy day fund to ensure that in hard times we can pay for our commitments then let s have a serious conversation about what to spend part of this revenue on education for starters california has underfunded university public education since the crash of 2008 and last year according to the times of san diego in a may 2020 article california state universities lost 10 of their expected budget this last year since even before the recession of 2008 tuition has sky rocked as universities shifted responsibility for funding from state budgets to student tuition now we hear that businesses of all stripes are finding difficulty in hiring qualified employees bartenders and waitresses will eventually come back when they feel safe and benefits run out but teachers and engineers it s hard to supply employees that don t exist fully funding higher education again while i might add auditing those institutions and cutting waste in their systems will give future professionals the means to complete their educations without incurring mountains of student debt and ultimately ensure future prosperity in california another problem that speaks out to californians is infrastructure president biden s infrastructure plan is tenuous as he will need some republican support to pass his bill that s unlikely why not skip over the wait and fund our own infrastructure improvements a serious flaw in the way we fund infrastructure is that we pass bills to create but never to maintain and improve infrastructure over time collapsing cliffs under amtrak and undriveable streets in san diego are two such examples let s do some fixing and then set up another rainy day fund for infrastructure advertisement what we don t want to do is spend and spend without creating monies to maintain our investments in a 21st century economy both in infrastructure and education instead we can plan for the inevitable downturn in state revenue and prevent future deficit spending or cuts to vital programs governor brown had it right save first spend later rick millican san diego advertisement let citizens decide how to spend it since politicians are hooked on spending other people s money no one sitting in the state legislature should be allowed near this surprise surplus there are an untold number of nooks and crannies where taxpayer dollars disappear without any accounting heck even the current state treasurer cannot provide an up to date record of expenditures but we do know that the multi billion dollar fraud in edd is just one example of mismanagement so that 38 billion of surplus should be escrowed whilst a new no holds barred task force of informed interested bipartisan and dedicated citizens is created to be the state s financial proctologist to separate the fly manure from the pepper in the state s expenditures for the sole purpose of making recommendations on how best to effectively employ those surplus funds which could include a taxpayer rebate for all who file a sit return an added benefit could be putting the spotlight on spending redundancies and wastage which can be given to the state legislators for action give this task force 180 days to complete this commission i suggest that jon coupal ceo of the howard jarvis taxpayer association be the chair with members numbering no more than say 15 so the work gets done vs getting bogged down in partisan bickering for these folks represent us taxpayers whose hard earned dollars are at stake here please note that i have not pointed fingers at any of the state s programs this task force will have the ultimate tabula rasa to make recommendations that will strengthen the expenditure of the hard earned taxpayer dollars recommendations that cannot just be cast aside by our elected politicians without ample reasoning and votes by both houses of the state s government

by lewis krauskopf new york reuters as u s stocks are hit with a bout of volatility some investors are looking to european equities attracted by lower valuations and the region s nascent emergence from the covid 19 pandemic european equity funds have notched their longest streak of net inflows in more than three years according to data from epfr while fund managers globally surveyed by bofa global research said they are more overweight european stocks than at any time since march 2018 morgan stanley s strategists meanwhile have named holding european stocks as one of their top trades the focus on europe comes as the region s benchmarks have kept pace with their u s counterparts after years of underperformance the is up 10 7 year to date broadly matching the the s p 500 was off 1 7 from its record high as of thursday while the european index has slipped 0 8 from its peak we have been more exposed to the u s over the past years and now we are becoming more interested in foreign equities said schutte chief investment strategist at northwestern nasdaq mutual wealth management company investors see an opportunity as europe s recovery begins to take root while the u s economic growth rate is expected to soon peak european indexes are also more heavily weighted in the types of stocks expected to perform particularly well as the global economy bounces back such as financials and industrials vaccinations are ticking up you are likely to see restrictions come off and that should mean a decent economic recovery which will bleed into the markets in the euro zone schutte said after contracting in the first quarter the euro zone s gross domestic product is expected to increase in the second quarter and post its fastest growth in the third rising on an annualized basis by 9 2 according to oxford economics u s gdp meanwhile is expected to post its peak growth rate of 13 3 in the second quarter after it expanded in the first quarter meanwhile nearly 48 of the u s population had received at least one vaccine dose as of wednesday compared with almost 28 of the european population according to our world in data the story for the first few months of this year has been around u s exceptionalism said mona mahajan senior u s investment strategist at allianz de global investors as we look through to the next three to six months that may fade a bit especially if europe continues to play catch up many european stocks are also trading at relative discounts to their u s counterparts the s p 500 trades at nearly 21 times forward earnings compared with 16 7 times for the stoxx index according to refinitiv datastream a wider gap than on average over the past 10 years although that difference has recently narrowed part of the gap stems from the fact that u s indexes are more heavily skewed towards tech and other growth stocks that tend to carry higher valuations those stocks have helped propel the u s stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago and helped push s p 500 performance ahead of european markets but could fall out of favor as rising bond yields and inflation fears cut into their valuations several factors could complicate the decision to shift into european stocks with tech and internet giants such as apple nasdaq and amazon nasdaq continuing to put up strong profits investors may be reluctant to cut back on a trade that has worked for years as inflation worries have hit u s stocks in recent weeks there are also some concerns about euro zone inflation which is approaching 2 its fastest rate in years any setbacks to europe s covid 19 response and economic rebound also could undermine the case for equities there investors said so could a reversal in the dollar s recent weakening trend which would hurt u s investors seeking to convert profits in their euro denominated assets back into their home currency the dollar is down about 4 against the euro since the start of april the next move we make is probably going to be to decrease the u s and increase international just because of the forces that we are seeing in the market said john traynor chief investment officer of people s united wealth management in bridgeport connecticut but traynor added when the dollar is moving up that hurts you if you re investing internationally
following best sales year ever wilcox furniture liquidates furniture world news desk on 5 20 2021 at the height of its success wilcox furniture decided to cease operations sell its showrooms and liquidate george moore ceo at wilcox furniture speaks about the principles wilcox furniture was founded on and the reasons why the four store texas retail operation made this decision 68 years of success the decision to liquidate the liquidation process end game bill wilcox founded wilcox furniture in 1953 said moore based on principles that included buying the right furniture at the right price passing the savings on to his customers and delivering quickly it s the basic mantra we carried through from that point forward wilcox grew from one location to four locations in that 68 year history i took over the organization in 1992 the original store was a 5 000 square foot quonset hut leftover as surplus from world war ii the store was rebuilt on poor quality blacktop wilcox put everything he had into that building since it s hot here in corpus christi the furniture would sink a little bit into the blacktop during the summer months i m sure it was a curious shopping experience but the net result was low overhead everybody at the furniture markets knew bill wilcox because he always wore a trench coat and carried a massive binder with specific furniture details including measurements construction and costs down to the penny having this encyclopedic information at his fingertips helped him to get the best prices and sell at the right prices it was that diligence and the concepts he developed back in the 50s that have carried us forward to the present day wilcox furniture now has two stores in corpus christi one in kingsville and another in rockport texas wilcox was an early technology innovator moore continued we were one of the first furniture retailers to have wireless devices on the floor so that the employees could check stock with tablets and scanners versus having to run to a computer this helped us to shorten the shopping window for consumers saving them time and be more competitive we delivered 70 percent of our merchandise within 24 hours which was another key aspect of our success moore recalled that mr wilcox worked through his 95th birthday and passed away in 2015 at the age of 100 none of his children who are in their 70s and 80s he added were active in the business recently they decided to liquidate 2020 was our best sales year ever so we were able to negotiate a purchase with bel furniture in houston the purchase will give them 19 stores bel is an aggressive organization that s growing quickly since their merchandise lineup isn t the same as ours they decided that it would be easier for them to take over empty stores i looked at a number of companies to handle the inventory liquidation and the last day before i was going to make the decision i received an email from clay wahlquist at wahlquist management it was purely coincidental out of the blue clay wahlquist immediately drove down to meet with us it s an unusual situation because our business is in excellent shape from a cash perspective and sales have been strong we decided to get help with the inventory liquidation because we had never done a sale like this and didn t know what to expect clay agreed to bring in his people handle the advertising and guarantee the margins we requested the timing was perfect if i could die and go to heaven and had to do a gob moore said i would set it up so that it would be done during tax time after a cute two trillion dollar stimulus payment sent out to the public and at a time when inventory availability was limited all these elements for success came together and we are having a very successful event i m reminded of a television commercial i saw during the dotcom boom he recalled that featured eight people standing around in a one room office waiting for their first internet order when the first order came in everybody started high fiving then suddenly they got 250 000 more orders in the next five minutes their worst nightmare that is a bit like our liquidation experience we did about two million dollars in 10 days that was eight to 10 times our normal volume in a short period thankfully everybody here rallied together and we got it pushed out the door we did so much volume we decided to take four days off to regroup do a physical inventory and let the dust settle that helped us to reorganize and get ready for the next round we anticipate being totally empty by the end of may so that bel furniture will be able to take over after it s all over i m going to need furniture therapy i ve been here 29 years and i appreciate the relationships we ve developed with companies like franklin restonic homestretch crown mark steve silver coaster powell best bassett flexsteel vaughan bassett milton green stars new classic and also gerald washington who founded washington furniture national furniture and had spin offs incorporating the same quick delivery concept with guys like jim snead at affordable furniture it s been a great experience dealing with factories that have a passion for producing great furniture we ve never had to worry about the quality or reliability of the furniture wilcox furniture has sold over the years closing down is sad in that sense because we re gonna miss seeing everybody at high point but we are glad that we sold our store locations to bel furniture because they are very interested in bringing our staff into their organization it s a win win situation for them because the people who work at wilcox furniture are conscientious care about their customers and do what it takes to get the job done for more

as restrictions ease across europe we are slowly seeing a resurgence in fuel demand for travel not only in gasoline and diesel but also in jet fuel as travel and tourism gradually pick up in recent weeks there has been some optimism across europe as uk fuel sales reached their highest level since the start of the pandemic restrictions in 2020 in addition toll roads across france italy and spain experienced their greatest use since the same months in 2019 as european refiners produce over twice as much diesel as gasoline the demand increase for passenger cars freight transportation and certain types of heating that use the fuel looks promising the iea believes europe s oil demand could increase by as much as 9 this quarter and 4 in the third quarter based on current trends since pandemic restrictions are gradually easing across most of europe and a greater reduction is expected for the summer months demand looks set to increase for everyday commuting tourism and across several industries such as manufacturing and freight gasoline demand goes beyond europe with exports to the us of the light fuel hitting a near two year high in march as several disruptions to north american refining called for import hikes while exports have since dropped slightly they are still significantly higher than in the same period of 2020 the supply shortage of gasoline in north america and the shutting down of several major refineries across europe have meant a climb in gasoline prices making the fuel more attractive than diesel at present but a return to pre pandemic global industrial activity could see this change as diesel demand intensifies it is not only european refineries that have added to diesel stocks this quarter as the lag in air tourism has led to large surpluses of jet fuel much of this extra fuel has been blended into diesel while there is a significant supply of diesel in europe ready to meet the increased demand over the coming months jet fuel may not be needed for other uses by the summer as air tourism is expected to increase substantially in line with covid 19 vaccines and the easing of travel restrictions this shift is being driven mainly by the us which saw 1 85 million passengers pass through airports last sunday this is the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic restrictions in march 2020 in europe both portugal and the netherlands have opened up travel and the uk has made it possible to travel to certain locations as a tourist additionally just this week the eu has announced that it will open its frontiers to vaccinated travelers this could have a huge impact on jet fuel demand as a large percentage of us and canadian citizens are now vaccinated most of the passengers registered at us airports last week were flying domestic however with europe opening up its borders this could all shift in the summer months george ferguson senior aerospace and airline analyst at bloomberg intelligence stated we think this summer is going to be a good summer said ferguson the cheaper you can deliver seat miles the more capacity you put in the marketplace the closer you are to 2019 levels as north american refiners get back to work europe continues its strong diesel refining and jet fuel demand looks set to steadily increase with the ease of restrictions travel related fuel demand could become the oil industry s frontrunner once again this article was originally published on oilprice com rt com

duke energy corp now opposes a bill in the n c general assembly to study regulatory market reform including the possibility of a regional transmission organization that could challenge the monopoly positions held utilities in the state meanwhile a political organization founded last year and apparently totally funded by duke began running attack ads against the bill and the opposition may have worked at least for now the head of the organization says it stopped the ads friday after bill sponsors agreed not to push it in this session the charlotte business journal has not been able to reach anyone to confirm that but it does appear the study will not be part of the major energy bill that duke the house republican leadership and others have been working on and hope to see introduced later this session it is not clear if the decision not to move forward was made by the sponsors of the rto bill or the sponsors of the broader legislation still expected to be filed what is clear is duke s now implacable opposition to a bill it once indicated it was open to talking about they told us straight up they are opposed to it and are actively working against even having a study on this said jamey goldin who works on global energy markets and policy at google those of us who want to take a look at this are now facing very strong pushback from electricity providers to having that conversation and that is unfortunate do not see the need in late april rep larry strickland r johnston filed a long anticipated new version of his bill to study utility market structures including a regional transmission organization rto within the geographical boundaries of north carolina and south carolina or a larger area such as the southeast united states duke supported a similar study bill in south carolina last year that legislative study committee is about to start work and the report is expected in september and duke in the past had talked about welcoming the conversation on regulatory reform in north carolina but now not so much duke spokesman neil nissan confirmed duke s position we do not see the need for a study at this time he said and cited efforts in the current regulatory environment to move utilities to cleaner energy sources let s ensure the collective focus on our state s energy transition is not hindered by counterproductive initiatives on thursday citizens for a responsible energy future a nonprofit issue group run by two former duke executives began running attack ads on facebook against the bill tell rep larry strickland don t raise my power bill the adds say with stock pictures of people looking at bills and a photo of strickland similar ads have run naming rep john autry d mecklenburg independent group the ads refer readers to a website sponsored by the organization with the headline the ugly truth about rtos that refers to the deregulated markets as a really terrible option mega utilities with monopolies are being challenged with momentum in both carolinas building to bring competition to energy production markets dukeenergy acts clandestinely via an insipid citizens group account to attack nc reformer repstrickland but the truth will out pic twitter com fpwgjualsu tom davis senatortomdavis may 20 2021 citizens for a responsible energy future has a short history in february 2020 shortly after the group was founded it received two 250 000 contributions from duke energy carolinas according to the group s tax filings those are the only contributions listed for the group in tax filings through jan 29 of this year nissan declined to comment on duke s connection with the group tony almeida formerly with duke and once gov pat mccrory s top economic adviser is the president of the duke funded organization its headquarters is also listed at his residence where he also runs his consulting firm almeida consulting asked by email if duke was a contributor he responds only that citizens for a responsible energy future is an independent group that complies with all state and federal disclosure requirements and advocates for a sustainable energy future through responsible policies that promote prosperity economic growth and well being he repeats some of the website s objections to rtos including blaming the electric reliability corporation of texas rto for the deadly power outage this past winter and he acknowledges the facebook ads we stopped running ads today after learning the sponsors of house bill 61 don t intend to move their rto bill this session he says legislative action all this comes as major energy regulatory legislation is expected soon in the general assembly duke has participated in a stakeholder process on the legislation all parties have agreed to keep the negotiations confidential but ceo lynn good said recently that her company is optimistic a bill will soon be introduced and has a good chance of approval the gov roy cooper administration the environmental community solar developers industrial customers duke energy others have been at the table and there is broad support to move forward in 2021 she told analysts may 10 there had been expectations the broad legislation now under discussion would address the rto study that is less clear now duke s flat opposition would be a surprise if the study provisions are in the bill duke apparently hopes to support and strickland filed his bill separately not waiting for the broader bill house leadership is working on a spokesman for strickland s office said early friday they could not comment on the bill at this time but duke s opposition has gone public only recently people familiar with the situation say that kevin mclaughlin duke s vice president of governmental affairs and external relations in north carolina first told major customers and other stakeholders at the beginning of this week sham citizens uprising strickland s bill was long conceived as something of a companion the the s c legislative study s c sen tom davis one of the leading proponents of that study says he is disappointed in duke s n c position he also blasts duke for going after larry strickland with sham citizen group uprisings he tweeted about the ads and criticized duke directly for the attacks but he is not surprised duke is digging in its heels in north carolina davis knows the political climate in south carolina is very different than its neighbor s because of the 2017 decision by scana corp and santee cooper to abandon the 20 billion v c summer nuclear plant after almost 10 billion had been spent on construction he says utilities in the state have been on the defensive in the last few years still davis says if the study recommends an rto or any competitive market or regulatory reform that challenges the monopoly for utilities he expects duke and dominion energy inc will oppose acting on it dominion bought scana after the v c summer debacle clean energy plan davis says south carolina sees advantages to establishing a regional transmission group including north carolina and possibly other southeastern states but he says if north carolina does not go ahead that would not change his mind about pushing for a competitive structured electricity market in south carolina to replace the current monopoly system goldin in fact was speaking friday on a panel on s c energy policy sponsored by e4 carolinas when he talked about duke s opposition nissan says duke still supports the south carolina study but it looks at the north carolina proposal differently in north carolina we ve just wrapped up a year long thoughtful analysis of similar issues as part of the governor s clean energy plan process he says with diverse stakeholders at the table leading those discussions we do not see a need to create another study of the same issues it is notable that he cites the clean energy plan process as a reason for rejecting a study into structured and possibly deregulated markets the stakeholder report from that process recommended that such a study be undertaken and last week the state s energy policy council chaired by lt gov mark robinson approved a motion to send a letter to the general assembly supporting strickland s bill and three other energy bills pending in the legislature there were no votes against the motion
despite the massive global expansion of sustainable investing assets many investors are still unsure of where to find useful esg data on which firms are living up to their corporate pledges nearly 75 of u s adults disagree or strongly disagree with economist milton friedman s doctrine stating that companies have no social responsibility other than to shareholders according to more than 2 200 surveyed randomly in april by market research firm j d power at the same time 29 said they have never looked for information about any firms corporate citizenship and 41 said that it could be somewhat or very difficult to find the poll showed the answers reflect a dearth of easily accessible metrics that financial advisors asset managers and researchers are readily trying to address through their work the sheer numbers display the interest in esg metrics between 2014 and 2018 u s sustainable investing assets soared by 83 to 12 trillion according to the global sustainable investment alliance advisors say it can be difficult to square clients desire to invest according to esg principles with the lack of data on what companies are actually doing to meet those standards and the surge in new esg funds and investment options investors have reason to be confused or skeptical about upstarts track records says advisor keith beverly of washington d c based grid 202 partners it s always been something that s been a focal point for us but what you see now is this proliferation of companies and products he says what you don t want to do is discount folks who have been doing the work for decades for some new wall street product that has great marketing behind it because they manage trillions of dollars beverly recommends morningstar data created through the research firm s partnership with esg data firm sustainalytics as a good place to start he and adasina social capital investment strategist phuong luong cited the nonprofit american friends service committee investigate website as well adasina is one example of the rush toward esg investments for eager clients its social justice all cap global etf has reached 50 million in assets just six months after its launch and the firm has added to the available data through the force the issue website and a racial justice exclusion list of companies the fund uses 50 different screens including those from the social in esg which luong describes as an underserved area of data transparency is our priority because we believe that s where we re going to make the most change luong says to move companies to be better in terms of social justice there needs to be transparency and accountability and working within communities is really crucial to that potential clients seeking to hold firms accountable may be searching in the wrong places for the data according to the j d power survey as sources of information about corporate citizenship more respondents cited social media 42 and company websites 38 than newspapers and magazines 33 tv 28 word of mouth 26 or other 13 still almost two thirds have changed their purchases or investments in response to a company s actions with fair wages 59 human rights 58 and gender pay parity 53 as the issues they most often called non negotiable as a customer employee or investor a set of issues with the power to influence massive behavioral changes has become a core area of focus but few best practices are in place and few clear cut leaders have emerged to pave the way craig martin j d power s global head of wealth lending intelligence wrote in a report on the survey s findings what is clear he wrote is that proactive communication around esg will be critical for the foreseeable future and companies that can distinguish themselves with clear quantifiable esg metrics that can be easily located and understood by consumers will be in the best position to benefit from increased investor appetite for companies that not only do well but also do good rising aum and missing information amounts to a frustrating combination according to marypat thenell smucker of gender lens investing research firm parallelle finance in its first quarter review of the sector the firm proposed a detailed new criteria for gender lens funds smucker has heard increasing criticism in recent years about so called greenwashing or pinkwashing by firms that meet funds criteria but still have harmful policies or practices since there aren t many firms with an a on every gender lens metric she questions whether it s greenwashing to include a firms in a fund s holdings parallelle aims to make it more simple for clients and advisors to assess their options through its research smucker says consumers want to pick managers who are following a standard adhering to a style and watching their holdings she says i dont think it s as easy as it should be more universal reporting standards could help fill in the missing information smucker says for now beverly s firm assesses stocks based on publicly available data reviews from career resource database inhersight submitted by female employees who are black latino or other minorities and anecdotes from clients working at various companies the lack of longitudinal figures to observe shifts over time remains a difficulty he says we had to go out and find the data beverly says you can kind of piecemeal it together but there s no single source where you can go and get a clean answer to that problem

quarter this six week period is meant to capture fair value increases as a result of earnings releases however keep in mind that some analysts may have upgraded fair value estimates prior to new earnings data based on other catalysts for a detailed explanation of the methodology see the end of this article the above chart shows the average fair value percentage change among what morningstar calls the super sectors cyclical defensive and sensitive cyclical sectors are those that are heavily correlated with the business cycle as the economy grows and expands cyclical sectors follow defensive sectors are anticyclical sensitive sectors are slightly correlated with the business cycle during 2020 s first quarter earnings when coronavirus uncertainty toppled the market cyclical and sensitive stocks had fair value downgrades of 3 9 and 2 2 respectively defensive stocks had an average downgrade of 1 1 sensitive stocks average fair value upgrade led each ensuing earnings season defensive and cyclical stocks went toe to toe up until first quarter 2021 in the following table we screened for fair value estimate increases of 10 or higher to capture the most meaningful changes basic materials had the largest number of fair value increases among the stocks we cover in the sector our analysts raised the fair values for 29 of these stocks by 10 or more during earnings season the next four sectors with large proportions of fair value upgrades were communication services technology financial services and industrials these five sectors all are within the sensitive and cyclical super sectors basic materials the basic materials sector recorded the greatest percentage of upward adjustments in fair value out of the 33 stocks covered by morningstar analysts 29 had their fair value estimates increase more than 10 following earnings season the biggest factor is higher near term prices says senior analyst seth goldstein rising commodity prices placed companies in a better position in the short and medium terms eastman chemical emn for instance had its fair value raised to 110 from 96 in response to accelerating demand and prices for its specialty chemicals rising commodity prices also provided mining companies an edge that raised our expectations iron ore has been incredibly strong and rapidly moved to record highs copper has been similarly strong and platinum group metals have been rising quickly director of equity research mathew hodge adds vale vale and anglo american ngloy who have exposure to these materials had their fair value estimates increase by 30 8 and 16 9 respectively rising lithium and nitrogen prices raised the fair value estimate for livent lthm by 21 4 and cf industries cf by 14 6 to reflect our analyst s revised outlooks communication services we found that 24 of the 75 communication services stocks that we cover had their fair value estimate increase by more than 10 during the last earnings season below are several stocks that had significant fair value increases in the sector the two stocks with the largest fair value increases were discovery disca at 39 3 and amc networks amcx at 26 1 both companies have launched subscription based media platforms while these companies experienced a slowdown in revenue from advertisements we expect their exposure to digital ad spending could provide a boost in future revenues we estimate digital ad spending in the u s to grow 20 this year 15 in 2022 and average nearly 15 annually through 2025 says senior analyst ali mogharabi by 2025 digital advertising will represent 72 of total ad spending according to michael hodel director of telecom and media equity research advertising spending has surged more than anticipated in the latter half of 2020 rising discretionary income and additional stimulus checks led consumers to spend more on consumer goods especially on leisure products this prompted more advertising spending particularly on digital platforms it seems that firms are afraid of getting left behind rivals he says facebook fb and alphabet googl had their fair values raised by 16 4 and 12 3 respectively these companies already have a substantial digital media presence that captured the demand for ads last quarter technology in the technology sector 18 3 of our coverage list had their fair value increase by 10 or more throughout earnings season according to technology media and telecommunications sector director brian colello the semiconductor industry represented a significant number of the fair value increases in the tech sector following this earnings period below are some semiconductor stocks with large fair value moves the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the semiconductor industry s manufacturing capabilities as the economy recovers many businesses especially the auto industry are seeking out semiconductors for their products as such demand exceeds supply especially for analog and mixed signal semiconductors colello says it will likely last to the end of 2021 the shortage also provides a boost to the semiconductor industry s revenue as prices rise in response revenue is a key component of how we determine our fair value estimates and in the near term it will depend on manufacturing capacity and a company s ability to secure enough supply to meet demand colello adds industrials the industrials sector had 17 7 of covered stocks get a fair value upgrade of 10 or more a number of top movers were concentrated among transportation stocks it stems from robust demand and pricing conditions for asset based truckers and asset light freight brokers stemming in part from the spike in retailers inventory restocking and tight capacity says analyst matthew young this is driving up medium term free cash flow generation for the names we cover xpo logistics xpo and landstar system lstr are among the stocks that benefit from the increased retail demand stocks that manufacture transportation vehicles or components such as paccar pcar and cummins cmi are also set to benefit however young believes that even with the increases in fair value the share prices for these stocks are still overvalued citing that investors may be considering that the favorable demand for transportation services will extend longer than reality the sector overall is expected to experience growth in light of a recovering economy it s happening a bit faster than most expected sector director brian bernard says he notes that the demand for industrial goods and services could also be bolstered by president biden s infrastructure renewal plan financial services stocks in the financial services sector had 17 7 of their fair value estimates raised by more than 10 in the six week period we reviewed the list is dominated by asset wealth management firms and according to financial services sector director michael wong their fair value upswings were due to the firms rising values in their assets under management or assets under advisement we are always quick to note that where the asset and wealth managers are today from an aum or aua perspective has a big impact on where they will be five to 10 years from now says financial services sector strategist greggory warren we ve now lapped the losses in the market from a year ago so additional gains will likely be tougher to come by in the near term as such our fair value estimates are going to reflect the nearer term twists of the markets as well as more normalized expectations over time many of these firms such as affiliated managers group amg and invesco ivz generate a majority of their revenue from fees which scale with the value of their managed assets they also have a high degree of operating leverage which can lead to a greater expansion in earnings during good times and a meaningful reduction in earnings during market sell offs like the one in early 2020 data notes fair value estimates were sourced from morningstar direct for the end dates of each quarter in some cases fair value adjustments may have been made prior to company earnings reports stocks without a fair value estimate at the beginning and or end of the six week period were excluded from data aggregation to account for any changes in our equity coverage list the underlying list of stocks can change from quarter to quarter owing to changes in analyst coverage or other factors stocks portrayed in sector tables may not reflect those that had the largest fair value moves within the sector demonstrated stocks were selected to emphasize sectorwide trends and or by the recommendation of morningstar analysts
the residence inn by marriott at hotel circle was purchased last year by the san diego housing commission the commission s broker reportedly invested in a company that owned the property before recommending the purchase to the city the real estate broker hired by the san diego housing commission to secure the purchase of two hotels last year personally invested in a company that owned one of the properties while the deal was being negotiated according to a published report jim neil a principal in the kidder matthews commercial real estate firm bought tens of thousands of shares of chatham lodging trust the former owner of a residence inn by marriott that neil then recommended the city acquire the voice of san diego reported the stock value climbed by 50 percent or more in the months after the city bought the property raising the value of neil s investment by as much as 350 000 or more advertisement a more specific profit total could not be determined because neil failed to file a state required disclosure form listing his personal assets investments and revenue during the time he was supposed to do so the voice reported according to a memo drafted by a housing commission attorney neil s investment should have disqualified him from participating in the city transaction it recommended the matter be referred to the district attorney s office for potential criminal prosecution the 16 page memo outlining the apparent conflict of interest has been provided to members of the housing commission as well as the san diego city council the voice reported neil whose firm was paid more than 500 000 for its work on the transactions did not respond to requests for comment friday from the san diego union tribune he told the voice by email that the memo to the commission and council contained information that was not accurate but he declined to specify the mistakes he also declined to respond to specific questions i do not believe i violated the law with respect to the housing commission s transaction with chatham the voice quoted neil nonetheless i am continuing to investigate your unsupported allegations further mayor todd gloria said in a written statement that there should be an investigation i m deeply concerned about these revelations regarding the hotel purchase in mission valley he wrote appropriate action must be taken this is not how city entities entrusted with taxpayer dollars should be doing business and i encourage a law enforcement investigation the san diego housing commission issued a statement friday that did not dispute any of the voice of san diego report instead it said it is confident through its analysis that the 67 million purchase of the hotel circle property was a good deal the sole issue is whether by virtue of alleged violation of various laws the commercial broker shall be required to reimburse sdhc for the 502 500 paid as a commission the statement said the issue will be resolved through the legal system the city bought two residence inn hotels last year under project homekey a state program designed to protect homeless people during the pandemic by housing them in hotels and motels the union tribune reported in february that both of the properties were purchased at per room costs that were among the highest in the county last year in total the city paid 106 5 million for the two hotels 67 million for the 192 room property in mission valley and 39 5 million for the 144 room hotel in kearny mesa the report quoted multiple real estate experts saying that the city appeared to pay top dollar for the properties at a time when the worldwide pandemic sent values of hotels and motels plummeting the sale prices translated to 349 000 per room for the hotel circle property and 275 000 per room for the hotel in kearny mesa the 349 000 per room cost was the highest rate for any hotel sold in san diego county last year escrow closed on the hotels in late november eight months after the nationwide lockdown sank hotel prices across the country four other residence inn hotels were sold in california over the prior two years all prior to the covid 19 pandemic and the average per room cost of those properties was 227 300 the union tribune reported only one other hotel sold for more than 300 000 per room last year a boutique la jolla property in september a motel 6 in la mesa sold for 25 000 per room adrian glover a commercial real estate broker from san diego told the union tribune in february that the city paid too much for both residence inn properties and said city officials should have known as much hotels are worth probably 30 percent to 40 percent less than they were a year ago because of covid 19 he said at the time this should have come out in the due diligence period of the escrow process in another unusual move the city of san diego agreed to pay the 500 000 commission an obligation that is generally met by a property seller rather than the buyer the housing commission defended the arrangement saying the seller agreed to deliver the property at close of escrow without any residents a deal point that saved the city time and money commission officials also rejected assertions by private sector real estate experts interviewed by the union tribune and said the purchase prices for the kearny mesa and hotel circle properties were in line with other recent transactions these two properties were extended stay properties that were constructed and or rehabilitated more recently than other properties spokesman scott marshall said at the time the voice of san diego also reported that lawyers for the housing commission only became aware of neil s investment in chatham lodging trust on feb 23 two days after the union tribune disclosed the high cost of the city acquisitions the commission s legal memo stated that neil paid between 5 and 8 for each of the 40 000 shares he purchased an investment that would have netted hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal gains today we can generally estimate that neil has made approximately between 230 000 and 353 000 on his ill advised and untimely investment from the standpoint of the applicable conflict of interest laws the memo stated according to the voice project homekey was a california department of housing and community development program that designated more than 600 million to cities and counties to buy distressed properties to protect homeless people from the novel coronavirus the city of san diego used about 38 million in state funds some existing funding and borrowed 50 million to acquire the two residence inns

by meredith radford unc media hub stock photo nearly a third of all americans are fully vaccinated against covid 19 but hesitancy is still an issue across the country annamarie marinelli an english teacher at northwood temple academy in fayetteville doesn t think the covid 19 vaccine is for her there are a lot of people who i know who have gotten it and they ve had significant side effects marinelli said and i personally i don t want to go through that according to the cdc side effects for the first few days after receiving the vaccine are normal i ve never been a person that needs a flu shot or anything i ve just never felt the need to get one she said i just don t see how the research and everything within the past year can say ok so now we have this vaccine i don t feel quite comfortable concerning what the truth is and what s not she said i just don t want to get into it that s why i just want to opt out of it marinelli is one of the millions of americans who so far have not received the covid 19 vaccination according to the centers for disease control 32 of the united states population is fully vaccinated for covid 19 and 45 have had their first dose in north carolina 43 are fully vaccinated according to the department of health and human services john sanders a professor of medicine and chief of the section of infectious disease in the wake forest university school of medicine said it was an amazing success in compressing the vaccine process but it is wrong to think that they invented vaccines 18 months ago and had them approved in less than a year he said we ve been doing gene based vaccine studies since the 90s tony moody a professor in the department of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at duke university medical center said the vaccines were developed quickly because of the need to get them out to the public the technology has been evolving so that we could turn these vaccines around very quickly moody said moody said they did not cut corners in the development of these vaccines he said in this round of vaccine development they were able to compress the length of the process while still being concerned about safety for people who are worried about getting the vaccine because it happened so fast people have dedicated their whole careers to get us to this fast response sanders said marinelli said she s not in the group at risk of getting covid 19 my health is good and i m young marinelli said i m relying upon my own immune system and also just my faith god protecting me and keeping me healthy as long as i wash my hands i wear my mask i do what we re supposed to do i believe i m going to be perfectly fine without the vaccine moody said that getting the vaccine wearing masks and social distancing is the route to get past the pandemic what people have to understand is that this virus is one that you can be completely asymptomatic moody said you can infect other people have no idea that you are putting other people at risk he said he thinks the country will get to a point where the vaccines are licensed and that it will end up being a required vaccine in the school system moody said that will lead to immunity in the community which is something that s been done for other viruses marinelli said if getting the covid 19 vaccine is made mandatory for teachers she would look for another career i m all about liberties and freedoms and the right to choose so i want that to be respected she said moody said he understands personal liberties and autonomy are important however i also think that americans when they are at their best are concerned about other people and that part of being vaccinated is not just about self moody said it is about selflessness it is about how do i protect other people who maybe can t get vaccinated or won t respond to the vaccine moody said there is a correlation between voting patterns and peoples willingness to take the vaccine i don t know that that s particularly surprising especially after the last decade or so of politics that we ve been through but it is very frustrating he said misinformation has also been spread about the vaccines for example the microchip thing moody said we don t need people to microchip us we ve done it to ourselves we carry around smartphones that essentially tell people exactly where we are and what we re doing at all times and he said there s also no mechanism to microchip another common rumor about the mrna vaccines is that they could alter dna sanders said that mrna is the messenger signal to tell the rest of our cells to make a protein and then it rapidly degrades sanders said vaccine hesitancy is about how people feel rather than intellectual concerns it ties into a belief system sanders said most of the time this is not a discussion about let s do the math problem together and agree that this is the right answer it s much more subjective than that he said the way to persuade people to get vaccinated is to be empathetic toward their concerns moody said the idea of herd immunity is to break transmission chains if you get sick and you come into contact with people who are susceptible the disease is going to spread moody said if you get sick and you come into contact with people who are not going to get sick not going to spread that virus then you contain it he said they don t know the exact number necessary to reach that goal because they are still gathering data but based on knowledge from past diseases it probably needs to be 80 85 coverage sanders said that at least a quarter to a third of adults had been infected by the time vaccines rolled out but that it doesn t mean they necessarily had immunity sanders said they did a study at the beginning of the year asking about 20 000 north carolinians if they would get the vaccine 75 said yes about 15 were hesitant and 10 said no he said that previous epidemics have shown that people tend to respond to what the rest of the community is doing so those who are hesitant will be more likely to come around once others in their life have been vaccinated he said the last 10 may never get the vaccine without legal requirements but it may not matter because they are likely to get infected and have some immunity really what we re going after is population protection sanders said sanders said there were no serious adverse events in the clinical trials of the covid 19 vaccines in the u s the johnson johnson blood clotting issue is concerning he said but it is one in a million he said it will likely be used again after more research is done on that vaccine and the rare clotting sanders said the only adverse events tied to moderna and pfizer are people passing out at vaccine clinics though currently approved under an emergency use authorization sanders said this was just the expedited way of getting the vaccines out to the public he said the vaccines will be fully fda approved it is just a matter of going through the full bureaucratic process of making that happen for those concerned about potential unknown long term vaccine effects sanders said we ve never seen a long term effect from vaccine technology the one that gets most often cited unfortunately is autism and that was based on not just erroneously interpreted data not just a difference of opinion about how to view the data actually fraudulent data sanders said he said any problems they do see in vaccines tend to appear in the first two weeks to at most the first two months there is nothing that is 100 safe life is not 100 safe he said what i can say is that the risk of the vaccines is so much lower than the risk of actually getting the disease or then giving the disease to someone else moody said we all want to get back to some kind of normalcy and the fastest way to do that is to get vaccinated comments

oconomowoc wisconsin had been operating on a razor s edge as retail sales moved online and mail order pharmacies siphoned off its patients it was losing money on 1 out of 4 pill bottles filled so the front of the store where it sold clothing cosmetics and jewelry had been compensating for pharmacy losses for years and then covid hit said dave schultz who co owned the store with his brother and that was the final straw the covid 19 pandemic sank many businesses in 2020 particularly those relying on in person sales to stay afloat for pharmacies especially independent pharmacies the pandemic lockdowns exacerbated long standing economic pressures many small owner operated pharmacies adapted quickly delivering their traditional amenities in safer ways or capitalizing on new services created by the pandemic such as covid testing and vaccinations but others like tobin s became casualties of the pandemic closing their doors for good it s too early to quantify just how many pharmacies succumbed to covid and assess how patients will be affected the total number of pharmacies has declined less than 1 over the past five years as pharmacy chains get larger while independent community pharmacies often the last place left to fill a prescription in some small towns go under the rural policy research institute found that 1 231 independently owned rural pharmacies about 16 closed for good from 2003 to 2018 well before the pandemic pinch and according to the drug channels institute after five years of declines the number of urban and rural independent pharmacies dipped below 20 000 for the first time in 2020 don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free revenue from covid testing and vaccinations may help keep some independents afloat but that comes with added costs and logistical challenges pharmacies are struggling said harry lattanzio president of prs pharmacy services a consulting firm in latrobe pennsylvania we re getting calls from a lot more pharmacy owners that want to sell their stores they ve had enough most pharmacies he said saw a decline in prescriptions last year as customers hesitated to visit their doctors for anything but emergencies that drop in business also meant fewer sales of over the counter medicines and ancillary items sold by the stores meanwhile pharmacies had to buy protective equipment to keep staffers and customers safe and beef up their technology to address the new reality lattanzio said some independent pharmacies which had always preferred the personal touch of having staff members answer the phones have had to invest in new systems to handle thousands of calls a day from people seeking vaccines costs rose even as revenues dropped for the most part they lost money lattanzio said if you didn t lose money you did something really right when lattanzio opened his first pharmacy 20 years ago he saw gross profit margins of 36 now independent pharmacies are fortunate to see margins of 3 to 5 if they survive the pandemic at all much of that decline comes from the impact of pharmacy benefit managers which manage commercial and public health plans prescription drug reimbursements to pharmacies those pbms often aligned with large drugstore chains systematically squeezed the profits out of independent pharmacies that left many smaller chains or unaffiliated pharmacies unable to bear the added hit from the pandemic i m afraid to see the outcome said joe moose co owner of moose pharmacy a chain of seven drugstores on the outskirts of charlotte north carolina the delay in payments the increased cost to keep operating in the early days of this combined with the fact that reimbursement is so poor already covid may be the final nail in the coffin for some of us moose pharmacy is trying to adapt when it had to stop in store purchases during the pandemic the chain expanded curbside services and hired additional drivers home deliveries tripled workers ferried food toilet paper paper towels and shampoo to customers we had to build out our website we put in technology so that people could text us from the parking lot it had to be hipaa compliant said moose who owns the chain with his brother and keep in mind that all of that is happening at no change in reimbursement covid also interrupted the medication supply chain in normal times the pharmacy s supply of drugs is automated so when it dispenses medicines replacements show up in the next day s delivery but moose and his staff had to resort to the old way of calling up five or six wholesalers to see who had the drugs in stock when covid testing was scarce the pharmacies taught their employees to perform rapid tests once vaccines arrived moose sought out patients who couldn t make an appointment on a smartphone who couldn t drive to mass vaccination clinics or who were just afraid to leave their home staffers delivered vaccines to one elderly man with cancer whose wife had died a year earlier he and his disabled adult son didn t want to risk going out and contracting the virus but he trusts us and so we deliver medication to him probably every other week moose said so it made sense that we bring the vaccine to him tripp logan a pharmacist in charleston missouri said one of his three pharmacies is in rural mississippi county which has no hospital or chain pharmacy for the 14 000 residents there four independent pharmacies and the county health department formed a consortium to help distribute covid vaccines it started with a group text and the next thing you know we re vaccinating hundreds of people a week collectively logan said don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free because pharmacies can make up to 70 per covid test and 40 for each vaccination many pharmacies are earning new revenue to offset some of the retail losses said owen bondurant president of independent rx consulting in centerville ohio so that has brought a significant increase in profit margins for the short term bondurant said covid has probably saved a lot of pharmacies because pbm pressure has been so hard especially on some of these rural and inner city pharmacies a lot of them still are on the verge of going out of business the cash infusion from the federal paycheck protection program also kept many pharmacies afloat and allowed some to make investments that better position them for the future we would have had to shut down or sell because the pbms were brutal last year and they killed off a lot of our friends in wisconsin said dan strause president and chief executive officer of hometown pharmacy in madison wisconsin without the ppp there would have been far more facing the same fate some of the changes born of necessity could stick in a recent survey by the national community pharmacists association 3 in 5 community pharmacists said they expect more pharmacies to offer point of care testing after the pandemic and more than half said additional pharmacies will give immunizations hashim zaibak ceo of hayat pharmacy in milwaukee said his pharmacy is considering testing for the flu strep and hemoglobin a1c levels for those with diabetes and it will continue providing vaccinations those changes are here to stay zaibak said tobin s owners considered selling their pharmacy but finding no buyers they shut down for good in september schultz said it s unclear whether they could have survived had covid not happened or if the vaccine revenue might have helped he knows of two other independent pharmacies in wisconsin that closed in the past 18 months the real crux of the matter is you re getting paid in some cases 60 under the cost that we end up paying for the medication he said how do you justify that portion of your business oconomowoc has one independent drugstore two grocery store pharmacies and a walgreens to serve its 17 000 residents but schultz worries about many of the older sicker customers who relied on the personalized care his pharmacy provided one of his former pharmacists now works at a drugstore outside of town but delivers medications to some of tobin s most vulnerable former customers on her way home she just didn t think they would survive going someplace else he said previously published on khn don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free join the good men

ub scientists doing genomic sequencing on coronavirus have determined the virus is still out there and it is different than what we started with buffalo n y the worst of the covid 19 pandemic may be behind us but the virus is still prevalent in western new york according to scientists at the university at buffalo every variant of concern identified by the centers for disease control and prevention has now been detected in erie county ub researchers are studying the genomic sequences of the variants up close they say in april over 90 of cases sequenced in our part of the state showed evidence of these variants the virus is still out there and it is different than what we started with said jennifer a surtees phd co director of the genome environment and microbiome community of excellence at ub and associate professor of biochemistry in the jacobs school of medicine and biomedical sciences at ub who leads the sequencing team if you were in close contact with someone who tested covid 19 positive you should get tested and quarantine as recommended by the department of health 2 on your side s maryalice demler spoke with dr thomas russo chief of infectious diseases at ub about this news demler how much should this news concern us dr russo it should concern us a little two of the variants of concern one of them described as the one from south africa 351 and the other initially described from brazil p 1 may allude protection afforded by prior protection however we know our vaccines are likely to be extraordinarily effective against these variants so i think the secret here is for everyone to get vaccinated even those individuals who have been previously infected and that way they ll attain the maximum degree of immunity demler many people in our community started getting vaccinated several months ago and although covid numbers have decreased greatly no one is ready to say it s gone for good so i m hearing a lot of folks wondering if they might need a booster shot this fall or next year what is the current thinking dr russo the only certainty about booster shots is that there is significant uncertainty at this time i think the consensus is that at one point we will need a booster shot but when that will be i think that it s not clear demler right now the prevailing thought is that once you get the vaccine you have immunity for approximately how long do we know or does it vary from vaccine to vaccine dr russo the reason for the uncertainty is that these vaccines are new and we do have data from individuals that have been vaccinated out to six months from moderna and the degree of protection and immune response still looks great at six months we also know that if you ve been naturally infected antibody levels look great at eight months and so we know the immunity from vaccination is better than immunity from natural infection so one would predict that we would get at least a year out of this vaccine but we re following this closely and we ll see how antibody levels do over the next six months or so

this week s rousing stock market debut of dairy alternative oatly underlines anew people s enduring appetite for vegan products if anything that hunger has grown during the covid 19 pandemic following a heady nasdaq debut on thursday and another surge in friday s session the swedish food company is now valued at about 13 billion a lofty level for one that took in 421 million in revenues last year from sales of oat based milk ice cream and other products not made with space age technology oatly is far from alone in the emerging space earlier this month nestle launched a new non dairy milk made with peas adding to a slate of plant based options for burgers sausages and tuna at its vast chain of coffee shops starbucks now offers four creamers made from something other than cow s milk soy almonds coconut and since march oats and in singapore since december consumers have the option to purchase lab grown chicken composed from animal muscle cells the alternative food industry was already on the rise before the pandemic with startups like beyond meat and impossible foods winning praise for vegan items that surprised many consumers with their likeness to meat in terms of taste odor and texture in april 2019 burger king made waves after launching the first vegan version of its popular whopper sandwich since then most big fast food chains have followed suit while producers have joined nestle in introducing meatless supermarket products during covid 19 meat alternatives enjoyed a temporary surge in interest as some consumers sought healthier products sales of beyond meat products spiked initially before moderating the surge also came as production problems due partly to covid 19 outbreaks temporarily curtailed conventional meat availability though supplies later stabilized the pandemic opened people s eyes to the risks of the meat industry the relative fragility of its value chain said jan dutkiewicz a fellow at concordia university and harvard law school who writes often on food and environmental studies investor interest in alternative meat is keen in part because of the environmental costs of conventional meat production as well as concerns about animal welfare investments in alternative food tripled in 2020 to 3 1 billion according to the good food institute a nonprofit this included 2 1 billion for plant based meat egg and dairy companies 360 million for cultivated meat companies and 590 million for fermentation companies devoted to protein alternatives sales of meat alternatives jumped 45 percent in 2020 in the united states but still account for only 1 4 percent of total retail meat sales according to the good food institute history shows it can be difficult for food substitutes to achieve sustained success said nicholas fereday an analyst specializing in consumer foods at rabobank despite the success of products like aspartame and stevia sugar remains the dominant coffee sweetener he said and for now nobody has been able to simulate popular items like roast beef or grilled pork with a vegan option environmental and animal welfare concerns will trigger interest among people who are looking for brands that align with their values and encourage the initial purchase fereday said but they will only keep buying if they like the product dutkiewicz notes that the conventional meat sector operates on relatively narrow profit margins with large volumes needed to the ventures economical if alternative proteins gain enough ground there may be a point where many large companies will start not just diversifying into alternative proteins but will start divesting from their existing holdings in protein he said dutkiewicz drew a comparison with large automotive companies now phasing out the internal combustion engine and transitioning to electric cars but he cautioned we are at the very very early stages of this
even though only 39 percent of nebraska s population has been vaccinated the state s government is rolling back mask mandates in omaha the mayor and city council made no moves to extend the mask mandate which will end on may 25 this is even as douglas county health director dr adi pour expressed concerns local news station ketv reported pour said that she thinks the council made the right decision but would have preferred the mandate to last another month she added she s a little bit worried about summer events like the college world series and swim trials she s worried visitors will bring variants into the community more deadly and transmissible variants have already started popping up in nebraska in march the douglas county health department reported that over 100 positive cases of covid 19 with a significant number of them the b 1 1 7 variant were traced to an omaha daycare and that a possible second outbreak tied to an event was under investigation earlier this month the first case of the b 1 617 or india covid 19 variant was verified through the nebraska public health lab in this aug 20 2020 photo nebraska gov pete ricketts addresses republican supporters during the opening of a trump campaign office in omaha neb yet as the omaha world herald reports nebraska governor pete ricketts said that he expects the state will have no need for pandemic restrictions in schools next fall if ricketts and the rest of nebraska s leadership like the rest of the ruling class get their way schools will be reopening full in person in the fall with no masks even though no vaccines have yet been approved for children under 12 the drive to reopen schools has never been based on science but rather the need to force parents to return to work in order to feed corporate profits and the stock market which has risen to astounding new heights during the pandemic over 200 000 people have been diagnosed with covid 19 in nebraska and over 2 000 are confirmed fatalities it is likely the numbers are much higher given the level of underreporting as noted by the university of nebraska medical center s recent study on school transmission as the wsws reported the study overseen by the university of nebraska medical center found that infection rates in the three schools were almost six times higher for students and two and a half times higher for staff than what was recorded through self initiated tests and reporting dr james lawler a director of the university of nebraska medical center s global center for health security has stated that he believes opening schools contributed to spread he was quoted by the star herald as saying i m certainly not saying that schools were the only factor driving transmission in communities clearly that is not the case but i think schools were important and probably much more important than most people realized lawler said the big outbreaks behave like dry brushfires while transmission in schools is like a peat bog fire where it s underground slowly spreading he explained even in the face of the new variants and the death of a custodian in omaha s millard school district nebraska s star herald reports that most education leaders say reopening was the right decision this article keeps in line with local reporting s focus on loss of learning as opposed to the risk to the health and safety of teachers and students the omaha world herald recently reported on the rates of failure for remote learners and barely noted the many factors that went into remote learning not being as successful for graduation rates as in person learning as the wsws noted in its article on the sabotage of remote learning educators were plunged into distance teaching and mostly left to completely redesign their lesson plans with no assistance teachers are consumed with fixing technical problems and managing large classes while in many cases being directed to impose punitive policies for student absenteeism these issues were no less pressing in nebraska in one of the state s largest school districts omaha public schools the teachers were told they were going to have to teach in person and last minute switched to remote learning last august after students teachers and parents pushed back starting a petition that stated let us be clear we want students to have the ability to return to school full time and in person which is why we support taking classes fully remote until the city of omaha shows that they can control the spread of covid 19 until the city is willing and able to protect students teachers and families it is not safe to return to school yet by september with test positivity rates no lower students and teachers were forced back into a 3 2 hybrid model then by february with omaha s positivity rates hovering officially around 25 percent educators parents and students were told they were going to transition to fully in person omaha public schools plans on pushing ahead with a robust summer school session just as the mask mandate will be expiring the dangerous and callous actions of nebraska s leaders is in line with how the ruling class has handled reopenings across the us and the world american federation of teachers aft president randi weingarten called for the full reopening of all us schools in the fall teachers and other workers however are not complacently accepting these conditions educators rank and file safety committees have been forming and speaking out against the centers for disease control and prevention s premature call to let up on the use of masks to stop the spread of covid 19 through schools and workplaces and save lives we call on nebraska teachers to establish rank and file committees at their schools get involved today

greed at its helm taking readers on a tour through evolutionary biology psychology and biblical sources kuhner explores how democracy emerged from religious and revolutionary awakenings he argues that to overcome trump s regime and establish real democracy we must reconnect with that radical heritage our political tradition demands a revolution against corruption explosive penetrating and utterly compelling kuhner charts the death spiral of american democracy as it collapses into the black hole of the religion of money never before in human history have noble ideals been corrupted so deeply

essential no matter who wins the 2020 election wendy brown professor of political science university of california berkeley author of undoing the demos and in the ruins of neoliberalism this book captures the nature of corruption in the trump era better than any other in print the essence of corruption is self involvement self indulgence luxuriousness and the loosening and discarding of the restraints of social bonds foundational norms of awareness of others and community responsibility are gradually replaced and ultimately overwhelmed by greed in all areas of personal and political life the ethos of the trump era is materialism impersonalism and unabashed greed for money and power at any moral cost how were two centuries of american idealism so suddenly and rapidly overwhelmed this book tells us how we got here and it tells us how we can fight the virus of corruption that threatens to destroy our shared culture and fragile democratic institutions laura s underkuffler j dupratt

explosive and vitally important h n hirsch professor of politics oberlin college author of a theory of liberty and the future of gay rights in america timothy kuhner captures the essence of donald trump and modern american politics in this illuminating book trump is many things but above all kuhner convincingly argues he is the embodiment of greed and his rise to power is no accident but rather the predictable product of a system that ignores corruption and enables the wealthy to dominate elections to fix american democracy trump s defeat won t be enough instead we ll have to rebuild the wall between private capital and public power nicholas stephanopoulos professor of law harvard law school co author of election law cases and materials many books are announcing the downfall of american democracy but tyranny of greed operates on another level it s an original and powerful work of art tapping into a deeper awareness kuhner helps us recognize this dark time for what it really is an opportunity for rebirth yes i feel shaken but also awakened the more people who read this book the more transformative our national conversation will become frances moore lappé bestselling author or co author of nineteen books from diet for a small planet to daring democracy with adam eichen in the span of a few years we have gone from arguing over politics to arguing about how many tens of thousands of deaths would be worth boosting the stock market we have become accustomed to wearing surgical masks to protect us from pandemics and gas masks to protect us from riot police we now shrug at the most blatant displays of authoritarianism and respond to nazi parades with whataboutisms if you re as worried about the effects of trump s election as i am then this brave and surprising book is for you kuhner opens our eyes to the historical philosophical and religious roots of our present crisis inspiring us to look inward to understand how we got to this moment in time

political parties the sheer volume of coverage of donald trump and his administration can have a deadening effect yesterday s scandal risks becoming today s shrugging new normal but tim kuhner s work reminds us that this shouldn t indeed must not be so by tracing the origins of trump s deeply immoral regime to fundamental flaws in the united states system of democracy he both helps us to understand how that country came to its current parlous situation and what must happen to reverse it andrew geddis professor of law university of otago author of electoral law in new zealand what does donald trump s rise to power say about the united states and the culture of greed and corruption tim kuhner courageously takes on that question in this important timely and thought provoking book i highly recommend it john bonifaz constitutional attorney co founder and president of free speech for people co author of the constitution demands it the case for the impeachment of donald trump kuhner holds nothing back he builds on a solid foundation of evidence about trump s abuses of power and the outsized role of money in american politics but then he goes way beyond that to explore biblical views of the corrupting power of greed and the demons that may possess our president from satan to the beast to mammon taking readers from hell into hope and light kuhner closes with a revolutionary vision of freedom self government and political equality the topic is grim but the prose is energetic and the ideas are fascinating tyranny of greed may well prove to be the best book of the year

united states today the greed and corruption of the trump era are captured better than in any other book i have read and i claim to have read them all tyranny of greedis both a work of true

their customers through higher payments from order flows the state of massachusetts is seeking to revoke its broker dealer license accusing robinhood of encouraging inexperienced investors to place

protect your identity and your data where robinhood falls short there are some points on which robinhood could use some improvement transparency and reliability in light of the lawsuits and accusations from account holders over the last couple of years robinhood has some work to do regarding its policies it is still unclear whether halting trading of certain stocks leaving investors stuck with shares or missing out on opportunities was a one off situation or could happen again in addition charges from the sec that robinhood potentially makes money by executing your trade orders at a less than favorable rate show that the young brokerage may need to be more upfront about its practices the company paid 65 million to settle without admitting or denying fault forbes reported and noted that it had significantly improved its execution practices no mutual funds robinhood doesn t offer mutual funds the backbone of a diversified portfolio you could trade etfs which are somewhat

what you need to know the 2nd generation ipad is now obsolete owners will no longer be able to get repairs through apple the 2nd generation ipad is officially obsolete as reported by macrumors apple has officially added the 2nd generation ipad to its obsolete list the tablet was originally introduced by steve jobs back in march of 2011 apple added the ipad 2 to its vintage and obsolete product list in may of 2019 which marked the ipad as obsolete in all countries except the united states and turkey where local law required apple to continue to consider it a vintage product yesterday however apple updated its list to add the new ipad to its official obsolete list deeming it obsolete worldwide the second generation ipad included an updated design that was 33 thinner than the original ipad the new ipad also sported new capabilities including a front facing camera for facetime calls a gyroscope and an updated dual core a5 processor twice as fast as the original ipad and up to nine times faster in graphics the ipad was also offered in both white and black models a product that finds itself on the obsolete list is unable to receive hardware service from a repair center meaning that customers who have the tablet can no longer get it repaired by apple or one of its authorized service providers they can of course still get it repaired by a third party but those repairs will no longer be backed by apple it does make sense that the 2nd generation ipad is now considered obsolete it is now a decade old and i assume there are plenty of components that are basically no longer regularly available to even fix the device
virginia tech researchers are unleashing an autonomous robot dog on university construction sites to investigate the applications of using robots to monitor construction progress faculty and students from myers lawson school of construction within the college of architecture and urban studies and college of engineering are partnering with the division of campus planning infrastructure and facilities and industry sponsor procon consulting to deploy spot a mobile robot dog developed by boston dynamics to conduct this innovative research the ongoing experimental investigation is exploring whether construction progress monitoring a traditionally human dependent labor intensive and error prone process can be improved by leveraging autonomous robotic technology to lead the systematic collection of data in construction environments six months into the yearlong study the team recently published its initial findings which include operating procedures required to launch legged robots in dynamic construction settings and early opportunities and limitations in using robots in this capacity introducing robotic technologies on construction sites can offer many exciting opportunities the ability to monitor construction progress remotely through autonomous means is a prime example other opportunities are improving the accuracy of data collection accessing hard to reach or hazardous job sites and diverting human capital capacity to other tasks said kereshmeh afsari assistant professor in the myers lawson school of construction and the project s principal investigator the goal of this study is to look at the feasibility of robots on active construction sites and assess any challenges job sites are extremely dynamic environments presenting evolving human and physical navigation barriers for robots there is a need for further exploration around operations limits for autonomous robots to boost effectiveness and safety by implementing sensors and other controls three capital construction sites on the blacksburg campus are serving as the study s backdrop the creativity and innovation district living learning community holden hall and the student athlete performance center within the job sites construction management students and researchers navigate spot via remote control they capture hundreds of 360 degree photographs of construction progress using the camera and holobuilder construction monitoring app mounted atop the robot dog to automate the data collection process 2d floor plans are loaded into the app and the operator marks the locations where data will be collected the operator also records the robot s navigation paths within the app for future use the data gathered within the app is analyzed for accuracy and communicated among all project stakeholders the unique collaboration among academics operations and private industry bringing spot to virginia tech is as innovative as the research itself while we could have conducted this research privately there are many reasons driving our partnership with virginia tech the university provides strong institutional capabilities in its ability to rigorously study the effectiveness and usability of the technology our intention is to develop a long term collaboration with virginia tech to continually investigate emerging technologies and encourage the development of robotics automation and information systems standards that improve the interoperability between various architecture engineering construction and operations technology solutions said steve devito director of technology at procon consulting procon s two cofounders are also proud virginia tech alumni as an organization we believe strongly in investing in the next generation of construction leaders putting emerging technologies like spot into the hands of students is one way we can help foster the construction talent pipeline for years to come teamwork has been a guiding catalyst supporting this study procon s leaders are industry visionaries after working together on a previous technology related project about three years ago i was elated to learn of their interest in introducing the latest robotic technologies onto virginia tech construction sites said walid thabet professor in the myers lawson school of construction and co principal investigator we ve also been working closely with the virginia tech capital construction team for the past six years and are grateful for their continued willingness to open up their job sites to our students and research activities experts on the capital construction team are working closely with the research team to enable the deployment of legged robots on hazardous and dynamically changing construction sites capital construction leaders partnered with virginia tech research and innovation procurement risk management and office of legal counsel to mitigate operational risks and to establish a legal service agreement for the use of the quadruped robot on live construction sites all of these stakeholders also helped the research team to implement standard operating procedures on the construction sites in a way that is safe for both human workers and for the robot we re thrilled to open up our capital construction sites to help advance virginia tech s educational and research missions with a host of construction projects underway and planned on the blacksburg campus and across virginia the division of campus planning infrastructure and facilities is looking forward to more creative partnerships with students our academic peers and industry leaders said paul ely associate director of capital construction and renovations also general contractors managing the construction of these projects including w m jordan company and branch builds have been working closely with the research team to investigate autonomous robot navigation and monitor weekly progress on the job sites on site technology adoption requires collaboration and support from all project stakeholders and we are very fortunate to have the support of virginia tech capital construction and their knowledgeable experts as well as the support of the general contractors in this project during the on site robot operation and investigation we have in depth discussion with these representatives who accompany us weekly on the job sites to find innovative solutions for the safe and effective integration of legged robots with construction inspection tasks said afsari for the students engaged in the study every interaction with spot has brought a new opportunity to put classroom knowledge into practice we ve learned quite a bit about spot and its autonomous capabilities particularly what it can and can t do right now it will be very interesting to see how the technology evolves in response to human intervention and the operational foundation we are building today through our research future applications for autonomous robots on construction sites could include everything from remote inspections geo locating utilities to support maintenance efforts safely identifying gas leaks and much more said srijeet halder a ph d student studying automation and robotics in construction halder is leading data modeling efforts in the study despite the restrictions caused by the pandemic we have had the opportunity to present our research results to multiple groups of students including building construction capstone students and christiansburg middle schoolers explained afsari we are delighted to work with excellent students on the team both graduates and undergraduates who are excited about construction robotics and are committed to implementing emerging technologies in the construction industry that has historically suffered from lack of technological solutions virginia tech students will become leaders in construction robotics the research project is expected to conclude in fall 2021

spectacular black and white ball at the plaza launched her onto the national stage and provided her with relationships that lasted a lifetime said dr louise mirrer president and ceo of new york historical a free press advocate the first woman ceo of a fortune 500 company a pulitzer prize winning memoirist and in her own discreet way a feminist graham truly was a trailblazer and we are proud to celebrate her legacy as part of our deep commitment to women s history katharine meyer graham s ties to journalism ran deep her father bought the washington post in 1933 and her mother was a former journalist graham herself began her career as a copy boy at the post and later worked as a reporter with the san francisco news but she never expected to become the president publisher and ceo of the washington post roles her husband filled until his untimely death in 1963 grief stricken graham promised the post s board of directors that she would keep the paper in the family and carry on in the spirit and principle of her father and husband at the time women in journalism were usually relegated to newspapers women s sections focused on society gossip and the four f s food fashion furnishings and family under graham s leadership the washington post became the first major paper to replace its old fashioned women s pages in 1969 with a new section called style that examined the way people

by upfina jobless clams are once again suggesting that the labor market improved in the month this time claims weren t impacted by ohio s normalization in the week of may 15th initial jobless claims fell from 478 000 to 444 000 which was 16 000 below the consensus and 6 000 below the lowest estimate it was a great reading we are getting closer to a full labor market almost every week non seasonally adjusted claims have fallen 3 straight weeks they fell from 492 000 to 455 000 in this past report puas fell from 104 000 to 95 000 at least 21 states will end emergency unemployment benefits for 3 5mn individuals before the scheduled sep 6 end date 940k 300 weekly federal top off 1 4mn pua top off 1 1mn peuc top offt co 4vm8fmh94l via oxfordeconomics nanc455 pic twitter com yvbpphtfqo gregory daco gregdaco may 19 2021 the most important aspect of unemployment benefits isn t the latest reading it is the incoming changes almost half the states are making in the next couple of months at least 21 states are going to end the emergency unemployment benefits before the september 6th deadline the map above shows many of the end dates this comes out to 3 5 million people coming off benefits in the next couple months 940 000 people will lose the extra 300 in weekly benefits given by the federal government 1 4 million people will lose pua benefits plus the 300 extra 1 1 million will lose peucs plus the 300 extra we are in a weird period where the pandemic is very close to over there are millions of people on unemployment benefits programs even though there are millions of job openings that are going unfilled specifically in the week of may 1st the total number of people on all benefits programs fell from 16 86 million to 15 98 million people that s still a ton of people who should be working given the state of the labor market it s a weird situation for there to be labor shortages and almost 16 million people getting government help we are very sympathetic towards anyone who lost their job during the pandemic however the government shouldn t pay people extra for being unemployed when there are this many jobs available undoubtedly some employers have openings they aren t serious about filling however there are labor shortages in many industries many people believe there is no such thing as a labor shortage because employers can just raise wages while they can raise pay many businesses operate on thin margins fun with valuation math it was obvious earlier in the year that some of the stocks with multi billion dollar valuations and zero sales were bubbles that would crash down to earth furthermore there were many tech stocks with above 20 sales multiples investors are trying to find the next big tech company but they are only discovering fool s gold it will be very difficult for software companies to replicate the success of microsoft amazon apple and google these firms multiplied their revenues by 54 in 17 years we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us so i assumed that all the stocks which currently trade at more than 10 x sales would follow the same growth path as the maga stocks and be as profitable 60 stocks are already priced higher than what the maga growth path would justify ask yourself 60 amazons really pic twitter com vfytxcq4se vincent deluard vincentdeluard may 19 2021 vincent deluard went through with the mathematical calculations to show how insane some valuations still are the screenshot above shows his math he states that 14 of the 351 russell 3000 stocks with ps multiples above 10 are projected to have a market cap greater than 4 trillion in 2038 based on his calculations that s pretty unlikely it s actually possible that no companies will have that market cap in 17 years it depends on how well the major tech companies do and how well stocks do overall 11 of them are expected to have 500 billion in revenues it s hard to imagine this many healthcare and tech companies doing this well amazon had 386 billion in sales last year finally the real kicker is that 59 companies are priced to do better than the major tech firms did in the past 17 years it s entirely possible that none of these companies will do this well the next great company might not be well known now keep in mind that in the early 2000s few investors believed amazon would be this successful it doesn t seem likely that the next great company will rocket from being a consensus pick to becoming one of the best companies ever without extreme volatility in the meantime investing isn t that easy if you expect there to be extreme volatility in the near term would you buy stock in something you believe to be the next great investment this depends on how confident you are in each prediction surely you wouldn t make a major bet on a company that has an extreme valuation at a sentiment cyclical peak very low z score for tech the past few months have been much different than 2020 tech has been weaker than the rest of the market especially the innovation stocks as you can see from the chart below the z score for tech s allocation is the lowest since 2003 it s worth noting that this doesn t mean tech is at its bottom it s possible that the whole market rolls over and tech performs in line with the market it s also possible the allocation was lower at points between 2000 and 2003 it would be great to have that extra 3 years of data fund managers are shedding their tech holdings rather quickly soberlook bankofamerica pic twitter com jenll41uhi liz ann sonders lizannsonders may 18 2021 the only thing we know for certain is that this new market regime won t be permanent just like the last one wasn t it feels the easiest to go long the market s favorite industries at exactly the wrong time that being said the commodities stocks aren t as overbought as tech stocks were last year conclusion about half of the country won t have pandemic unemployment benefits in place by the middle of the summer the good news is this means there won t be a major impact to the labor market all at once in september imagine millions of people trying to get a job all at once in september that would be chaotic most of the companies that trade at over 10 times sales won t be as successful as investors think they will be fund managers tech allocation is low that doesn t mean the selloff in tech is done though stay nimble if you are trading in and out of rotations
one of the unlikely consequences of the pandemic has been a boom in people investing for the first time more disposable income for many combined with the rise of free stock trading services and a sharp drop in share prices when the pandemic struck has led to a 20pc jump in the number of diy investors over the past 12 months according to boring money a research company but rather than simply chasing hot stocks novice investors are taking a longer term approach freetrade a stockbroker found that 80pc of first timers traded every couple of months and the same proportion said they were approaching investing as a long term habit so how is the army of newbie investors putting its money to work telegraph money found out i was playing it safe now i m taking on the hedge funds as soon as he turned 18 bailey greetham clark began investing in the stock market via freetrade my overall goal was to invest for the long term in quality companies and tracker funds that would build my wealth i only put money into the market that i could afford to lose he said however mr greetham clark who runs a gym business in lincolnshire said he then realised that he could make more money by buying stocks backed by social media users after starting out by playing it safe i ve put 90pc of my portfolio in amc entertainment an american cinema chain which hedge funds are betting will fall in value my 2 400 investment is now worth 3 600 he said while he accepted that he was taking a lot of risk at the moment mr greetham clark said his plan was to reinvest the profits into safer companies which could grow steadily over the long term
by martin armstrong new york city is dying thanks to covid it has really killed broadway when i would often go to a play the vast majority were tourists from overseas i would often listen to the different languages being spoken around me new york city is clearly dying as a mass exodus has taken place of not just the rich but even wall street is moving quietly to florida the rise in taxation that is reducing the quality of life will only continue to send more people south and the hallow remains will gradually decline into 2042 even permits for guns have soared in new york as the police are unable to restore order the east village was the hardest hit with so many businesses just gone nyc is rapidly becoming extinct politicians only see the world from their perspective they fail completely to comprehend how the economy truly functions thus nyc is on the edge this covid plan demic has so altered the social structure it is dividing the population into vaccinated v unvaccinated even among those who were vaccinated they are not what you would call biden supporters some have taken the vaccination just to be able to visit family in europe others thought that it would mitigate covid and prevent hospitalization yet the destruction of jobs and suspending education for many cannot learn remotely there is also a massive shift with millennials returning home to the nest the democrats are hard at work and desperately trying to open the flood gates to grant citizenship to those from the mexican border giving them access to a welfare state while keeping the border closed to canadians fearing they would vote republican then they are also promising citizenship to what they call the dreamers again trying to expand their voting base we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us while many try to blame china for covid and presume they did this deliberately while they are not locked down any rational thinking person would quickly realize that such theories are attributing clairvoyance to the chinese leaders never in 6 000 years of history has any nation ever carried out such a response even during woodstock the hong kong flu had the same death rate as covid and nobody shut the entire world economy down it is very interesting how the 309 6 year cycle marked when nyc was on the brink of bankruptcy in 1975 which was spot on from when nyc was born in 1665 it is stunning how new york has followed the ecm model rather closely which does not bode well for what is coming in 2022 the 2007 2009 financial crisis marked its epicenter in new york city the collapse of lehman brothers and bear sterns accelerated an economic meltdown that became the great recession before it was over the nation s unemployment rate had reached 10 but the loss of jobs in the financial sector of nyc approached 20 nearly 9 million payroll jobs had been lost housing prices had plummeted and the stock market had crashed since new york city was the epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis the federal government s immediate response was too focused on propping up new york based financial institutions they feared that if the investment banks failed then the government would no longer be able to sell its debt into the marketplace the national economic downturn was officially dated from december 2007 to mid 2009 when real gross domestic product began to increase again but non farm payroll employment didn t bottom out until the first quarter of 2010 thanks to covid lockdowns this financial crisis is politically made and has created a cycle inversion unlike the great financial crisis of 2007 2009 this time the source of the crisis is government and the response is the opposite of what we saw during the 2007 2009 crisis where lehman brothers marked the collapse in the private sector from reckless financial products this time it is the government s incompetence the result has been over 100 000 wealthy people migrating from nyc to florida worse still wall street itself is quietly leaving relocating their most profitable positions and trading to florida the crisis facing nyc will escalate and the financial crossing of the rubicon will arrive in 2022

zhang yiming said he discussed resigning as ceo of bytedance in march but said he was caught off guard by an initial 200 billion investor after a tumultuous year the 38 year old founder has announced that he will hand over the duties to his ceo on thursday to step down from staff even as his company is preparing for a public start up while in his letter he said he was not so interested in really managing people zhang was the only ceo of bytedance and tiktok built a company with a viral video application to become a global challenge to facebook and tencent even the company s worst crisis survived recently the u s government s threat to ban tiktok yiming zhang has dared to announce his resignation a truly amazing ceo tweeted patrick collison chief executive of the 95 billion payments company stripe to make sense of the quality of their execution bytedance was founded in 2012 generated 35 billion in revenue in 2020 and hired 40 000 people last year investors at bytedance said they were shocked and could only explain beijing s recent pressure on the technology sector as an explanation since the end of 2020 china has been losing in its technological giants by using antitrust and other rules zhang s resignation was that of the founder of e commerce giant pinduoduo colin huang in march and his departure was also unexpected earlier this month simon hu ant the group s general manager also resigned a few months after beijing broke its double record list in shanghai and hong kong the government is weakening the central authority of all the leaders of the technology giants said feng chucheng a beijing based plenum ai consulting partner in his resignation letter zhang said he wanted to avoid the trap of turning the ceo too central this reflects the concern of the central government which has long been concerned about the power of technology leaders as for bytedance especially since the top three apps require an average of more than an hour a day regulators have always been concerned about how it might affect public discourse propaganda is the party s salvation fenge added beijing has provided a wealth of guidance on the governance of social media algorithms and the promotion of positive content so far this year regulators have criticized bytedance for problems ranging from sexual content to deepfakes yiming is not very good at government relations one of the most popular said that in 2018 bytedance suffered the first moment of its life or death at the hands of the government which criticized several applications for hosting regular content bytedance had to shut down neihan duanzi with 22 million daily users he had an app to share the joke but the company backed down after a long public apology and hired more employees to manage government relations zhang clashed with beijing again in 2020 trying to satisfy what the trump administration has demanded to make tiktok s u s operations us owned the chinese government fired establishing export controls above the corresponding technology while censors allowed the storm of social media criticism to go down to zhang liang rubo a fellow at zhang university co founder of bytedance and head of hr will take the witness stand after six months staff who have worked with liang describe zhang as a loyal lieutenant liang rubo right announced that he was the new ceo in a letter written by zhang yiming left posted on the bytedance website while the staff at bytedance were generally shocked by zhang s resignation those who worked at liang were even more shocked my colleagues and i never expected liang to take over a humanities official said adding that chinese president zhang lidong had more power and courage than liang it doesn t scream at the ceo said another human resources employee liang s selection suggested that zhang yiming would govern behind the curtain a former hr employee said employees do not expect to stray from liang zhang s career which in itself is a source of comfort we were all shocked said a bytedance engineer but after a bit of discussion they all went back to work because we thought liang would mostly take yiming s plans and there shouldn t be too much change zhang s departure reveals the fragility of bytedance s management structure and its centrality with all senior executives reporting directly to him bytedance declined to say whether zhang would remain in the five member board as investors would take the other four seats the company has had the largest hiring in technology history nearly doubled in the past year and a half to more than 100 000 employees and its application has been hugely successful earning about 35 billion in 2020 according to two well known people the next step was to have a blockbuster ipo in hong kong or new york several people close to the planet have said that discussions with hong kong stock exchange officials have made great strides earlier this year people said however that the talks slowed down this spring in april the state run china securities journal reported that bytedance had begun an ipo process in hong kong although other media outlets had widespread follow up they deleted the original story one day and told the state media not to republish the story an unusual behavior for government censors who usually do not intervene in market speculation bytedance later said it was not ready at this stage zhang s departure may help the company get enough government approval for the ipo feng said while bytedance s concerns about its listing plans are clear political pressure would explain its previous censorship of ipo rumors zhang s resignation was part of a logical order with one person involved in the preparations saying the company was moving toward an ipo he made the decision and of course he had to report it before he could move on to the next phase of the offer he couldn t leave the post until he went public his move will not affect bytedance s chinese business structure as it is the source of most of his income in march 2020 zhang put china s operations under the direction of kelly zhang and zhang lidong at the same time he became the ceo and created a separate ceo position for tiktok which is now filled by shouzi chew li chengdong the founder of beijing dolphin technology consulting said the decision to back down could benefit bytedance he defends the company and himself from future attacks usually changing ceos is not good for the company but that is a ceo with chinese characteristics li added zhang can still remain in power additional news from nian liuk

america may develop its own digital currency read on to learn more about the federal reserve s announcement on a digital dollar federal reserve chair jerome powell announced yesterday that the fed is exploring the creation of a u s digital dollar this would essentially be a cryptocurrency controlled by the central bank several countries are now considering developing their own digital currencies these are called central bank digital currencies cbdcs and work as a digital version of that country s traditional fiat currency for example in the u s it would be a digital version of the dollar broadly speaking we can group the types of digital currencies into three categories bitcoin and altcoins bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency but many more followed in its wake these are called altcoins they often aim to use bitcoin s blockchain ledger technology in new and more efficient ways some want to make transactions faster and cheaper others have added new layers such as self executing contracts or smart contracts bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency but many more followed in its wake these are called altcoins they often aim to use bitcoin s blockchain ledger technology in new and more efficient ways some want to make transactions faster and cheaper others have added new layers such as self executing contracts or smart contracts stablecoins stablecoins are altcoins that are pegged to a stable asset like the u s dollar or the price of gold the idea is to reduce the volatility risk we see with other cryptocurrencies but keep the benefits like speedy processing and security currently you can buy both stablecoins and altcoins from top cryptocurrency exchanges stablecoins are altcoins that are pegged to a stable asset like the u s dollar or the price of gold the idea is to reduce the volatility risk we see with other cryptocurrencies but keep the benefits like speedy processing and security currently you can buy both stablecoins and altcoins from top cryptocurrency exchanges cbdcs these are government issued coins that use the blockchain ledger unlike other cryptocurrencies which are decentralized they don t rely on a bank or government as a middleman cbdcs would be centralized the central bank or national government would still control the coin when will we see a digital dollar it will take time before the u s introduces a digital currency if it does so at all powell said that careful thought and analysis would be required and he set out a roadmap for how to move forward in a video message powell explained that the fed has been exploring the potential benefits of a cbdc for several years he said our key focus is on whether and how a cbdc could improve on an already safe effective dynamic and efficient u s domestic payments system he made it clear though that any potential cbdc could serve as a complement to and not a replacement of cash and current private sector digital forms of the dollar such as deposits at commercial banks the fed will issue a discussion paper this summer and powell said it was committed to hearing a wide range of voices before making any decisions what countries already have cbdcs several countries are in the process of developing cbdcs but none have yet launched the chinese government was one of the first to consider a digital currency and has been working on the project since 2014 it is currently piloting a digital yuan in 10 cities some believe china s plan to launch its own cbdc is the reason for the recent chinese bank crackdown on cryptocurrencies according to gemini sweden has also launched a pilot cbdc called the e krona which it began testing last year similarly the european union is exploring a digital euro the u k has announced a task force to explore the risks and benefits of a digital pound the bahamas are piloting a sand dollar what does this mean for crypto it is difficult to know how cbdcs might affect ordinary cryptocurrencies the biggest issue is the question of centralization by design cryptocurrencies cut out the need to have a government or central entity in the middle of transactions this doesn t sit well with governments that want to retain control of the money in their countries powell s speech touched on other aspects of cryptocurrency most notably the need for increased regulation he warned that stablecoins can enhance efficiency and reduce costs but they also carry potential risks for example these coins may not have the same protections as money you deposit in your bank account he said therefore as stablecoins use increases so must our attention to the appropriate regulatory and oversight framework some have sounded a warning fearing increased cryptocurrency regulation will hamper the development of the industry others see it as a way to curb the negative aspects of digital currencies such as fraud and money laundering the challenge for governments is how to protect consumers without stifling the development of blockchain technology powell s discussion based approach seems to be a step in the right direction emma newbery owns bitcoin the motley fool owns shares of and recommends bitcoin the motley fool has a disclosure policy
good morning summer has arrived here in chicagoland as my phone temperature seemed stuck on 84 for two days the grocery run club yes chicago ill a couple from chicago created a non profit called grocery run club that is helping underserved neighborhoods on the south and west side by providing food and essentials lucia angel and jorge saldarriaga are the founders and operators of the grocery run club a non profit that started last july in the midst of the pandemic the non profit started as a result of the mass need for essentials and food in the south and west side of chicago we saw this immense need and we felt a call to action saying i m from this community i need to help my people angel said the couple said they have partnered up with several organizations delivering fresh food and essentials to people in need almost every day on friday the non profit collaborated with dions chicago dream another non profit that works to ease the food disparity in the city s englewood neighborhood the collaboration allowed both groups to stock up a community fridge in the englewood community wrestling those gators a florida man wrestled an alligator to save his 8 month old dog while they were out for a walk on tuesday mike mccoy was walking jake his chocolate lab around a pond when the dog wandered a few feet away to a bush suddenly an alligator emerged from the water and attacked the dog in a matter of seconds mccoy recalled the he barely saw the gator spring out of the pond but heard jake crying out as the gator pulled him back into the water he said in a phone interview with nbc news he was in a death roll with that thing mccoy said with his dog helplessly in the water and under attack from the alligator mike said he jumped into the pond immediately to fight off the predator and save his dog he said he recalled some tips he previously read on alligators and tried to put that knowledge to use mccoy said he thumbed the alligator in the eye and tried to pick it up out of the water so it could not go anywhere until the dog was freed from its jaw but as mccoy tried to fight the gator he too was bit on both of his hands had i not remembered what i read about the alligators i wouldn t have been able to respond as quickly to help jake mccoy said it was only because i knew what i did that i felt confident to fight the gator off ht dm linsey marr s persistence changes aerosol impact on friday april 30 the who quietly updated a page on its website in a section on how the coronavirus gets transmitted the text now states that the virus can spread via aerosols as well as larger droplets as zeynep tufekci noted in the new york times perhaps the biggest news of the pandemic passed with no news conference no big declaration if you weren t paying attention it was easy to miss but marr was paying attention she couldn t help but note the timing she li and two other aerosol scientists had just published an editorial in the bmj a top medical journal entitled covid 19 has redefined airborne transmission for once she hadn t had to beg the journal s editors came to her and her team had finally posted their paper on the origins of the 5 micron error to a public preprint server in early may the cdc made similar changes to its covid 19 guidance now placing the inhalation of aerosols at the top of its list of how the disease spreads again though no news conference no press release but marr of course noticed that evening she got in her car to pick up her daughter from gymnastics she was alone with her thoughts for the first time all day as she waited at a red light she suddenly burst into tears not sobbing but unable to stop the hot stream of tears pouring down her face tears of exhaustion and relief but also triumph finally she thought they re getting it right because of what we ve done the light turned she wiped the tears away someday it would all sink in but not today now there were kids to pick up and dinner to eat something approaching normal life awaited yes and i m grateful for a great editor in my early days we have so many fantasies of what the writer s life is like jotting down notes at a café time to dream and a certain ease of getting published while many of these particularly the last quickly fade either because of early rejections or the need for a steady paycheck there is one fantasy that i held on to until my first book was published that of the overly involved tough love editor who would take my work to some next level the gordon lish to my raymond carver and care about it as much as i did my first book a story collection was published by a university press the peer reviewers each gave a few careful comments one reviewer wanted one story cut the other thought it could be reworked a second story was recommended for fine tuning i agreed to address these small issues and i waited for the editor to whom i had originally submitted the work to give me her edits they never came she told me to make the changes the reviewers had suggested and then i was whisked right on to copy editing i know she cared about the book she just wasn t going to edit it in the way i thought she would rewind a year to when i found an agent for my debut novel he and i spent months going back and forth with my revisions his comments and more revisions here was the editing process i expected where sentences are debated scenes deleted problems large and small addressed throughout this process he kept telling me editors these days like really clean copy and i started to realize that editors don t really edit anymore my agent used to be an editor says author keith lee morris whom i contacted after hearing him discuss the editing process at a book event and she quit to become an agent so that she could work more closely with authors on their manuscripts my own agent madison smartt bell agrees that editing has shifted editors now can expect manuscripts submitted to them to be in an extremely finished state perfected whether by writers teaching in the academy or by agents drawing on their past experience as editors or a combination of those two philly well done cnn nearly twenty buildings in philadelphia are dimming their lights this spring after thousands of birds perished in the city s largest mass collision in recent history the voluntary measure has been coordinated by bird safe philly and continues until may 30 with the purpose of sparing the lives of some of the 100 million birds passing over the city of brotherly love on their semiannual migrations to some it might seem more intuitive to leave the lights on to help birds steer clear of buildings but robert peck a senior fellow at the academy of natural sciences of drexel university explains most migrating fowl navigate by light the sun the moon and the stars fog and rain which are quite common in spring and autumn force birds to fly at lower altitudes when they see the bright city lights they are often dazzled disoriented and confused suddenly they have all these lights coming at them from different directions it s overwhelming peck said they get turned around and they will fly into buildings and walls the philadelphia buildings participating in these efforts have agreed to switch unnecessary lights off from 12 01 a m to 6 a m especially on higher floors dimming lights in lobbies and atriums
