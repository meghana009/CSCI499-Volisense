our call today will be hosted by john sheridan our president and chief executive officer and leigh vosseller our executive vice president and chief financial officer following their prepared remarks we ll open up the call for questions thank you in advance for limiting yourself to one question and one follow up before getting back into the queue 02 24 i ll now turn the call over to john john sheridan 02 27 thank you susan and welcome to everyone to today s call our first quarter performance demonstrated the strength which we are executing across all areas of our business we achieved record breaking q1 sales both inside and outside the united states we also received fda clearance for the t slim x2 users to initiate a bolus delivery from ios and android smartphones which is our top requested app feature and we also made operational progress throughout the business 2 56 our office employees deliver these accomplishments while continue to navigate the broader headwinds being faced across the world a special thanks to everyone on the team for sharing your talents with tandem and our customers each of these plays a role in our success and together we continue to make a positively different impact on people s lives with diabetes 03 17 we already reached a new milestone in 2022 as our installed base has surpassed more than 350 000 people worldwide this represents an estimated 30 of people using insulin pumps in the geographies in which we serve which is remarkable considering our commercial efforts outside the united states began to ramp less than four years ago it s evident that we are making meaningful progress in our longstanding objective to bring the benefits of our technology to the diabetes community we are also continuing to progress our goal to expand the insulin pump market as about half of our new customers in the us in q1 reported converting from multiple daily injections with the remainder from competitive offerings at the same time we are seeing strong customer retention 04 04 a key driver of this continued growth is the overwhelmingly positive experience customers and healthcare providers report from our control iq technology this powerful diabetes management solution is now offered in all the geographies which we serve worldwide and the feedback we hear and the data we see is consistent our t slim x2 with control iq technology provides immediate and sustained positive results this was demonstrated at last week s advanced technologies and treatment for diabetes conference in barcelona spain where data was presented from our control iq observational study also referred to as the clio study where users reported improved quality of life reduced diabetes burden and higher satisfaction with diabetes therapy irrespective of age baseline hemoglobin a1c and the previous method of insulin delivery 04 58 our clio data is particularly insightful as the study is fully enrolled with more than 2 000 customers and it s now two thirds complete its powerful information that will help inform our future algorithm advancements as well as discussions with payers and further optimization of the user experience we provide additional presentations at the conference feature data demonstrating positive clinical outcomes from long term use of control iq technology as well as the successful adoption of control iq by people previously using mdi as it s effective across all ages including children 05 34 the attd conference as well as next month s ada scientific sessions are important opportunities for us to showcase data that demonstrates the power of our technology experience matters and with more than 60 million real world customer days of use our control iq technology continues to set a high bar in advanced automated insulin dosing it s an advantage that s not tied to one specific algorithm feature like our automated correction bolus or auto population cgm data but rather the full customer experience with the ease of use of our technology improved clinical outcomes it provides and through the positive interactions with our employees 06 16 another competitive advantage that we offer is the ability to bring new software features and benefits to our customers who are within the typical warranty cycle in february we received fda clearance of the mobile app that enables our t slim x2 pump users to bolus insulin from their smartphone with this clearance we added to the list of tandem s first as this is the first ever fda cleared smartphone app capable of initiating insulin delivery on both ios and android operating systems 06 47 following the clearance out team kicked off training for our internal employees along with healthcare providers launch activities are underway this month as part of a paced rollout into the summer and we are on track to offer our t slim x2 us customers access to the mobile bolus delivery feature and this will be free of charge 07 08 mobile bolus clearance provides a great reason for our sales and clinical teams to reach out to healthcare providers it also reinforces the importance of our strategic decision to expand our us sales and clinical teams in the first quarter to further drive awareness of our technology solutions among people living with diabetes and healthcare providers people have been excited to learn about our mobile bolus technology as it s been a top requested feature 07 34 our interactions with healthcare providers have continued to be a mix of in person and virtual it varies widely by practice and geography and overall the impact of the broader labor shortages in physicians offices continues to weigh on many of our prescribers this along with the fluctuating covid case rates is a dynamic our us field team continues to navigate well staying both flexible and adaptable our international distribution partners are also successfully managing these headwinds outside of the united states 08 07 turning to our product pipeline we re making great progress across our family of products under development mobi a novel miniaturized durable pump is a focus for our r d team as it provides us an opportunity to serve a new market segment as a reminder the mobi pump is designed to be fully controlled through a mobile app on the user s personal smartphone and the t connect mobile app that was cleared earlier this year for bolus insulin delivery is also the foundation of mobi s mobile control functionality the big development milestone for mobi in q1 was our undertaking of the largest human factor studies in tandem s history which was recently completed 08 43 we are in the data analysis process now and early data from the study is encouraging it s been exciting and inspirational to hear the feedback from people who participated in the study both people living with diabetes as well as our pump trainers and how systems operate and how it will serve a current unmet need in the diabetes community the data from our pivotal human factor study along with other final test reports and development work are now taking place and we intend to submit our 510 k filing to the fda in the third quarter we ll be filing through an ace pump pathway in the us which allows mobi to be integrated with interoperable cgms as well as our algorithms like control iq without additional regulatory review 09 29 cgm work is another top priority for our development teams and continues to progress well with both of our cgm partners dexcom and abbott we are in tight communications with both organizations as they each progress towards bringing their technology to market through the icgm pathway 09 47 the last area of product development i d like to highlight today is the extensive clinical work that we re undertaking to bring the benefits of our control iq technology to more people living with diabetes for example our first type 2 feasibility study for control iq is anticipated to be fully enrolled this month also the pediatric trial using control iq continues to progress well and as discussed in the past we intend to use the data to pursue an age indication for children younger than six years old 10 16 and lastly we re working to expand insulin indications for control iq through the addition of and we ll be kicking off a study this quarter in addition to these products under development we re making progress on our global digital health initiatives which remain strategically important to us these efforts and our longer term pipeline are all designed to deliver on our commitments to meet the varying needs and preferences of people living with diabetes relentless innovation and revolutionary customer experience remain at the heart of our company 10 49 looking across our business we re also applying the lens of continued improvement to identify areas for process efficiency lean optimization and reduced environmental impact i look forward to keeping you updated on the company s accomplishments to reduce the burden of diabetes management while working to deliver value to our shareholders 11 09 i ll now turn the call over to leigh to provide further color on the quarter as well as on our guidance for the year leigh leigh vosseller 11 15 thank you john good afternoon everyone 2022 is off to a strong start us sales outperformed expectations and we are on track with international sales and operational execution against our profitability goals 11 29 first quarter sales were 176 million worldwide demonstrating continued high growth at a rate of 25 year over year our control iq technology continues to improve the quality of life for our customers around the world driving more people to our products and creating strong retention within our customer base in the first quarter of 2022 we shipped 20 000 pumps worldwide contributing to nearly 50 growth of our installed base compared to one year ago 11 56 beginning with our results in the us our first quarter sales grew 27 to 131 million we shipped nearly 19 000 pumps in the quarter bringing us to an installed base of more than 250 000 customers we continue to see growth from both an increase in customers new to tandem and an increase in renewal customers who are purchasing a pump from us once again in fact our renewals grew to nearly 20 of the total pumps we shipped this quarter compared to approximately 15 in the prior year this higher rate of renewal growth is particularly encouraging as we look ahead to our increasing renewal opportunities and it is a trend we expect will continue throughout 2022 12 38 turning to our results outside the us we generated 45 million in sales this quarter growing 18 over the prior year half of those sales were generated from shipping more than 9 000 pumps with the other half from supply sales to the nearly 100 000 customers in our installed base this is a remarkable 87 increase in the number of our customers outside the us compared with q1 of last year 13 00 as we discussed on our last call this quarter reflected inventory rebalancing at some of our key distributors it s important to note that the variability we have seen in shipment patterns is not necessarily reflective of underlying market demand analysis of the end customer data is exciting as it shows a steady uptick in demand within the individual countries which is even more pronounced in the six months following each control iq launch 13 24 as we look to the remainder of the year ahead we are increasing our 2022 worldwide sales expectations to a range of 850 million to 865 million reflecting a growth rate of 21 to 23 this is based primarily on our strong q1 results in the us and so we have increased our us sales guidance to a range of 635 million to 645 million and are reaffirming our us expectations of 215 million to 220 million overall we remain cautious regarding the broader covid and economic trends and the lingering impact these have on the market our health care providers and our customers 14 03 i will now turn the gross margin which was in line with the first quarter of last year at 52 demonstrating that we re finding ways to offset some of the broader economic pressures the three primary factors that contributed to our gross margin performance this quarter where production cost improvements improved average selling prices and ongoing global supply chain challenges first is a production cost we continue to see improvement in the per unit cost of each of our products year over year from manufacturing efficiencies lean initiatives and leverage of overhead on increased sales volumes 14 36 second improvement in our average selling prices came from the mix of customers ordering within this quarter in particular our sales through direct contracts in the us increased to 35 of total us sales this quarter versus only 32 in the prior year both the price and cost improvements more than offset the impact of the increasing percentage of supply sales from our large and growing installed base keeping in mind that supplies have lower margins than pumps 15 02 last our non manufacturing costs were slightly pressured this quarter due to greater freight costs from global supply challenges we anticipate that this pressure will be more significant in the second quarter based on increases in both freight and the recent acquisition cost of certain materials because of this we expect gross margin in the second quarter to be in line with the first quarter despite a seasonal increase in pump shipments as is typical in our business we have factored the impact of these pressures into our expectations for the full year and our 2022 guidance is unchanged at 54 most importantly we remain confident in our ability to achieve our long term gross margin objectives 15 42 the change in our operating and adjusted ebitda margins year over year reflects our commitment to increasing investment in r d which has been the trend for the last four quarters our operating margin was negative 9 of sales and adjusted ebitda remains positive at 4 of sales r d grew to 19 of sales this quarter as we expanded our teams in support of our hardware software and digital health initiatives this reflects higher spending but it s also greater on a percentage basis due in part to the seasonality of our business for the full year r d expenses are expected to average 15 of sales up more modestly from 30 of sales in the full year of 2021 this investment in r d and balanced by expected efficiencies in sg a with operating expenses overall remaining flat as a percent of sales from 2021 to 2022 16 34 our full year expectations for adjusted ebitda remain unchanged in the range of 14 to 15 of sales factoring in the current level of investments we are making in the business we remain on track to achieve our long term operating margin outlook our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to navigate challenges of the covid environment and drive operational execution we ended the quarter with 635 million in cash and investments generating free cash flow of 11 million in the quarter 17 02 to summarize our 2022 outlook worldwide sales are estimated to be in the range of 850 million to 865 million including international sales of 215 million to 220 million we estimate gross margin for the year to average 54 and adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 14 to 15 of sales our noncash p l charges for stock compensation depreciation and amortization are expected to be slightly higher than our original expectations for the year at approximately 95 million of which 80 million is associated with non cash stock compensation and 15 million in depreciation and amortization 17 43 with that i will turn it over to the operator for questions question and answer session operator 17 48 our first question comes from the line of steven lichtman of oppenheimer company your question please steve lichtman 18 10 thank you hi guys i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of the intra quarter trends and whether you saw an appreciable pick up as the quarter went on with omicron fading and perhaps that having an incrementally better impact on staffing et cetera so just anything you saw throughout the quarter would be helpful leigh vosseller 18 35 sure thanks steve i think what we were seeing in the quarter as much of what you ve heard from other companies as well as is the beginning of it was more pressured as there were more absences due to illnesses as the omicron wave was kind of running out at that point but itâ s also typical for us to have an uptick across the quarter particularly in the first quarter with it being the lowest seasonal quarter of the year and so our field continues to express as the same challenges exist where when they call in physician offices thereâ s still staff shortages and high absenteeism which put price pressure but we were happy that we still came through strong this quarter john sheridan 19 10 steve the only thing i d add to that is that we also continue to see shipping challenges to our ous partners the supply chain is still a bit turbulent and so it just really hasn t settled down we hope it happens here in the next month or so maybe in the next second half of this year but it s definitely still been a little problematic for the distributors steve lichtman 19 30 got it got it and then i just wanted to follow up on one of the opportunities that you guys talked about in that moving up to the the new cgm and so in particular relative to g7 progress there can you talk a little bit more about sort of what you guys need to do to get that up and running i know obviously fda has set up from a regulatory perspective with the protocols but how long should we be thinking about that process taking for you guys once does get approved john sheridan 20 02 yeah and as you know we ve been working with dexcom now for many years we re in the fourth generation of the sensor integration and our team is in very close relationship there is work i mean they have made a submission to the fda for the cgm system there is still work that we both need to do to establish the communications cyber securities and things like that that both teams are continuing to work on and so when they get approval we re anticipating us probably going to be a quarter maybe two quarters afterwards before we introduce the device and since it is an icgm and it will be on a days pump there is no there is not going to be any regulatory submissions and we ll be in close communication with the dexcom team to discuss the commercialization and timing and discuss more of that as we get through this year steve lichtman 20 50 got it thanks john thanks leigh john sheridan 20 52 good talking to you steve leigh vosseller 20 54 thanks steve operator 20 55 thank you our next question comes from travis steed of bank of america please go ahead unidentified participant 21 03 hey this is dan on for travis thanks for taking the questions just two from me we ve heard from some other med tech companies that ous regions werenâ t as heavily impacted from this covid wave it sounds like your messaging is a little bit different so just love to get your thoughts on those markets and how you think the full year can play out and are you seeing any competitive differences in the us market compared to the ous leigh vosseller 21 28 yeah i ll start with the first part of the question about the impact in the ous markets and you re correct for us what we ve seen in our distributors outside the us have also continue to manage through the same challenges that we ve seen here in the us and it s been like that for the last three or four quarters as well which has contributed to some of that variability that we ve seen in the revenue as their shipment timing and orders have varied as well and so we re being thoughtful about that from a full year perspective as we continue to factor in caution around the ongoing lingering effect of covid across the rest of the year john sheridan 22 03 and i would say in regards to the competitive environment ous it really hasn t changed at all there has been no new products that have come to market it s still a same and we are still doing great we just had the atv conference there we were able to pull together our entire distribution group of distributors and we re now in every ous country with control iq and so there s a great deal of excitement and we re really expecting to see good things as far as control iq goes ous 22 35 and in united states there has been there has been a new product that has come to market but i would say even with that the competitive environment remains largely unchanged it s been on the market now for a few months but we have heard conversations about it but there so few systems that are out there that is really very difficult for us to get a sense for how it s actually performing keep monitoring and see how that goes in time unidentified participant 23 01 understood thank you and then just a quick follow up on the type 2 market you spoke during the r d day about that mark being more of a focus so just trying to get a sense here of when you expect to start capturing some more type 2 patient there and really what it takes to start driving that market and thanks for taking the questions john sheridan 23 18 yeah well we currently have about 20 000 people who are using control iq off label and they re seeing fantastic results we ve we have a feasibility study right now for type 2 underway it s fully enrolled and we would anticipate that that will probably take the majority of this year to complete and what that s done we ll have that will give us the information that we will need to work with the fda to design a pivotal study which will be something that will most likely be run in the beginning part of 2023 so we re moving in a good direction we ve got a lot of excitement on the type 2 front as well it s probably more like a late â 23 24 product unidentified participant 23 58 great thanks so much john sheridan 24 00 yeah leigh vosseller 24 01 thank you operator 24 02 our next question comes from brooks o neil of lake street capital your line is open brooks o neil 24 08 good afternoon and congratulations on continued terrific results recognize that you ve talked quite a bit about various factors that influence performance this quarter but could you talk try to highlight for us the factors that you think contributed to 11 pump shipment growth in the quarter leigh vosseller 24 34 sure it s actually brooks a lot of people focus on the challenges that everyone is facing but it was a really strong quarter for us in a good way to start the year and we have seen strength coming from all the areas that have been made us so successful in the past few years and that our new customers continue to increase year over year and we re getting great traction with our renewals and so it was great to see the step up in those year over year as well which is very meaningful as we think about the number of new opportunities coming this year and how that will continue to scale in the coming years brooks o neil 25 07 great and then i guess as a follow up or a different question could you just comment at all about whether the human factors testing on mobi uncovered issues or things you really want to change about the product or would you say it was pretty affirming of the strong characteristics of the underlying product john sheridan 25 31 i would say it s a relatively complicated analysis brooks and we re still in the process i mean up until this point we have not found anything that we think is problematic but we still have some data to dig through i mean we re optimistic there is nothing that just stood out that was problematic in fact people were thrilled to use it it was great to see people who live with diabetes as well as our trainers the excitement that they had as they were just watching people interact with it so they is still more analysis to be done but i m optimistic that we re going to get through this with no significant changes brooks o neil 26 07 great thanks a lot john sheridan 26 09 thank you operator 26 10 thank you our next question comes from alex nowak of craig hallum your line is open alex nowak 26 17 great good afternoon everyone it was a good renewal number this quarter but i would say still say itâ s a big opportunity could you expand a bit more on the marketing efforts there you can undertake to help push for more upgrades in the installed base is it something from a patient marketing perspective that could be done and i guess how critical is having a different form factor out there like mobi to encourage those upgrades leigh vosseller 26 40 sure so part of the success we ve had in increasing that renewal rate in the past 12 months or so has just really come from i would say some of the operational efficiencies and embedding some of the learnings from the early years since our processes we continue to expand that team we have a high level of outreach and we re seeing great retention from our customers i mean so there are number of factors we re excited about the opportunity to talk about mobile bolus with patients because it s another good reason to reach out to customers and then we ll continue with that trajectory as we move forward john sheridan 27 12 and alex i would just say that we believe that it s not a one size fits all situation when it comes to managing diabetes and there is different segments out there and so we think that certainly we re doing very well with the t slim pump but when mobi comes to market we think it s going to unlock another segment that we haven t been participating in and so we think it s going to continue to drive growth in the penetration rate from mdi conversions to pumps and we think that s an important factor in our growth going forward alex nowak 27 41 and then as you re getting ready to submit mobi here what sort of payers conversations are you having now to position mobi i would assume itâ s both a durable but also a pbm capable pump and does mobi more give you anymore renewed levers to push for direct contracts with the payers leigh vosseller 27 58 there are a number of good reasons to talk with the payers it s not just the technology the form factor changes but conversations we re having today really center around control iq as much as anything else and it s demonstrating the great outcomes that our customer base has seen we re able to share with payers their own subscriber base and we can show them the pre and post outcomes so they can really see what a difference we re making for their own population and so we re at the beginning stages now with initiating conversations about mobi that will be very prepared for launch 28 31 and it likely wonâ t probably be in the dme channel but it doesn t mean that we re not starting to explore further what it might what how pharmacy channel might benefit our business or how we might be able to fit into the pharmacy channel in the long term each product evolution in our pipeline will give us another opportunity to find out what fits and what doesn t alex nowak 28 51 excellent i appreciate that s it thank you john sheridan 28 54 thank you alex operator 28 57 thank you our next question comes from jayson bedford of raymond james your line is open jayson bedford 29 04 good afternoon just a couple here you mentioned the inventory dynamic with international distributors it did look like non pump revenue internationally came a bit lower than we has expected is this where you saw the impact or did you also see the inventory dynamic play out in the pump side as well leigh vosseller 29 23 it was across the board jayson so it s not so much product focused but it s distributor focus and how they are managing through their inventories and so it came in basically right where we anticipated as we came out of the fourth quarter understanding what their inventory levels look like and while we are anticipating that we will be continued variability going forward as we look ahead to q2 at least we don t have anything at this point of a material nature that we could call out that would that we should feel like we should share with you jayson bedford 29 54 okay okay that s helpful and just on the renewal rate do you expect this rate to trend higher throughout the year or is 20 a good number for the rest of the year leigh vosseller 30 06 yeah i think it s a good average for the year to think about because obviously our us business scale seasonally just for new customers similar to renewal customers we do have a heavier renewal opportunity coming to the table in the fourth quarter it represents about 40 of that 13 000 new opportunities this year so as you always expect a heavier back end finish for us it would be the same with renewals and new customers alike operator 30 42 thank you our next question comes from danielle antalffy of svb securities your line is open unidentified participant 30 51 hey good afternoon guys this is ryan on for danielle thanks so much for taking the questions so you touched on the â you covered impacts in the quarter in your remarks can you please talk a little bit more of new patient volumes and patient starts for the quarter given potential omacorn impacts that might have limited access to physician offices and any trends you might be seeing exiting the quarter and then i had one follow up leigh vosseller 31 14 sure so what we saw basically was that it is what you re hearing across the board from folks omicron impacts physician offices and customers alike in so many different ways but a lot of it is just higher levels of illness and the offices still have heavy staff shortages and so that s where our field is trying to help supplement as much as possible as they work with their physician customers to make sure we can still get new patients onto the product as expected and i think we ve been very successful again not without challenge but the team has worked very hard and so as we go into second quarter there is still a lot of conversation about how the pandemic is affecting the environment what we ve seen is i would say not to a typical from a typical not atypical from a second quarter which is around significant holidays like easter and spring break time you see a little bit more softness but for the most part we expect to continue to have to work through these covid challenges all year long and i applaud our field sales force for what they ve been doing to get it done unidentified participant 32 19 okay great super helpful thanks for that and then just shifting gears to primary care physicians how are you seeing pcp doctor prescribing more patients on pumps and how has the process different with the pcp versus an endocrinologist and i guess if you could frame how many target pcps are there john sheridan 32 39 i don t have a sense for the number off top of my head i can tell you that we primarily interact with vendors as you would think but we do have we do keep track of insulin usage on that pcp offices and we actually do visit offices that do have significant amounts of insulin usage and so i think that the interaction is there is probably more of a training burden that s required in that setting but we are having such success i just off the top of my head donâ t recall the numbers and how significant they are at this point in time 33 12 we definitely as we move to type 2 we definitely are interested and looking at that channel carefully and trying to figure out ways to access it without significantly growing the sales force and we think training is a big important part of that operator 33 34 thank you our next question comes from jeff johnson of baird please go ahead jeff johnson 33 39 hey guys good afternoon and i apologize i m jumping back and forth between a couple of calls but leigh i just wanted to check one thing just on the supplies revenues back to jason s question on the international side but even in the us side both numbers kind of came sort of our model and i could see it itâ s either pricing has come down on some of the supplies maybe dropouts were higher than normal in the quarter or my modeling was just off and i have a feeling of just that latter one but just help us understand kind of like the price maybe seeing a little softer both us and international this quarter thanks leigh vosseller 34 10 sure and iâ ll separate the two they re slightly different conversations from the us perspective i guess what i could say on both pricing has been pretty consistent and really when you think about the us much like we see seasonality from pump purchases the same sort of seasonality exists for supply purchases as well so what you have are people who deductibles are resetting so many times at the end of the year they will stock up on supplies and it will impact their q1 quarters so in our models we didn t see anything unusual with the first quarter supply trends in the us in particular 34 44 and i should make it clear too we see very high retention with our customers on both those renewing as well as people who continue to stay on the product out of warranty so it s still been very strong and stable and probably even more so since control iq came about in the last few years and then from a ous perspective there is not so much of that seasonality aspect it just goes back to these dynamics of the distributors trying to manage the inventory on their shelves with unpredictable order times and so it s about when they re trying to figure out what they need to ship when they can ship and the frankly how they ship it to get it when they want it so it s more about the variability than it is about seasonality jeff johnson 35 27 yeah that helps thanks a lot john sheridan 35 30 take care jeff operator 35 31 thank you our next question comes from josh jennings of cowen company your line is open unidentified participant 35 48 hi this is brian here for josh thank you for taking my questions i wanted to go back to just the international distributor inventory levels topic our levels back to normal now and how are you thinking about reorders this quarter after the first quarter destocking leigh vosseller 36 06 yeah what we ve tried to do is when we know there s going to be something materially different from the trends that we ve called it out each time and as we go into the second quarter there is nothing to speak of necessarily from any particular distributor so when we and just to recap when we ended 2021 we were very aware that certain distributors had enough inventory on their shelves were there weren t going to be first quarter orders to replenish and so as we go into second quarter we feel good about the fact that it s going to be something if there is a normal something more normal and each distributor will order at what would be a standard level unidentified participant 36 45 okay thank you and on mobi i think you previously referenced the filing is a summer time filing so the third quarter language seems very consistent to me but i just wanted to confirm that the timing of the submission hasn t changed and i guess if i could ask a follow on question just will you be releasing data specific to mobi either at the time of the filing or wallets under review john sheridan 37 08 yeah i mean i think that regarding timing as you get closer to the end of the schedule you get you have better visibility on it and i think that we knew it wasn t going to be june and so we just wanted to make that clear so it s a minor situation and relative to data i would say that the data that we have presented really has been on the algorithm and that s and since it is a interoperable algorithm it could be used on mobi or on t slim so we are sort of filing mobi to be an ace pump and so as a result of that we can integrate the algorithm onto the pump with no regulatory filings all we have to do is get the ace pump approval 37 54 so at this point in time nothing specific relative to data brian i mean i think that we ll probably be sharing some of the human factors work that s being done some of the benefits that our psychosocial the ease of use sort of the response to the size and the mobile app those sorts of things but i don t think there ll be any clinical data at this point in time unidentified participant 38 16 understood thank you john sheridan 38 19 you are welcome operator 38 21 and as there are no further questions in queue this does conclude today s conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video here are some questions and answers about what the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses washington record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive related articles fed raises key rate by a half point most aggressive move since 2000 how will rising mortgage rates affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about credit card rates and other interest rates for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does should the fed decide to raise rates by 2 percentage points or more over the next two years a distinct possibility that would significantly enlarge interest payments will i be able to earn more on my savings probably though not likely by very much and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to increase their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers this is particularly true for large banks now they ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier americans during the pandemic they won t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or cd buyers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts could be an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits still savers are starting to see some better potential returns from treasurys on tuesday the yield on the 10 year note was 2 96 after having briefly topped 3 for the first time since 2018 financial markets expect inflation to average 2 83 over 10 years that level would give investors a positive if very small return of about 0 13 all of a sudden we end up in this position where fixed income is way more competitive than it was before said jason pride chief investment officer for private wealth at glendmede ___
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago washington the federal reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short term interest rate by a half percentage point wednesday its most aggressive move since 2000 and signaling further large rate hikes to come the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago the fed also announced that it will start reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which consists mainly of treasury and mortgage bonds those holdings more than doubled after the pandemic recession hit as the fed bought trillions in bonds to try to hold down long term borrowing rates reducing the fed s holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy all told the fed s credit tightening will likely mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses over time including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans speaking at a news conference wednesday chair jerome powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming there is a broad sense on the committee he said referring to the fed that additional half point increases should be on the table in the next couple of meetings with prices for food energy and consumer goods accelerating the fed s goal is to cool spending and economic growth by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow the central bank hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession it will be a delicate balancing act the fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession in their statement wednesday the central bank s policymakers said they are highly attentive to inflation risks the statement also noted that russia s invasion of ukraine is worsening inflation pressures by raising oil and food prices it added that covid related lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions which could further boost inflation inflation according to the fed s preferred gauge reached 6 6 last month the highest point in four decades inflation has been accelerated by a combination of robust consumer spending chronic supply bottlenecks and sharply higher gas and food prices exacerbated by russia s war against ukraine starting june 1 the fed said it would allow up to 48 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them a pace that would reach 95 billion by september at september s pace its balance sheet would shrink by about 1 trillion a year powell has said he wants to quickly raise the fed s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point which the fed says is about 2 4 by year s end the fed s credit tightening is already having some effect on the economy sales of existing homes sank 2 7 from february to march reflecting a surge in mortgage rates related in part to the fed s planned rate hikes the average rate on a 30 year mortgage has jumped 2 percentage points just since the start of the year to 5 1 yet by most measures the overall economy remains healthy this is especially true of the u s job market hiring is strong layoffs are few unemployment is near a five decade low and the number of job openings has reached a record high powell has pointed to the widespread availability of jobs as evidence that the labor market is tight to an unhealthy level that would tend to fuel inflation the fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures without triggering mass layoffs for now with hiring robust the economy has added at least 400 000 jobs for 11 straight months and employers grappling with labor shortages wages are rising at a roughly 5 annual pace those pay raises are driving steady consumer spending despite spiking prices in march consumers increased their spending 0 2 even after adjusting for inflation even if the fed s benchmark rate were to go as high as 2 5 by year s end powell said last month the policymakers may still tighten credit further to a level that would restrain growth if that turns out to be appropriate financial markets are pricing in a rate as high as 3 6 by mid 2023 which would be the highest in 15 years shrinking the fed s balance sheet will add another layer of uncertainty surrounding how much the fed s actions may weaken the economy complicating the fed s task is a slowdown in global growth covid 19 lockdowns in china are threatening to cause a recession in the world s second largest economy and the european union is facing higher energy prices and supply chain disruptions after russia s invasion of ukraine what s more other central banks around the world are also raising rates a trend that could further imperil global growth on thursday the bank of england is expected to raise its key rate for the fourth straight time the reserve bank of australia increased its rate tuesday for the first time in 11 years
fed authorizes biggest interest rate rise in 22 years washington the us central bank has announced its biggest interest rate increase in more than two decades as it toughens its fight against fast rising prices the federal reserve said it was lifting its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point to a range of 0 75 to 1 after a smaller rise in march with inflation at a 40 year high further hikes are expected the push marks the latest effort to contain spiking costs being felt by households around the world inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing federal reserve chairman jerome powell said in a press conference in washington on wednesday we are moving expeditiously to bring it back down by raising rates banks will make it more expensive for people businesses and governments to borrow they expect that to cool demand for goods and services helping to ease price inflation but their actions also risk triggering a sharp economic slowdown especially as new challenges emerge such as the war in ukraine and recent covid shutdowns in china it s a narrow path they have to walk said economist donald kohn who previously served on the fed s rate setting committee it s going to be a very difficult task behind the curve inflation in the us hit 8 5 in march the sharpest annual rate since 1981 driven by accelerating costs for food and energy that is well above the bank s 2 target many economists say the fed has been slow to respond to the problem which has been fueled by a mix of factors including covid related supply shortages a shock to energy markets from the war in ukraine and in the us massive government spending including direct checks to households to support the economy after the pandemic hit the rate increase announced on wednesday was an unanimous decision it will push what the fed charges banks to borrow to a range of 0 75 to 1 with the higher costs rippling out to consumers in the form of more expensive mortgages credit cards and other loans in addition the bank detailed plans to remove economic support by winding down its balance sheet which swelled during the pandemic as it purchased assets including us government debt and mortgage backed securities to boost the economy starting in june the bank said it would reduce its holdings by 47 5bn per month increasing to 95bn in september the actions by the bank in charge of the world s largest economy are expected to have widespread repercussions as many countries and commodity markets rely on the dollar on wednesday gulf states whose currencies are tied to the dollar responded to the fed with interest rate rises of their own powell said further rate hikes were planned he added that officials agreed that boosting rates by half a percentage point should be on the table in the future but moving more aggressively was not under active consideration us stock markets soared following the press conference which played out largely as investors had expected powell said he was confident the us economy was strong enough to handle the bank s more aggressive stance pointing to the tight job market in which openings outnumber available workers by nearly two to one but he acknowledged that the supply shocks from the war in ukraine and covid lockdowns in china have presented officials with a tough task and might force them to move more aggressively to curb demand than they would otherwise we can t really affect oil prices or food and commodity prices things like that he said but he added we have to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored that s part of our job too it puts any central bank in a very difficult situation source bbc news story date may 5 2022

the united states federal reserve fed has announced its biggest rate hike since 2000 with a half percentage point increase as it works to crush soaring us inflation with inflation at the highest rate in four decades federal reserve chair jerome powell on wednesday sent a message directly to the american people expressing concern for the pain caused by rising prices and pledging to use all available tools to bring them down but he told reporters he remains confident the economy is strong enough to withstand rate increases without tipping into a recession after a quarter point hike in march the us central bank s policy setting federal open market committee fomc pushed the benchmark interest rate above 0 75 per cent as it works to cool the economy and confirmed more increases will be appropriate the hike will raise the costs of all types of borrowing from mortgages to credit cards to car loans cooling demand and business activity inflation has become an overriding concern after the world s largest economy saw annual consumer prices surge 8 5 per cent over the 12 months to march the biggest jump since december 1981 policymakers continue to believe inflation will gradually return to the fed s two percent target as it raises borrowing costs but in a statement following the conclusion of its two day meeting the fomc said it will be highly attentive to inflation risks in an unusual move mr powell opened his news conference speaking to the american people inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship that is causing he said promising to use all tools available to bring it down expeditiously he acknowledged that higher interest rates also bring their share of pain but everyone would be better off if we can get this job done the sooner the better to achieve that aim he said additional 50 basis point increases should be on the table at the next couple of meetings however a more aggressive three quarter point hike is not under consideration the fed s goal is to engineer a soft landing reining in inflation while avoiding a contraction in economic activity and mr powell said that outcome is likely it s a strong economy and nothing about it suggested that it s close to or vulnerable to a recession he said ukraine war impact but with china s pandemic lockdowns worsening global supply snarls and the war in ukraine pushing commodity prices higher analysts fear factors beyond the central bank s control could undermine that goal and perhaps plunge the us economy into a recession the fomc acknowledged the highly uncertain impact of russia s invasion of ukraine and western sanctions on moscow which are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are likely to weigh on economic activity in addition covid 19 lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions the statement said offloading bonds though it contracted in the first quarter mr powell said the economy was healthy enough to withstand higher rates and pointed to robust job gains and strong household and business spending however central bankers cannot engineer a solution for the worker shortages that have challenged businesses and raised fears of a wage price spiral when employees demand higher salaries and fuel price increases mr powell downplayed those concerns saying some of the inflation is due to price shocks while fed policy can help address the imbalance in the labour market on wednesday payroll services firm adp reported private employers added a weaker than expected 247 000 workers in april a sign that companies are struggling to find available labour while government data released tuesday showed there are nearly two openings for every job seeker the fomc also said it would begin reducing its massive bond holdings starting june 1 beginning at the pace of 47 5 billion a 65 5 billion a month and then doubling after three months also aimed at removing stimulus from the economy the decision was widely expected and many economists believe the fomc will again hike rates by a half point in june though ian shepherdson of pantheon economics said after that we think all bets are off given the likelihood of a steep sustained drop in inflation a clear softening in manufacturing and a meltdown in housing market activity

reduce the roughly 9 trillion stash of assets accumulated during the coronavirus pandemic in another lever to bring inflation under control it s very unpleasant powell said of the impact on households of inflation which is running about three times the fed s 2 target if you re a normal economic person then you probably don t have that much extra to spend and it s immediately hitting your spending on groceries on gasoline on energy and things like that so we understand the pain involved powell speaking in a news conference after the end of the fed s latest two day policy meeting said he and his colleagues were determined to restore price stability but that doing so would entail higher borrowing costs including for things like mortgages and car loans so it s not going to be pleasant either but in the end everyone is better off with stable prices nonetheless the fed said the economy is continuing to perform well and powell said it is well positioned to withstand the coming rate hikes

the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington the federal reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short term interest rate by a half percentage point wednesday its most aggressive move since 2000 and signaling further large rate hikes to come the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago the fed also announced that it will start reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which consists mainly of treasury and mortgage bonds those holdings more than doubled after the pandemic recession hit as the fed bought trillions in bonds to try to hold down long term borrowing rates reducing the fed s holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy all told the fed s credit tightening will likely mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses over time including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans speaking at a news conference wednesday chair jerome powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming there is a broad sense on the committee he said referring to the fed that additional half point increases should be on the table in the next couple of meetings with prices for food energy and consumer goods accelerating the fed s goal is to cool spending and economic growth by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow the central bank hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession it will be a delicate balancing act the fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession in their statement wednesday the central bank s policymakers said they are highly attentive to inflation risks the statement also noted that russia s invasion of ukraine is worsening inflation pressures by raising oil and food prices it added that covid related lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions which could further boost inflation inflation according to the fed s preferred gauge reached 6 6 last month the highest point in four decades inflation has been accelerated by a combination of robust consumer spending chronic supply bottlenecks and sharply higher gas and food prices exacerbated by russia s war against ukraine starting june 1 the fed said it would allow up to 48 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them a pace that would reach 95 billion by september at september s pace its balance sheet would shrink by about 1 trillion a year powell has said he wants to quickly raise the fed s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point which the fed says is about 2 4 by year s end the fed s credit tightening is already having some effect on the economy sales of existing homes sank 2 7 from february to march reflecting a surge in mortgage rates related in part to the fed s planned rate hikes the average rate on a 30 year mortgage has jumped 2 percentage points just since the start of the year to 5 1 yet by most measures the overall economy remains healthy this is especially true of the u s job market hiring is strong layoffs are few unemployment is near a five decade low and the number of job openings has reached a record high powell has pointed to the widespread availability of jobs as evidence that the labor market is tight to an unhealthy level that would tend to fuel inflation the fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures without triggering mass layoffs for now with hiring robust the economy has added at least 400 000 jobs for 11 straight months and employers grappling with labor shortages wages are rising at a roughly 5 annual pace those pay raises are driving steady consumer spending despite spiking prices in march consumers increased their spending 0 2 even after adjusting for inflation even if the fed s benchmark rate were to go as high as 2 5 by year s end powell said last month the policymakers may still tighten credit further to a level that would restrain growth if that turns out to be appropriate financial markets are pricing in a rate as high as 3 6 by mid 2023 which would be the highest in 15 years shrinking the fed s balance sheet will add another layer of uncertainty surrounding how much the fed s actions may weaken the economy complicating the fed s task is a slowdown in global growth covid 19 lockdowns in china are threatening to cause a recession in the world s second largest economy and the european union is facing higher energy prices and supply chain disruptions after russia s invasion of ukraine what s more other central banks around the world are also raising rates a trend that could further imperil global growth on thursday the bank of england is expected to raise its key rate for the fourth straight time the reserve bank of australia increased its rate tuesday for the first time in 11 years
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video here are some questions and answers about what the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses washington record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive related articles fed raises key rate by a half point most aggressive move since 2000 how will rising mortgage rates affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about

here are some questions and answers about what the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive related articles fed raises key rate by a half point most aggressive move since 2000 how will rising mortgage rates affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about credit card rates and other interest rates for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck

bloomberg federal reserve chair jerome powell assured americans that policy makers will do what it takes to curb surging inflation acknowledging this could cause some pain as the u s central bank deployed its most powerful policy tightening in decades the fed on wednesday raised interest rates by 50 basis points for the first time since 2000 and powell said similar moves were on the table for june and july still investors took heart that he also pushed back against a larger 75 basis point increase with stocks notching their largest rally on the day of a fed meeting in a decade i d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the american people powell said at the start of a post meeting press conference in washington held in person for the first time since the pandemic began inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing and we re moving expeditiously to bring it back down fed officials who also decided to start reducing their holdings of treasuries and mortgage backed securities next month are trying to curb the hottest inflation since the early 1980s back then chair paul volcker raised rates as high as 20 and crushed both inflation and the broader economy in the process the fed s hope this time around is that the combination of rising borrowing costs and a shrinking balance sheet will deliver a soft landing that avoids recession while tamping down inflation though powell implied this might not be possible without hurting growth yes there may be some pain associated with getting back to that powell said but the big pain is not dealing with inflation and allowing it to become a contraction the fed chief and his colleagues have faced mounting criticism they were slow to confront inflation which in march reached a 40 year high of 8 5 based on the labor department s consumer price index powell on wednesday said the central bank has been adapting as the data changed and will continue to do so this was volckeresque in terms of the hawkishness and the willingness to raise rates said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton llp powell is not going to say directly we are going to go into a recession you don t have to read between the lines too much to see if push comes to shove they are going to get rid of inflation what bloomberg economics says bloomberg economics expects the fed to hike by 50 basis points at its next two meetings as well with the fed funds rate exceeding fomc members neutral rate estimate of about 2 5 in the last quarter of this year at the announced pace the balance sheet runoff will see the fed s portfolio approach its pre pandemic size by 2024 anna wong yelena shulyatyeva andrew husby and eliza winger economists click here to read more powell said half point increases were on the table for the next two policy meetings and suggested that officials could then throttle their hiking pace to quarter point increases starting in september provided price pressures showed signs of cooling fed officials say they want to raise rates until they reach the level that neither speeds up not slows down the economy known as the neutral rate he also said it is certainly possible that the fed decides over time that it will need to move rates to levels that are restrictive for the economy if higher rates are required then we won t hesitate to deliver them powell said though he noted that that there was a broad range of plausible levels of neutral which officials in march estimated between 2 and 3 his wager is that by cooling demand with a steady march to higher interest rates price increases will be kept in check but it is also a risky strategy and one that may become more dramatic later in the year if inflation doesn t settle down said michael de pass head of linear rates at citadel securities supply pressures the fed is hanging on to the view that the supply side pressures are transitory he said the real challenge will be at the end of summer if inflation is going to remain uncomfortably above target and their rate is close to neutral what is their reaction then russia s invasion of ukraine and ongoing covid driven lockdowns in china are continuing to impact global supply chains which the fed acknowledged in its post meeting statement but powell emphasized that the fed doesn t have the tools to fight supply side demand and is instead trying to use its tools to rebalance a too hot labor market powell framed the fed s aggressive plan to rein in inflation as a way to ultimately help workers whose wage gains this year have been eroded by price increases in essentials like food gasoline and rent real wages which take into account inflation have decreased for 12 straight months there was no pussyfooting around said lou crandall wrightson icap llc chief economist he wants to provide guardrails about how far they ll go in the short run while at the same time leaving scope for tightening in the medium term that s much more aggressive than most market participants thought possible even three months ago 2022 bloomberg l p

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago washington the federal reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short term interest rate by a half percentage point wednesday its most aggressive move since 2000 and signaling further large rate hikes to come the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago the fed also announced that it will start reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which consists mainly of treasury and mortgage bonds those holdings more than doubled after the pandemic recession hit as the fed bought trillions in bonds to try to hold down long term borrowing rates reducing the fed s holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy all told the fed s credit tightening will likely mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses over time including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans speaking at a news conference wednesday chair jerome powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming there is a broad sense on the committee he said referring to the fed that additional half point increases should be on the table in the next couple of meetings with prices for food energy and consumer goods accelerating the fed s goal is to cool spending and economic growth by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow the central bank hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession it will be a delicate balancing act the fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession in their statement wednesday the central bank s policymakers said they are highly attentive to inflation risks the statement also noted that russia s invasion of ukraine is worsening inflation pressures by raising oil and food prices it added that covid related lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions which could further boost inflation inflation according to the fed s preferred gauge reached 6 6 last month the highest point in four decades inflation has been accelerated by a combination of robust consumer spending chronic supply bottlenecks and sharply higher gas and food prices exacerbated by russia s war against ukraine starting june 1 the fed said it would allow up to 48 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them a pace that would reach 95 billion by september at september s pace its balance sheet would shrink by about 1 trillion a year powell has said he wants to quickly raise the fed s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point which the fed says is about 2 4 by year s end the fed s credit tightening is already having some effect on the economy sales of existing homes sank 2 7 from february to march reflecting a surge in mortgage rates related in part to the fed s planned rate hikes the average rate on a 30 year mortgage has jumped 2 percentage points just since the start of the year to 5 1 yet by most measures the overall economy remains healthy this is especially true of the u s job market hiring is strong layoffs are few unemployment is near a five decade low and the number of job openings has reached a record high powell has pointed to the widespread availability of jobs as evidence that the labor market is tight to an unhealthy level that would tend to fuel inflation the fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures without triggering mass layoffs for now with hiring robust the economy has added at least 400 000 jobs for 11 straight months and employers grappling with labor shortages wages are rising at a roughly 5 annual pace those pay raises are driving steady consumer spending despite spiking prices in march consumers increased their spending 0 2 even after adjusting for inflation even if the fed s benchmark rate were to go as high as 2 5 by year s end powell said last month the policymakers may still tighten credit further to a level that would restrain growth if that turns out to be appropriate financial markets are pricing in a rate as high as 3 6 by mid 2023 which would be the highest in 15 years shrinking the fed s balance sheet will add another layer of uncertainty surrounding how much the fed s actions may weaken the economy complicating the fed s task is a slowdown in global growth covid 19 lockdowns in china are threatening to cause a recession in the world s second largest economy and the european union is facing higher energy prices and supply chain disruptions after russia s invasion of ukraine what s more other central banks around the world are also raising rates a trend that could further imperil global growth on thursday the bank of england is expected to raise its key rate for the fourth straight time the reserve bank of australia increased its rate tuesday for the first time in 11 years
shortages of crucial metals could potentially hobble the electric vehicle boom photo pixabay in the next few years millions of people will buy electric vehicles evs all those cars and trucks will run on batteries containing metals such as cobalt lithium and nickel not a lot of people realise we simply do not have enough of these critical materials at the moment mined around the world says megan o connor chief executive and co founder of boston based battery materials mining and recycling firm nth cycle her company has designed a means of extracting nickel and other metals from minced up old batteries so that these materials can be used again it s called electro extraction and it works by using an electrical current to separate metals out from crushed up battery waste known as black mass the separated metals are isolated and trapped in a special filter nth cycle s technology extracts nickel not just from pulverised old batteries but also from the clumps of rock and metals dug out of mines it s potentially a more sustainable method of recovering nickel than traditional techniques such as pyrometallurgy which dr o connor says is not an environmentally friendly process think of it like a big furnace they melt everything at very high temperatures you can imagine the carbon footprint she explains in the coming years industry will need all the supplies of nickel it can get as its integral to so many of the products we use daily lithium ion batteries which power many devices including your phone rely on a mix of nickel manganese and cobalt but in some batteries nickel is by far the largest component representing 80 of the mix the problem is that sourcing nickel like many materials at the moment is subject to supply chain headaches caused in part by the war in ukraine as russia is one of the world s biggest nickel suppliers photo afp countries such as indonesia and the philippines will likely boost their nickel output as buyers search for non russian sources of the metal although there are questions over how sustainable this new production will be dr o connor argues that new mines will not be able to open quickly enough to satisfy rising demand for nickel which is also used to make stainless steel and wind turbine components instead recycling old batteries will help to patch that supply problem she suggests other companies are also taking this approach with redwood materials in the us already acquiring batteries from the equivalent of between 60 80 000 electric vehicles every year we recover on average 95 percent of the elements from batteries like nickel cobalt lithium and copper says vice president for communications and government relations alexis georgeson but general confidence in the nickel market is yet to return after a difficult episode in march when nickel s price on the london metal exchange lme spiked by 250 before falling again that prompted the lme s operators to suspend trading of nickel for about a week a more or less unprecedented move it was a disaster says keith wildie head of trading at metals recycling firm romco group who notes that the price of nickel remains volatile although it has fallen again the price is still around 60 higher than it was at the beginning of the year the price shock happened partly because a chinese firm tsingshan holding group had built up a large short position in the market in other words arranging contracts that bet the price of nickel would fall when it didn t the firm was forced to buy back those contracts or commit to supplying the nickel taking either option would result in a huge loss the company did not respond to a request for comment disruption and panic on the market has subsequently knocked nickel traders confidence adds mr wildie the volumes have absolutely collapsed both the financial conduct authority and the bank of england have announced reviews into the incident in a statement the lme said the lme is committed to ensuring that the actions of all participants are fully reviewed and appropriate actions taken to both restore confidence and support the long term health and efficiency of the market however there were concerns about future supplies of nickel even before this episode unfolded ev maker tesla for example had already moved to secure access to the metal by becoming a technical partner in a new nickel mine on the pacific island of new caledonia photo afp not all firms can take this option more than two thirds of the world s nickel production goes to the stainless steel industry where it ultimately ends up in everything from cutlery to bathroom taps and washing machines some stainless steel factories in europe have already cut production thanks to nickel pricing and supply concerns although lisa reisman founder and executive editor of trade publication metalminer predicts that short term demand for the metal in some industries could fall high interest rates might lead to a slowdown of the housing market which would likely mean fewer people may purchasing new appliances containing stainless steel in the coming months she explains electric cars will almost certainly require a steady supply of nickel though earlier this year market research firm s p global platts forecasted that light duty ev sales worldwide would reach 26 8 million by 2030 the firm noted that ev sales more than doubled between 2020 and 2021 jason sappor senior analyst at s p global platts says the elevated price of nickel probably won t have a major impact on ev sales but he does say that ev batteries are becoming an increasingly important driver of the nickel market could recycling old batteries help fill the gap as dr o connor suggests maybe says mr sappor but it requires getting access to enough old batteries to make extracting the small amounts of nickel inside them worthwhile the one issue with that is that there needs to be the existing stock to recycle from he says this approach does make

reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda less i customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period plus or minus ii net loss gain on derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv non cash compensation expense and v other non cash and non recurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before the provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization this conforms to the calculation of adjusted ebitda in our senior credit facility we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the non cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments we also deduct non cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long term incentive plan due to the non cash nature of the expense we adjust from time to time other non cash or unusual and or infrequent charges due to either their non cash nature or their infrequency we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of adjusted ebitda we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre tax financial loss of 64 9 million due to winter storm uri as described above this loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub freezing temperatures across texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ercot we believe this event is unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature our lenders under the company s senior credit facility allowed 60 0 million of the 64 9 million pre tax storm loss to be added back as a non recurring item in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for the company s debt covenant calculations as our senior credit facility is considered a material agreement and adjusted ebitda is a key component of our material covenants we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of the company s financial condition and or liquidity we will present any credits received related to the storm exceeding 4 9 million as a reduction of adjusted ebitda for consistent presentation we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our performance and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful for an understanding of our financial condition and or liquidity due to its use in covenants in our senior credit facility adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure historical cost basis and specific items not reflective of ongoing operations the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends our ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debt and our compliance with financial debt covenants retail gross margin we define retail gross margin as operating income loss plus i depreciation and amortization expenses and ii general and administrative expenses less iii net asset optimization revenues expenses iv net gains losses on non trading derivative instruments v net current period cash settlements on non trading derivative instruments and vi gains losses from non recurring events including non recurring market volatility retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity segments as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of retail gross margin we will continue this historical approach but during the current quarter we have made the decision to add back the financial loss related to winter storm uri as described above in the calculation of retail gross margin because the extremity of the storm combined with the impact of the scarcity pricing mechanisms ordered by ercot is considered unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss net cash provided by operating activities and operating income loss and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management s decision making process the following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted

derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv non cash compensation expense and v other non cash and non recurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before the provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization this conforms to the calculation of adjusted ebitda in our senior credit facility we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the non cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments we also deduct non cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long term incentive plan due to the non cash nature of the expense we adjust from time to time other non cash or unusual and or infrequent charges due to either their non cash nature or their infrequency we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of adjusted ebitda we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre tax financial loss of 64 9 million due to winter storm uri as described above this loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub freezing temperatures across texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ercot we believe this event is unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature our lenders under the company s senior credit facility allowed 60 0 million of the 64 9 million pre tax storm loss to be added back as a non recurring item in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for the company s debt covenant calculations as our senior credit facility is considered a material agreement and adjusted ebitda is a key component of our material covenants we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of the company s financial condition and or liquidity we will present any credits received related to the storm exceeding 4 9 million as a reduction of adjusted ebitda for consistent presentation we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our performance and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful for an understanding of our financial condition and or liquidity due to its use in covenants in our senior credit facility adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure historical cost basis and specific items not reflective of ongoing operations the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends our ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debt and our compliance with financial debt covenants retail gross

iv net gains losses on non trading derivative instruments v net current period cash settlements on non trading derivative instruments and vi gains losses from non recurring events including non recurring market volatility retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity segments as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of retail gross margin we will continue this historical approach but during the current quarter we have made the decision to add back the financial loss related to winter storm uri as described above in the calculation of retail gross margin because the extremity of the storm combined with the impact of the scarcity pricing mechanisms ordered by ercot is considered unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss net cash provided by operating activities and operating income loss and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap

moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes

frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage

appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car

federal reserve raises the base rate 50 basis points to 1 0 as expected passive bond roll off to begin in june reaching 95 billion three months later massive stock rally as powell downplays 0 75 hike in june the federal reserve made good on its promise to fight inflation with the largest rate hike in over two decades and though it indicated more increases are pending the governors pulled back from more extreme measures igniting a huge equity rally and bringing to a halt the dollar s month long surge the federal reserve open market committee fomc the bank s policy board unanimously endorsed a 50 basis point hike in the base rate to 1 0 its highest since the onset of the pandemic in march 2020 a reduction of the bank s 9 trillion portfolio will begin in june with 30 billion in treasuries and 17 5 billion in mortgage back securities allowed to roll off and climbing to 95 billion in three months fed funds fxstreet in a somewhat unusual move fed chair jerome powell opened his statement by addressing the country directly before i go into details of today s meeting i d like to take this opportunity to speak directly to the american people inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing we are moving expeditiously to bring it back down in questioning by the press direct for the first time in two years mr powell noted that assuming that economic and financial conditions evolve in ways that are consistent with our expectations there is a broad sense on the committee that additional 50 basis increases should be on the table for the next couple meetings the next two fomc meetings are june 15 and july 27 and if the fed keeps this schedule that would bring the fed funds rate to two thirds of the treasury market expectation of at least 3 0 by year end in response to a question about a 75 basis point increase in june mr powell commented that this is not something that the committee is actively considering that remark touched off a massive equity rally that pushed the dow ahead by 932 27 points 2 81 to 34 061 0 and the s p 500 up 2 99 124 69 points to 4 300 17 as has been common recently the nasdaq led all averages adding 3 19 401 10 points to 12 964 86 nasdaq composite cnbc the dollar halted its month long surge losing ground against all the majors though the amounts were relatively modest the eur usd closed at 1 0615 its first trade above 1 0600 in five sessions most treasury yields declined as the fed decided not to accelerate its rate campaign with the largest loss on the short end of the curve the yield on the 10 year treasury slipped 3 basis points to 2 927 the return on the 2 year bill dropped just over 13 basis points to 2 636 the yield on the 30 year or long bond added 2 basis points 3 024 at several points in the 45 minutes of questioning mr powell acknowledged the difficulty of avoiding a recession while curbing inflation the issue will come that we don t have precision surgical tools we have essentially interest rates the balance sheet and forward guidance they are famously blunt tools they are not capable of surgical precision mr powell and the fed governors know postwar us economic history they know the incidence of recessions following a tightening cycle since 1950 is about 75 the fed chief s diffidence on the economy and on the ability of the fed to engineer a soft landing reducing demand and inflation without raising unemployment has been taken by the markets to mean that rate increases are tied to economic growth a likely though unstated corollary is that if growth falters rate hikes will stop mr powell did not say this but it is inescapable in the huge equity gains and in the declines in treasury rates and the dollar part of the underlying logic to the fed s sudden and rapid conversion to a tightening program is that the governors know the risk of recession rises with every rate increase they want to do as much to curb inflation as possible in case and before slowing growth brings the increases to a halt mr powell and the fed are very aware that economic history is not on their side

the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington the federal reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark short term interest rate by a half percentage point wednesday its most aggressive move since 2000 and signaling further large rate hikes to come the increase in the fed s key rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago the fed also announced that it will start reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet which consists mainly of treasury and mortgage bonds those holdings more than doubled after the pandemic recession hit as the fed bought trillions in bonds to try to hold down long term borrowing rates reducing the fed s holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy all told the fed s credit tightening will likely mean higher loan rates for many consumers and businesses over time including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans speaking at a news conference wednesday chair jerome powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming there is a broad sense on the committee he said referring to the fed that additional half point increases should be on the table in the next couple of meetings with prices for food energy and consumer goods accelerating the fed s goal is to cool spending and economic growth by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow the central bank hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession it will be a delicate balancing act the fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession in their statement wednesday the central bank s policymakers said they are highly attentive to inflation risks the statement also noted that russia s invasion of ukraine is worsening inflation pressures by raising oil and food prices it added that covid related lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions which could further boost inflation inflation according to the fed s preferred gauge reached 6 6 last month the highest point in four decades inflation has been accelerated by a combination of robust consumer spending chronic supply bottlenecks and sharply higher gas and food prices exacerbated by russia s war against ukraine starting june 1 the fed said it would allow up to 48 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them a pace that would reach 95 billion by september at september s pace its balance sheet would shrink by about 1 trillion a year powell has said he wants to quickly raise the fed s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point which the fed says is about 2 4 by year s end the fed s credit tightening is already having some effect on the economy sales of existing homes sank 2 7 from february to march reflecting a surge in mortgage rates related in part to the fed s planned rate hikes the average rate on a 30 year mortgage has jumped 2 percentage points just since the start of the year to 5 1 yet by most measures the overall economy remains healthy this is especially true of the u s job market hiring is strong layoffs are few unemployment is near a five decade low and the number of job openings has reached a record high powell has pointed to the widespread availability of jobs as evidence that the labor market is tight to an unhealthy level that would tend to fuel inflation the fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures without triggering mass layoffs for now

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video here are some questions and answers about what the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses washington record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive related articles fed raises key rate by a half point most aggressive move since 2000 how will rising mortgage rates affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about credit card rates and other interest rates for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does should the fed decide to raise rates by 2 percentage points or more over the next two years a distinct possibility that would significantly enlarge interest payments will i be able to earn more on my savings probably though not likely by very much and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to increase their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers this is particularly true for large banks now they ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier americans during the pandemic they won t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or cd buyers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts could be an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits still savers are starting to see some better potential returns from treasurys on tuesday the yield on the 10 year note was 2 96 after having briefly topped 3 for the first time since 2018 financial markets expect inflation to average 2 83 over 10 years that level would give investors a positive if very small return of about 0 13 all of a sudden we end up in this position where fixed income is way more competitive than it was before said jason pride chief investment officer for private wealth at glendmede ___

reading time 8 mins what income levels can afford a million dollar mortgage how can someone save for a down payment on a million dollar house while struggling to pay such high rent is owning a home in the fraser valley an attainable goal in 2022 these are questions i alyssa ask myself daily along with many other young british columbians planning their futures currently my fiancé and i are looking to move into a detached home that aligns with our goals as a couple we purchased a condo in 2017 and since then it has soared in value from 245 000 to approximately 650 000 despite this jump in overall equity to put towards a detached home we are finding that even most townhouses are beyond our reach my fiancé is an industrial electrician and i am completing my undergrad in april for social work along with currently working full time as a support worker we both have very well paying jobs but despite our net income the fraser valley is not affordable because of the high cost of housing we are considering relocating to another province it saddens me that we are being pushed out of our home province where all our friends and family are we want to provide our future family with the same childhood that we had a big backyard with a trampoline a blow up pool in the summer and a garden where we can grow vegetables and fruits is this realistic for us if we remain in the fraser valley when looking at a single person with a good career we can see more barriers when it comes to owning a home or upgrading their existing one ashlee purchased a two bedroom apartment in abbotsford in 2010 for 125 000 she was only twenty one years old but the cost of the apartment was low which also meant the down payment was an attainable sum to manage around 7 000 she was also able to co sign the mortgage loan with her father a privilege that not all are afforded she worked eight years in retail to fulfill the mortgage payments and she retained roommates to offset monthly expenses twelve years later her residence is currently valued at around 420 000 an increase of just over 236 per cent even with this shocking jump of 295 000 worth of equity it is still insufficient in her quest to upgrade to a detached house or even a townhouse in the fraser valley with a soon to be career as a social worker the real estate market she was once able to buy into as a single person is now beyond her reach should she choose to sell her apartment to dig deeper and uncover the numbers associated with the housing market in bc we turned to the fraser valley real estate board fvreb for the following statistics from january 2010 to january 2022 the data indicated that there was a 213 per cent increase in benchmark prices for detached homes in the last 12 years what once cost 500 931 now costs a staggering 1 569 million similar situations can be observed in the market for townhouses and apartments which also saw gains of 150 per cent and 135 per cent respectively this dramatic price hike originated in 2017 according to our research based on the statistics provided by the fvreb in january 2017 the benchmark prices of single family detached homes increased by 24 3 per cent townhomes increased by 28 8 per cent and apartments increased by 27 6 percent within the span of just one year prices have been steadily increasing since then and we see the highest jump yet between 2022 and 2021 when the benchmark price for detached homes townhomes and apartments increased by 41 8 per cent 37 2 per cent and 30 6 percent respectively brendon ogmundson british columbia real estate association s bcrea chief economist suggests that a contributing factor to this housing market frenzie is due to supply and demand many are wanting to buy and little is available for sale disparities in the fraser valley rental market making it difficult to transition from renting to owning high rental costs are a major barrier for people wanting to become homeowners between 2015 and 2019 the average rental cost in abbotsford increased by 34 per cent for all rental units according to bc housing housing is considered affordable when 30 per cent or less of your household s gross income goes towards paying for your housing costs this 30 per cent rule originated in the 1969 amendment to public housing requirements the brooke amendment sally french financial writer for the new york times states that this rule is increasingly outdated because it doesn t account for modern expenses that are prevalent today nor does it take into consideration individual circumstances such as how many dependents one is supporting the abbotsford b c housing needs report from 2021 identifies the following populations to be most vulnerable to not being able to meet their housing needs seniors 14 per cent of whom live with low income can apply for rental assistance through the shelter aid for elderly renters safer program seniors also trend towards being illegally evicted due to living in rent controlled apartments people with special needs also face barriers when finding accessible housing especially in abbotsford where 56 per cent of housing stock was built before 1990 and often lacks accessibility features low income renters who make up 34 per cent of all rental households in abbotsford face a higher risk of eviction indigenous peoples are disproportionately represented in abbotsford s homeless population due to historical trauma oppression and discrimination which has resulted in structural issues that create greater barriers to housing like poverty low education levels and unemployment families especially single parent households also struggle to attain affordable three plus bedroom housing options finally individuals in extreme and core housing need meaning they spend more than 50 per cent of their income on housing made up 5 6 per cent of abbotsford households in 2016 if these key groups of people are struggling to pay their rent each month how could they ever save enough to afford a down payment on a home bc does have a first time home buyers program to reduce or eliminate the property transfer tax for people buying their first home as well canada s home buyers plan is a program that allows first time home buyers to take money out of their registered retirement savings plans rrsps to be able to pay for the down payment the minimum down payment is five per cent on a home that costs under 500 000 this is a great initiative to get people into homes but now they are left with a massive mortgage payment each month along with purchasing mortgage insurance which is a requirement when your down payment is less than 20 per cent stagnant wages don t match with rising inflation as a society we need to recognize that the issue is not that young people do not want to work the problem is rising housing prices and stagnant wages in 2011 bc saw the first minimum wage increase in a decade as hourly wages rose from 8 75 to 9 50 minimum wage has been slowly but surely increasing ever since then and on june 1 b c s minimum wage will reach 15 65 an hour this 78 85 per cent increase in wages still does not match the 213 per cent increase in the housing market stats canada shared the results of a 2022 survey that revealed canadian wages increase approximately 3 1 per cent annually with canadian inflation rising 5 1 per cent on a year over year basis 2022 having the highest inflation rate canada has seen since 1991 this inflation of housing prices has happened alongside a dramatic increase in the minimum wage so it may be appropriate to address the disparity between the wage increases not matching the market but there is no wage hike that could tackle that wages were stagnant for too long but further increases aren t a magic bullet either it s a market problem that requires market solutions the living wage in the fraser valley still does not equal the minimum amount employers have to pay their workers living wage for families calculated that the cost of living for two working parents with two children must earn 16 75 an hour to be able to pay for their basic needs living wage does not take into account what would be necessary to save for a down payment at the pace of the market if that figure was acknowledged over how long would we expect someone to work before being able to afford a down payment unfortunately the living wage allows for only that living no advancement dreams or betterment of any kind your rent is paid and you survive another two weeks better be able to do it again and again and again foreign buying using the market as income and the colonial history of settlement expansion there are many more factors to consider when talking about b c s absurd housing market such as the government s response to foreign purchasing currently there is no cap on how much real estate foreign buyers can possess but foreign buyers pay 20 per cent tax and a vacancy tax on all their properties while foreign investors benefit those wanting to sell their homes this flood in the buyers market has caused many who live here to not be able to enter the market at all this brings into question another factor of people using the market as income as those who own their homes use their equity to buy rental properties or to help their children enter the market for many the housing market has become the most lucrative means of saving for retirement forty years ago when interest rates were much higher mortgages were expensive and savings accounts offered an incentive to squirrel money away for the future today savings accounts offer a paltry 0 010 per cent and locking your money away for five years doesn t equate to a windfall either housing on the other hand has proven to be a surefire investment in recent decades in a 2021 interview with global news paul kershaw founder of generation squeeze and policy professor in the ubc school of population health stated that we have tolerated rising home prices because it has made homeowners who got into the housing market earlier get rich while we sleep watch television and cook those who got into the housing market early are incentivised to want prices to climb unfortunately this comes at the expense of those who arrived later we should also consider the colonial history of settlement expansion as europeans sought the americas and australia with the expectation of land that had grown scarce in europe and how that legacy still informs many of our notions of home ownership many canadians were raised with the expectation that a stable career was the only real prerequisite to owning a detached home with a yard and for a long time that was a realistic expectation provided you were willing to commute whether or not that expectation is realistic it s interesting to see where it comes from as it s certainly not universal historically going out west was synonymous with seeking land and that generational expectation of a plot of land all to oneself can be seen in the urban sprawl that plagues metro vancouver faced with an immensity of space it s easy and totally understandable to pine for the same but there is a price to be paid and historically we have made indigenous communities pay that price in our stead as populations increase if we don t adjust our expectations we are doomed to continue on a devastating trajectory solutions b c has posed to address the housing crisis the housing crisis in b c is one that many experts have pondered over for the last decade the b c government has made claims before that they are working on resolving the disparity in wages versus housing affordability in 2018 they published a 30 point plan for a fairer housing market that addressed issues like stabilizing the market by increasing the foreign buyers tax working against tax fraud and evasion building more affordable homes for key populations like seniors and students and strengthening rental assistance programs for low income individuals and families some progress is being made as 32 000 homes for target populations have been completed or are currently in construction the b c student housing loan program allows public post secondary institutions to borrow money from the province to build more on campus student housing units on campus housing has already expanded by 25 per cent at the university of victoria thanks to this program will ufv take advantage of this program to expand our available on campus housing to hold more than 1 3 per cent of the student body economics is hard vancouver born educator laurence j peter stated an economist is an expert who will know tomorrow why the things he predicted yesterday didn t happen today as canadians grapple with the housing crisis it s important to consider that we didn t get here overnight as convenient as it might be there is no single reason or policy to point to as the root cause of the situation whether it be provincial policies or municipal zoning foreign buyers or local investors boomers millennials stagnant wages interest rates or inflation there s plenty of blame to go around similarly there s no magic fix that will remedy the situation so beware those who offer one the scope and complexity of the problem of metro vancouver housing is precisely what makes it a crisis those who have yet to enter the market are effectively shut out for the time being meanwhile new construction adds to an increasing supply decreasing demand in an already overpriced market if or when the market collapses a possibility looming larger by the day the heights of the housing boom will be matched only by the calamity of the fallout

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video here are some questions and answers about what the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses washington record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive related articles fed raises key rate by a half point most aggressive move since 2000 how will rising mortgage rates affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about credit card rates and other interest rates for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does should the fed decide to raise rates by 2 percentage points or more over the next two years a distinct possibility that would significantly enlarge interest payments will i be able to earn more on my savings probably though not likely by very much and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to increase their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers this is particularly true for large banks now they ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier americans during the pandemic they won t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or cd buyers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts could be an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits still savers are starting to see some better potential returns from treasurys on tuesday the yield on the 10 year note was 2 96 after having briefly topped 3 for the first time since 2018 financial markets expect inflation to average 2 83 over 10 years that level would give investors a positive if very small return of about 0 13 all of a sudden we end up in this position where fixed income is way more competitive than it was before said jason pride chief investment officer for private wealth at glendmede ___

destin fl accesswire may 4 2022 on monday the u s department of commerce and noaa fisheries formally published their decision to take fish from working families markets restaurants and consumers even though this decision comes as a result of flawed procedures inaccuracies and inadequacies in their economic analysis and numerous legal precedents which will be violated amendment 53 to the reef fish resources fishery management plan as formulated by the gulf of mexico fishery management council gulf council will reallocate 20 percent of commercial red grouper quota to the recreational sector a 32 percent decrease from what would have been allocated without the amendment causing significant harm to restaurants markets distributors processors harvesters and ultimately end consumers will deny the citizens of the united states access to 1 2 million pounds of red grouper currently being caught annually by commercial fishermen and enjoyed by anyone who does not have the ability or opportunity to fish recreationally will deprive restaurants of revenue from those landings negatively affect the tourist industry and deprive non angler citizens of their access to gulf of mexico seafood resources during the public comment period the gulf coast seafood alliance gcsa submitted an analysis conducted by respected independent experts in opposition to the proposed rule in addition to our comments seventeen major organizations registered their opposition to amendment 53 including the environmental defense fund the national restaurant association the national fisheries institute the gulf of mexico reef fish shareholders alliance and the charter fisherman s association on february 18 public comments were due to noaa fisheries on the proposed rule for the implementation of amendment 53 to the reef fish resources fishery management plan on march 9 just 12 workdays later andrew strelcheck the regional administrator approved the amendment in a letter to dale diaz chair of the gulf council given the typical length of time required by noaa to conduct analyses it is incomprehensible that the agency undertook a serious analysis of the comments submitted by gcsa and the numerous other organizations and individuals who raised serious concerns instead noaa appears to have taken an approve now analyze later approach the gcsa review gcsa s expert panel analyzed the gulf council s actions in the development of amendment 53 and found significant problems from three perspectives process flaws in the processes and procedures undertaken by the gulf council that led to its adoption an analysis of the gulf council process under the supervision of dr steve cadrin professor of fisheries oceanography at the university of massachusetts dartmouth school of marine science and technology and past president of the american institute of fisheries research biologists conducted by aubrey ellertson church a graduate student at the same institution economic inadequacies and inaccuracies in the economic and environmental studies conducted an economic analysis by dr tom sproul associate professor of environmental and natural resource economics at the university of rhode island who represents rhode island on the committee for economics and social science at the atlantic states marine fisheries commission legal the legal precedents that would be violated by implementation of the amendment a legal analysis by attorney drew minkiewicz a partner in the washington dc law office of kelley drye warren llp in his second decade of legal practice he represents commercial fishing interests and maritime shippers prior to joining kelley drye drew served as senior counsel and staff director of the subcommittee on oceans atmosphere fisheries and coast guard of the senate committee on commerce science and transportation process issues and statistical analysis problems the review found these serious issues in the gulf council s promulgation of amendment 53 the gulf council s economic analysis in the final environmental impact statement feis contains a pattern of assumptions and omissions that bias the cost benefit analysis against commercial fishing and in favor of recreational fishing accordingly an unbiased feis would come to the opposite conclusion that recreational quota should be reallocated to the commercial fishery the gulf council s analysis to calculate economic value for recreational fisheries included all value added from the time a fish was swimming freely below the waves until it was caught by a recreational fisher s hook but that council analysis to calculate economic value of commercially caught fish ended with the ex vessel value at the dock and ignored all additional value added from the dock to the restaurant plate or the market seafood counter significant concerns exist on efforts to retroactively interrelate estimates of recreational fishing effort derived from the coastal household telephone survey chts with the fishing effort survey fes these concerns emerged in the marine recreational information program mrip calibration model peer review organized by noaa fisheries in 2017 and are expressed in the minority report anomalies in the record of the noaa fisheries analysis of the 2017 mrip calibration model peer review indicating that the data from florida private vessels most representative of recreational red grouper catch are not aligned with the macro assumptions used by the council in the adoption of amendment 53 the circumstances leading to amendment 53 arose from changes in the way that recreational fishing catch is estimated starting in 1979 data about recreational fishing effort was collected by phone survey this method became less practical over time due in large part to a decline in the use of landline telephones it was replaced with the fes a postal mail survey sent to a sample of residential households in coastal states between 2016 and 2017 noaa fisheries staff and independent consultants worked to develop a calibration model to re estimate statistics produced by the phone survey during the 2017 mrip calibration model peer review noaa fisheries researchers were unable to explain the large difference in mrip fes catch estimates using covariates in the statistical calibration model reviewer jason mcnamee noted it was impossible to certify the accuracy of the predictions backwards in time neither of these difficulties are surprising given the difficulty of retrodicting data going back decades from just a few recent years of calibration data members of the gcsa are concerned about an anomaly we have found in the official record of the 2017 mrip calibration model peer review in examining the records of the estimated retrodicted fes values the recalculation of the historic numbers against the previously existing chts values and using what can be called the sesame street analysis we see that that one of these things is not like the other one of these things just doesn t belong the additional materials from the 2017 mrip calibration model peer review panel contain a series of plots of the estimated retrodicted fes values against the previous chts values for each of the 17 atlantic and gulf coastal states an examination of the plot of retrodicted fes values against previous chts values for private boat trips by florida anglers who represent the overwhelming majority of the red grouper recreational fishery shows that nearly all the pre existing chts values over the period 1986 2005 fall inside the confidence interval for the newly calculated mrip fes predictions the implication of this one state anomaly is important it implies that the retrodicted fes values for florida anglers who comprise much of the gulf red grouper recreational fishers are not statistically different from the previously existing chts estimates in other words there appears to be insufficient statistical information to determine that historical catch for these anglers was different from the previous estimates and therefore there is no basis for reallocation our combined review of both the council procedures and the ultimately selected alternative using questionable historic statistical analyses demonstrates that amendment 53 to the fishery management plan for the reef fish resources of the gulf of mexico does not promote conservation for a highly vulnerable stock does not advance objectives of the fishery management plan ignores factors that would have increased the commercial sectors allocation does not minimize bycatch does not provide information on how noaa fisheries recalibrated historical red grouper landings ignored the council s allocation policy ignores recommendations of the reef fish advisory panel and ifq advisory panel economic analysis problems to translate the term consumer surplus from terms used by economists to the commonly used vernacular what this means is that the economic analysis used by the council includes the value of any fish caught by a recreational angler all the way to the hook of the recreational fisher but when we examine the application of the same consumer surplus concept as it is applied to the commercial fishery in the council analysis the calculation ends at the ex vessel value that is paid by a fish house or processor at the dock so all of the additional economic value added by the gcsa members who distribute seafood wholesale or own markets or restaurants is ignored in the council calculations as well as the value to the end consumers of seafood there is no justification for this choice nor even any disclosure that this choice was made our economic analysis found that the feis contains incomplete arbitrary and biased analysis it cannot be relied upon for federal rulemaking until corrections are made the key points in our review are as follows estimates of angler consumer surplus are arbitrary and overstated estimates of consumer surplus from commercial harvest are missing estimates of producer surplus from commercial harvest are missing for secondary wholesale retail and restaurants estimates of climate change impacts are missing our estimates indicate substantially larger climate change impacts from recreational trips than from commercial harvest indirect and induced economic impacts are omitted from the cost benefit analysis objective cost benefit analysis favors increasing commercial quota allocation confidence in the analysis is overstated because estimates of uncertainty are missing the economic conclusions drawn in the feis to support amendment 53 hinge entirely on the arbitrary assignment of outsize enjoyment benefits to recreational anglers of 110 per fish this value is based on a single research study using hypothetical tradeoffs and it is more than 25x the value determined appropriate by the u s environmental protection agency without this single arbitrary assumption the economic analysis in the feis would come to the opposite conclusion amendment 53 should be rejected and if anything recreational quota should be reallocated to the commercial fishery legal problems our legal analysis shows the rule would violate existing law in several ways under the law if fishing privileges are allocated to a specific group that allocation must actually promote a conservation purpose because the allocation fails to promote the conservation of a fish stock the rule violates national standard four of the magnuson stevens act 16 u s c 1851 a 4 it does not advance the objectives of the fishery management plan to achieve robust fishery reporting and data collection systems across all sectors for monitoring the reef fish fishery which minimizes scientific management and risk uncertainty to minimize and reduce dead discards and to promote and maintain accountability in the reef fish fishery by selecting alternatives that contradict these stated goals the agency is acting in an arbitrary and unreasonable fashion oceana inc v evans 2005 wl 555426 7 d d c 2005 quoting city of alexandria v slater 198 f 3d 862 867 d c cir 1999 national standard 9 16 u s c 1851 a 9 directs those measures to minimize bycatch or mortality of bycatch amendment 53 has no measures to reduce bycatch rather the rule would increase bycatch in a directed fishery in coastal conservation ass n v gutierrez 512 f supp 2d 896 2007 and in flaherty v bryson 850 f supp 2d 38 2012 courts found that nmfs violated the law by not including measures to address the minimization of bycatch 16 u s c 1851 a 2 dictates that conservation and management measures shall be based upon the best scientific information available yet as our economic analysis shows the environmental protection agency s meta analysis is far superior than the economic analysis used to justify amendment 53 in every objective way in hall v evans 165 f supp 2d 114 d r i 2001 the court concluded that nmfs violated national standard 2 because the secretary had not utilized the best scientific information available to the agency the proposed rule for amendment 53 is similar to the rule promulgated for amendment 28 to the reef fish fmp which was rejected in guindon v pritzker 240 f supp 3d 181 d d c 2017 in which the court struck down a reallocation that rewarded the recreational sector for overharvesting as not fair and equitable other major organizations opposing this action following are excerpts from their public comments environmental defense fund much of our u s work supports the development and implementation of fishery management best practices and climate resilience key to progress in these areas is ensuring that fishery management policies are rooted in sound public process are consistent with governing laws and use the best available science it is through this lens that we respectfully request that you reject amendment 53 in its current form and send it back to the gulf council for further consideration following the gulf council s designated allocation review process national restaurant association cause significant harm to the entire seafood supply chain including restaurants and is inconsistent with the requirements of the magnuson stevens act fishery conservation and management act would remove hundreds of thousands of red grouper servings from restaurants and their consumers national fisheries institute if adopted amendment 53 will establish a worrisome precedent against the science driven collaborative msa framework that framework has enabled nmfs and the fishery management councils to restore dozens of significant fisheries to maximum sustainable yield and then to keep them there in the face of conservation and other headwinds but if one sector can successfully engineer a dramatic reallocation in the red grouper fishery as proposed here that will tempt others to seek similar one sided outcomes in other completely unrelated fisheries that like this one do not face sustainability disaster gulf council management of the red snapper fishery in recent years has already prompted similar concerns from environmental advocates commercial seafood producers gulf council members and other parties this will undermine the msa framework and if repeated often enough will cause its collapse gulf of mexico reef fish shareholders alliance nmfs attempted to re create historical acls based on fes calibrations for other species like king mackerel no similar attempt was made for red grouper our understanding is that attempting to calculate historical acls going back to years used for red grouper allocation 1986 2005 was difficult but without undertaking that exercise reallocation is just a one way ratchet in which only the recreational sector can ever benefit in that regard red grouper reallocation under amendment 53 is similar to red snapper reallocation under amendment 28 which a court struck down as not fair and equitable as required by national standard 4 charter fisherman s association amendment 53 appears to punish the commercial sector for the discards of the recreational sector the commercial sector loses 1 2 million pounds of red grouper while the recreational sector s quota only increases 550 000 pounds the remaining 650 000 pounds goes to accounting for the recreational sector discards and we can t support that each sector or subsector should be responsible for their own discards and not be forced to subsidize the dead discards of others the gulf coast seafood alliance gcsa is an organization of stakeholders seeking a common goal equitable and sustainable fisheries along the gulf coast for commercial and recreational use alike our members make up a diverse group of restaurant owners chefs vessel owners and seafood market owners gcsa

clearway capital an activist investor in glanbia plc has come out publicly suggesting that glanbia should sell its european joint venture cheese operations and spin off its performance nutrition business and list it on the stock markets in the united states and ireland in a letter to glanbia plc chair donard gaynor the clearway capital ceo gianluca ferrari who is obviously trying to steer the strategic direction of glanbia insists the moves would unlock significant value in the group and would double the company valuation from 3bn to 6bn while clearway only holds less than a 3 stake in glanbia he suggests the glanbia performance nutrition business had lost touch with its consumer base in his letter he also states glanbia has a confused corporate structure and has made questionable capital allocations that complicate the business understanding
fed raises key rate by a half point in bid to tame inflation washington the federal reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark interest rate by a

holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy with prices for food energy and consumer goods accelerating the fed s goal is to cool spending and economic growth by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow the central bank hopes that higher costs for mortgages credit cards and auto loans will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession it will be a delicate balancing act the fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession speaking at a news conference wednesday chair jerome powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming he said that additional half point increases in the fed s key rate should be on the table in the next couple of meetings in june and july but powell also sought to downplay any speculation that the fed might be considering a rate hike as high as three

the federal reserve helped the us economy through the covid 19 pandemic by dropping rates to near zero now the fed is facing new challenge crushing inflation without bringing on recession it s hard to catch up when you have to go very fast it s also hard to catch up when you actually have to push monetary policy to tight setting coming up with so called soft landing could be difficult in part because the jobs market is booming and increasing the interest rate will likely change that this is situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in in very long time and people are able to quit their jobs and move to better paying jobs the unemployment rate in the us is at 3 6 according to the bureau of labor statistics which is considered full employment by the fed they have to push up the unemployment rate and in the past when you pushed up the unemployment rate you ve almost never been able to avoid full fledged recession the central bank raised rates by quarter of percentage point in march but some say that wasn t soon enough they wanted to start late because they wanted to see they kind of get the full employment but i think that s going to turn out in retrospect to have been policy mistake they should have gone little bit sooner in terms of removing monetary policy accommodation i m john lawrence reporting advertisement federal reserve raises key rate by a half point

reconciliation of gaap to non gaap measures adjusted ebitda we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda less i customer acquisition costs incurred in the current period plus or minus ii net loss gain on derivative instruments and iii net current period cash settlements on derivative instruments plus iv non cash compensation expense and v other non cash and non recurring operating items ebitda is defined as net income loss before the provision for income taxes interest expense and depreciation and amortization this conforms to the calculation of adjusted ebitda in our senior credit facility we deduct all current period customer acquisition costs representing spending for organic customer acquisitions in the adjusted ebitda calculation because such costs reflect a cash outlay in the period in which they are incurred even though we capitalize and amortize such costs over two years we do not deduct the cost of customer acquisitions through acquisitions of businesses or portfolios of customers in calculating adjusted ebitda we deduct our net gains losses on derivative instruments excluding current period cash settlements from the adjusted ebitda calculation in order to remove the non cash impact of net gains and losses on these instruments we also deduct non cash compensation expense that results from the issuance of restricted stock units under our long term incentive plan due to the non cash nature of the expense we adjust from time to time other non cash or unusual and or infrequent charges due to either their non cash nature or their infrequency we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of adjusted ebitda we will continue this historical approach but during the first quarter of 2021 we incurred a net pre tax financial loss of 64 9 million due to winter storm uri as described above this loss was incurred due to uncharacteristic extended sub freezing temperatures across texas combined with the impact of the pricing caps ordered by ercot we believe this event is unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature our lenders under the company s senior credit facility allowed 60 0 million of the 64 9 million pre tax storm loss to be added back as a non recurring item in the calculation of adjusted ebitda for the company s debt covenant calculations as our senior credit facility is considered a material agreement and adjusted ebitda is a key component of our material covenants we consider our covenant compliance to be material to the understanding of the company s financial condition and or liquidity we will present any credits received related to the storm exceeding 4 9 million as a reduction of adjusted ebitda for consistent presentation we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our performance and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is also useful for an understanding of our financial condition and or liquidity due to its use in covenants in our senior credit facility adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements such as industry analysts investors commercial banks and rating agencies use to assess the following our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded companies in the retail energy industry without regard to financing methods capital structure historical cost basis and specific items not reflective of ongoing operations the ability of our assets to generate earnings sufficient to support our proposed cash dividends our ability to fund capital expenditures including customer acquisition costs and incur and service debt and our compliance with financial debt covenants retail gross margin we define retail gross margin as operating income loss plus i depreciation and amortization expenses and ii general and administrative expenses less iii net asset optimization revenues expenses iv net gains losses on non trading derivative instruments v net current period cash settlements on non trading derivative instruments and vi gains losses from non recurring events including non recurring market volatility retail gross margin is included as a supplemental disclosure because it is a primary performance measure used by our management to determine the performance of our retail natural gas and electricity segments as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance retail gross margin should not be considered an alternative to or more meaningful than operating income loss its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we believe retail gross margin provides information useful to investors as an indicator of our retail energy business s operating performance we have historically included the financial impact of weather variability in the calculation of retail gross margin we will continue this historical approach but during the current quarter we have made the decision to add back the financial loss related to winter storm uri as described above in the calculation of retail gross margin because the extremity of the storm combined with the impact of the scarcity pricing mechanisms ordered by ercot is considered unusual infrequent and non recurring in nature the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities the gaap measure most directly comparable to retail gross margin is operating income loss our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss net cash provided by operating activities or operating income loss adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin are not presentations made in accordance with gaap and have limitations as analytical tools you should not consider adjusted ebitda or retail gross margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap because adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin exclude some but not all items that affect net income loss net cash provided by operating activities and operating income loss and are defined differently by different companies in our industry our definition of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and retail gross margin as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these data points into management s decision making process the following tables present a reconciliation of adjusted

amazon com inc founder jeff bezos has the resources to launch himself into space elon musk does too in many ways though the richest people left the vast majority of the world behind long ago the world s wealthiest 500 individuals are now worth us 8 4 trillion up more than 40 per cent in the year and a half since the global pandemic began its devastation meanwhile the economy s biggest winners the tech corporations that created many of these vast fortunes pay lower tax rates than grocery clerks and their mega wealthy founders can exploit legal loopholes to pass huge windfalls onto heirs largely tax free now a group powerful enough to challenge the supremacy of the tech titans is on the verge of taking action the leaders of the group of seven including u s president joe biden and u k prime minister boris johnson meet in southwestern england this weekend where they re expected to endorse a plan to plug holes in the world s leaky tax system while the changes still need approval from a larger group of nations including china before becoming reality the agreement by the g 7 marks a historic turning point after decades of falling levies on multinational corporations it is very easy for multinationals and the richest people to escape tax what we are seeing with the g 7 is that the time has come for politicians to take back power said philippe martin a former adviser to french president emmanuel macron who now heads the conseil d analyse economique there is a window of opportunity a turning point at which they are realizing they need tax power and they need to spend more the deal would bolster biden s own plans to boost taxes on corporations and the wealthy by raising rates making heirs pay more and equalizing rates between investors and workers the proposals are part of a global revival of initiatives to target the rich from buenos aires to stockholm to washington including new taxes on capital gains inheritances and wealth that have gained momentum since covid 19 blew massive fiscal holes in government budgets around the world u s treasury secretary janet yellen framed the g 7 deal as a way for governments to protect their national sovereignty to set tax policy for too long there has been a global race to the bottom in corporate tax rates yellen said following the g 7 finance ministers meeting in london last week ahead of this weekend s gathering yellen was joined by the finance ministers of germany indonesia mexico and south africa in a washington post opinion piece wednesday calling for all countries in the international tax talks to come together in a political agreement in line with the agreed timeline and ahead of the g 20 finance ministers meeting next month amazon and some other tech companies meanwhile have endorsed the agreement believing the global regime will be more manageable than costly alternatives being pursued by individual countries bezos has also voiced support for higher u s corporate taxes to pay for infrastructure advocates for higher taxes say the steps are necessary to stave off a rise in populism and even for the sustainability of capitalism the most visible and prominent winners of globalization are these big multinationals whose effective tax rates have collapsed said university of california at berkeley economics professor gabriel zucman who tracks wealth and inequality that can only lead to a growing rejection of that form of globalization by the people the world economic forum the organizer of the annual conference for the rich and powerful in davos switzerland issued a white paper this month arguing taxation systems must be redesigned efficiently to tax capital and multinationals governments need the revenue and progressive taxation will be an essential mechanism to compensate for the uneven recovery already under way according to the report there remain plenty of defenders of low taxes conservative economists such as douglas holtz eakin president of the american action forum argue taxing the wealthy and corporations more heavily will damage the economy higher taxes on capital generally raises the possibility of a slowdown of productivity growth said holtz eakin who was an adviser to president george w bush that view is losing ground though as resentment grows over the ways that highly profitable corporations reduce their taxes facebook apple amazon netflix google and microsoft collectively skirted approximately us 100 billion in u s taxes from 2010 to 2019 according to an analysis of regulatory filings from fair tax mark a progressive think tank many of those untaxed profits were shifted into tax havens like bermuda ireland luxembourg and the netherlands amazon paid an effective corporate tax rate of 11 8 per cent in 2020 according to a bloomberg economics analysis and it s hardly an outlier among highly successful tech companies facebook founded by the world s fifth richest person mark zuckerberg paid 12 2 per cent last year asked to comment for this article an amazon spokesperson pointed to some of the company s prior statements related to its tax bill including in part amazon s taxes which are publicly reported reflect our continued investments employee compensation and current u s tax laws as a mix between a technology company and a retailer with massive physical infrastructure amazon is able to use a slew of long standing low profile tax preferences for stock compensation buildings research and development bezos has pushed to re invest profits into the company a strategy that keeps taxable income low and tax breaks high amazon completely avoided federal income taxes in 2017 and 2018 thanks to its savvy use of the tax code since then the company has had to pay some income tax to the internal revenue service but it s been far below the 21 per cent headline rate installed under president donald trump billionaire tech founders often pay even less personally than their corporations do bezos for example got us 77 billion richer in 2020 according to the bloomberg billionaires index but in the u s gains on stock are only taxed when they re sold at a far lower rate than well off workers pay meaning that bezos owed at most a few billion dollars in taxes to the u s treasury last year this country s wealthiest who profited immensely during the pandemic have not been paying their fair share senate finance committee chairman ron wyden said after propublica reported on tuesday that several of the world s billionaires including bezos didn t pay any federal income taxes in some years the media organization said it obtained confidential tax documents on thousands of the wealthiest americans including for warren buffett and michael bloomberg owner of bloomberg lp the parent company of bloomberg news bloomberg and others told propublica they had paid the taxes they owed to remove advantages in the u s tax code that benefit the ultra wealthy biden has proposed taxing inherited assets that currently escape levies and boosting the top rate on investment income so that well paid workers and investors pay the same on an international scale the administration is seeking a global minimum tax of at least 15 per cent for the world s most profitable companies the deal expected to be pushed forward at the g 7 meeting this weekend the g 7 deal would change other rules for taxing multinationals in order to undercut efforts to shift profits to low tax countries biden is also advocating to increase the u s corporate rate to 28 per cent partly reversing trump s tax overhaul tech companies could see their effective tax rates jump if a global tax deal is reached according to research from morgan stanley facebook and alphabet s google could both pay 28 per cent on their profits worldwide up from 18 per cent and 17 per cent respectively under current rules the report found for all the talk of taxing the rich biden s proposals and the international tax deal face serious hurdles before they re adopted while some of his fellow democrats who narrowly control congress are pushing for more radical changes to the taxes of estates and wealth others are hesitant the next step for the global tax negotiations which were launched years ago by the organization for economic cooperation and development and have involved roughly 140 nations is to win agreement among the group of 20 countries finance ministers for the g 20 which collectively oversee about 90 per cent of the world s economy will meet in july in venice stumbling blocks to reaching a deal by year end include china which may seek exemptions from the minimum tax still there are hopes the global effort puts an end to the craziness said pascal saint amans director of the center for tax policy at the oecd you had loopholes everywhere and nobody was taking care of that it s undermining the very goal of capitalism and a free market economy

afternoon and welcome everyone i m pleased to report a strong start to 2022 with a first quarter of solid operating results the first quarter represented several firsts for bnl including the largest first quarter of acquisition volume and strongest start to a year since we began investing in net lease real estate over 15 years ago additionally we completed our first targeted acquisition north of the border which has expanded our footprint into several very attractive new markets all across canada i will provide further details on both of these milestones in just a few moments but first i d like to touch on how our diversified strategy has uniquely positioned us to successfully navigate the current market environment and many of the challenges facing the broader net lease space following what was a historic year in net lease acquisition market during 2021 the current transaction environment remains highly competitive asset prices have generally held firm as substantial amounts of capital from private and public buyers continue to aggressively chase transactions although sustained levels of elevated inflation rising interest rates and volatility in equity markets have posed new challenges in the first few months of the year our diversified strategy positions us to flexibly navigate this dynamic environment our diversified approach to investing allows us to adapt quickly during periods where changes in cap rates lag changes in cost of capital we are able to adjust our capital allocation decisions across a wider buy box to ensure a consistent flow of acquisition opportunities that meet our evolving cost of capital and our risk adjusted returns expectations in addition a smaller asset base provides the ability to remain highly selective while still producing meaningful growth in earnings with relatively modest levels of acquisitions granular diversification successfully acted as a defensive hedge during the covid pandemic now diversification will prove to be an offensive advantage in today s market environment during the first quarter we invested 210 million in 27 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5 7 the leases include a strong weighted average lease term of 19 3 years and solid 1 5 annual rent escalations translating into a gaap cap rate of 6 4 acquisitions completed during the first quarter continue to showcase how our diversified approach to capital allocation creates a consistent pipeline of attractive opportunities despite highly competitive market dynamics acquisitions completed during q1 were more heavily weighted toward restaurant and retail at 50 and 37 respectively while industrial accounted for the remaining 13 we remain committed to sourcing and closing acquisitions across all of our core property verticals while the composition may vary from quarter to quarter we expect the overall portfolio concentration levels by property type to remain stable given the size of our existing portfolio and the composition of our current pipeline on the financing side successful capital market execution during the second half of 2021 helped to fuel this accretive growth during the first quarter capital raised as part of our inaugural public bond and follow on offerings coupled with equity issuance via our atm program in q4 allowed us to accretively transact on several high quality opportunities that i m pleased to provide additional detail on during the quarter we acquired a portfolio of 16 upscale restaurants located across 10 different states for a total of 100 million leases include weighted average annual rent escalations of 1 1 and a weighted average lease term of 19 5 years the 16 sites were diversified across four different concepts and master leased to a national operator with nearly 50 total locations and over 30 years of experience the assets are located in attractive retail corridors and exhibit strong operating metrics that translate into robust rent to sales and rent to coverage ratios we are excited to add additional restaurant exposure to the portfolio since returning to invest in the restaurant space during q4 we have thoughtfully and modestly increased our exposure from 13 to 15 of total abr through two separate restaurant portfolio transactions we also added nine retail assets in three separate transactions for a total of 83 million during the first quarter the leases include weighted average annual rent escalations of 1 9 and an average 19 4 year lease term these retail transactions include our first targeted portfolio acquisition in canada which is comprised of six high quality retail locations master leased to canada s leading retailer of outdoor recreation gear the assets are located in premier urban markets including vancouver calgary winnipeg ottawa and toronto this milestone transaction has allowed us to meaningfully expand our footprint into new markets through a high quality portfolio of scale we now own seven in canada representing 2 4 of total abr and we ll continue to evaluate select opportunities north of the border that complement our existing portfolio finally we acquired two industrial assets and transactions for a total of 27 million during the first quarter the leases include attractive weighted average annual rent escalations of 2 1 and a weighted average lease term of 18 5 years the largest of the two transactions was the sale leaseback of a food grade manufacturing facility located at minneapolis 50 of the asset footprint is dedicated to cold storage space and the site is intended small production facility for over 120 prepared food products the second industrial transaction completed during q1 was an off market acquisition of a warehouse leased to one of the largest wholesale distributors of materials in the u s the property is located just south of downtown oklahoma city we re thrilled to add both the industrial assets to our portfolio amid what has been a challenging industrial acquisition market we remain committed to maintaining our underwriting standards and continue to transact on select industrial assets such as these that fit within our overall risk return profile since quarter end we ve closed on 27 2 million of transactions and currently have over 164 million of opportunities under control which we define as executed contract or a letter of intent with a strong start to the year and a robust pipeline of opportunities i would like to reiterate our confidence in our full year 2022 acquisition guidance of 700 million to 800 million we remain intensely focused on prudent capital allocation and will continue to prove how our diversified approach to investing provides a unique advantage in the current environment our portfolio continues to perform exceptionally well with 100 of base rents collected during the first quarter and occupancy of 99 8 as of quarter end all but two of our 752 properties were subject to a lease and our properties were occupied 210 different commercial tenants with no single tenant accounted for more than 2 1 of abr our portfolio has been deliberately constructed and is uniquely positioned to weather any singular tenant credit event i ll now turn the call over to ryan to provide additional detail on our q1 2022 results recent capital market activity and our current guidance for 2022 ryan ryan albano chief financial officer thank you chris and good afternoon everyone during the first quarter we generated affo of 60 4 million or 0 35 per share which represents growth on a per share basis of approximately 13 and 3 over our q1 and q4 2021 results respectively growth in affo this quarter was largely driven by late q4 acquisitions that closed in december 2021 as well as acquisitions completed during the first quarter during the quarter we incurred total g a expenses of 8 8 million which includes 7 9 million of cash g a expenses during q1 we sold approximately 6 3 million shares of common stock at a weighted average sale price of 21 82 per share for total net proceeds of 134 3 million as of quarter end there was approximately 235 3 million of capacity remaining on our atm program equity issued via the atm during q1 will help fuel our growth objectives for the remainder of the year we ended the quarter with leverage of 5 1 times on net debt to annualized adjusted ebitdare basis consistent quarter over quarter we continue to target a conservative leverage profile of less than six times q1 equity issuance has provided the leverage capacity and liquidity to execute our current acquisition guidance and flexibly navigate the second half of 2022 without compromising the integrity of our balance sheet as i stated on our q4 earnings call we amended and restated our revolving credit facility upsizing the capacity to 1 billion extending its maturity date to march of 2026 and reducing the applicable margin to 85 basis points based on our bbb and baa2 ratings the amendment also provided for a 500 million sublimit for canadian dollar and other foreign currency borrowings which we used to fund the canadian portfolio acquisition during the first quarter for fiscal year 2022 we are reiterating our initial affo per share guidance range of between 1 38 and 1 42 which represents an implied growth rate of 6 9 at the midpoint of our guidance range over our 2021 full year results of 1 31 per share this guidance range is based on the following key assumptions acquisition volume between 700 million and 800 million which remains unchanged disposition volume between 75 million and 100 million which remains unchanged and total cash g a between 31 million and 33 million which remains unchanged as a reminder our per share results for the year are sensitive to both the timing and amount of acquisition disposition and capital markets activity that occurred throughout the year finally at our board meeting held on april 29th our directors declared a 0 27 dividend per common share and op unit to holders of record as of june 30th payable on or before july 15th this represents an increase of approximately 2 over the previous dividend rate we will continue to evaluate additional future increases to our dividend with our board on a quarterly basis with that i will turn it back over to chris for closing remarks chris czarnecki chief executive officer i m pleased with how we have started 2022 but also recognized that our work is far from complete we are focused on carrying the momentum of q1 into the remainder of 2022 and believe that our diversified strategy will continue to yield exceptional results for our shareholders on both a same store portfolio performance and external growth front i look forward to seeing many of you in person over the coming months at various industry events finally please be on the lookout for the launch of our new website our team is very excited to unveil some new pieces of content with a higher degree of user functionality and hope it will prove to be useful for all of our stakeholders this concludes our prepared remarks operator you can now open the line for questions questions answers operator thank you chris we will now take our first question from the line of john kim with bmo capital markets john your line is open unknown speaker bmo capital markets analyst hey guys good afternoon it s eric on for john maybe kind of sticking with the canadian expansion what were some of the key decisions there that helped you become more comfortable underwriting assets in the new market and then maybe going forward will canada become a bigger part of the mix in terms of portfolio chris czarnecki chief executive officer absolutely thanks for the question eric i think we have even going back to our ipo talked about potentially being more active in canada we had one side of the ipo and have continued to look at various portfolios along the way that might make sense and i ll let john talk a little bit more about future activity but where we got comfortable with this opportunity in the retail space was really just the exceptional nature of the portfolio and the opportunity that we could do something a little bit more scale than a simple one off acquisition so as we looked across the markets in an infill location and settings where there s very limited space for further development excuse me that was a really big part of it the strength of the brand the 20 lease the master lease component the solid rent growth and just being able to acquire and some really premier sites across canada in bigger markets was incredibly attractive for us and so that was a lot of what went into it in terms of the business it was very standard from a regular underwriting procedure and that was fairly straightforward but we love the individual site dynamics here with very low rent to sales and very strong rent coverage ratios and just where the brand has been going through its ownership group and what they ve been able to achieve in a relatively short period of time so for us these opportunities don t come along every day that was one where we felt like these would be cornerstone assets for us in the portfolio given their quality of build their location and then what we like about the tenant and so that s how we got comfortable with expanding the aperture a little bit to do something north of the border as we ve looked at the canadian space more detail again i ll let john jump in here but i took a good hard look at it with our board over the last couple of quarters and maybe he can tell you about where we re thinking this could going forward john moragne chief operating officer executive vice president and company secretary sure so i think canada for us is a really natural expansion of what s already a highly diversified geographic strategy relative to the portfolio and in many ways we re thinking about our opportunity in canada similar to the same opportunity in the united states we re not going to be active often in the most in the largest markets in canada but there are sort of those secondary tertiary markets that we focus on here in the u s that we ll be able to focus on in canada as well that being said i don t think anyone should expect that this is going to be a large effort by us in canada i think the most exciting part of it is in the same way that our diversified strategy differentiates us from some of the other competitors on portfolio or sale leaseback opportunities where we re able to take down maybe the entirety of a portfolio where others aren t able to do so because they don t invest in a particular vertical we now would be able to do the same thing with canada where if there was a larger portfolio sale leaseback that included some canadian assets that others may have to exclude which then makes their bid a little bit less competitive this should hopefully be a differentiator and a competitive advantage for us so we re not looking to take a big position overnight in canada we will continue to explore opportunities there but we expect it to be slow and methodical with a continued commitment to maintaining our highly diversified approach and disciplined underwriting unknown speaker bmo capital markets analyst i appreciate that and then kind of switching to pricing for a minute is there a delta between the u s and canada in terms of cap rates or are they pretty similar across the border chris czarnecki chief executive officer yes they re very similar you re looking at sort of the lower cap rates in their largest markets particularly in canada with the concentration of the population along the border and in their urban centers where there s opportunity for us outside of some transactions like this will be outside of those markets but those cap rates are pretty consistent in terms of what you re seeing in larger urban areas versus secondary markets similar to the u s unknown speaker bmo capital markets analyst all right thank you guys appreciate it thank you chris czarnecki chief executive officer thank you operator thank you john the next question is from the line of ronald kamdem of morgan stanley your line is open rosemary rivero morgan stanley analyst thank you so much you have rosemary on behalf of ronald i had a quick one on the portfolio s tenant health can you elaborate on any headwinds that you might see that your tenants placed in the near future thank you chris czarnecki chief executive officer sure rosemarie thank you i think for us we ve been in a pretty solid position for multiple quarters at this point from a rent collection perspective and is obviously the most real time indicator but our portfolio review process and just looking very granularly at each of our tenants on an annual basis through our am and credit team s lens generally we ve been pretty steady for the past year our internal watch list has just a handful of names and a few that came out in this quarter and a few that came off so nothing particularly material to talk about there i d say where we continue to focus our efforts and just making sure that we re aware of any changes that might be happening as a result of inflation or some of the labor pressures and all the topics du jour that we re all talking about and seeing regularly our discussions with tenants where they might be particularly sensitive to some of those metrics are really where we re focused from a risk management perspective and obviously you can guess where those would be on the best food side and whatnot that just tends to be where we re spending more of our time but given the performance of those assets and how they ve been able to grow sales over the pandemic and where we are today it hasn t been an overarching concern yet but that s generally where we are from a portfolio management perspective rosemary rivero morgan stanley analyst awesome thank you so much chris czarnecki chief executive officer thank you operator thank you rosemary the next question is from ki bin kim of truist your line is open unknown speaker bmo capital markets analyst hey guys you have kyle here on for ki bin i was wondering if you could kind of share what your thoughts were on the capital raising strategy for this year just given where some of the inputs there have gone chris czarnecki chief executive officer kyle would you mind repeating your question you got a little quiet there it was thoughts around and then it just it got quiet i don t know if you could kind of repeat that for us unknown speaker bmo capital markets analyst sorry yes i m just talking about if you guys were contemplating like if that raise toward the end of this year and what those interest rates would look like chris czarnecki chief executive officer ok so potential debt raise and what that would look like ok please ryan go ahead ryan albano chief financial officer sure so i think i d sort of back up in terms of what we ve accomplished so far and how it s provided flexibility as we continue to move through the year and a lot of the volatility that we re seeing in the markets and the actions that we have available i would say that as of right now we don t have a need for a debt offering this year we have contemplated whether or not there would be an opportunistic point to do so and to term out some of the debt from our revolver into a more permanent basis however we don t have the need right now and the market is clearly choppy we ve seen base rates obviously expand quite a bit and whatnot and any given week at this point it s either 20 basis points up 20 basis points down so it s really hard to say where that rate is what i guess i would say is that given the bond offering that we did last year as well as some of the revolver work and increasing our size there i think we re well positioned today that plus our leverage to be able to continue to pursue our growth objectives without having any need to go to the market anytime soon unknown speaker bmo capital markets analyst gotcha ok and i guess switching over to some of the dispositions guidance just curious if you guys could share more detail there on whether or not at some more strategic asset sales or just your general portfolio pruning chris czarnecki chief executive officer sure on the disposition front during the first quarter we sold one casual dining site that s consistent with sort of a portfolio pruning approach that we ve been applying to the casual dining and a few restaurants quick service restaurants over the past 18 months and so we do have a few of those assets out there that as we seek to tighten up our master leases and just enhance the overall portfolio quality that is flowing through and then contemplated in the disposition guidance we also anticipate selling an office asset either late q3 or q4 that s under contract and that s been contemplated in our guidance and we negotiated that late last year so sort of been locked into the initial guidance for the year and that s a little bit of a chunkier asset but that would really round out the year unknown speaker bmo capital markets analyst gotcha that s helpful operator there are no questions waiting at this time we do not have any further questions registered in our queue so i ll hand the call back over to the management team for any closing remarks chris czarnecki chief executive officer thank you very much for joining this call today we had a really strong first quarter the team is excited to continue delivering during the second quarter and executing our pipeline and i said before we look forward to seeing many of you in other events in the coming weeks and months we ll talk to you again soon thank you bye operator

record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation related fed raises interest rates by half point the most since 2000 yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses i m considering buying a house will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive how will that affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high what about auto loans fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about other rates for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does should the fed decide to raise rates by 2 percentage points or more over the next two years a distinct possibility that would significantly enlarge interest payments will i be able to earn more on my savings probably though not likely by very much and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to increase their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers this is particularly true for large banks now they ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier americans during the pandemic they won t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or cd buyers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts could be an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits still savers are starting to see some better potential returns from treasurys on tuesday the yield on the 10 year note was 2 96 after having briefly topped 3 for the first time since 2018 financial markets expect inflation to average 2 83 over 10 years that level would give investors a positive if very small return of about 0 13 all of a sudden we end up in this position where fixed income is way more competitive than it was before said jason pride chief investment officer for private wealth at glendmede
photo credit fizkes shutterstock as the u s continues to navigate the lasting ripple effects of the covid 19 pandemic key economic indicators are sending mixed messages about where the economy stands today on the positive side gdp increased by 6 9 in the last three months of 2021 and consumer spending started off strong in 2022 simultaneously year over year inflation is at record levels according to the consumer price index and the u s federal reserve is raising interest rates to slow the economy many supply chain issues from 2021 have extended into 2022 with new covid outbreaks in china the war in ukraine and high energy prices creating additional challenges the labor market provides another set of unclear signals the bureau of labor statistics reported in april 2022 that the unemployment rate had fallen to 3 6 around where it was in february 2020 before the pandemic hit the u s the great resignation has record numbers of workers leaving jobs to seek out positions that pay more or provide better working conditions but workers have more power in the economy in large part because the labor force participation rate remains below pre pandemic levels which means fewer people are available for all the jobs that are currently open additional bls data confirms the gap between open positions and hires after falling to 3 5 amid covid shutdowns in april 2020 the rate of job openings has doubled to 7 over the last two years while the rate of hiring has been above 4 higher than typical levels historically every month since may 2020 this figure has not been sufficient to keep up with the explosion of open positions and employers face even more challenges with the quit rate at around 3 meaning that they are struggling to retain employees in addition to hiring new ones but as with many aspects of the current economy the overall statistics do not tell the full story and the hiring outlook depends heavily on industry many of the sectors with the highest job openings rates have been the most challenging to work in during the pandemic leisure and hospitality businesses whose workers face low wages and greater volatility in their working conditions due to the effects of covid have a job openings rate of 10 57 the health care and social assistance industry whose workers have been on the front lines of the pandemic has a job openings rate of 8 73 in comparison the total nonfarm rate is 6 97 and in fields like construction and real estate the rate is below 5 00 the rate of openings is also dependent on geography at the high end alaska 9 00 and hawaii 8 60 have the highest job openings rates which may in part be due to the difficulty of recruiting labor to their more remote locations in contrast states with rapid economic growth like washington 6 13 and texas 6 47 or with denser populations like new york 6 17 and connecticut 6 20 have lower rates of openings the data used in this analysis is from the u s bureau of labor statistics

stocks rallied on wednesday after the federal reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point but ruled out lifting them by larger amounts going forward the fed is waging a tough fight against inflation delivering on wednesday its biggest rate hike in more than two decades but investors were relieved after fed chair jerome powell said policymakers weren t contemplating hikes larger than half a percentage point at a time even as he made clear the fed will continue to raise interest rates fears the fed would be especially aggressive rocked markets last week sending shares sharply lower a 75 basis point increase is not something that the committee is actively considering powell told reporters when asked if the fed would consider raising rates by three quarters of a percentage point the dow ended the day up by more than 900 points and the s p 500 gained almost 3 percent with both notching their best day since 2020 still the fed made clear fighting inflation remains its top priority after consumer prices have surged by the most in 40 years powell said he and his colleagues would actively consider two additional half point rate increases at their next two meetings in june and july jim watson afp via getty images afp via getty images fed chair jerome powell takes questions during a news conference in washington d c on wednesday the fed earlier raised interest rates by half a percentage point its biggest hike in more than two decades the economy s uncertain future it s not only inflation the fed is facing great economic uncertainty from the war in ukraine to china s ongoing crackdown after a covid outbreak in a note to investors bank of america global research said the central bank had clearly signaled its intention to be aggressive fighting inflation but that that at least it s likely done surprising markets for a while markets are likely to remain concerned the fed could overdo its interest rate hikes tipping the economy into a recession but powell expressed optimism that the central bank can curb inflation without stalling economic growth i would say we have a good chance to have a soft or soft ish landing powell said on wednesday copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
here are some questions and answers about what the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive related articles fed raises key rate by a half point most aggressive move since 2000 how will rising mortgage rates affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about credit card rates and other interest rates for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does should the fed decide to raise rates by 2 percentage points or more over the next two years a distinct possibility that would significantly enlarge interest payments will i be able to earn more on my savings probably though not likely by very much and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to increase their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers this is particularly true for large banks now they ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier americans during the pandemic they won t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or cd buyers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts could be an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits still savers are starting to see some better potential returns from treasurys on tuesday the yield on the 10 year note was 2 96 after having briefly topped 3 for the first time since 2018 financial markets expect inflation to average 2 83 over 10 years that level would give investors a positive if very small return of about 0 13 all of a sudden we end up in this position where fixed income is way more competitive than it was before said jason pride chief investment officer for private wealth at glendmede ___

washington dc may 4 2022 the federal reserve intensified its fight against the worst inflation in 40 years by raising its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point wednesday its most aggressive move since 2000 and signaling further large rate hikes to come the increase in the fed s key short term rate raised it to a range of 0 75 to 1 the highest point since the pandemic struck two years ago the fed also announced that it will start reducing its huge 9 trillion balance sheet made up mainly of treasury and mortgage bonds reducing those holdings will have the effect of further raising loan costs throughout the economy with prices for food energy and consumer goods accelerating the fed s goal is to cool spending and economic growth by making it more expensive for individuals and businesses to borrow the central bank hopes that higher costs for mortgages credit cards and auto loans will slow spending enough to tame inflation yet not so much as to cause a recession it will be a delicate balancing act the fed has endured widespread criticism that it was too slow to start tightening credit and many economists are skeptical that it can avoid causing a recession speaking at a news conference wednesday chair jerome powell made clear that further large rate hikes are coming he said that additional half point increases in the fed s key rate should be on the table in the next couple of meetings in june and july but powell also sought to downplay any speculation that the fed might be considering a rate hike as high as three quarters of a percentage point a 75 basis point hike is not something that the committee is actively considering he said a remark that appeared to cause stock indexes to jump before he spoke the dow jones industrial average had risen modestly less than an hour later the dow was up 700 plus points at his news conference powell stressed his belief that restoring price stability that is curbing high inflation is essential to sustaining the economy s health in their statement wednesday the central bank s policymakers noted that russia s invasion of ukraine is worsening inflation pressures by raising oil and food prices it added that covid related lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions which could further boost inflation inflation according to the fed s preferred gauge reached 6 6 last month the highest point in four decades inflation has been accelerated by a combination of robust consumer spending chronic supply bottlenecks and sharply higher gas and food prices exacerbated by russia s war against ukraine starting june 1 the fed said it would allow up to 48 billion in bonds to mature without replacing them a pace that would reach 95 billion by september at september s pace its balance sheet would shrink by about 1 trillion a year the balance sheet more than doubled after the pandemic recession hit as the fed bought trillions in bonds to try to hold down long term borrowing rates powell has said he wants to quickly raise the fed s rate to a level that neither stimulates nor restrains economic growth fed officials have suggested that they will reach that point which the fed says is about 2 4 by year s end some economists warn that some of the factors fueling inflation notably shortages of supplies and workers are outside the fed s ability to solve the fed can t fix supply side challenges with higher interest rates said jim baird chief investment officer at plante moran financial advisors fed tightening doesn t re open chinese factories increase grain shipments from ukraine re position container ships to where they are needed or hire truckers to move goods the fed s credit tightening is already having some effect on the economy sales of existing homes sank 2 7 from february to march reflecting a surge in mortgage rates related in part to the fed s planned rate hikes the average rate on a 30 year mortgage has jumped 2 percentage points just since the start of the year to 5 1 yet by most measures the overall economy remains healthy this is especially true of the u s job market hiring is strong layoffs are few unemployment is near a five decade low and the number of job openings has reached a record high powell has pointed to the widespread availability of jobs as evidence that the labor market is tight to an unhealthy level that would tend to fuel inflation the fed char is betting that higher rates can reduce those openings which would presumably slow wage increases and ease inflationary pressures without triggering mass layoffs for now with hiring robust the economy has added at least 400 000 jobs for 11 straight months and employers grappling with labor shortages wages are rising at a roughly 5 annual pace those pay raises are driving steady consumer spending despite spiking prices in march consumers increased their spending 0 2 even after adjusting for inflation even if the fed s benchmark rate were to go as high as 2 5 by year s end powell said last month the policymakers may still tighten credit further to a level that would restrain growth if that turns out to be appropriate financial markets are pricing in a rate as high as 3 6 by mid 2023 which would be the highest in 15 years shrinking the fed s balance sheet will add another layer of uncertainty surrounding how much the fed s actions may weaken the economy complicating the fed s task is a slowdown in global growth covid 19 lockdowns in china are threatening to cause a recession in the world s second largest economy and the european union is facing higher energy prices and supply chain disruptions after russia s invasion of ukraine what s more other central banks around the world are also raising rates a trend that could further imperil global growth on thursday the bank of england is expected to raise its key rate for the fourth straight time the reserve bank of australia increased its rate tuesday for the first time in 11 years and the european central bank which is grappling with slower growth than in the united states or the united kingdom may raise rates in july economists expect ap
the federal reserve helped the us economy through the covid 19 pandemic by dropping rates to near zero now the fed is facing new challenge crushing inflation without bringing on recession it s hard to catch up when you have to go very fast it s also hard to catch up when you actually have to push monetary policy to tight setting coming up with so called soft landing could be difficult in part because the jobs market is booming and increasing the interest rate will likely change that this is situation where wages have moved up at the highest rate in in very long time and people are able to quit their jobs and move to better paying jobs the unemployment rate in the us is at 3 6 according to the bureau of labor statistics which is considered full employment by the fed they have to push up the unemployment rate and in the past when you pushed up the unemployment rate you ve almost never been able to avoid full fledged recession the central bank raised rates by quarter of percentage point in march but some say that wasn t soon enough they wanted to start late because they wanted to see they kind of get the full employment but i think that s going to turn out in retrospect to have been policy mistake they should have gone little bit sooner in terms of removing monetary policy accommodation i m john lawrence reporting advertisement federal reserve raises key rate by a half point

prior year this decline was primarily due to the exit of the wood treatment business and an increase in the cost of a key raw material in the pipeline and industrial materials pim business was 40 8

or 33 5 of revenue in the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda margin1 increase was due to the benefit from higher revenue from all businesses in the segment global price increases implemented

achieving additional r d progress to drive profitability improvement during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 the company successfully completed its exit of the wood treatment business adjusted ebitda was 13 9 million or 28 0 of revenue1 compared to 18 8 million or 39 1 of revenue1 in the same quarter last year the adjusted ebitda decline was primarily the result of the exit of the wood treatment business and an increase in the cost of a key raw material in the pim business please refer to the financial table below titled segment revenue and adjusted ebitda for more information current financial guidance the company currently expects electronic materials revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 to be up low single digits compared to revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 primarily because the company completed its exit of the wood treatment business in the second quarter of 2022 performance materials revenue is expected to be down approximately 20 in the third

full fiscal year 2022 guidance which includes adjusted ebitda1 to be between 355 million to 385 million depreciation and amortization to be between 50 million to 55 million interest expense to be between 38 million to 40 million tax rate to be between 20 to 23 and capital spending to be between 60 million to 80 million the company s outlook includes its completed exit of the wood treatment business which is expected to negatively impact adjusted ebitda by approximately 36 million compared to fiscal 2021 the company expects to generally offset this impact with organic growth as well as with the initial impact of the future forward program additionally for fiscal year 2022 the global pricing actions taken are expected to largely offset the increased costs for raw materials freight and logistics the company continues to evaluate further pricing actions to mitigate additional inflationary headwinds as needed for additional details on the company s exit of the wood treatment

stocks rallied on wednesday after the federal reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point but ruled out lifting them by larger amounts going forward the fed is waging a tough fight against inflation delivering on wednesday its biggest rate hike in more than two decades but investors were relieved after fed chair jerome powell said policymakers weren t contemplating hikes larger than half a percentage point at a time even as he made clear the fed will continue to raise interest rates fears the fed would be especially aggressive rocked markets last week sending shares sharply lower a 75 basis point increase is not something that the committee is actively considering powell told reporters when asked if the fed would consider raising rates by three quarters of a percentage point the dow ended the day up by more than 900 points and the s p 500 gained almost 3 percent with both notching their best day since 2020 still the fed made clear fighting inflation remains its top priority after consumer prices have surged by the most in 40 years powell said he and his colleagues would actively consider two additional half point rate increases at their next two meetings in june and july jim watson afp via getty images afp via getty images fed chair jerome powell takes questions during a news conference in washington d c on wednesday the fed earlier raised interest rates by half a percentage point its biggest hike in more than two decades the economy s uncertain future it s not only inflation the fed is facing great economic uncertainty from the war in ukraine to china s ongoing crackdown after a covid outbreak in a note to investors bank of america global research said the central bank had clearly signaled its intention to be aggressive fighting inflation but that that at least it s likely done surprising markets for a while markets are likely to remain concerned the fed could overdo its interest rate hikes tipping the economy into a recession but powell expressed optimism that the central bank can curb inflation without stalling economic growth i would say we have a good chance to have a soft or soft ish landing powell said on wednesday copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video here are some questions and answers about what the federal reserve s aggressive interest rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses washington record low mortgages below 3 are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally receive a yield high enough to top inflation the substantial half point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have much immediate effect on most americans finances but additional large hikes are expected to be announced at the fed s next two meetings in june and july and economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result could be much higher borrowing costs for households well into the future as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and thereby slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects doing so could tip the u s economy into recession here are some questions and answers about what the rate hikes could mean for consumers and businesses will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence mortgage rates have jumped 2 full percentage points just since the year began to 5 1 on average for a 30 year fixed mortgage according to freddie mac in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate to as high as 3 5 by mid 2023 as many economists expect the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive related articles fed raises key rate by a half point most aggressive move since 2000 how will rising mortgage rates affect the housing market if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that s unlikely to change anytime soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace the surge in mortgage rates will temper the pace of home price appreciation as more would be homebuyers are priced out said greg mcbride chief financial analyst for bankrate still the number of available homes remains historically low a trend that will likely frustrate buyers and keep prices high will auto loans get more expensive fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes said alex yurchenko chief data officer for black book which monitors u s vehicle prices because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too for now new vehicle loans average about 4 5 used vehicle rates are about 5 what about credit card rates and other interest rates for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does should the fed decide to raise rates by 2 percentage points or more over the next two years a distinct possibility that would significantly enlarge interest payments will i be able to earn more on my savings probably though not likely by very much and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to increase their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers this is particularly true for large banks now they ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier americans during the pandemic they won t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or cd buyers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts could be an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits still savers are starting to see some better potential returns from treasurys on tuesday the yield on the 10 year note was 2 96 after having briefly topped 3 for the first time since 2018 financial markets expect inflation to average 2 83 over 10 years that level would give investors a positive if very small return of about 0 13 all of a sudden we end up in this position where fixed income is way more competitive than it was before said jason pride chief investment officer for private wealth at glendmede ___
