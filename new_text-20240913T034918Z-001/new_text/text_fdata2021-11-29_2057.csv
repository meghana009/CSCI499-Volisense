a covid 19 variant spreading in south africa was dubbed omicron and classified a variant of concern by the world health organization on friday as the u s and other nations reacted to the newly discovered variant with travel restrictions experts with the world health organization met friday to assess the variant which appears to have a high number of mutations in the virus spike protein prompting worries about how easily it will spread while good data on the risks of omicron is likely weeks away the organization cited early evidence suggesting an increased risk of reinfection the u s said it will restrict travel from south africa as well as botswana zimbabwe namibia lesotho eswatini mozambique and malawi according to a statement from senior officials from the biden administration

the new rules mean no travel to or from the designated countries except for returning u s citizens and permanent residents who test negative infection rates in south africa have increased steeply coinciding with the detection of the variant according to a friday statement from the who the first omicron case was reported to the agency from south africa on nov 24 and the number of cases of the variant are increasing in almost all south african provinces the who said while omicron is now in the same category as the delta variant the extent of the public health threat the new variant will pose is unclear the beta variant was classified a variant of concern but did not spread as far as initially expected the who urged countries to increase surveillance of omicron cases and genome sequencing efforts to better understand its potential impact biden said the emergence of omicron emphasizes the importance of vaccinations and urged americans to get their booster shots as soon as possible the new variant has also been found in botswana and hong kong in travelers from south africa according to joe phaahla the nation s health minister phaahla said the variant has seen rapid spread in gauteng the country s most populous province several nations including germany italy the united kingdom the netherlands the czech republic and japan have responded to news of the variant by moving friday to restrict air travel from several southern african countries the european union which is made up of 27 nations is also recommending a ban on flights from southern african countries

reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines but moderna has already announced a three point strategy to combat the new variant omicron s mutations could possibly reduce current vaccines effectiveness but are unlikely to eliminate their benefit according to dr ashish jha dean of brown university s school of public health there are a series of mutations in key regions that may impact effectiveness of our vaccines tweeted jha on friday render vaccines useless no super unlikely moderna s strategy involves three options for boosting covid 19 vaccination should omicron prove problematic for current vaccines the three options according to a friday release from the company a higher dose booster shots currently being studied that are designed to anticipate mutations such as those that have emerged in the omicron variant and an omicron specific booster which is already in the works andy slavitt who previously served as president joe biden s white house senior adviser for covid response said in a tweet that both moderna and pfizer biontech have estimated a vaccine to combat a new variant could be developed in about 3 months with some regulatory and logistical hurtles to follow if we start in early december new vaccines could be available by summer in much of the world slavitt tweeted multiple media organizations on friday reported pfizer biontech is studying the new variant and expects data within weeks if warranted a targeted vaccine could be developed within 6 weeks and ship within 100 days the reports say johnson johnson is also testing its current vaccine against omicron according to cnbc it s coming new york braces for omicron hospitals already strained new york gov kathy hochul on friday announced an executive order intended to boost hospital capacity and address staffing shortages a move that comes amid growing concerns about hospital beds and staffing hospitalizations have already risen sharply recently in much of the state and could soar higher if omicron proves to be as highly transmissible as some fear the variant has not yet been detected in new york it s coming hochul said in a statement friday her order allows the state health department to limit non essential surgeries if needed to ensure capacity the governor said the order also will allow the state to acquire critical supplies more quickly hospitals in other areas of the country are already stretched thin amid a spike in cases on wednesday the federal government said it would send 44 military medical staffers to michigan to help beleaguered hospitals treat covid 19 patients amid a fourth surge that is the worst in the country facing hospitals filling up with covid patients needing lengthy stays massachusetts gov charlie baker said tuesday any hospital or hospital system facing limited capacity to care for patients will be required to reduce non essential non urgent scheduled procedures beginning monday the associated press fda merck covid pill effective experts will review safety federal health regulators say an experimental covid 19 pill from merck is effective against the virus but they will seek input from outside experts on risks of birth defects and other potential problems during pregnancy the food and drug administration posted its analysis of the pill ahead of a public meeting next week where academic and other experts will weigh in on its safety and effectiveness the agency isn t required to follow the group s advice the fda scientists said their review identified several potential risks including possible toxicity and birth defects given those risks the fda will ask its advisers whether the drug should never be given during pregnancy or whether it could be made available in certain cases under that scenario the fda said the drug would carry warnings about risks during pregnancy but doctors would still have the option to prescribe it in certain cases where its benefits could outweigh its risks for patients given the safety concerns fda said merck agreed the drug would not be used in children additionally the fda flagged a concern that merck s drug led to small changes in the coronavirus signature spike protein which it uses to penetrate human cells theoretically fda cautioned those changes could lead to dangerous new variants regulators also noted that merck collected far less safety data overall on its drug than was gathered for other covid 19 therapies fda will ask its independent advisers to discuss all those issues and then vote on whether the drug s overall benefits outweigh its risks the associated press

a u s parks and wildlife officer releases a captive bred black footed ferret into a prairie dog burrow on wednesday nov 17 at may ranch in lamar black footed ferrets were assumed to be extinct until 1981 when a dog discovered one in wyoming olivia sun the colorado sun amar somewhere between the comforts of a plastic tote outfitted with clean shredded paper and a bloody quarter of a prairie dog for snacks and the yawning dark hole he was being tipped into as hawks circled above north america s rarest mammal had the genetic weight of the world on its furry shoulders black footed ferret no 10 166 clung desperately to the inside of a black pvc tube the tawny kit appeared reluctant to dive into a lonely prairie dog hole five hours drive from the breeding center near the wyoming border and take on the responsibility of restoring a species thought extinct until 1981 it chattered like a psychotic dolphin alternately retreating and lunging at the heavy leather gloves of the handler elsewhere on the unplowed shortgrass prairies of sprawling may ranch 14 other kits were about to go down other holes colorado has spent eight years tipping 500 ferrets into the abodes of surprised prairie dogs biologists still can t tell how many of the shy nocturnal creatures have reproduced between the plague relentless development and roving coyotes they won t call black footed ferrets officially reestablished until no 10 166 and its half siblings have a lot more babies state and federal biologists are so eager to throw more genetic material at the ferret puzzle that they cloned one born in december and now revered around the world as elizabeth ann she s not breeding yet they re letting elizabeth ann sort out some personal stuff at a compound at the national black footed ferret conservation center northeast of wellington that s the same place no 10 166 and a few dozen other kits got live prairie dogs tossed inside their walls for some practice same place the kits were handed the travel size snacks of prairie dog parts to cushion their long drive down to lamar the kit poised above the hole near a creek on the may ranch was marked as the 10 166th black footed ferret nurtured to life since biologists from the u s fish and wildlife service and other partners became matchmakers for the mustelid family in the 1980s ferrets are a key balance in north american prairie life they keep prairie dog populations manageable with vampire length cuspids yes but still it s important the prairie dogs when they re not dying of plague help keep soil healthy and they reluctantly provide homes for burrowing owls when burrowing owls don t want prairie dogs to repossess their homes they make a sound that imitates a rattlesnake rattlesnakes and owls keep the mice from getting uppity circle of life and all that scientists had assumed wild ferrets were extinct since the 1950s those ferrets that weird guy at your college led around on a leash are domestic ferrets they are paradoxically imported not the same at all then a wyoming dog dropped a dead but fascinating package on its owner s doorstep turned out to be a black footed ferret the dog s name was shep because of course it was biologists fanned out and captured a colony of about 15 wild ferrets only seven kept breeding and so the genetic stock of no 10 166 and every other before him are well the polite word is undifferentiated clinging to his car carrier the genes of no 10 166 could use a little more protection before diving into his late afternoon hunt for survival the biologists visiting lamar this week think they found some hiking across the lamar fields with ferret carriers in hand colorado biologists were excited to see little turquoise poops around the prairie dog holes they ve been dropping blue green plague vaccine pellets down the holes with no idea if they were getting eaten this week the rainbow feces proved their recipe was becoming a local favorite with all the trouble all the federal state private nonprofit funding all the science all the prairie dog snacks a guest at the may ranch watched no 10 166 contemplating his fate and asked how much the chattering kit might be worth price tag 5 000 to 10 000 was the quick answer whenever cost comes up u s fish wildlife and its partners like the colorado division of parks and wildlife are quick to mention another number 130 that s the number of plant animal and insect species that depend on a healthy competitive ferret v prairied dog endless death match prairie dogs eat 90 plants black footed ferrets eat 90 prairie dogs a black footed ferret looks out from a prairie dog burrow after its release ferrets are released in autumn months to simulate when kits usually leave their mothers olivia sun the colorado sun so the guests have to ask as the ferret carriers are poised ominously over the prairie dog holes is it a fair fight colorado ferret wrangler tina jackson thinks for a moment adult ferrets and prairie dogs are the same size she notes so that seems a little fair also the prairie dogs take advantage of having the day shift when they come across one of their holes where they sniff out a sleeping nocturnal ferret they bury it the ferrets eventually dig out but doesn t that seem kind of fair grunts emanate from pete gober of the u s fish and wildlife service standing nearby it s the grunt of a man who has raised ferrets to be their fully realized selves and maybe thinks the prairie dogs need to suck it up buttercup fair gober blurts what s fair in wildlife weary of the daytime shyness and existential angst of no 10 166 state biologist jonathan reitz pulled out a pry bar in the form of an old deer antler you can t take the danger out of endangered species but you can take the ferret out of the cage reitz pried the black pvc tube over the lip of the car carrier and suddenly the ferret was splaying all fours at the end of the tube in order not to drop like a first time parachutist in an airplane doorway a few more chatters and down it went disappearing into the hole reitz tossed the ferret s bloody chewed over car snack down the hole as a little housewarming gift and suddenly a bunch of nearby prairie dogs were texting each other wtf just happened to honor those prairie dog feelings it would be full disclosure to mention right about here that black footed ferrets have the largest canine tooth to skull ratio of any living mammal reitz and other handlers wore masks perhaps to protect the precious hothouse creatures from covid 19 or perhaps to protect their noses from becoming a snack so now what the biologists are asked the state s top scientists have just this week dumped a quarter million dollars of research down a bunch of humble prairie dog holes from pueblo to the wyoming border black footed ferrets spend at least 23 hours a day underground will they at least call home on thanksgiving who knows jackson laughs we might not see them for three months each ferret has a chip like the kind you can put under your dog s neck fur but you have to find them first the hand held chip readers only work within a couple of feet the may family hosting the ferrets will look out for signs of living or deceased kits and the biologists will come back in the spring hoping to discover breeding pairs or at the very least survival fingers crossed these guys do well over the winter jackson said a female ferret needs 30 to 40 acres of territory all to herself to find enough prairie dogs to survive they eat a whole one every couple of days overall colorado needs 50 000 acres of healthy prairie dog territory to support the 250 wild ferrets it wants to see as an established population neither home developers nor most farmers want prairie dogs in colorado they dig holes that break ankles and ruin machinery nosh on valuable crops and draw coyotes the may ranch is a dryland operation doesn t irrigate or till so the prairie dogs are fine with them dallas may was excited to open the gates for ferrets he thinks should have been here all along for us it s a different philosophy that we want the prairie dogs we want coyotes we want rattlesnakes we want black footed ferrets we want what is there to be there we want what isn t there that s supposed to be there to come in he said the may ranch has seen no rain for three months and dust from pickup trucks can roll like a storm cloud but as an early golden hour crept across the short grass and toward the scattered cottonwoods on a mid november day the 15 000 acres took on the glow of promise ferret no 10 169 decided to enjoy the sunset above ground rather than explore the underground colony the vip buses headed back to the may barn and the biologists settled into an optimism that their latest effort might actually take hold some wildlife groups estimate that despite all the hard work only 300 black footed ferrets survive in the wild world wide the key is that when you re starting from extinct any sign of life after that is gravy maybe the rolling natural wonders of the arkansas river corridor would please the new homeowners maybe the peanut butter flavored rainbow pellets would hold off the plague maybe the badger that lived in the extra large hole they d just walked past would ignore its ferret cousins for a while instead of eating them this is what we do in the southeast corner one wildlife officer said after tilting ferret no 10 168 into a new life just as the sun dropped below the horizon lower people s expectations and then jump right over them the colorado sun is a reader

fears over the omicron variant of the coronavirus have spread across the globe within days of its discovery sending stocks tumbling prompting travel restrictions and drawing international attention to an uptick in cases in south africa the international reaction is happening weeks faster than the sluggish response to the delta variant by the time delta was named a variant of concern by the world health organization in may 2021 it had already spread in india for months and had been seeded across the globe in contrast omicron was first reported to the who on tuesday as covid 19 cases in south africa spiked to thousands per day by friday it had been named and labeled a variant of concern the most serious type with omicron s high number of mutations experts have raised yet unanswered questions about the risk of reinfection for people who have been vaccinated or previously infected with other variants experts have applauded the who for moving quickly to sound the alarm on omicron and south africa for its fast transparent reporting on the variant that will kickstart studies over the next few weeks into its contagiousness virulence and immune escape which is its ability to resist an immune response from prior infections or from vaccines emergency physician and public health professor at george washington university dr leana wen said the level of alarm at this point is completely appropriate wen told usa today i would much rather that we take action and then find out that actually this variant does respond very well to the vaccines that we have early data is troubling but incomplete experts say the outbreak of the omicron variant in south africa was like a vertical line according to dr eric topol vice president for research at scripps research in la jolla california we haven t seen anything like that he told usa today the line of slope is much higher than the initial delta line topol said the number of concerning mutations to the virus may make it more contagious than previous variants and that it is likely to have evolved in an immunocompromised person also in the news the cdc issued a level 4 advisory its highest due to very high covid levels in eight african countries a level that carries an avoid travel designation the state department also raised the countries to level 4 which means do not travel the who says it skipped two letters in the greek alphabet nu and xi in naming the new variant omicron because nu is too easily confused with the word new and because xi is a common last name according to a statement from the agency the cdc this week dropped its percentage of vaccinated adults in pennsylvania by nearly five percentage points to 68 9 from 73 7 in what apparently was a data correction to weed out duplicates the world trade organization is postponing its conference of government ministers set to open tuesday after switzerland initiated new travel restrictions following the emergence of omicron stocks sank friday with the dow jones industrial average briefly falling more than 1 000 points as investors reacted to news of omicron today s numbers the u s has recorded more than 48 million confirmed covid 19 cases and more than 776 000 deaths according to johns hopkins university data global totals more than 260 9 million cases and more than 5 1 million deaths more than 196 1 million americans roughly 59 of the

germany france belgium israel hong kong canada and the uk united kingdom health secretary sajid javid confirmed saturday that two people tested positive for the omicron variant in nottingham and chelmsford a southeastern english town he added the cases were related to travel from southern africa in germany the max von pettenkofer institute a munich based microbiology center said the omicron variant was confirmed in two travelers who arrived on a flight from south africa on nov 24 the french ministry of health announced eight possible cases of the omicron variant on sunday two cases were discovered in canada after travelers returned from nigeria according to the ontario government authorities in the netherlands are working to see if 61 people who tested positive for covid 19 after arriving on flights from south africa have the omicron variant the czech republic also detected a suspected omicron case in a person who spent time in namibia the guardian reported an italian man who previously traveled to mozambique on business landed in rome on nov 11 and returned to his home near naples he and five family members tested positive and the omicron variant was confirmed by sacco hospital in milan the man had been vaccinated italy s national health institute said there are likely already undiscovered cases in the u s dr eric topol told usa today a concern echoed by presidential medical adviser dr anthony fauci in a saturday nbc interview we have not detected it yet but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you re having travel related cases they ve noted in other places already when you have a virus like this it almost invariably is going to go all over fauci said fauci called president joe biden s decision to restrict travel from south africa and other countries in the region prudent and told americans not to panic but to take the variant seriously as health experts learn more about omicron he also urged vaccinations adding that booster shots give a very very important edge in warding off the virus including potentially dangerous variants scientists wait for answers to key questions about the omicron variant including key questions that remain unanswered ashish k jha dean of brown university s school of public health noted three metrics for evaluating the potential effect of a variant in a twitter thread if the new variant is more transmissible than the current predominant variant if the variant causes more severe disease and if it will render prior infections or vaccines less effective all these questions remain largely unanswered though jha said it is super unlikely that the variant will render vaccines useless experts say it may take weeks to know if current vaccines are less effective against omicron epidemiologist ce line gounder estimated it may take about two weeks to make this determination gounder said in a twitter thread that scientists don t yet know how omicron may compare to delta in terms of how infectious it is and its incubation period what s happening in south africa as omicron spreads in two weeks south africa has gone from low transmission rates to rapid growth in new cases the spike in cases happened after a cluster of infections among university students in pretoria one of the country s capital cities grew to hundreds then thousands spreading to johannesburg south africa s largest city scientists say the new variant is likely responsible for as many as 90 of the new cases according to south africa s health officials the variant has also quickly infected young south africans reflecting a shift in the demographic profile of covid 19 patients young people in their 20s to just over their late 30s are coming in with moderate to severe disease some needing intensive care rudo mathivha head of the intensive care unit at soweto s baragwanath hospital told an online press briefing some are vaccinated but few are fully vaccinated mathivha said despite the country s case numbers remaining relatively low with 2 828 new confirmed cases friday mathivha urged hospitals to have critical care beds ready in case of the worst case scenario that omicron has a similar effect as delta mathivha also encouraged vaccinations about 40 of south african adults are currently vaccinated and vaccination rates are lower among younger adults omicron s impact on vaccines unclear but contingency plans rolling out health experts have said it will likely be weeks before the world has good data about how omicron may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines but moderna has already announced a three point strategy to combat the new variant moderna says its strategy for responding to omicron involves three options for boosting covid 19 vaccination should the variant prove problematic for current vaccines the three options according to a friday release from the company a higher dose booster shots currently being studied that are designed to anticipate mutations such as those that have emerged in the omicron variant and an omicron specific booster which is already in the works andy slavitt who previously served as biden s white house senior adviser for covid response said in a tweet that both moderna and pfizer biontech have estimated a vaccine to combat a new variant could be developed in about 3 months with some regulatory and logistical hurtles to follow if we start in early december new vaccines could be available by summer in much of the world slavitt tweeted multiple media organizations on friday reported pfizer biontech is studying the new variant and expects data within weeks if warranted a targeted vaccine could be developed within 6 weeks and ship within 100 days the reports say johnson johnson is also testing its current vaccine against omicron according to cnbc professor andrew pollard director of the oxford vaccine group told bbc radio he was cautiously optimistic existing covid vaccines would be effective in preventing serious illness from the omicron variant adding that mutations in omicron appear to be in similar regions as the mutations in other variants that tells you that despite those mutations existing in other variants the vaccines have continued to prevent serious disease as we ve moved through alpha beta gamma and delta pollard whose team developed the astrazeneca vaccines said at least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new variant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed joel shannon usa today the associated press with identification of omicron are more travel restrictions ahead just when things were looking up for airlines and the rest of the travel industry another covid 19 variant has emerged early reports of the omicron variant instantly sparked restrictions on travel the united states which lifted a pandemic long travel ban from dozens of international countries including south africa on nov 8 on monday will reinstitute the ban for foreign nationals from eight african countries the cdc issued a level 4 advisory its highest due to very high covid 19 levels a level that carries an avoid travel designation the state department whose covid 19 advisories generally parallel the cdc s also raised the countries to level 4 which means do not travel we re going to be cautious make sure there is no travel to and from south africa and six other countries in that region except for american citizens who are able to come back biden said friday read more on what travelers need to know about the new restrictions and the potential impact on travel in the months ahead if the omicron variant spreads rapidly across the globe dawn

bloomberg former advisers to president joe biden said travel restrictions will do little to stop the spread of new covid 19 variants and the u s and other nations would be better off increasing vaccine deliveries to africa biden last week imposed a broad entry ban on people who have been in south africa and seven nearby countries seeking to halt the spread of the omicron variant the european union the u k canada and others have imposed similar measures biden s ban kicks in monday while political leaders gravitate to border closures as a way to take immediate action medical experts tend to say that partial closures are typically ineffective in part because they affect only a sliver of travel volume andy slavitt who served as a covid 19 adviser to biden for several months this year is among the critics and said energy should instead be focused on inoculations in africa banning travel hasn t seemed to be anything close to panacea slavitt tweeted on friday and it punishes countries and their economies who make and report discoveries he added saturday a far better response would be the mass shipment of hundreds of millions of vaccines to the area south africa s discovery of the variant triggered a market sell off on friday airlines sank and the s p 500 closed 2 3 lower the biggest one day drop since february middle east stocks tumbled on sunday even as south african health officials said initial omicron cases have been mild anthony fauci biden s chief medical adviser said sunday that travel bans would never completely prevent a highly transmissible virus from entering the country but what you can do is you can delay it enough to get us better prepared he said on abc s this week francis collins head of the national institutes of health told fox news sunday that travelers entering the u s still must be tested and foreigners entering the u s must be vaccinated he called the curbs a temporary measure this is just the best advice of the public health experts and you ll notice other countries like the u k and the e u are doing the same he said we re not going to say this is going to be there for a long time to block travel from those countries where we know omicron is already spreading the white house when asked for comment referred to the remarks by fauci and collins still the measure was criticized as modestly effective at best italy s first known omicron carrier for instance arrived two weeks ago had a negative test before his flight and moved around italy for days before his diagnosis travel bans have not been very effective this entire pandemic peter hotez a professor and dean of tropical medicine at baylor college of medicine told cnn i think much more productive than travel bans would be refocusing our energies on trying to vaccinate southern africa celine gounder a physician who served as a covid 19 adviser to the biden transition team said the bans announced by biden on friday were too slow and have massive loopholes that includes a lack of bans on belgium and other countries where cases have been detected and that u s citizens are exempt she said rick bright a former head of the u s biomedical advanced research and development authority who also advised the transition team echoed that porous travel bans will do very little to slow the spread of an airborne virus replay the tape bright who now heads the rockefeller foundation s pandemic prevention institute tweeted on sunday the u s and world should be getting vaccine and resources to vaccinate people across africa biden said friday that the move was precautionary he called on other nations to boost donations and support a u s call for an intellectual property waiver for covid 19 vaccines the u s has pledged donations of over 1 billion doses of vaccines by mid 2022 but hasn t pledged anything new for africa since omicron s emergence can t hide biden dismissed a question on friday about whether travel restrictions discourage countries from coming forward about new variants i d say that s ridiculous because you can t hide the variants he said in nantucket where he spent the thanksgiving holiday with his family it s not like someone could hide the fact that there s a new variant with people getting sick more quickly gounder disagreed when we punish countries e g south africa who ve been scientifically transparent and collaborative how do we think they and others e g china will behave in the future she tweeted slavitt said testing people on arrival and requiring quarantine for positive cases is sensible the u s measures reimposed country based restrictions that were abandoned earlier this month in favor of a system based on whether a traveler is vaccinated or not regardless of which country they were coming from or recently visited the u s now has a hybrid system that leaves it largely open to vaccinated foreigners and fully open to citizens while banning anyone vaccinated or not who has been in the eight african countries within the past two weeks 2021 bloomberg l p

the boudoir box stands at 69 centimeters tall and 33 centimeters wide covered in black leather its front panels swing open to the sides transforming it into three vertical panels a triptych on the left panel is a tasselled leather whip necklace with a sterling silver handle on the right a champagne coloured ostrich feather also with a sterling silver handle and on the middle panel is a display of 19 jewel tools as their creator calls them among them are sterling silver nipple clamps petting rings dilettos to name a few designed by industrial designer metalsmith sexologist and self described sexual anthropologist betony vernon in 2000 the box and its contents which straddle the worlds of art jewellery design and erotica stayed hidden from the public for its first 17 years of existence it was designed to transport and display betony vernon s paradise found fine erotic jewelry and jewel tool collections to her private collectors in may 2017 it was unveiled to the public for the first time at the museum of modern art paris as part of medusa which the museum describes as an exhibition taking a contemporary and unprecedented look at jewellery unveiling a number of taboos it was exactly a month before the opening of medusa that by chance i found myself in eden vernon s private showroom and residence in paris marais neighbourhood my partner an artist was exhibiting work in the city a mutual acquaintance who was working with vernon at the time had invited him to meet vernon for a candid chat about her upcoming exhibition unwittingly i tagged along we sat in the downstairs pale pink basement of eden named heaven where vernon had created a space that was not only home to her boudoir box and her jewel tools but a sensual oasis in the middle of the city where she could conduct her salons and workshops with her clients besides her private collectors the people that saw the boudoir box were people who attended my salons when i was teaching in london at the turn of the century including the author of 50 shades of grey i was an inspiration for many and part of my art is giving permission says vernon above us on heaven s dome shaped ceiling were w rings bolted to the cement here she hangs her theta rig on which clients can be suspended according to vernon who is also a certified medical hypnotist the aim is to induce the theta brainwave frequency state and its benefits via the horizontal suspension of my subjects this is achieved by using leather straps that are attached to the rings as the state of abandonment advances the subject s brain begins to emit the theta brainwave frequency which is also registered during trance hypnosis deep meditation and even orgasm it is in this deeply relaxed state that vernon works with her clients later in september 2017 the theta rig like the boudoir box would also have its public reveal at the museum of modern art paris born and raised in virginia in the us vernon bought a one way ticket to florence italy at the age of 20 back in 1990 shortly after receiving a bachelor s degree in art history and metalsmithing there a position teaching goldsmithing awaited her she also worked with various florentine masters on refining her craft by 1992 she designed and launched her sado chic jewellery collection inspired by the story of o the controversial and oft banned erotic novel published in 1954 little did she know then how that collection would shape the trajectory of her life and practice i understand that i have put myself on a very complicated and complex and rocky trail but i will continue to stand by my brothers and my sisters around the world to ensure that our pleasure is not taken away from us says vernon as we catch up in october 2021 via zoom she has recently returned to her apartment in paris after spending a few days in rome promoting the ninth edition of her bestselling 2013 sex guide the boudoir bible which was translated into italian and launched in the country under the title eros as she describes it the boudoir bible fills those niches missing from other sex guides nicely with full elaborated chapters on rope bondage restraints of sound and sight erotic flagellation and the stimulation of new erogenous zones among innumerable other offerings 2022 will also mark three decades since she launched the sado chic collection and embarked on a journey that has seen her celebrated in some corners and ostracized in others over the past three decades she has collaborated with several brands including jean paul gaultier missoni gianfranco ferré swarowski pampaloni karl lagerfeld alexander wang and the italian fashion house valentino and she was also the design director for the italian interior design house fornasetti from 1995 to 2012 for the 2021 launch of eros she collaborated with valentino during the covid lockdown i did some creative writing for them and then when we got out of lockdown they were like hey let s do some other things says vernon i have a beautiful friendship with pierpaolo and with the maison valentino team they re amazing so forward thinking it s been a fantastic journey she explains however the luxury fashion world hasn t always been welcoming back in 1992 when she launched her sado chic collection she couldn t find stores to stock her luxury erotic collection it was really strange to me i thought to myself why is that sex related objects are not made from beautiful materials why does is our sexuality not honored or considered sacred we re using these objects on our bodies we re making love with them and making love having sex with someone is the most intimate thing that you can possibly do in the whole wide world she explains she sold through italian fashion retailer louisa via roma they carried the collection and they loved it vernon explains luisa was my first and only client in the early 90s and they sold the collection immediately as she developed the pieces in her collection she incorporated more functional jewellery pieces a sterling silver choker comes with a chain attached to a ring that allows partners to share and connect more deeply to each other a tasselled necklace pendant doubles as a whip the bulbous spheres atop a metal ring also serve as tools for a sensual massage emboldened by success with louisa via roma she presented her designs to to her client barney s in 1996 the woman from barney s was completely freaked out she was like i can t sell these kinds of things in barneys new york and i was like well it s just a bracelet you don t have to share it but she was disturbed i had slipped the sado chic ring onto her finger but it was still connected to the bracelet and the chain and she said take it off of me i m not interested in this collection i decided oh my god i ve hit a nerve and i better stay underground she carried on with her non erotic work presenting her other pieces to private clients and eventually creating the boudoir box which she travelled around the world with to present to them then came the september 11 attacks on the twin towers at the time vernon had come to view sexual wellness as integral to overall well being of the individual the community and therefore society at large the attacks became the catalyst for her to once again step into the light and take her message on the road says vernon i thought you know what i can t really design and produce any more product in this world unless they re going to promote a sexual enlightenment and sensual enhancement up until that point she was still doing other design work for the fashion industry i dropped everything at the time the erotic collection was about 70 pieces and i went to paris for sales with the boudoir box because it was the only way for me to show my pieces i had to go to my clients there were no stores no galleries nobody wanted to touch me they all put their own small ideas of sexuality onto me which had nothing to do with my broad vision so she presented her work specifically called the paradise found fine erotic jewellery collection during fashion week in paris now some six years since the barney s incident still the reception to her jewel tools was still not quite as positive as she had hoped i lost all of my clients from the fashion they were like what are you doing that same year a new luxury lingerie and erotica store which positions itself as the home of female pleasure opened in london s covent garden coco de mer was really the first luxury erotica sales point that wasn t in the wrong side of town that wasn t dangerous it was geared towards women and men who believe that our sex is also sacred and that we should adorn our bodies with beautiful things and make love with each other with things that are safe for the body says vernon steadily the cultural landscape was also shifting one such key moment was designer tom ford s 2003 fall winter collection which featured bondage inspired dresses that same year the designer presented a campaign shot by mario testino and styled by french fashion editor carine roitfeld featuring a model with the gucci logo shaved into her pubic hair launching a wave of controversy complaints and calls to ban the campaign fashion drives things there were certain happening around the theme of sexuality at the turn of the century tom ford was using whips in his advertising campaigns for example and it was suddenly happening everywhere you could see symbols of another kind of loving popping up explains vernon encouraged by the shifting cultural landscape she thought the world has caught up with me now it s going to be easier safer by 2004 vernon had agreed for the boudoir box to be shot by helmut newton for the new york times sadly he passed away before the shoot took place and it would be another 13 years before it would be revealed to the world meanwhile the fashion and art world came knocking a key moment came in 2006 when she was photographed for purple magazine suspended after the magazine came out with me hanging from the ceiling totally glammed out with lipstick and heels and glamour but glamorous suspension i got the phone calls i got the phone calls from the director of vogue i got the phone calls from sam taylor wood who was doing a cover for the new york times and she was like please can you do some cord work for me while vernon is reluctant to call herself an artist her bio suggests otherwise showing an increasing list of gallery shows alongside a stream of press coverage over the years her pieces also come with a certificate of authenticity no matter what medium she is using she is adamant that her primary goal is to dismantle the pleasure taboo and teach sensual and sexual wellness as a path towards holistic wellness i was so naive when i started in the 90s i was working for the worlds greater pleasure then i discovered that no everyone lived their sexuality as freely as i did and that there was so much trauma so much abuse so much pain connected to the sexual persona the way that we perceive our sexuality is also a reflection of the way that we perceive the world and this is why the center of my attention became sexuality i became a sexologist and a clinical hypnotherapist with a focus on sexual wellness it s because i believe that in the moment that we can heal sexual trauma we can live a more satisfying life in general through her work she says she has come to understand that sexual abuse is far more prevalent than we would like to admit and possibly the norm rather than the exception and it does such deep damage so much healing is required if you break a soul by violating them sexually as children they don t have the capacity to say this is right or wrong they have no pre frontal activity in their brains to be able to discern adults command a child s world the horrors of sexual abuse radiates in every aspect of the abused life i have seen it destroy lives so this means that the contrary is also true that sexual wellness radiates joy into every aspect of our lives not our sex lives alone she elaborates readers of her 335 page long boudoir bible will know that long before one gets to more instructional chapters with titles such as riding the orgasmic wave male ejaculation control the anthems of anal sex from hygiene to heavenly pleasures and x marks the sweet spot erotic flagellation vernon dedicates about a third to educating her readers about the body and understanding the many ways in which it can give and receive sensual pleasure long before and even without penetration she also emphasises the importance of communication between sexual partners encouraging each to understand their bodies and communicate how they wish to be pleasured in a world where porn and fast sex are ubiquitous she also encourages the concept of the sexual ceremony where rather than a quick exercise with orgasm as its goal the sexual ceremony is considered sacred lasting anything from three hours to a few days where the body mind and soul are engaged as one as her work continues be it through her jewel tools her parisian salon her workshops or private counselling sessions she is also laying claim to her legacy i believe that my work has opened doors and it has given permission a big part of my work has been giving permission i also brought luxury values and aesthetics to sex even as her work now regularly receives positive attention she remains wary of those she says would take away our rights she points political movements around the world that limit women s rights the rights of sexual minorities and people of colour through to the censorship she has experienced on social media where she says she is not allowed to promote her work and is regularly shadow banned most recently she says she has had to change the name of her sado chic collection to the o ring collection to avoid online censorship i m an educator my work my book is didactic i m doing nothing wrong i break none of their rules the idea of sexual intelligence must be embraced sex and love are an important part of your being we shouldn t be shadowing it making it feel dirty making it feel naughty making it everything that it s not it is a sacred part of our lives so that s my goal spreading sexual intelligence and i think the only way to do this is to stand entirely in the light dm ml

india which this spring was the center of a devastating outbreak is sequencing 0 2 percent of samples up from 0 06 percent in april the countries with the highest sequencing rates are largely european ones with comparatively high vaccination rates iceland tops the chart with 56 2 percent of its virus samples sequenced and more than 88 percent of its population fully vaccinated according to a reuters tracker since the vaccine rollout began nearly one year ago scientists have warned rich mainly western countries against monopolizing vaccine stocks at the expense of a more equitable global distribution the longer the virus circulates among unvaccinated populations the more chances there are for highly transmissible variants to develop just 6 percent of africa s 1 2 billion people are vaccinated compared with about 59 percent of people in the united states while the united states and some countries in europe are providing their populations with booster shots only around 3 percent of people in low income countries are fully vaccinated according to gordon brown the world health organization s ambassador for global health financing and a former british prime minister until we vaccinate enough people we re going to have this happen over and over again glenda gray head of the south african medical research council told the washington post south african officials have criticized the travel bans imposed on their country over the weekend after the new variant was announced saying that such moves could deter other nations from reporting new variants for weeks europe has been battling a surge in coronavirus cases the travel restrictions are akin to punishing south africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker south africa s ministry of international relations and cooperation said in a statement excellent science should be applauded and not punished
amir peay had high hopes when he salvaged the abandoned 140 year old james e pepper distillery near the heart of lexington kentucky after years of planning and renovations it was finally ready to produce whiskey on site in 2017 but peay s hopes were dashed a few months later as the european union imposed tariffs on american whiskey we thought we could really grow our business over there says peay that is of course until june of 2018 when out of the blue american whiskey got dragged into a trade war but now peay and whiskey distillers across the u s are raising their glasses and setting their sights once again on europe the u s and european union announced a trade agreement last month that effectively lifts the 25 percent tariffs on american whiskey come january the tariffs which had been levied as part of a growing trade dispute between the trump administration and the e u over steel and aluminum also targeted american exports such as motorcycles and denim and stymied international growth for the burgeoning american whiskey industry jeff dean npr jeff dean npr the james e pepper distillery jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch walks through the distillery europe is a major importer of american spirits yet distillers saw a 53 decline in american whiskey exports to the u k and a 37 decline to the e u while the tariffs were in place resulting in over 300 million in lost revenue according to the distilled spirits council then covid 19 exacerbated the pain of small distillers as they were forced to close their doors to tours and tastings and bars and restaurants shut down in the beginning when the pandemic hit you know myself and us as a company we were really really nervous and scared says peay adding that bars and restaurants made up nearly half of his business at the time jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch inspects the mash jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch weighs containers of rye the distillery pivoted to retail sales and with more people drinking at home throughout the pandemic the company sold a record number of cases of whiskey in 2020 peay says we had very strong domestic growth says peay but it made us change how we wanted to allocate stock to europe and it altered what was going to be our growth trajectory in europe it could be hard for smaller craft distillers to reclaim the space they lost on european store shelves when the tariffs were imposed now that distributors have adjusted their purchasing strategies once you re off the shelves it s like 300 times harder to get back on says sonat birnecker hart president of koval distillery in chicago illinois jeff dean npr jeff dean npr distillery employee cody giles left uses a forklift to pick up a container of malt jeff dean npr jeff dean npr bottles sit on bottling line at the james e pepper distillery hart says koval decided to keep its prices steady essentially eating the excess cost of the tariffs in order to maintain existing relationships we had to show them that we were in it for the long term says hart so when the biden administration announced that it had come to an agreement with the e u to lift the tariffs hart saw reason to celebrate we took out the bourbon cocktails to toast that the tariffs had gone away says hart that being said you know there s still work to be done jeff dean npr jeff dean npr boxes are stacked at the james e pepper distillery jeff dean npr jeff dean npr travis kitchens pours a tasting flight at the james e pepper distillery especially when it comes to britain the u k is no longer part of the e u thanks to brexit and has yet to remove its tariffs on american whiskey yet amir peay in lexington is optimistic a deal will be struck and demand for u s whiskey will increase it s not a light switch we can t just flick it and immediately just let s go back to what we had he says i m not sure about 2022 but i am confident that 2023 and beyond it s a very bright future for american whiskey in europe copyright 2021 npr to see more visit
prior to 2019 africa was a no brainer for finding quality workers in the field of tech that was then nowadays the search in the motherland is more of a challenge one that was put on blast thanks to sacha poignonnec the co ceo of the africa focused e commerce site jumia according to rest of world poignonnec exposed a very real reality in an april 2019 interview when explaining why his company s technical team is located everywhere but africa the place jumia makes its money during that chat poignonnec said africa didn t have enough software developer talent from there a nerve was struck with those who weren t sharing the same view privately tech industry insiders confessed how right poignonnec was in a sense that an engineering talent shortage in africa was present publicly a longstanding concern about jumia s non african roots was the talk as much as the theory of african tech talent not being good enough to work in a company with world class goals more news on eurweb dwayne the rock johnson to be feted as the people s champion at 2021 people s choice awards adding to the discussion was a report that came from the international finance corporation and google last year the report estimated that there are currently some 700 000 professional developers across africa with just over 50 concentrated in egypt kenya morocco nigeria and south africa noted rest of world which compared the report s findings to the the state of california which has an estimated 630 000 developers as tech talent is not as prevalent with agencies a huge increase in demand for tech talent over the last few years has been present in the last few years with training companies such as decagon semicolon moringa school in nairobi and addis abababa based professional placement service gebeya andela a new york based company positioned as a talent network for tech workers raised 200 million in a series e funding round rest of world noted how the company underscored the potential of african tech talent as a result andela graduated to the level of companies valued at 1 5 billion since it s founding in 2014 andela spent time convincing young people to apply for a free six month developer training program that guaranteed them a software engineer job with the company when it was completed with africa having high youth unemployment and few formal job prospects it wasn t hard for thousands of people to take a chance with andela and apply for just a few hundred open slots a reputation for training african developers and placing them with global clients developed followed by international venture capital from silicon valley and investors with a social impact focus elevating andela s stock further were follow up rounds with other high profile investors including former vice president al gore and tennis superstar serena williams while andela s initial time on the scene featured the company covering the cost of training junior developers with the plan of earning fees for placement things switched by 2019 according to rest of world andela was having trouble placing the junior developers it trained and were now on its payroll contrary to prepping young workers to enter its workforce andela s issue centered around more experienced talent being sought after by it s clients the impact was noticeably felt that with more than 400 developers laid off following another 100 developers laid off by the company plus staffers andela switched over completely with announcing the shift in its model to focus on placing more senior developers as for this year andela is transitioning to less emphasis on training african developers with it s focus on a global talent network with developers from more than 80 countries we started off as a training led company and we had to monetize through placement but over time it became really clear what was needed is a global marketplace for talent andela chief executive and co founder jeremy johnson told rest of world johnson said the switch to more senior talent has enabled andela to pay on average more than 60 higher compensation for developers and offer longer term client contracts for more about the tech talent shortage in africa click here for rest of world org

london amsterdam the omicron coronavirus variant spread around the world on sunday with new cases found in the netherlands denmark and australia even as more countries imposed travel restrictions to try to seal themselves off the world health organization who said it was not yet clear whether omicron first detected in southern africa is more transmissible than other variants or if it causes more severe disease preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in south africa but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected rather than a result of specific infection who said it said understanding the level of severity of omicron will take days to several weeks the detection of omicron triggered global alarm as governments around the world scrambled to impose new travel curbs and financial markets sold off fearing the variant could resist vaccinations and upend a nascent economic reopening after a two year global pandemic in its statement the who said it was working with technical experts to understand the potential impact of the variant on existing countermeasures against covid 19 including vaccines britain said it will convene an urgent meeting of g7 health ministers on monday to discuss the developments dutch health authorities said 13 cases of the variant were found among people on two flights that arrived in amsterdam from south africa on friday authorities had tested all of the more than 600 passengers on the flights and found 61 coronavirus cases going on to test those for omicron this could possibly be the tip of the iceberg health minister hugo de jonge told reporters dutch military police said they arrested a married couple who left a hotel where they were in quarantine after testing positive for covid 19 and were attempting to flee the country omicron dubbed a variant of concern last week by the who that is potentially more contagious than previous variants has now been detected in australia belgium botswana britain denmark germany hong kong israel italy the netherlands france canada and south africa many countries have imposed travel bans or curbs on southern africa to try to stem the spread financial markets dived on friday and oil prices tumbled a south african doctor who was one of the first to suspect a different coronavirus strain said on sunday that symptoms of omicron were so far mild and could be treated at home dr angelique coetzee chair of the south african medical association told reuters that unlike with delta so far patients have not reported loss of smell or taste and there has been no major drop in oxygen levels with the new variant israeli measures in the most far reaching effort to keep the variant at bay israel announced late on saturday it would ban the entry of all foreigners and reintroduce counter terrorism phone tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant prime minister naftali bennett said the ban pending government approval would last 14 days officials hope that within that period there will be more information on how effective vaccines are against omicron the top u s infectious disease official dr anthony fauci told president joe biden on sunday it will take about two weeks to have more definitive information about the transmissibility and other characteristics of omicron the white house said in a statement adding that fauci believes existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of covid biden will give an update on the new variant and the u s response on monday the white house said in britain the government has announced measures including stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country and requiring mask wearing in some settings more countries announced new travel curbs on southern african nations on sunday including indonesia and saudi arabia south africa has denounced the measures as unfair and potentially harmful to its economy saying it is being punished for its scientific ability to identify coronavirus variants early south africa s president cyril ramaphosa said on sunday that his government was considering imposing compulsory covid 19 shots for people in certain places and activities and he slammed rich western countries for what he called their knee jerk imposition of travel bans the prohibition of travel is not informed by science nor will it be effective in preventing the spread of this variant ramaphosa said the only thing it will do is to further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to the pandemic omicron has emerged as many countries in europe are already battling a surge in covid 19 infections with some reintroducing restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread the new variant has also thrown a spotlight on huge disparities in vaccination rates around the globe even as many developed countries are giving third dose boosters less than 7 of people in poorer countries have received their first covid 19 shot according to medical and human rights groups live tv

president biden s team sees getting more people vaccinated and finally controlling covid 19 as the key to reviving the country and biden s own performance example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington inflation is soaring businesses are struggling to hire and president joe biden s poll numbers have been in free fall the white house sees a common culprit for it all covid 19 biden s team views the pandemic as the root cause of both the nation s malaise and his own political woes finally controlling covid 19 the white house believes is the skeleton key to rejuvenating the country and reviving biden s own standing but the coronavirus challenge has proved to be vexing for the white house with last summer s premature claims of victory swamped by the more transmissible delta variant stubborn millions of americans unvaccinated and lingering economic effects from the pandemic s darkest days all of that as yet another variant of the virus omicron emerged overseas it is worrying public health officials leading to new travel bans and panicking markets as scientists race to understand how dangerous it may be although the economy has actually been coming back there are multiple signs that covid 19 will leave its scars even if the pandemic fades for now in the administration s view an intransigent minority that is resisting vaccination is spoiling the recovery for the rest of the country forcing masks on the vaccinated and contributing to lingering anxiousness everywhere you look asked why americans aren t getting the message that the economy is improving white house press secretary jen psaki said this past week we re still in the middle of fighting a pandemic and people are sick and tired of that we are too the state of affairs she said affects everything from how people feel about sending their kids out the door to the price for a gallon of gas the administration views vaccination mandates as critical not only to preventing avoidable illness and death but to safeguarding the economic recovery and salvaging biden s political position we have the tools to accelerate the path out of this pandemic widely available white house covid 19 coordinator jeff zients told a coronavirus briefing while he ruled out large scale lockdowns like the united states experienced in 2020 and like those popping up again across europe zients renewed the administration s appeals for more americans to get their shots but on friday the discovery of the new variant in southern africa had much of the world acting to to shut down travel from the region and contain a threat that the world health organization suggested could be worse than the ravaging waves from delta inside the white house and among allies of the president there has been frustration for weeks over the slow government action to approve booster shots for all adults the regulatory process they fear contributed to misinformation and confusion around the boosters and means the nation isn t optimally protected for the holiday season biden on friday appealed for unvaccinated americans to be responsible and get the shot and for those eligible for a booster to get that too that is the minimum that everyone should be doing we always talk about whether this is about freedom but i think it s a patriotic responsibility to do that still for all the hand wringing over biden s sagging standing with americans democrats say a turnaround may be within reach from trump to biden people have gone from feeling like it s mourning again in america to feeling on the cusp of morning again in america said party strategist jesse ferguson getting past the pandemic unlocks the door for the economy for our way of life and for people feeling less divided he added to biden s critics though it s a stretch to blame all the nation s problems on covid 19 or to think that containing the virus will solve them senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky in fact puts the blame for high prices on biden s big pandemic relief package saying recently there is no question what is keeping working americans awake at night inflation the runaway prices and unpredictability that democrats policies have fueled the lingering effects of the virus have taken a toll on the president s approval ratings even if his handling of the virus has been seen as a relative strength in an october ap norc poll 54 of americans said they approved of biden s job on the pandemic that was somewhat higher than his approval rating overall and much higher than approval on his handling of the economy at 48 and 41 respectively as recently as july 66 had approved of biden on covid 19 and 59 approved of his job performance overall in last month s poll only about one third of americans said the nation was heading in the right direction down from about half in late february views of the economy have dimmed as well with only about one third saying conditions are good compared with close to half in september to the white house fixing blame on the pandemic is emerging as a modern version of the old it s the economy stupid mantra from the bill clinton years when psaki was pressed on what the administration was doing to contain higher prices she replied we know what the root causes of those are right global supply chain issues the best thing we can do as the government is to get the pandemic under control that s what the president s number one focus is the same message ripples throughout the administration as long as the pandemic continues there will be pandemic driven shortages which is why the best way to fix that is to end the pandemic transportation secretary pete buttigieg said recently stressing the need for vaccination energy secretary jennifer granholm speaking about the administration s response to spiking gasoline prices said getting people vaccinated was the ultimate answer economists largely endorse the sentiment but caution that the solution is not simple the root of the problems in the economy is the virus said harvard economist james stock and the best way to minimize the spread of the virus is to increase vaccinations it s the number one economic policy in my mind but with experts predicting that covid 19 is becoming endemic stock said you ve got to be realistic that it s not going to go away even if the virus fades economists warn there will be harmful lingering effects goldman sachs noted in a recent analysis that roughly half of the 5 million people who have left the labor force since the pandemic have retired making it harder for businesses to regain lost jobs work by stanford university economist nicholas bloom and others indicates that companies expect more people to keep working from home and shopping online a problem for local retailers that depend on office workers to buy lunch and people to return to stores just 5 of americans total work days were at home pre pandemic a figure that is now 25 according to bloom more than three quarters of workers surveyed by his colleagues and him would prefer to have at least one day a week working from home and nearly one third would rather work from home for all five days this could make it harder for employers to evaluate their workers and efficiently use office space the administration is also dealing with a global economy so solving pandemic issues at home has its limits coronavirus outbreaks in asia shut down computer chip plants worsening the shortage of semiconductors one sign that vaccination worldwide could be as critical as the administration s domestic efforts one of the rationales for biden s infrastructure spending to strengthen the supply chain is to minimize the damage from these shutdowns if a factory in malaysia shuts down due to a covid outbreak which they have it causes a ripple effect that can slow down auto manufacturing in detroit biden said in one recent speech why they can t get the computer chips they need ___

in the year 2000 the international energy agency made a prediction that would come back to haunt it by 2020 the world would have installed a grand total of 18 gigawatts of photovoltaic solar capacity seven years later the forecast would be proven spectacularly wrong when roughly 18 gigawatts of solar capacity were installed in a single year alone ever since the agency was founded in 1974 to measure the world s energy systems and anticipate changes the yearly world energy outlook has been a must read document for policymakers the world over over the last two decades however the iea has consistently failed to see the massive growth in renewable energy coming not only has the organisation underestimated the take up of solar and wind but it has massively overstated the demand for coal and oil jenny chase head of solar analysis at bloombergnef says that in fairness to the iea it wasn t alone when i got this job in 2005 i thought maybe one day solar will supply 1 of the world s electricity now it s 3 our official forecast is that it will be 23 by 2050 but that s completely underestimated chase says i see it as the limits of modelling most energy system models are or were set up to model minor changes to an energy system that is run on fossil fuel or nuclear every time you double producing capacity you reduce the cost of pv solar by 28 we ve got to the point where solar is the cheapest source of energy in the world in most places this means we ve been trying to model a situation where the grid looks totally different today this rapid radical reduction in the price of pv solar is a story about chinese industrial might backed by american capital fanned by european political sensibilities and made possible largely thanks to the pioneering work of an australian research team the deep history begins with a succession of us presidents and the quest for energy independence first was richard nixon who in november 1973 announced project independence to wean the us off middle eastern oil then came jimmy carter who declared the energy transition the moral equivalent of war in april 1977 and pumped billions of dollars into renewable energy research which came to a screeching halt when ronald reagan came to power but by then interest had been piqued in australia the father of pv solar the solar cell was invented when russell shoemaker ohl a researcher in bell labs noticed in 1940 that a cracked silicon sample produced a current when exposed to light however little improvement had been made until the contribution of martin green a young engineering professor working out of the university of new south wales born in brisbane green had spent some time in canada as a researcher before circling back home in 1974 a year later he had started a pv solar research group working out of a small university laboratory built with unwanted equipment scrounged from big american engineering firms view image in fullscreen university of nsw researcher martin green started a photovoltaic solar research group in 1975 photograph university of nsw his first experiments alongside a single phd student involved looking for ways to increase the voltage on early solar cells pretty soon we started beating all these groups in the us in terms of the voltage we could get green says nasa had a project that had six contractors working on it we beat them all not long after green and his team began to raise their ambitions having boosted the voltage the next step was building better quality cells their early efforts broke the world efficiency record in 1983 a habit the team would continue for 30 of the next 38 years in the very early years of the industry the received wisdom had been that a 20 conversion rate marked the hard limit of what was possible from pv solar cells green however disagreed in a paper published in 1984 a year later his team built the first cell that pushed past that limit and in 1989 built the first full solar panel capable of running at 20 efficiency view image in fullscreen martin green and the team that built the first solar cell capable of running at 20 efficiency in 1989 photograph university of nsw it was a moment that opened up what was possible from the industry and the new upper limit was set at 25 another barrier green and his team would smash in 2008 in 2015 they built the world s most efficient solar cell achieving a 40 6 conversion rate using focused light reflected off a mirror rise of the sun king out of this whirlwind of activity the chinese solar industry would be born largely thanks to an ambitious physicist named zhengrong shi born in 1963 on yangzhong island shi had earned his master s degree and come to australia a year before the tiananmen square protests he had spotted a flyer advertising a research fellowship and talked green into bringing him on as a phd student in 1989 shi would finish his phd in just two and a half years a record that still stands today by the time he became dr shi he had so impressed green that he stayed on as a researcher with time the university was increasingly looking to commercialise its world leading solar cell technology and struck up a partnership with pacific power in 1995 the government utility sank 47m into a new company called pacific solar a factory was set up in the sydney suburb of botany and shi was made the deputy director of research and development where he quickly earned a reputation for resourcefulness and precision zhengrong basically ran the company green says shi stuck it out for a few years but in november 2000 he was made an offer at a dinner held at his home four officials from the chinese province of jiangsu suggested the 37 year old researcher and australian citizen return to china and build his own factory there after some consideration shi agreed and ended up settling in the small city of wuxi where he founded suntech with 6m in startup funding from the municipal government view image in fullscreen an event to mark the founding of chinese solar panel manufacturer suntech in 2002 photograph judy green shi s arrival caused a stir the ability to cheaply build conventional pv solar panels with 17 efficiency was far beyond what his competitors were capable of that was a shock to them shi says when they saw we were making solar cells of large area and high efficiencies they said wow the first reaction was that s the future everybody said that s the future but they also said it was one step too early what they meant was that there was no market for it yet in china at the time if you mentioned solar people thought of solar hot water all that would change when germany passed new laws encouraging the uptake of solar power quickly it became clear there was a massive global demand and the world s manufacturers were struggling to keep up with supply view image in fullscreen the listing of suntech on the new york stock exchange in 2005 photograph new york stock exchange spying an opportunity for investment a consortium that included actis capital and goldman sachs came knocking to pitch shi on taking the company public when the company listed on the new york stock exchange in 2005 it raised 420m and made shi an instant billionaire a year later he would be worth an estimated 3bn and crowned the richest man in china earning him the moniker the sun king having shown the way the chinese pv solar industry began a massive expansion suntech alone boosted its production capacity from 60 megawatts to 500mw and then to 1 gigawatt in 2009 the company grew so fast its supplies of glass polysilicon and electronic systems needed to build its panels came under strain forcing it to invest heavily in local supply chains and then you know the rest shi says dirt cheap power at a price as with the rest of china the rate of technological development in the pv solar business makes for an industry that builds itself up one day tears itself down the next and then remakes itself again the day after with razor thin margins and cut throat competition everyone is always one step away from falling around 2012 the world market was flooded with solar panels sending the price plummeting through the floor leaving suntech vulnerable already under intense financial pressure disaster struck when an internal investigation found a takeover bid it had launched had been guaranteed by 560m in fake german government bonds upon discovering the bonds didn t exist shi was removed as ceo of his company and a year later suntech would file for bankruptcy protection when it couldn t repay a 541m loan that fell due in march 2013 whatever befell suntech later the macquarie university emeritus professor john mathews says the company played a pivotal role in changing both china and the world forever in a quirk of history what had begun as an american drive to wean itself off oil was eventually taken up by china which made solar power dirt cheap in the process the chinese approach to renewables is all about energy security mathews says at the scale from which they re building new industries they would need colossal imports of conventional fossil fuels which would cripple them economically they can get around that problem which is a geopolitical obstacle by manufacturing their own energy equipment today green and shi keep in touch both are working on new projects shi is overseeing a new company while 72 year old green is looking for new innovations to explore one such innovation is the stackable solar cell though still a niche technology very much in the early stages the basic idea is to lay a material over a solar cell in order to boost its power output we think a 40 module rather than the 22 you can do nowadays with perc is what the industry will be doing once we perfect this stacking approach green says we re just trying to find a new cell that will have all the qualities of silicon that we can stack on top of silicon the international energy agency now says solar is providing the cheapest energy the world has ever seen but we re headed towards a future of insanely cheap energy it s a fundamentally different world we re moving into
hong kong bloomberg an unstoppable ascent in the renminbi is signalling beijing s growing ease with gradually freeing up one of the world s most tightly managed currencies since the renminbi hit a six year high on a trade weighted basis on nov 17 the people s bank of china pboc has set the currency s daily reference rate at only mildly weaker than expected levels the central bank also has refrained from delivering stronger warnings to investors following a gentle reminder of not making one way bets meantime a key renminbi volatility gauge is near a two year low suggesting that traders are not bracing for sharp price swings the composure and restraint that beijing has demonstrated in the face of a resurgent renminbi shows policymakers remain confident in their ability to prop up a slowing economy without having to rely on a cheaper currency at least for now it stands in stark contrast to the situation in 2015 the last time the renminbi was this strong when the pboc shocked markets with a surprise and messy currency devaluation this time is different because the currency regime is more flexible said mr eddie cheung senior emerging market strategist at credit agricole cib in hong kong there is now transparency around the yuan basket and markets can gauge the intentions of the pboc which allows the currency to be more market driven the renminbi has gained more than 2 per cent against the dollar this year to beat all its asian peers thanks to robust exports and capital inflows the bloomberg replica of the cfets rmb index which tracks the renminbi s performance against major trading partners has surged more than 8 per cent for now there is little to suggest that the renminbi s appreciation will slow even as the dollar has strengthened globally amid expectations for a faster united states exit from economic stimulus china s net foreign exchange settlement on behalf of banks clients has been positive since the third quarter of last year an indication of stronger demand for the renminbi mr cheung said he expects the chinese currency to be worth around 6 30 per dollar at the end of next year to be sure the pboc could still step in to slow the renminbi s advance if it risks undermining the country s so far resilient exports and history shows it has an array of tools at its disposal for instance in early 2018 china s central bank effectively gave banks the green light to submit quotes for a weaker renminbi reference rate causing the currency to head for its biggest drop in two months immediately afterwards alternatively the pboc could also adjust the supply of dollar liquidity onshore as it did earlier this year by asking banks to hold more foreign currencies in reserve to cool the renminbi s rally the export or the trade surplus advantage will eventually diminish and china definitely doesn t want to see the yuan being too strong said mr bruce zhang portfolio manager at csop asset management nor do the authorities want the currency to be excessively weak he added this comes amid renewed market volatility on friday nov 26 as investors responded to news of a new coronavirus variant omicron which was identified in south africa the foreign exchange market stabilised on monday amid signs the new variant causes only mild symptoms and vaccine reformulations against it can be achieved quickly

don t miss out on the headlines from celebrity life followed categories will be added to my news donna d errico can vividly recall the moment she decided to give up meat it was about eight years ago after she was invited by director producer sam simon a vegan to appear on his podcast the former baywatch star who grew up in the us south said she wasn t familiar with veganism or what it meant exactly we were chatting and then he asked me if i was vegan she told fox news i grew up in alabama and georgia we had barbecues chicken steak venison all kinds of meat so he stopped the interview and he said would you be willing to go in the next room and watch a video i thought to myself this is sam simon and i really respected him so i said sure i went to the next room and he had me watch this undercover footage of a factory farm at that time i had no idea there were factory farms or what they were i didn t know what conditions these animals were in before they ended up on our plates and in grocery stores i lived in the dark former baywatch star donna d errico turned 53 in march i watched the video she said i came back to the room where he had his podcast studio set up and i was in tears i told him i was never going to eat meat again he said well great let s finish the podcast and we did but from that point on i didn t need meat anymore the actress said that her journey to veganism originally began because she loved animals however she noticed some unexpected side effects along the way there were happy benefits like clearer skin better digestion better sleep but that s not why i do it said the 53 year old i do it for the animals d errico noted that it has gotten easier to become a vegan no matter the reason thanks to plenty of food options available d errico front in her baywatch days and a recent makeup free selfie the vegan alternatives for meat and cheese are so much better now than they used to be she said and you don t miss it it s so easy to switch over but if it s too hard to do that try it in baby steps like with meatless mondays take a week at a time there are so many tasty alternatives out there to make it easier and before you know it you won t miss it over the years the star has been outspoken about her passion for animal rights and while d errico has been widely complimented by the press for her appearance she hopes her message doesn t get lost along the way i m very flattered but i just feel like i m more than that she said i understand it comes with the territory and i understand that when you look at my social media there s that kind of stuff but i think it s very important for a lot of women and for myself to feel good about themselves i like to look my best and i do that for myself i don t do it to be compared to other women or to be complimented i don t do it for those reasons i do it for me it doesn t feel nice to hear somebody say you look great for your age or you still look amazing why not just say wow you look amazing and just move on i think critiquing women based on their age is unfair men don t face the same scrutiny and i don t think they would like either but i know it s not going to go away because it s part of our culture she s best known for baywatch but d errico says she stays out of the sun when it comes to looking and feeling her best d errico said she stopped baking in the sun i used to do the old baby oil baking in the sun thing long ago to get super tan she said i ve stopped that i ve let myself get a little pale and i wear sunblock all the time no matter the season if i want a little glow i ll use a self tanner or a tinted moisturiser i want to take care of my skin the best that i can and the number one thing you can do is stay out of the sun there s no magic product that will fix everything she said i don t have a special skincare regimen i sometimes forget to take my makeup off at night which is a huge no no i ll wake up with raccoon eyes from my mascara but i like to wash my face with a gentle cleanser and when it comes to trying new products i m a professional researcher i read up on everything i can because everyone swears that the new thing works i think we re all guilty of falling into that but i want to take care of myself as much as possible i just think we shouldn t be pressured into trying every single product that has all these claims use what truly works for your skin and keep it simple as for staying healthy d errico said she grazes throughout the day because that s what works best for her on a 2017 red carpet picture afp i like to stock up on vegetables fruits nuts and avocados she said i like to have things like impossible meat to make proper meals but i like to have a handful of things here and there throughout the day as opposed to three large meals i started doing that years ago and it just suits me better but again that just works for me it doesn t make it better than anything else these days d errico said she encourages her followers to help animals in need and one way to do just that is to adopt i recently adopted a dog he s deaf has a bum leg and no teeth but he s the sweetest dog in the world d errico said he sleeps with me every night i think more and more people are becoming aware of animal cruelty and getting outraged by what s still happening i just hope i can enlighten people this story originally appeared on fox news and is republished here with permission originally published as why 53 year old baywatch star donna d errico looks decades younger
news analysis u s electric vehicle giant tesla inc which has had great strides in the chinese market is under mounting data scrutiny from the chinese communist party ccp despite its engagement with regulators the bean stems are burning hot while the seeds are weeping in the boiling pot as outgrowths from the same root the seeds protest why thou leave us in such a disastrous rest the piece carries an insinuating criticism that brutality should be avoided among those with close ties tesla founder elon musk on nov 2 posted on twitter a poem titled humankind followed by a 4 line original quote from an ancient poem well known to chinese readers which can be roughly translated in english as the following the piece carries an insinuating criticism that brutality should be avoided among those with close ties legend has it that its author cao zhi who was one of the brothers of the king of the wei state cao pi in chinese history saved his own life with the piece at the palace the king who envied his brother s talent and deemed him as a threat ordered him to create a public poem before he could walk seven paces if he failed the king could order his men to kill him the cornered but quick witted poet succeeded with this poem and survived the crisis the tesla ceo did not provide any interpretation for the tweet which stirred up thousands of interpretations currently his company in china faces huge challenges posed by ccp regulators the yoke of beijing s data scrutiny tesla has blossomed in china s electric vehicle market over the last few years with the country becoming its second largest single market however hong kong finance columnist alexander liao sees trouble for the company in china the staggering data gathering capability of tesla electric cars has always been regarded as a threat to the ccp regime said liao seeing data as a top concern in its ai strategy beijing is seeking dominance of the resource according to liao the contest for data control might stay the entire course of tesla s development in china because the automaker is unlikely to abandon its core advantages in data collection and application in mid june the ccp s rubber stamp legislature passed a data security law to tighten its grip within the domain the law went into effect on sept 1 on nov 1 china started enforcing a personal information protection law posing further challenges to trans national flow of personal data yet liao suspects that the ccp s true intention is not meant for protecting privacy but for ensuring the communist regime s data dominance blocking all other institutions or individuals from entering the field whoever controls big data controls ai liao said and controlling ai means controlling the future fall from grace tesla successfully gained strong support from the communist regime at the start of its business in china in 2019 tesla began construction of its shanghai plant it received from several chinese banks more than more than 2 3 billion in loans at low interest rates only available to china s best state owned enterprises the plant delivered its first model 3 vehicles in late 2019 despite the covid 19 virus outbreak its production remained unaffected by the end of 2019 tesla s stock price began to enter the fast lane according to a january 2020 article on china s news portal sina china imported tesla in hopes of helping forge a complete supply chain for the electric vehicle industry in china the paper noted the weakest link in the industry lies in complete vehicle manufacturing expecting tesla to play its role in that field as apple had done to china s cellphone industry surprisingly the honeymoon between tesla and beijing did not last long with the u s carmaker leaving under suspicion of spying users big data has been viewed as a new strategic resource amid fierce u s china tensions in the high tech sector an article published on chinese news portal netease in march suspected tesla electric vehicles of being data monsters that gather all sorts of information the story accuses a tesla car of being a mobile smart spying terminal system that collects and transfers data in real time including information that its cameras scan from a chinese military vehicle it encounters back to its u s based database the report argues it is a potential form of intelligence collection even worse the article claims a tesla vehicle could be used to create an apparent accident for assassination purpose if musk s spacex starlink program comes to fruition which then could be connected to its terminal and control it at least the story assumes access to tesla s database alone may easily reveal the distribution and precise locations of a country s core institutions which could be directly destroyed in the event of war all countries need to be wary the paper concludes according to tesla china each of its electric vehicles is equipped with eight cameras and 12 ultrasonic sensors as well as a 360 degree vision to power its autopilot system there have been signs that at least some chinese authorities have ordered to block tesla vehicles from entering military or other sensitive facilities citing security concerns according to china s state media reports the restrictions involve military and governmental institutions key state owned enterprises as well as residential communities where relevant personnel and their families live in some cases restriction orders were only verbal tesla reluctant to surrender its data tesla denied all accusations against it regarding alleged spying officials of at least two government agencies in beijing and shanghai were instructed verbally by supervisors not to park their tesla electric cars at work insiders who declined to be named told reuters in may tesla denied all accusations against it regarding alleged spying there s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information musk told a prominent chinese forum during a virtual discussion on march 20 if tesla used cars to spy in china or anywhere we would get shut down in late october tesla announced it had completed construction of its china based data center and that the data collected in the country will be stored within the territory still the ccp does not rest assured viewing the center as a risk afraid that its data might be transferred to tesla s home country or leaked by design or by accident because it is not kept at a data terminal the ccp controls liao said tesla s move is reminiscent of apple inc which declared construction of an icloud data center in china in july 2017 one month after china s cybersecurity law came into effect later apple turned over its icloud to a chinese state owned company guizhou cloud big data to operate however tesla didn t follow apple to partner with a state owned firm instead the automaker began to hire engineers on data platforms to operate a center of its own for tesla big data and ai computing represent one of its core advantages to back its autopilot liao told the epoch times the vehicle giant would be hesitant to give it up to the ccp beijing s next move might be to pressure tesla to agree to separate data control from vehicle manufacture and sales liao said say create a separate joint company to manage its data together with a ccp designated partner however tesla viewing its vehicles as a driving ai system may have no interest in such cooperation musk said autopilot functions heavily depend on data from different scenarios according to state news portal tencent so far fsd fully self driving is best used in california because the data collected during its initial research and development stage came from the state likewise tesla can t go without data from china if it wishes to get its vehicles more adapted to china s road conditions and local driving habits tesla s autopilot feature requires a sea of data to train its model in 2017 the carmaker requested owners to authorize the manufacturer to collect videos taken by autopilot cameras when it released an update at that time most car owners consented to tesla collecting their data with the popularity of model 3 and model y and the rollout of fsd tesla has gained access to massive amounts of owner driven data to train its visual neural network which enables it to cover more scenarios and continuously optimize its algorithms thus making its unique autonomous driving solutions possible additionally tesla cannot hand over its data to beijing if only for the protection of its customers privacy china the most data restrictive country in the world think tank the ccp s dominance of big data has raised global concern china is the most data restrictive country in the world the washington based information technology and innovation foundation itif a u s nonprofit public policy think tank said in a july report the document provided a list of data localization measures by country covering 30 pages five pages of which went to china alone the worst of all the nations involved it wrote that authoritarian governments like china see physical access to data centers as a critical enabler of surveillance and political control the ability to target individuals and impact their privacy and freedom of expression or political oppression is made possible once information is under government control the report noted big data is a must have for the ccp taiwanese economist chang ching his told the epoch times it ll be extremely dangerous if companies cannot handle it properly themselves the ccp could take it away easily beijing is bent on keeping data firmly in its own hands sparing neither domestic tech firms like tencent douyin alibaba baidu nor foreign companies like google tesla and apple inc in july china s regulators targeted ride hailing giant didi just days after its debut on the new york stock exchange a key concern for chinese authorities was that didi might offer its large body of data to american regulators three months earlier chinese regulators urged 13 large and powerful private firms including tencent jingdong and bytedance to apply for licenses for financial holding companies for their financial platforms this way authorities could channel their payment data into the scope of surveillance a new war over big data appears to be underway as nations get into more specifics about the role of ai future tech competition and their relationship and musk may have smelled the gunpowder wendy yue contributed to this report views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times
tariff reduction on imports from china raises hope as u s inflation bites 09 08 november 29 2021 by huang yongfu cgtn a view of the nansha port in guangzhou south china s guangdong province xinhua editor s note huang yongfu is an economic affairs commentator after earning a phd he started his career at the university of cambridge and then moved on to the united nations un system he is the author of many papers and books related to economics his current interests lie in global development and sino u s links especially trade financial and technological issues the article reflects the author s opinions and not necessarily the views of cgtn at a time when inflation in the united states resembles a fairy tale beast president biden s re nomination of jerome powell as federal reserve fed chairman on november 22 means that monetary policy will stay on its previous course of exceptionally easy raising concerns about the impact of the inflation spike and the democrats social spending policies according to a november 10 u s labor department report inflation has risen by 6 2 percent three times above the fed s 2 percent mandate the fastest rate in 31 years as is well known this is a price shock largely made by the reckless policy of the u s government which has been orchestrating one of the most radical trade protectionist policies against china and the boldest economic policy responses against disaster since world war ii on the one hand the disrupted global supply chain has become a bottleneck this is partly due to the trump administration s trade war against china which aimed to hurt china economically decouple the two economies via technological and economic sanctions and relocate some production to the u s or its allies on may 20 2020 i wrote an op ed entitled stagflation is looming if trump pursues decoupling instead of cooperation pointing out that trump s decoupling will be sending inflation shooting back up and run up against the interests of the american economy and people the biden administration has so far followed all the populist policies of the previous administration ironically the protectionist policies of the two administrations have triggered the current surge in inflation in the first place and done even more harm to the u s itself on the other hand the u s congress feeds demand while the fed stays easy causing an extraordinary explosion in the money supply in connection with unruly government borrowing in march congress shoveled out 1 9 trillion in new spending after about 4 trillion in covid 19 relief in 2020 feeding a huge increase in personal savings the fed slashed interest rates to zero and monetized the federal debt of trillions of dollars at the largest scale never seen before in concert with congress and the u s treasury the money supply measured by m2 increased by more than 5 trillion a stunning one third increase in only a year and a half from the end of 2019 to this summer this month biden signed a roughly 1 trillion infrastructure bill into law and democrats want to pass another multi trillion spending bill including a massive social welfare expansion as the pandemic recedes buoyant demand is fueled by stimulus low interest rates and the reopening of businesses at the same time supply is hobbled by disrupted global supply chain covid 19 related disrupted transportation factory closures labor shortages energy shortages and port capacity constraints with the resulting typical supply demand mismatch inflation has zoomed to its highest levels in three decades milton friedman s famously said inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon as one characteristic outcome of a fiat money system the inflation upticks aren t temporary but structural it has to be tamed from both a macroeconomic and a microeconomic perspective the fed is now weighing how to fight inflation from a macroeconomic point of view via asset purchase taper and higher interest rates however the fed can t address the microeconomic problems of inflation moreover raising interest rates too fast or too soon carries multiple risks including political blowback it risks prematurely slowing down the hiring undermining stock and real estate values lifting budget deficit and putting the brakes on the biden administration is working on the microeconomic aspect of inflation specifically the covid 19 related supply side problems constraining u s labor markets and output such as increasing the capacity at ports and releasing raw materials or energy reserves however all these can only achieve limited utility because ultimately sound global supply chain and trade openness play a key role in fact a tariff reduction especially on goods from china could be the biggest lever to tame u s inflation under the sino u s phase one trade deal the u s still has 25 percent tariffs on roughly 250 billion in chinese goods and 7 5 percent tariffs on about 120 billion in other imports from china given the high tariffs u s imports from china still exhibit a rising trend in 2021 with u s consumers paying for the high tariffs not chinese firms the association of southeast asian nations and the european union are now bigger trading partners with china than the u s this should be attributed to the irreplaceability of china s manufacturing which is getting more and more comprehensive and advanced no longer based on cheap labor but on expertise and competence with the u s waged trade war compounded with the covid 19 pandemic the inflationary spike is becoming a hot international and domestic political

donna d errico can vividly recall the moment she decided to give up meat it was about eight years ago after she was invited by director producer sam simon a vegan to appear on his podcast the former baywatch star who grew up in the us south said she wasn t familiar with veganism or what it meant exactly we were chatting and then he asked me if i was vegan she told fox news i grew up in alabama and georgia we had barbecues chicken steak venison all kinds of meat so he stopped the interview and he said would you be willing to go in the next room and watch a video i thought to myself this is sam simon and i really respected him so i said sure i went to the next room and he had me watch this undercover footage of a factory farm at that time i had no idea there were factory farms or what they were i didn t know what conditions these animals were in before they ended up on our plates and in grocery stores i lived in the dark former baywatch star donna d errico turned 53 in march i watched the video she said i came back to the room where he had his podcast studio set up and i was in tears i told him i was never going to eat meat again he said well great let s finish the podcast and we did but from that point on i didn t need meat anymore the actress said that her journey to veganism originally began because she loved animals however she noticed some unexpected side effects along the way there were happy benefits like clearer skin better digestion better sleep but that s not why i do it said the 53 year old i do it for the animals d errico noted that it has gotten easier to become a vegan no matter the reason thanks to plenty of food options available d errico front in her baywatch days and a recent makeup free selfie the vegan alternatives for meat and cheese are so much better now than they used to be she said and you don t miss it it s so easy to switch over but if it s too hard to do that try it in baby steps like with meatless mondays take a week at a time there are so many tasty alternatives out there to make it easier and before you know it you won t miss it over the years the star has been outspoken about her passion for animal rights and while d errico has been widely complimented by the press for her appearance she hopes her message doesn t get lost along the way i m very flattered but i just feel like i m more than that she said i understand it comes with the territory and i understand that when you look at my social media there s that kind of stuff but i think it s very important for a lot of women and for myself to feel good about themselves i like to look my best and i do that for myself i don t do it to be compared to other women or to be complimented i don t do it for those reasons i do it for me it doesn t feel nice to hear somebody say you look great for your age or you still look amazing why not just say wow you look amazing and just move on i think critiquing women based on their age is unfair men don t face the same scrutiny and i don t think they would like either but i know it s not going to go away because it s part of our culture she s best known for baywatch but d errico says she stays out of the sun when it comes to looking and feeling her best d errico said she stopped baking in the sun i used to do the old baby oil baking in the sun thing long ago to get super tan she said i ve stopped that i ve let myself get a little pale and i wear sunblock all the time no matter the season if i want a little glow i ll use a self tanner or a tinted moisturiser i want to take care of my skin the best that i can and the number one thing you can do is stay out of the sun there s no magic product that will fix everything she said i don t have a special skincare regimen i sometimes forget to take my makeup off at night which is a huge no no i ll wake up with raccoon eyes from my mascara but i like to wash my face with a gentle cleanser and when it comes to trying new products i m a professional researcher i read up on everything i can because everyone swears that the new thing works i think we re all guilty of falling into that but i want to take care of myself as much as possible i just think we shouldn t be pressured into trying every single product that has all these claims use what truly works for your skin and keep it simple as for staying healthy d errico said she grazes throughout the day because that s what works best for her on a 2017 red carpet picture afp i like to stock up on vegetables fruits nuts and avocados she said i like to have things like impossible meat to make proper meals but i like to have a handful of things here and there throughout the day as opposed to three large meals i started doing that years ago and it just suits me better but again that just works for me it doesn t make it better than anything else these days d errico said she encourages her followers to help animals in need and one way to do just that is to adopt i recently adopted a dog he s deaf has a bum leg and no teeth but he s the sweetest dog in the world d errico said he sleeps with me every night i think more and more people are becoming aware of animal cruelty and getting outraged by what s still happening i just hope i can enlighten people this story originally appeared on fox news and is republished here with permission

a sign reading stay safe in regent street in london november 26 2021 a slew of nations moved to stop air travel from southern africa on friday and stocks plunged in asia and europe in reaction to news of a new potentially more transmissible c the omicron coronavirus variant spread around the world on sunday with new cases found in the netherlands denmark and australia even as more countries imposed travel restriction to try to seal themselves off the world health organization who said it was not yet clear whether omicron first detected in southern africa is more transmissible than other variants or if it causes more severe disease preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in south africa but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected rather than a result of specific infection who said it said understanding the
speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif walks with house majority whip james e clyburn d s c as they arrive for a news conference with democratic leadership jabin botsford the washington post washington the clock is ticking on congressional democrats as they return to washington this week where they hope to advance president joe biden s economic agenda authorize key defense programs and resolve a slew of urgent fiscal deadlines with little time left to the year the flurry of policy battles set the stage for a politically discordant december on capitol hill at a moment when tensions between democrats and republicans are running high and fears are resurfacing nationwide about a potential setback in the coronavirus pandemic for lawmakers their most immediate charge is to prevent a government shutdown a short term measure that funds federal agencies and initiatives is set to expire on friday meaning the house and senate need to act swiftly to adopt another spending fix or risk a major disruption then democrats and republicans may have less than two weeks to avert a second crisis they must move to preserve the country s ability to borrow to pay its bills addressing the cap known as the debt ceiling or washington will experience its first ever economy crippling default the two tasks normally engulf the capitol in partisan warfare as lawmakers turn the debates into political proxy fights over the future of federal spending the tensions could flash especially in the waning hours of this year as democrats simultaneously seek to approve a roughly 2 trillion package to overhaul the country s health care education climate immigration and tax laws a sprawling effort backed by biden that republicans vehemently oppose but democrats in recent days have projected an air of optimism stressing they can balance the routine duties of governance with their own political aims and accomplish their full slate of policy objectives before the end of 2021 as you know the legislative agenda for the remainder of 2021 is considerable senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y told lawmakers in a letter before they departed for the thanksgiving break later adding i am confident we can get each of these important items done this year but it will likely take some long nights and weekends the prospect of final four week sprint offers a fitting coda to an intense frenetic year on capitol hill democrats have rushed to try to enact as much of their agenda as possible in the 10 months they have controlled the white house the house and the senate a position of power they have not held since the very first days of 2011 party lawmakers adopted a 1 9 trillion relief package at the height of the pandemic in march muscling past vocal gop objections they steered to passage a more bipartisan 1 2 trillion infrastructure proposal that biden signed into law in november and democrats took the first steps on a final roughly 2 trillion bill to bolster the social safety net which cleared the house before thanksgiving despite unanimous republican opposition it now awaits a vote in the senate for all their public squabbles and private late night fights democrats attribute significant economic gains to their legislative efforts the latest unemployment measure from the labor department last week for example found that new jobless claims had tumbled to their lowest levels since november 1969 but republicans allege that democrats spending combined with a surge in pent up demand has contributed to a spike in prices that amounted last month to the largest such annual increase in about 30 years new unexpected economic challenges arose last week amid reports about a novel coronavirus variant dubbed as omicron while little is known about its transmissibility its arrival nonetheless rattled markets and governments into the weekend prompting a raft of travel restrictions not seen since the darker earlier days of the public health crisis speaking to reporters friday on a day when the dow jones industrial average fell by more than 900 points biden said the administration remains cautious about the trajectory of the variant but he also maintained he was not not at all concerned about the short term turmoil in the stock market for now congressional lawmakers are set to arrive in washington and attend to their agenda as planned in the senate democrats and republicans this week hope to finalize a roughly 768 billion annual measure to authorize key defense programs sorting through hundreds of amendments including an attempt to repeal a resolution that permitted the iraq war once its work is complete the senate plans to turn its attention later in the month to finalizing the 2 trillion measure known as the build back better act lawmakers still must work through a thicket of unresolved policy issues including lingering concerns about its price tag previously raised by sen joe manchin d w va a centrist without whom democrats cannot bring the bill to a vote manchin also has sounded public objections to some of its specific components such as its provision to provide paid family and medical leave benefits to millions of americans in doing so party leaders must further confront a slew of procedural issues since they have opted to advance the roughly 2 trillion tax and spending endeavor through the senate using a special process known as reconciliation the move allows democrats to sidestep a gop filibuster but only if they hew to strict rules that limit their policymaking specifically to issues that implicate the budget the process opens the door for a raft of behind the scenes haggling with the chamber s parliamentarian that is set to intensify this week addressing the senate before the thanksgiving break schumer said he hopes to complete work on the bill before christmas in the meantime democratic leaders in congress also must respond to two more rigid political deadlines beginning with an urgent need to fund the federal government by dec 3 democrats and republicans brokered an initial short term extension at the end of september narrowly averting a shutdown in a move that offered them more time to craft spending bills that could cover washington operations through the 2022 fiscal year that ends in september but their work remains far from finished even as the stopgap nears its expiration opening the door for another round of eleventh hour sparring over a temporary fix in recent weeks lawmakers in the house and senate have warred in part over how long a second stopgap measure should last democrats including rep rosa delauro d conn the leader of the house appropriations committee have sought only a brief extension in an attempt to keep up the pressure on republicans to come to a deal on a dozen longer term spending proposals covering major federal operations those fuller appropriations bills would enact biden s broader budgetary goals securing new funding in areas including housing education and health care republicans however hope to adopt a measure that funds the government into the spring or later gop lawmakers including sen richard shelby r ala the leader of his chamber s appropriations panel previously has identified march as a preferred timeline otherwise republicans have opposed biden s long sought spending increases as well as democrats efforts to slash funding for defense in recent days democratic leaders have eyed late january as a potential end date for a new spending arrangement according to two people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to describe negotiations that are still in flux once a date is settled some in the party hope they can sidestep any political histrionics and adopt the stopgap in time for the dec 3 deadline though some house republicans in recent days have tried to instigate a political feud taking to twitter this weekend rep marjorie taylor greene r ga even went as far as to call on her party to shut down the government in order to oppose democrats spending agenda and thwart biden s recent federal mandates on vaccines in the end though the two parties must come to an agreement particularly in the narrowly divided senate where democratic votes alone cannot keep the government functioning uninterrupted the precarious political dynamic prompted the biden administration to call on congress earlier this month to reach a full year deal rather than proffer a series of stopgaps congress has a long history of reaching bipartisan appropriations agreements that benefit the american people and fund critical public health services the office of management and budget stressed in a public memo at the time over the coming weeks lawmakers have an opportunity and obligation to do so again the next critical fiscal deadline could arrive 12 days later at which point congress must act to address the country s borrowing cap known as the debt ceiling unless lawmakers raise it by a specific amount or suspend it entirely the u s government could fall behind on its payments an unprecedented calamity that could thrust the country back into an economic recession in october lawmakers reached an eleventh hour agreement to raise the debt ceiling by more than 300 billion essentially giving washington the power to borrow into early december the deal came after weeks of political brinkmanship driven chiefly by republicans who initially refused to supply their must have votes in the senate as part of a campaign to undermine biden s economic agenda exiting that battle senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky stressed at the time that the gop would not support another increase he instead demanded that democrats address the debt ceiling on their own relying on the same parliamentary maneuver that they intend to use to pass their 2 trillion economic package in response schumer reaffirmed his refusal to invoke the process known as reconciliation creating a logjam since then though democratic and republican leaders have toned down their rhetoric in recent weeks mcconnell said at a news conference earlier in november that he thought lawmakers eventually would figure out how to avoid default and the gop leader has held private talks with schumer to discuss the debt ceiling along with other pending business in the final weeks of the year both offices declined to comment on the talks in the meantime though the exact debt ceiling deadline is not entirely clear in a letter to lawmakers earlier in november treasury secretary janet yellen has said the government can confidently pay its bills until dec 15 after that she said there are scenarios in which treasury would be left with insufficient remaining resources to continue to finance the operations of the u s government beyond this date the bipartisan policy center meanwhile has suggested the deadline known as the x date could come as late as mid february the divergence reflects the difficulty in calculating washington s cash flows at the end of the year particularly amid the extraordinary spending levels during the pandemic
chicago tribune tns the semiconductor shortage has disrupted the auto industry throughout 2021 halting production reducing inventory and raising prices a formula that has left some frustrated buyers searching for any tires to kick for some chicago area dealers the scarcity of new cars has made for a surprisingly good year as demand outstrips supply and profits soar the nice thing is that we re selling cars before they hit ground said greg mauro 61 owner of gregory auto group which has three dealerships in the northern suburbs of chicago including hyundai mitsubishi and infiniti we ve had people literally follow transport trucks to our locations and say i want that 2022 tucson on the truck and i hope it s not spoken for it s kind of crazy but we try to make it work the auto industry seemed to be recovering after surviving plant shutdowns at the onset of the pandemic in 2020 but a dearth of semiconductors which control everything from collision avoidance sensors to infotainment systems has stalled auto production again this year with plants shutting down for weeks and in some cases months at a time for want of the crucial chips the pandemic driven global supply chain crisis has created a growing list of shortages from fast food containers to stuffed animals semiconductors are among the tiniest links in the chain but the fallout from the chip shortage has been enormous curtailing technically advanced products such as smartphones home appliances and automobiles nowhere is this more acute our supply chain problems than in the semiconductor industry commerce secretary gina raimondo told the economic club of chicago earlier this month congress is weighing a measure to allocate 52 billion to boost semiconductor manufacturing in the u s the birthplace of an industry that has since migrated primarily to taiwan it can t come soon enough for the auto industry which is projected to produce 7 7 million fewer vehicles and lose 210 billion in revenues globally this year due to the semiconductor shortage according to consulting firm alixpartners new vehicle sales in the u s declined precipitously in 2020 as production ground to a halt at the start of the covid 19 pandemic dropping from about 17 million vehicles the previous year to 14 6 million the lowest total since 2012 according to car shopping website edmunds edmunds is projecting that about 15 million new vehicles will be sold in 2021 a number that was revised downward as the semiconductor shortage persisted throughout the year consumers still want cars said ivan drury senior manager of insights at edmunds they just can t buy them because of the semiconductor shortage earlier in the year industry analysts expected the semiconductor shortage would ease by the fourth quarter but it now looks like it will last well into next year drury said the ongoing shortage has meant significant manufacturing interruptions at auto plants around the country the semiconductor shortage has shaken up the traditional car shopping process haggling is a thing of the past buyers are preordering vehicles or taking what they can get off the lot and dealers are scrambling to find cars new or used to sell in what has become a less frequent but increasingly lucrative transaction last month new vehicles sold at an average of 513 over sticker price according to edmunds during october 2019 before the pandemic new cars sold at a discount of 2 673 below the retail price it s a new business model sell less make more said john webb 55 a partner in packey webb ford a nearly 60 year old downers grove illinois car dealership started by his father patrick packey webb packey webb ford has about 37 new cars on its lot far below the 400 or so new vehicles it typically kept in stock before the pandemic and semiconductor shortage disrupted auto production webb said of the 20 new cars recently delivered to the dealership 17 were sold before arrival for the dealership the build to order model means lowering carrying costs for the buyer it means the end of the impulse purchase webb said you see a shiny new car in the showroom you want to buy it right now webb said they ve got to wait three or four months now to get an order gregory hyundai in highland park illinois has about 60 new vehicles on the lot less than a third of its normal inventory cars are selling at sticker price and orders can take up to four months mauro said customers who can t wait are taking what they can find and in some cases going to great lengths to get first dibs on newly arriving vehicles including following the delivery trailer to the dealership mauro said the current environment is a lot harder on customers than dealers our gross margins are higher than i ve seen in 40 years mauro said with demand exceeding supply mauro said he has resisted charging above the manufacturer s suggested retail price he has also rejected offers to sell his cars at a premium through brokers from other parts of the country where supply is even more scarce instead mauro is focused on his existing customer base and other local buyers hoping to make up any lost sales revenue on the service end of the business an increasingly important profit center for dealerships which can pay dividends for years after the sale but that end of the business proved challenging this year when dozens of chicago area auto dealers had to navigate an eight week mechanics strike that shut down service in august and september there are signs that the worst of the semiconductor shortage may be in the rearview mirror on thursday ford and gm both said they were pursuing strategic partnerships to produce semiconductor chips down the road auto industry analyst drury said the semiconductor shortage seems to be in a trough and is not getting any lower offering some hope that the production pipeline can accelerate in the coming months while 2022 models are beginning to filter into circulation it may be another relatively rare vintage with new cars expected to be in short supply for some time drury said as far as getting enough units within the market to start seeing some semblance of normalcy you ve got to give it a year drury said i mean we can t even backfill what people are wanting to buy today
washington the top u s infectious disease official dr anthony fauci told president joe biden on sunday it will take about two weeks to have definitive information on the new coronavirus variant omicron that has sparked new travel restrictions and shaken financial markets biden returning to washington following the thanksgiving holiday weekend was briefed in person by his coronavirus response team on sunday afternoon as officials expect the new variant to reach the united states despite an impending ban on travelers from southern africa where it was first detected fauci said he believes existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of covid and officials reiterated their recommendation for vaccinated americans to get booster shots according to a

fauci told abc news this week that the new variant would inevitably reach the united states u s health officials were to speak with counterparts in south africa to get more information in real time fauci told nbc adding the flight curbs would give them more time to gather information and weigh possible action it clearly is giving indication that it has the capability of transmitting rapidly that s the thing that s causing us now to be concerned he added on nbc its appearance in the united states where 30 of the population has not received a single dose of vaccine could threaten to undermine the nation s recovery nearly two years after covid 19 s emergence and further pressure local healthcare systems already taxed by the recent delta variant rising cases as colder weather forces more

no new screening or tracing requirements have been introduced flights by delta air lines and united airlines have continued from south africa to the united states since the variant was discovered fauci and other top officials said the sudden burst of cases made omicron worrisome and it remained unclear how current vaccines or therapeutics could be impacted we need more data there before we can

these cannabis stocks are no brainers to add to your portfolio the recent ruling by the south dakota supreme court that struck down a voter referendum approving legalized marijuana shows the difficult road ahead for cannabis stocks in dealing with state by state approvals a cohesive national policy is required that s why the introduction of a republican sponsored bill to legalize pot at the federal level is an important development it could point the way toward a bipartisan agreement but whether marijuana remains a patchwork quilt of state sanction or it gets the nod nationally the following three cannabis companies are ones to buy right now what s not to like about rising revenue and widening margins alex carchidi scotts miracle gro i d be willing to buy a few shares of scotts miracle gro smg 3 33 without hesitation because it s a highly diversified business that makes the gardening tools and plant nutrients that marijuana growers need to keep making money as a result of hot demand from newly opened cannabis facilities its cannabis cultivation equipment subsidiary hawthorne is driving much of the company s top line growth though its sales contracted by 2 year over year for q4 hawthorne s full year revenue for 2021 grew by 39 which isn t half bad similarly because of the strong seasonality of scotts consumer gardening segment fourth quarter revenue dipped 17 but companywide sales for the year grew by 19 as the marijuana industry in the u s continues to grow it ll continue to need the gear hawthorne provides in greater and greater quantities plus if consumers need to buy cannabis year round hawthorne will need to sell growers the right gear every quarter which could reduce some of the seasonality that i suspect scares some investors away from scotts stock right now there s every indication that the company will rise to meet the marijuana boom and reward its shareholders in the process scotts is improving its efficiency over time across several metrics while committing to another round of share repurchases worth up to 300 million in 2022 over the past five years its annual profit margin has risen by nearly 26 reaching its current level of 10 41 and its annual return on invested capital roic rose by 70 3 in the same period reaching 18 53 that means the company is getting better at squeezing more money out of both its operations and its equity from sources such as shareholders in short scotts has the right set of products in the market at the right time and it has a history of pulling through for its shareholders over the long term for me there s nothing better thumbs up for this bargain weed stock eric volkman green thumb industries pot companies with a strong retail presence will be the first ones to benefit when federal cannabis law is reformed or several more states flip the switch on recreational legalization granted neither is likely to happen anytime soon but green thumb industries gtbif 9 25 is a company beautifully poised to leap on the opportunity in many ways green thumb is a bellwether retail facing pot stock as it s among the top three u s multistate operators msos in terms of revenue along with rivals curaleaf and trulieve cannabis it also bucks the money losing mso standard by being consistently in the black of late with five consecutive quarters of bottom line profitability in fact green thumb did smashingly well in its most recently reported quarter its q3 revenue came in at 235 million 49 higher year over year and 5 better than the q2 result net profit leaped even further ahead at 21 6 million it was more than double the year ago figure although it represented an 8 decline from the previous quarter among the major u s msos in my opinion green thumb has one of the best geographic footprints this starts with its own home state illinois in which recreational weed got off to a roaring start when it became law at the beginning of 2020 in october the state surpassed 1 billion in year to date recreational sales that s well above the total for the entirety of 2020 which was only 669 million green thumb s rise is a go to dispensary in the state with nine locations green thumb s retail presence covers not only established locales such as illinois but also ones that have yet to establish their recently legalized recreational markets there are three rises apiece in both new york and new jersey and a pair in virginia pot stocks aren t the flavor of the month just now because of the more stop than start nature of u s decriminalization legalization green thumb stock has been unfairly punished in the process but that provides opportunity for investors to snap up the shares at a relatively cheap price they re down by nearly 40 from their one year peak after all all the pieces are in place for a big growth spurt rich duprey growgeneration i like growgeneration grwg 8 11 for much the same reason my colleague alex like scotts miracle gro it s a picks and shovels cannabis company that can win regardless of which pot stocks actually grow the fastest as the country s largest specialty hydroponic and organic garden center supplier growgeneration sells to marijuana growers the required supplies and equipment they need to produce pot for sale particularly within its own line of branded products such as char coir coconut coir and power si plant additives although it operates a network of 62 stores across 13 states it plans to expand in 2022 to all 18 states that have adult use laws in effect growgeneration s products are sold in third party outlets as well power si for example is available in 500 independent hydroponic locations across the u s and it now sells across canada the u k and europe that s helping push sales higher which more than doubled in the third quarter to 116 million as comparable sales were up nearly 16 from last year despite its success the market has punished growgeneration its stock is down 25 since it reported earnings on nov 11 and shares have lost nearly three quarters of their value from the highs they hit back in february even as it saw net profits grow 20 from last year as adjusted earnings of 0 18 per share were 38 above the year ago figure and double the consensus estimates adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of 10 8 million fell short of analyst expectations although it was a record amount for growgeneration guidance also weighed on the stock as fourth quarter sales and profit margins will be pressured by an oversupply situation in california the largest marijuana market good for investors wall street forecasts that growgeneration will quadruple sales by the middle of the decade while ebitda will expand fivefold that makes the cannabis supplier company a discounted play and one investors might not want to wait too long to buy

transmission by imposing travel restrictions beginning at 12 01am et 1 01pm singapore time on monday it will bar entry of nearly all foreign nationals who have been in any of eight southern african countries within the last 14 days and has warned americans against travelling to those nations us citizens who have travelled to the countries will still be able to enter the united states flights by delta air lines and united airlines have continued from south africa to the united states since the variant was discovered passengers interviewed by cnn as they arrived on flights from southern africa at two us airports one in atlanta and the other at newark said they were not subject to any specific checks or restrictions dr fauci and other top officials said the sudden burst of cases made omicron worrisome and it remained unclear how current vaccines or therapeutics could be impacted we need more data there before we can say confidently that this is not a severe version of the virus but we should find that out in the next couple weeks outgoing national institutes of health director dr francis collins told fox news sunday vaccine makers pfizer biontech and moderna have said they expect more information soon we have to go through a couple of weeks yet of uncertainty moderna chief medical officer dr paul burton told cnn saying omicron s transmissibility and severity were also still unknown along with current vaccines effectiveness against it clarion call for shots dr fauci pressed americans to continue to get covid 19 vaccines and boosters while experts evaluate omicron this is a clarion call to get vaccinated he told nbc white house chief of staff ron klain echoed that sentiment saying on twitter the thing every vaccinated adult should do now if they have not done it yet is get a booster shot the united states has recorded over 1 1 million new covid cases in the last 14 days up 9 per cent from the prior two weeks reuters data shows with michigan and minnesota leading the nation in new cases based on infections per 100 000 residents the governor of one hard hit state arkansas asa hutchinson expressed worry over another blow from the latest variant telling cnn s state of the union program delta has been tough on us and so we don t welcome a new variant and it is a great concern the variant could cast a pall over the rest of the us holiday season and potentially impact companies return to office plans depending on what officials discover in coming weeks a number of banks and other firms have said they planned for workers to come back in january on wall street sources at major us banks and european banks with large us operations said they were not yet changing their policies but were monitoring the situation
don t miss out on the headlines from celebrity life followed categories will be added to my news donna d errico can vividly recall the moment she decided to give up meat it was about eight years ago after she was invited by director producer sam simon a vegan to appear on his podcast the former baywatch star who grew up in the us south said she wasn t familiar with veganism or what it meant exactly we were chatting and then he asked me if i was vegan she told fox news i grew up in alabama and georgia we had barbecues chicken steak venison all kinds of meat so he stopped the interview and he said would you be willing to go in the next room and watch a video i thought to myself this is sam simon and i really respected him so i said sure i went to the next room and he had me watch this undercover footage of a factory farm at that time i had no idea there were factory farms or what they were i didn t know what conditions these animals were in before they ended up on our plates and in grocery stores i lived in the dark former baywatch star donna d errico turned 53 in march i watched the video she said i came back to the room where he had his podcast studio set up and i was in tears i told him i was never going to eat meat again he said well great let s finish the podcast and we did but from that point on i didn t need meat anymore the actress said that her journey to veganism originally began because she loved animals however she noticed some unexpected side effects along the way there were happy benefits like clearer skin better digestion better sleep but that s not why i do it said the 53 year old i do it for the animals d errico noted that it has gotten easier to become a vegan no matter the reason thanks to plenty of food options available d errico front in her baywatch days and a recent makeup free selfie the vegan alternatives for meat and cheese are so much better now than they used to be she said and you don t miss it it s so easy to switch over but if it s too hard to do that try it in baby steps like with meatless mondays take a week at a time there are so many tasty alternatives out there to make it easier and before you know it you won t miss it over the years the star has been outspoken about her passion for animal rights and while d errico has been widely complimented by the press for her appearance she hopes her message doesn t get lost along the way i m very flattered but i just feel like i m more than that she said i understand it comes with the territory and i understand that when you look at my social media there s that kind of stuff but i think it s very important for a lot of women and for myself to feel good about themselves i like to look my best and i do that for myself i don t do it to be compared to other women or to be complimented i don t do it for those reasons i do it for me it doesn t feel nice to hear somebody say you look great for your age or you still look amazing why not just say wow you look amazing and just move on i think critiquing women based on their age is unfair men don t face the same scrutiny and i don t think they would like either but i know it s not going to go away because it s part of our culture she s best known for baywatch but d errico says she stays out of the sun when it comes to looking and feeling her best d errico said she stopped baking in the sun i used to do the old baby oil baking in the sun thing long ago to get super tan she said i ve stopped that i ve let myself get a little pale and i wear sunblock all the time no matter the season if i want a little glow i ll use a self tanner or a tinted moisturiser i want to take care of my skin the best that i can and the number one thing you can do is stay out of the sun there s no magic product that will fix everything she said i don t have a special skincare regimen i sometimes forget to take my makeup off at night which is a huge no no i ll wake up with raccoon eyes from my mascara but i like to wash my face with a gentle cleanser and when it comes to trying new products i m a professional researcher i read up on everything i can because everyone swears that the new thing works i think we re all guilty of falling into that but i want to take care of myself as much as possible i just think we shouldn t be pressured into trying every single product that has all these claims use what truly works for your skin and keep it simple as for staying healthy d errico said she grazes throughout the day because that s what works best for her on a 2017 red carpet picture afp i like to stock up on vegetables fruits nuts and avocados she said i like to have things like impossible meat to make proper meals but i like to have a handful of things here and there throughout the day as opposed to three large meals i started doing that years ago and it just suits me better but again that just works for me it doesn t make it better than anything else these days d errico said she encourages her followers to help animals in need and one way to do just that is to adopt i recently adopted a dog he s deaf has a bum leg and no teeth but he s the sweetest dog in the world d errico said he sleeps with me every night i think more and more people are becoming aware of animal cruelty and getting outraged by what s still happening i just hope i can enlighten people this story originally appeared on fox news and is republished here with permission originally published as why 53 year old baywatch star donna d errico looks decades younger

the newly discovered omicron covid 19 variant has been confirmed in sydney with two returned travellers testing positive for the strain both people who are fully vaccinated and were asymptomatic are isolated in the state s special health accommodation after returning from southern africa on saturday 27th of november the passengers were amongst 14 people from southern africa who arrived on qatar airways qr908 doha to sydney the remaining 12 passengers from southern africa are undertaking 14 days of hotel quarantine in the special health accommodation around 260 passengers and aircrew on the flight are considered close contacts and have been directed to isolate according to nsw health with the new variant brings new travel restrictions for people arriving from the southern africa region travellers arriving in nsw and victoria from south africa lesotho botswana zimbabwe mozambique namibia eswatini malawi and seychelles during the 14 day period before their arrival in nsw must enter hotel quarantine for 14 days irrespective of their vaccination status all travellers who have been in any other overseas country during the 14 day period before their arrival in nsw and victoria must travel directly to their place of residence or accommodation and isolate for 72 hours pending further health advice questioned if the government could go further than this initial list of nine restricted countries greg hunt featured image said it could if necessary let me be absolutely clear i said yesterday if more actions are required we will not hesitate today we have taken those actions today i m saying if the medical evidence shows that further actions are required we will not hesitate to take them and that may involve strengthening or expanding the restrictions it may involve reducing the restrictions and the temporary measures which we ve put in place the world will learn a lot over the coming weeks and what we ve done is make sure that no person who has been in the nine southern african countries can enter australia unless they re australian citizens residents or dependents and if they fall into that category they must have 14 days supervised quarantine said hunt hunt also asked the government s expert immunisation panel to review the time frame for covid 19 booster shots in light of the new variant the current advice from the australian technical advisory group on immunisation s atagi is that a person receives a booster shot six months after their second dose we will as ever allow them atagi to act independently and continue to follow their advice mr hunt said but we re prepared with supplies we are already one of the earliest nations in the world after israel to have a whole of nation booster program if they recommend changes we will follow those changes scott morrison also expressed his concern for the new strain however he has faith in the respective state departments and their handling of it it moved from being a variant of investigation to a variant of concern within the space of 24 hours and as a result late on friday night and again early on saturday morning i convened with the chief medical officer and the health minister and the secretary of the health department and immediately put in place a set of actions that were implemented successfully yesterday and i spoke both with the premiers of new south wales and victoria and i support the measures that they are taking within their jurisdictions we ve taken measures in our jurisdiction and that was intended for the states to then follow through on the areas that fell within their responsibilities said morrison hit hard by the omicron variant are companies expected to benefit from this year s economic reopening amc entertainment united airlines and carnival corp were hammered from fears of a possibly vaccine resistant covid strain emerging travel and leisure stocks bore significant losses in the us with carriers united delta air and american airlines losing between 8 and 10 hotel chains hyatt marriott and hilton fell between 8 and 11 while cruise operators carnival royal caribbean and norwegian slumped about 10 each and theatre chain amc sank 6 2 the new variant announcement has been met with other nations also placing restrictions on southern african countries following confirmed cases of the omicron variant in the uk germany and italy travel restrictions have been placed on the southern african nations by the uk the us japan israel and the eu however this was met with disappointment by south africa s minister for tourism lindiwe sisulu while this is most disappointing south africa will continue working with policy makers in the uk japan israel and european union to ensure that the best possible interventions are put in place she said we remain open for business and tourism travel and we appreciate the continued support from various partners across the world and are confident that through the tourism recovery plan in place we

image quality enhanced workflows increased productivity improved patient comfort and greater sustainability signa hero aims to make challenging exams simpler turning difficult to routine true heroes are built for any challenge and today s healthcare workers have proven themselves true heroes says jie xue president ceo magnetic resonance imaging ge healthcare while the world s healthcare heroes cared for patients on the frontlines our ge healthcare team kept working the background on cutting edge technologies to help reduce the burden on clinicians and improve patient outcomes the result is signa hero a system dedicated to all those who always care for our global community healthcare systems and radiology departments in particular face more strain than ever in the united states alone the covid 19 pandemic is expected to have led to a 35 percent drop in mri procedure volume in 2020 from 42 million procedures in 2019 to an estimated 27 4 million in 2020iii this backlog in non urgent patient care combined with today s growing disease burden and industry wide staff shortages demands new solutions to help clinicians manage today s evolving needs to help address these challenges ge healthcare designed signa hero to help accommodate more patients of all shapes and sizes offering a 70 cm bore and detachable table for enhanced patient comfort additionally the system unlocks new clinical workflows for today s healthcare heroes leveraging artificial intelligence to improve the clarity of images while increasing operational efficiency this includes air recon dl ge healthcare s pioneering deep learning image reconstruction technology that works across all anatomies and offers clinicians a 30 50 percent reduction in exam timesiv prior to going live we were doing on average 10 12 patients a day with air recon dl we were able to add four time slots a day on average explains dr randall stenoien md owner and ceo of houston medical imaging as we come out of covid and increase volumes further we re going to have a really tremendous opportunity to be more efficient and improve patient outcomes it s been a wonderful experience to date air recon dl has benefited nearly one million patients around the world and feedback from clinical users has been overwhelmingly positive including observations of sharper and less noisy images stenoien adds we were seeing a dramatic reduction in scan times one of our first patients was a pituitary scan 30 minutes 40 seconds in january on the same scanner the scan was 14 minutes and 42 seconds a 52 percent reduction and when i sent those images to my neuroradiologist i immediately got a phone call to ask what in the world had happened it was the prettiest pituitary scan she d ever seen now at the radiological society of north america s 2021 annual meeting ge healthcare is excited to announce two new extensions of this cutting edge deep learning technology including 3d sequences and propeller for motion robustnessii both solutions are designed to provide sharper images with better signals in half the time for nearly 90 percent of the daily clinical scans done regardless of the anatomy being imaged furthermore

positioning and handling during an mri scan each coil is lightweight and flexible to closely wrap around patients like a blanket to fit each patients form helping them achieve the best results possible this feature is especially useful in light of today s disease burden for example prostate imaging a traditionally uncomfortable experience is now much faster simpler and more comfortable with wing to wing clinical solutions like one stop prostate imaging with air coils and air recon dl which can complete the patient scan in less than 15 minutes additionally air touch and air x leverage the power of ge healthcare s edison platform to help daily practice run smoother to begin air touch dramatically simplifies scan set up for technologists reducing set up time by up to 37 percent with automated coil selection and landmarking that optimizes key elements in the coil configuration automatically to get an excellent image for every patient while using the full power of each coil then air x provides automated slice prescriptions to help reduce previously redundant manual steps the ai based automated workflow tool for brain and knee scanning helps increase consistency and productivity for greater operational efficiency ge healthcare also designed the system with sustainability in mind to help healthcare systems save on operational costs in the long run signa hero is an

a worrisome new strain of the coronavirus pushed the pandemic back to the forefront sunday spurring global travel restrictions and raising alarm about the south african variant s potential to deliver another medical and economic blow to the u s white house chief medical adviser dr anthony fauci said that no cases have been detected in the u s but said it was only a matter of time before the omicron variant reaches american shores as we all know when you have a virus that has already gone to multiple countries inevitably it will be here said dr fauci on abc s this week the question is will we be prepared for it and the preparation that we have ongoing for what we re doing now with the delta variant just needs to be revved up he warned indeed canadian officials announced sunday that the omicron variant had reached their country with two cases in the province of ontario putting the latest virus mutation on america s largest land border with its biggest trading partner australia also found two cases and the netherlands found 13 by sunday a strong indication that the virus already has spread far beyond southern africa see also canada confirms first two cases of omicron covid 19 variant the white house covid response team urged americans to get fully vaccinated or a booster shot as soon as possible after meeting sunday on the variant with president biden and dr fauci even before the first u s case the variant was taking a toll the dow jones industrial average fell 905 points or 2 5 friday for its biggest plunge since june 2020 as the world health organization who announced that omicron had been labeled a variant of concern the first since the delta variant was detected in december 2020 mr biden announced flight restrictions on south africa and seven other african countries slated to take effect monday others announcing travel limits to the southern africa region included the european union canada israel and singapore dr fauci acknowledged that travel bans are ineffective against viruses in the long run but said that they can slow things down giving countries a chance to prepare for the worst what you can do is you can delay it enough to get us better prepared and that s the thing that people need to understand he said if you re going to do the travel ban the way we ve done now and that we re implementing right now utilize the time that you re buying to fill in the gaps the variant has also raised concerns about another round of economically devastating and politically divisive lockdowns but dr fauci said it was really too early to say whether such steps would be necessary people talking about lockdowns people talking about that let s see what the information that we re getting in real time tells us and we ll make decisions based on the science and the evidence the way we always do he said but you want to be prepared to do anything and everything and that s the reason why we re paying such close attention to this and why we re all over it dr francis collins director of the national institutes of health acknowledged that it s certainly not good news we don t know yet how much of an impact this will have dr collins said on cnn s state of the union it ought to redouble our efforts to use the tools that we have which are vaccinations and boosters and to be sure we re getting those to the rest of the world too which the u s is doing more than any other country the virus is not tired of us whether the omicron variant spurs another round of shutdown orders hinges on its factors including severity and transmissibility neither of which is fully understood at this point according to the who in a sunday statement who said that the number of cases in south africa pushed by the variant is rising but that epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of omicron or other factors also under study is whether omicron causes more severe infections than other variants including delta preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in south africa but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected rather than a result of specific infection with omicron who said there is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with omicron are different from those from other variants another major question is whether the covid 19 vaccine is effective against the omicron variant but dr collins said there is reason for optimism based on what we ve learned so far with alpha beta gamma and delta the vaccines which are generated against the original virus still work and the boosters work particularly well dr collins told cnn he said the covid 19 booster basically enlarges the capacity of your immune system to recognize all kinds of different spike proteins it s never seen this is a great day to go and get boosted or find out how to do so at vaccines gov he said still unknown whether omicron could compete against delta referring to the highly contagious delta variant although omicron certainly shows the signs of being able to spread quickly said dr collins he cited the example of the beta variant which never really took off because delta was so incredibly effective in spreading that it couldn t compete we don t know what omicron will look like if it gets to our country and i hope it doesn t but it s fairly likely we ll see cases dr collins said will it be able to compete or will it fizzle in the next few weeks he said there should be more answers as medical experts gain data from south africa including information on the effectiveness of the vaccination in combating the variant though the issue is complicated by south africa s low vaccination rate we ll get some sense of that already from what s happening in south africa because about 37 of south africans are vaccinated dr collins said we should be able to find out in the next two or three weeks is the protection they re having somewhat better than the unvaccinated people he added the strain has already spurred political wrangling rep thomas massie kentucky republican mocked the biden administration s travel ban tweeting no worries travel ban begins next week because you know variants don t spread on holiday weekends he added ps who really believes this variant isn t already here the south africa ministry of international relations and cooperation accused other nations saturday of punishing the nation for reporting the variant by cutting off travel this latest round of travel bans is akin to punishing south africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker the foreign ministry said excellent science should be applauded and not punished the global community needs collaboration and partnerships in the management of the covid 19 pandemic the covid 19 variants are named after greek alphabet letters but who skipped the 13th and 14th letters nu and xi in labeling the omicron variant the decision to leapfrog letters prompted accusations of pandering to china a longstanding charge since the beginning of the virus in wuhan china the english spelling of xi is the same as the name of chinese president xi jinping although who said xi was skipped to avoid giving offense to regions and groups nu is too easily confounded with new and xi was not used because it is a common last name and who best practices for naming disease suggest avoiding causing offense to any cultural social national regional professional or ethnic groups the who said in an email the 14th letter of the greek alphabet although it is represented in english as xi is pronounced gz as in most english pronunciations of exactly it is unrelated to the chinese name xi which is a latin alphabet representation of a pictograph that is pronounced like the english feminine pronoun she among those who criticized the move were sen ted cruz texas republican and donald trump jr both longtime who critics if the who is this scared of the chinese communist party how can they be trusted to call them out the next time they re trying to cover up a catastrophic global pandemic asked mr cruz in a friday tweet the variant also presents another challenge for mr biden as he struggles with a free fall in the polls his approval rating on his handling of the pandemic has dropped from 69 in january to 48 as of saturday according to fivethirtyeight more than 770 000 people in the u s and 5 2 million people worldwide have died of covid 19 since the outbreak began in december 2019 in china dr collins said the variant means that we need to pay attention to those mitigation strategies that people are just really sick of like wearing masks when you re indoors with other people who might not be vaccinated and keeping that social distance i know america you re really tired of hearing those things but the virus is not tired of us and it s shape shifting itself he said if you imagine we re on a racetrack here the virus just sort of emerged in a new version and it s trying to catch up with us shen wu tan and victor morton contributed to this report for more information visit the washington times covid 19

don t miss out on the headlines from entertainment followed categories will be added to my news donna d errico can vividly recall the moment she decided to give up meat it was about eight years ago after she was invited by director producer sam simon a vegan to appear on his podcast the former baywatch star who grew up in the us south said she wasn t familiar with veganism or what it meant exactly we were chatting and then he asked me if i was vegan she told fox news i grew up in alabama and georgia we had barbecues chicken steak venison all kinds of meat so he stopped the interview and he said would you be willing to go in the next room and watch a video i thought to myself this is sam simon and i really respected him so i said sure i went to the next room and he had me watch this undercover footage of a factory farm at that time i had no idea there were factory farms or what they were i didn t know what conditions these animals were in before they ended up on our plates and in grocery stores i lived in the dark former baywatch star donna d errico turned 53 in march i watched the video she said i came back to the room where he had his podcast studio set up and i was in tears i told him i was never going to eat meat again he said well great let s finish the podcast and we did but from that point on i didn t need meat anymore the actress said that her journey to veganism originally began because she loved animals however she noticed some unexpected side effects along the way there were happy benefits like clearer skin better digestion better sleep but that s not why i do it said the 53 year old i do it for the animals d errico noted that it has gotten easier to become a vegan no matter the reason thanks to plenty of food options available d errico front in her baywatch days and a recent makeup free selfie the vegan alternatives for meat and cheese are so much better now than they used to be she said and you don t miss it it s so easy to switch over but if it s too hard to do that try it in baby steps like with meatless mondays take a week at a time there are so many tasty alternatives out there to make it easier and before you know it you won t miss it over the years the star has been outspoken about her passion for animal rights and while d errico has been widely complimented by the press for her appearance she hopes her message doesn t get lost along the way i m very flattered but i just feel like i m more than that she said i understand it comes with the territory and i understand that when you look at my social media there s that kind of stuff but i think it s very important for a lot of women and for myself to feel good about themselves i like to look my best and i do that for myself i don t do it to be compared to other women or to be complimented i don t do it for those reasons i do it for me it doesn t feel nice to hear somebody say you look great for your age or you still look amazing why not just say wow you look amazing and just move on i think critiquing women based on their age is unfair men don t face the same scrutiny and i don t think they would like either but i know it s not going to go away because it s part of our culture she s best known for baywatch but d errico says she stays out of the sun when it comes to looking and feeling her best d errico said she stopped baking in the sun i used to do the old baby oil baking in the sun thing long ago to get super tan she said i ve stopped that i ve let myself get a little pale and i wear sunblock all the time no matter the season if i want a little glow i ll use a self tanner or a tinted moisturiser i want to take care of my skin the best that i can and the number one thing you can do is stay out of the sun there s no magic product that will fix everything she said i don t have a special skincare regimen i sometimes forget to take my makeup off at night which is a huge no no i ll wake up with raccoon eyes from my mascara but i like to wash my face with a gentle cleanser and when it comes to trying new products i m a professional researcher i read up on everything i can because everyone swears that the new thing works i think we re all guilty of falling into that but i want to take care of myself as much as possible i just think we shouldn t be pressured into trying every single product that has all these claims use what truly works for your skin and keep it simple as for staying healthy d errico said she grazes throughout the day because that s what works best for her on a 2017 red carpet picture afp i like to stock up on vegetables fruits nuts and avocados she said i like to have things like impossible meat to make proper meals but i like to have a handful of things here and there throughout the day as opposed to three large meals i started doing that years ago and it just suits me better but again that just works for me it doesn t make it better than anything else these days d errico said she encourages her followers to help animals in need and one way to do just that is to adopt i recently adopted a dog he s deaf has a bum leg and no teeth but he s the sweetest dog in the world d errico said he sleeps with me every night i think more and more people are becoming aware of animal cruelty and getting outraged by what s still happening i just hope i can enlighten people this story originally appeared on fox news and is republished here with permission originally published as why 53 year old baywatch star donna d errico looks decades younger

25 years ago ceasefire in guatemala on december 4 1996 a top guatemalan general and other members of the government joined guerrilla leaders in signing a definite ceasefire in oslo norway with this agreement the weapons will be silenced forever declared rolando moran a commander in the guatemalan national revolutionary union a coalition of three guerrilla movements the civil war in the poverty stricken central american nation had lasted with varying degrees of intensity for three and a half decades costing over 100 000 lives in addition to the death toll an estimated further 40 000 were disappeared and 1 million more were turned into refugees and exiles the guatemalan military was notorious for its torture and murder of thousands of political opponents and its indiscriminate killing sprees of poor peasants particularly native people the truth commission established as part of the peace process to investigate past violations of human rights was denounced by human rights activists as a travesty the commission s final report would not name any individuals who violated human rights and its findings could not be used to bring anyone to trial the commission had only six months to investigate the decades long war the agreement left guatemala s social structure the fundamental cause of the bloodshed totally untouched the vast majority of the population was made up of poor peasants living in rural villages and laboring in highly exploitative agricultural labor while a tiny elite of wealthy families ruled in guatemala city and maintained its monopoly of the country s economic and political life the accord for a firm and lasting peace was formally ratified on december 29 1996 presidents of eight latin american nations attended the signing event alongside united nations secretary general boutros boutros ghali thomas f mclarty the clinton administration s representative and special envoy for latin america and the caribbean attended on behalf of the united states which held primary responsibility for the military coup of 1954 which set the stage for the eruption of civil war in 1960 50 years ago india and pakistan at war on december 3 1971 india entered into the ongoing war between pakistan and the bangladesh east pakistan national liberation forces of the mukti bahini the war had begun in march 1971 after the central government in western pakistan blocked the bangladesh awami league from taking its seats in parliament after sweeping the 1970 all pakistan general elections the war threatened the balance of power in the indian subcontinent an independent bangladesh with a population 70 million people drastically weakened pakistan which would lose the majority of its population simultaneously a bangladesh unification movement threatened to draw in the millions of bengalis living in the indian state of west bengal once the bengali liberation war had begun both indira gandhi prime minister of india and yahya khan president of pakistan considered india s entry into the war to be inevitable and both countries began making preparations for war hoping to preemptively disable the indian military on december 3 1971 khan ordered the bombing of several indian military bases india immediately responded by launching a full scale invasion into east pakistan with more than double the manpower of the pakistan armed forces the indian military quickly surrounded khan s army and forced a surrender in 13 days on december 16 1971 pakistan surrendered to india over 90 000 pakistani military and government personnel were taken prisoner and removed from the now independent bangladesh west pakistan s attempt to suppress the national liberation movement led to the war s worst horrors mass killings were directed against armed mukti bahini liberation soldiers and civilian supporters alike while the exact number of deaths is unknown estimates of the bengali deaths range from 200 000 to as many as 3 million millions more became refugees while prime minister indira gandhi insisted that india s intervention in the war was purely to support bangladesh s independence in reality it allowed new delhi to dictate the terms on which the new bengali government would form and suppress the movement for a united bengal including in the territory comprising part of the indian state a statement issued by the revolutionary communist league rcl the sri lankan section of the icfi titled long live the bangladesh revolution no compromise with the hindu capitalists on december 8 1971 explained the class interests involved in the indian pakistan war and the efforts to suppress the revolutionary movement of the bengali workers it read in part the trotskyists therefore take their position firmly in support of the struggle of the e bengali masses for their legitimate aspirations and for an end to military and national oppression we unconditionally support the right of the bengali masses of the west as well as of the east to unite as a nation ending the imperialist carve up of 1947 and to secede from india and pakistan if they so desire the struggle to exercise this right by the bengali masses becomes inevitably transformed into a revolutionary struggle because it poses an end to the imperialist designed status quo and to the rule of the parasitic hindu and muslim bourgeoisies the trotskyist movement calls upon the toiling bengali masses to unite the struggle for national unification and liberation with the struggle for socialist revolution as the sole guarantee of victory the indo pakistani war brought to the surface political differences between the trotskyists in the rcl and the socialist labour league in the uk who were adapting towards pabloism and supporting the indian invasion for further reading on these questions see documents of the indo pakistani war of 1971 75 years ago us ruling class attacks coal miners strike on december 4 1946 district judge t alan goldsborough found the united mine workers umw and its leader john l lewis in contempt of court for defying a court order banning an indefinite stoppage throughout the us coal mines goldsborough fined lewis 10 000 and the union 3 5 million equivalent to over 35 million today the judgment was part of a hysterical ruling class campaign against the stoppage the third coal strike in little over a year the walkout was called to demand a reduction to the minimum work week of 54 hours and other improvements to pay and conditions in addition to the disruption to an extremely lucrative industry the official response expressed fears that the struggle by the miners a strategic section of the working class could become the focal point for a broader movement in the course of 1946 some 5 million workers were involved in industrial actions in the largest strike wave in us history the struggles were directed against rising inflation and stagnant real wages and a great many were wildcat strikes carried out in defiance of both employers and unions bringing down his ruling against lewis and the umw goldsborough declared the continuing strike an evil demoniac monstrous thing that means hunger and cold and unemployment and destitution and disorganization of the social fabric if actions of this kind can be successfully persisted in the government will be overthrown and the government that would take its place would be a dictatorship the socialist workers party swp then the american section of the world trotskyist movement responded to the onslaught by insisting on the need for a unified movement of the entire working class how can organized labor meet and answer this tremendous propaganda attack the swp asked answering only by mobilizing its own forces for a full scale counter offensive only by showing the same unity in action as the capitalists are displaying but the trotskyists warned that the top afl and cio leaders were too narrow minded too blinded by their own bureaucratic interests to take this imperative step on their own initiative meaning that the struggle would need to be spearheaded by the rank and file in december with the supreme court upholding a ban on the strike and the democratic party administration of president harry truman demanding that it end lewis instructed the 400 000 miners to return to work the strike s end paved the way for a massive reduction in the size of the coal mine workforce in the ensuing decades 100 years ago mass workers protests in vienna on december 1 1921 hundreds of thousands of workers rallied in front of the parliament building in the austrian capital vienna to support a general strike called in the industrial district of floridsdorf over the high cost of living and abolition of government food subsidies prices had risen 240 percent in the previous month workers sent a delegation to chancellor franz schrober of the greater german people s party christian social party government the workers representatives demanded abolition of the stock exchange and price controls they received an evasive answer and as the demonstration broke up crowds marched to seize the stock exchange others broke off to attack cafes and began to harass well to do people in the upscale districts according to the new york times shops were looted of luxury goods and the main thoroughfares of the city were strewn with rubbish well heeled matrons including some american visitors were robbed of their furs and jewelry crowds broke into hotels and tossed furniture out of windows red flags the symbol of socialist revolution were raised the times noted that the police largely stood by when one correspondent asked a squad of police who were standing by as a hotel was looted why they were not intervening they replied we are tired of shooting and being shot these people are hungry and desperate and so are many of us in the evening a large force of mounted police was able to break up the crowds and drive rioters back to the working class quarters

david nolte whose work could well lead to new better and more effective ways to treat cancer never set out to make a fortune he never dreamed of becoming a captain of industry good thing because the bespectacled 61 year old purdue university professor whose silver hair falls casually to either side of a near center part has done neither certainly not for lack of intellect his peers say emphatically that nolte is a world class physicist nor for lack of ambition or a strong work ethic those same peers say he works countless hours at his craft but the patented inventions born from his brain while they ve given rise to companies have not generated a great deal of money for him his school or investors at least not yet he has a potential home run right now animated dynamics a firm that recently raised 5 5 million in venture funding still for his part nolte who earned his undergraduate degree in physics from cornell university and his doctorate at the university of california at berkley isn t overly concerned about the business world s definition of success he is fueled by different fires he didn t even ponder the full potential of the patented products he worked on until he was well down his career path in some ways nolte is typical of college professors and researchers he spends his time studying figuring and tinkering for long hours over subject matter he is obsessed by the journey of discovery is the draw rather than a pot of gold that might lie at the end of the rainbow but that is changing as more and more of the work done by university researchers is being spun off into companies and commercial applications that they or the universities own or are a part of historically professors used research as a tool to foster education as well as for problem solving and discovery said peter kissinger a purdue university analytical chemistry professor many never think of taking their research commercial they became professors because they love to teach and the pursuit of knowledge seeking patents and starting a business is a whole different pursuit it s a pursuit many academics frowned upon up until the 1980s or even 1990s i remember clearly in the 70s people and many in academia thought professors were tainted by commercial endeavors kissinger said but for some a light goes on and they realize their research could have a wider meaning and a big impact a positive one on the broader world said kissinger whose own research has given rise to bioanalytical systems a contract research firm that sells its services to pharmaceutical medical device and biotechnology companies around the world the company had 2019 revenue of 43 6 million when it dawns on you that your research can actually make people s lives better now or in the relatively near future that s a big moment he said early patents that moment for nolte came while working as a postdoctoral researcher at at t bell laboratories a world class tech lab in new jersey from 1998 to 1999 nolte worked on solid state physics and semi conductors at bell labs where he learned about the process of filing patents and how the results of his research could lead to patented inventions that was at a time when bell labs was the top research lab in the world there was no other place on earth like it nolte recalled despite bell s emphasis on patenting research at t didn t always launch the technology into businesses or products instead the company tended to sell or trade the patents at t didn t care about the technology they just wanted to either leverage or package them as bundles and sell them off nolte said at bell labs nolte worked with laser physics we invented the most sensitive holographic film ever he said nolte never even knew the value of the patents he worked on i got a dollar for my at t patent for holographic film he said with a laugh i have no clue what they ever did with that patent after joining purdue as a professor in 1989 nolte filed a few more patents based on his research even at purdue through the 90s there wasn t much encouragement for faculty to launch startups nolte said the patents we filed were often with a company he said we would have non exclusive rights to a patent one of the patents was done with ibm others were with small companies in california power to the schools a powerful seed for change was sown 20 years before it began to produce real fruit the bayh dole act of 1980 gave colleges and universities rights to intellectual property generated from federal funding co sponsored by then sens birch bayh d ind and bob dole r kan the law was seen as a way to pull the united states out of the economic malaise of the 1970s schools in indiana and nationally already had some understanding about the marketing value of products born from their research studies at indiana university gave rise to crest toothpaste and the drunkometer now known as the breathalyzer blood alcohol calculator from research at purdue came orville redenbacher popcorn stove top stuffing mix fiberglass and the bright red led lights in automobile brake lights and traffic signals but many of those discoveries were commercialized outside the university system the bayh dole act gave researchers and schools financial incentive to pursue commercialization of research internally still many academics and academic institutions were hesitant to dive in but in the 2000s a new generation of university presidents emerged when martin jischke became president at purdue in 2000 he started pushing the school s researchers toward the commercial realm a few years later indiana university president michael mcrobbie followed suit in bloomington mitch daniels the former republican indiana governor took the effort to a new level when he became purdue president in 2013 that triggered intensified efforts to capitalize on research at iu the university of notre dame and other state schools if you run a university with a professor you will rarely break the mold kissinger said if you bring in someone with new ideas with deep government business and think tank experience you just can t find that very often mitch daniels brought in good people and was a lot more aggressive about what we can do fueling the fire in the mid 2000s colleges started programs and organizations to spur the research to market revolution operations like purdue foundry purdue ventures innovate indiana fund and iu ventures launched as did the idea center and innovation park at notre dame the schools and their backers started angel networks and capital funds with the express intent of commercializing the research of faculty and students iu and purdue researchers now crank out dozens of patents each year in some years well over 100 the number of startups and inventions coming out of the schools in indiana is almost dizzying said iu ventures ceo tony armstrong there has never been more activity and more potential and there s never been more excitement attention or opportunities around the research coming out of the state s universities than there is now and i think there s a lot more to come schools policies differ on how money from patents and startups is distributed but a typical model has the faculty inventor taking 35 directly and getting another 15 to invest in his or her lab for more research another 15 or so usually goes into the inventor s academic department and 35 goes to the school all the recent successes don t mean the task is not daunting a college professor or researcher has much to learn before launching a company grasping business management and capital markets is just the start nolte is better equipped than most said purdue ventures managing director john hanak first of all david is a world renowned physicist he s great to work with and totally understood what we were doing with ideation development and startup hanak said david was inherently more savvy about business if he would have put his mind to being a ceo of a company he could have done it instead he applied his gifts to research that s important hanak said because many professors get in over their head trying to fill the ceo role i knew he would be a success because he realized his role would be as chief scientific and technical officer nothing but left turns nolte s journey from academia to filing patents to launching companies was a bit more circuitous than most my whole career has been nothing but left turns nolte said after a stint working on high energy particle physics constituents of reality type of stuff nolte said he moved on to high altitude cosmology he spent a year working on a sounding rocket project but the rocket which was designed to take measurements and perform scientific experiments while in orbit sank in the pacific ocean off the coast of japan without ever opening its nose cone the nose cone bolts failed to fire nolte said the next day i switched to solid state physics he then worked on semi conductors which opened the door to his work at bell labs there he got into laser physics which led to the work with sensitive holographic film we started to ask the question what can we do with this somewhere along the line somebody suggested why don t we look at living tissue he recalled the next thing you know a couple years pass and i m doing biomedical research like i said it s been nothing but left turns now almost everything i do is related to cancer so i m a cancer researcher motion pictures the company born from nolte s research animated dynamics was founded in 2011 and has raised 5 5 million in capital the company is pioneering technology that animates the traditional view provided by a microscope the startup has created camera like hardware that allows it to view living tissue in motion nolte gives much credit for the launch of animated dynamics to his business partner john turek a purdue professor of basic medical sciences and animated dynamics vice president the technology nolte said is important in helping doctors tailor treatment to patients specific cancer the technology picks up all the motion going on inside of cells and the cells themselves nolte said we re able to see how those motions are affected by an applied therapeutic he explained that the biodynamic imaging is created by shining a light on living tissue the reflection of light waves creates a three dimensional image that shows the real time movement of living cells and structures inside them while this type of imaging can be helpful in a long list of applications the company believes helping cancer patients is its best application those familiar with nolte s work at animated dynamics say he s on the brink of a big breakthrough it s not the first time more than 15 years ago nolte came up with a way to fill the pits of a compact disc like the ones that play music with antibodies that collect proteins out of blood serum so instead of having 5 billion empty pits you have 5 billion pits that are actually testing the constituents of blood nolte said the biocd was born nolte started a company with a group from notre dame around the technology he invented quadraspec was launched in 2004 nolte who became chief scientific officer and his partner retained 50 of the company and 50 went to a new management team quadraspec had a spectacular trajectory nolte said with a chuckle all the way up until the market crash of 2008 we were about to sign an international deal that would have actually brought in a large chunk of investment with a human diagnostics company out of ireland that s what we were shooting for the contract was finished all that remained was the ceremony to put on the signatures then the stock market crashed and that was basically the end of that company the company s employee count was nearly halved to 17 in one month shortly after all the assets were sold and nolte essentially exited lessons learned despite the bitter experience nolte wasn t done with business enterprises he learned a lot in that endeavor and wanted to apply it to another so in 2010 when he was filing the patent that would be the cornerstone for animated dynamics he harkened back to his time with chad barden who had been brought on as ceo of quadraspec he had taken small company to a successful exit with an acquisition to intel nolte said he was an inspirational guy and i studied him closely like many university researchers nolte never had formal business education or training so he sought to fill his knowledge gaps in 2012 he attended a purdue research foundation entrepreneurship boot camp in 2013 he attended a boot camp put on by the national science foundation that camp was key to learning how to win grants in 2015 he landed a 1 million nsf grant at that point we realized we weren t playing around anymore and this was going to become a real company nolte said and he realized he still needed help it was clear we needed to have people who were connected to large networks of key opinion leaders and investors he said as a faculty out of purdue i just didn t have that nolte brought in ted schenberg and travis morgan who were running a genotyping company strand diagnostics in indianapolis they were introduced through the purdue research foundation animated dynamics was a phenotyping organization so it was a perfect match nolte said the company grew to nine full time employees before the pandemic now it s down to five but nolte is optimistic growth will resume when the pandemic abates due to the pandemic clinical trials shut down and our whole model revolves around clinical trials he said this is important work gaining business knowledge is just one of many challenges for academics wanting to start companies time is also an obstacle nolte said purdue allows him to spend one day a week working on his company he has no interest in walking away from his academic job he still loves teaching but nolte who began as president at animated dynamics but now serves as chief scientific officer and owns 10 of the company spends much of his own time on the company let s just say i have a lot of strange hobbies he said the adrenaline keeps you running for years i think this is important work and that s a big part of it even the challenges make it interesting trying to overcome those challenges is a reason to get out of bed in the morning but he insists the venture is not a burden and he s not driven to keep grinding by a big financial payout scientists are motivated by different things he said we re motivated by the challenge and the intellectual aspects of things it would be great to make money but i would have to say that was never one of the prime motivators there s a strong desire to make an impact and not just for yourself you do have a sense that you re improving the world i suppose all entrepreneurs say that it sounds like a joke but it s also real

london bloomberg airlines passengers and businesses scrambled to respond to a deluge of travel restrictions announced over the weekend to slow the spread of the omicron coronavirus variant an initial spate of flight bans from southern africa where omicron was first detected gave way to more wide ranging measures that will make travel more expensive and less convenient if possible at all recalling earlier days in the pandemic britain re introduced mandatory polymerase chain reaction pcr tests for all arriving passengers and said they must self isolate until receiving a negative result israel closed to all inbound foreign nationals for 14 days the philippines said travellers from european countries including switzerland and the netherlands will not be welcome for several weeks and singapore delayed the launch of vaccinated travel lanes with qatar the united arab emirates and saudi arabia spain and switzerland tightened access for arrivals from britain whose travel comeback has quickly been thrown into reverse british low cost carrier easyjet said on sunday its flight schedule was operating as normal however we continue to monitor the situation closely while the full impact will get clearer over coming days this will be problematic for business travel particularly inbound into the uk said mr martin ferguson a spokesman for american express global business travel organisers of the world aviation festival in london told attendees the event will go on as scheduled starting on tuesday the day the new british rules come into effect the group arranged for testing at two nearby hotels where delegates who are guests can self isolate while awaiting results a separate internal corporate event in britain was shifted to hybrid from in person because the new testing and isolation requirements would have caught out some attendees set to arrive on tuesday according to a source leisure travel will also see an impact while friends and relatives visiting loved ones after long absences are more likely to go through with a trip said mr alex irving an analyst at bernstein in london christmas bookings will obviously be weaker than we had expected prior to the omicron variant he said as you add barriers to travel such as the pcr tests and isolation requirements all that does is changes the incentives airlines now face a return to the uncertainty of shifting rules and public health developments that threw customer plans into chaos and undermined demand earlier in the pandemic british airways for example halted flights to hong kong through at least nov 30 after one employee tested positive for covid 19 and staff were sent into quarantine the airline said it is keeping its operations under review as the situation evolves singapore and japan are among countries that have said they are considering tighter border restrictions the risk of a second lost winter has already tanked shares of airline stocks with the bloomberg emea airline index down 18 per cent this month this will make it harder to raise fresh capital to repair balance sheets british airways parent iag has 12 4 billion in net debt for example this comes at a time of year when airlines will seek to bolster liquidity and to a modest extent profitability and is after an already arduous 18 months of revenue depletion said mr john strickland who heads london based jls consulting

one of the strongest arms of the singaporean military is the republic of singapore air force here s what you need to remember overall unlike their neighbors singapore has gone all in with western tech the common origins of their aircraft probably make resupply and maintenance easier this trend looks to continue now that singapore is looking into the f 35 as a replacement for their f 5es they also have the significant advantage of having awacs aircraft unlike their two closest neighbors despite its small geographical size singapore fields one of the most advanced and well equipped militaries in south east asia it spends more on its military than any of its neighbors being a tiny city state one of the strongest arms of the singaporean military is the republic of singapore air force but how does it stack up against its neighbors from the small to the big does western tech really provide the level of advantage it needs to defend itself the backbone of the rsaf is a fleet of f 15 and f 16 fighters the rsaf fields forty f 15sg eagles forty f 16ds and twenty f 16cs these are augmented by around thirty f 5s tiger ii and some a 4 skyhawks in storage singapore also fields an awacs capability with five israeli modified gulfstream 550 jets out of all those aircraft singapore s strongest fighter is definitely the f 15sg itself a variant of the f 15e the most important advantage the f 15sg has is the apg 63 v 3 aesa radar which one of the best aircraft mounted radars on any fighter in the region aesas also have the capability to perform electronic warfare ew tasks they can actively degrade the lock of an active radar guided missile while scanning at the same time due to their electronic nature the rsaf f 16s are also rumored to be undergoing similar upgrades to receive aesas of their own the f 15sg also has an irst system which gives it the capability to detect and lock onto aircraft with infrared missiles without even switching on the radar the irst bulb is positioned on a pod pylon under the left engine of the f 15sg and is directly integrated into the plane to make the actual kill the f 15sg wields the advanced aim 9x block ii air to air missile this is integrated with the joint helmet mounted cueing system helmet which allows the seeker to track where the pilot is looking allowing for the missile to lock onto targets off boresight while the soviet air force pioneered this capability with the r 73 and su 27 mig 29 aircraft including those fielded by its neighbors the jhmcs and aim 9x block ii take it to even further levels with a wider seeker lock angle than what can be achieved with the russian system for longer range targets singapore has access to advanced long range active radar homing air to air missiles the aim 120c 7 it also has stocks of the medium range aim 120c 5 these can be fired from both the f 15 and f 16s singapore has although it s likely the f 15 will be able to achieve a lock earlier on with its aesa radar while it s clear singapore s air force packs a significant air to air punch its mission is not to just protect singapore itself but its interests in the immediate region as a result they have significant stocks of the agm 154 jsow a long ranged american glide bomb that can fly up to 130km away while these could be used to deliver an alpha strike against an opponent singapore is expected to use them more in an anti shipping role one of singapore s greatest fighter threats might come from indonesia which bought the advanced su 35s earlier this year however they are fewer in number than singapore s f 15sg fleet indonesia also fields many more different types of aircraft the indonesian air force has f 16s original su 27s two different variants of the su 30 and f 5e tiger ii s as well obviously this results in greater maintenance and sustainment issues for indonesia another strong air force that could face singapore is china s plan aviation china also has j 15 carrier fighters these largely are chinese developed variants of the first generation su 27s flankers china first received in the 1990s while on paper they have the same capabilities as the f 15sg arh missiles irst advanced radar china s flankers are still considered to be underpowered due to their engines malaysia also is a strong contender fielding a weird mix of western and eastern planes like indonesia unlike indonesia most of their flankers are of older variants and a good portion of their fighter fleet is relatively obsolete mig 29s they also do field the aim 9x block ii like singapore overall unlike their neighbors singapore has gone all in with western tech the common origins of their aircraft probably make resupply and maintenance easier this trend looks to continue now that singapore is looking into the f 35 as a replacement for their f 5es they also have the significant advantage of having awacs aircraft unlike their two closest neighbors charlie gao studied political and computer

these cannabis stocks are no brainers to add to your portfolio the recent ruling by the south dakota supreme court that struck down a voter referendum approving legalized marijuana shows the difficult road ahead for cannabis stocks in dealing with state by state approvals a cohesive national policy is required that s why the introduction of a republican sponsored bill to legalize pot at the federal level is an important development it could point the way toward a bipartisan agreement but whether marijuana remains a patchwork quilt of state sanction or it gets the nod nationally the following three cannabis companies are ones to buy right now what s not to like about rising revenue and widening margins alex carchidi scotts miracle gro i d be willing to buy a few shares of scotts miracle gro smg 3 33 without hesitation because it s a highly diversified business that makes the gardening tools and plant nutrients that marijuana growers need to keep making money as a result of hot demand from newly opened cannabis facilities its cannabis cultivation equipment subsidiary hawthorne is driving much of the company s top line growth though its sales contracted by 2 year over year for q4 hawthorne s full year revenue for 2021 grew by 39 which isn t half bad similarly because of the strong seasonality of scotts consumer gardening segment fourth quarter revenue dipped 17 but companywide sales for the year grew by 19 as the marijuana industry in the u s continues to grow it ll continue to need the gear hawthorne provides in greater and greater quantities plus if consumers need to buy cannabis year round hawthorne will need to sell growers the right gear every quarter which could reduce some of the seasonality that i suspect scares some investors away from scotts stock right now there s every indication that the company will rise to meet the marijuana boom and reward its shareholders in the process scotts is improving its efficiency over time across several metrics while committing to another round of share repurchases worth up to 300 million in 2022 over the past five years its annual profit margin has risen by nearly 26 reaching its current level of 10 41 and its annual return on invested capital roic rose by 70 3 in the same period reaching 18 53 that means the company is getting better at squeezing more money out of both its operations and its equity from sources such as shareholders in short scotts has the right set of products in the market at the right time and it has a history of pulling through for its shareholders over the long term for me there s nothing better thumbs up for this bargain weed stock eric volkman green thumb industries pot companies with a strong retail presence will be the first ones to benefit when federal cannabis law is reformed or several more states flip the switch on recreational legalization granted neither is likely to happen anytime soon but green thumb industries gtbif 9 25 is a company beautifully poised to leap on the opportunity in many ways green thumb is a bellwether retail facing pot stock as it s among the top three u s multistate operators msos in terms of revenue along with rivals curaleaf and trulieve cannabis it also bucks the money losing mso standard by being consistently in the black of late with five consecutive quarters of bottom line profitability in fact green thumb did smashingly well in its most recently reported quarter its q3 revenue came in at 235 million 49 higher year over year and 5 better than the q2 result net profit leaped even further ahead at 21 6 million it was more than double the year ago figure although it represented an 8 decline from the previous quarter among the major u s msos in my opinion green thumb has one of the best geographic footprints this starts with its own home state illinois in which recreational weed got off to a roaring start when it became law at the beginning of 2020 in october the state surpassed 1 billion in year to date recreational sales that s well above the total for the entirety of 2020 which was only 669 million green thumb s rise is a go to dispensary in the state with nine locations green thumb s retail presence covers not only established locales such as illinois but also ones that have yet to establish their recently legalized recreational markets there are three rises apiece in both new york and new jersey and a pair in virginia pot stocks aren t the flavor of the month just now because of the more stop than start nature of u s decriminalization legalization green thumb stock has been unfairly punished in the process but that provides opportunity for investors to snap up the shares at a relatively cheap price they re down by nearly 40 from their one year peak after all all the pieces are in place for a big growth spurt rich duprey growgeneration i like growgeneration grwg 8 11 for much the same reason my colleague alex like scotts miracle gro it s a picks and shovels cannabis company that can win regardless of which pot stocks actually grow the fastest as the country s largest specialty hydroponic and organic garden center supplier growgeneration sells to marijuana growers the required supplies and equipment they need to produce pot for sale particularly within its own line of branded products such as char coir coconut coir and power si plant additives although it operates a network of 62 stores across 13 states it plans to expand in 2022 to all 18 states that have adult use laws in effect growgeneration s products are sold in third party outlets as well power si for example is available in 500 independent hydroponic locations across the u s and it now sells across canada the u k and europe that s helping push sales higher which more than doubled in the third quarter to 116 million as comparable sales were up nearly 16 from last year despite its success the market has punished growgeneration its stock is down 25 since it reported earnings on nov 11 and shares have lost nearly three quarters of their value from the highs they hit back in february even as it saw net profits grow 20 from last year as adjusted earnings of 0 18 per share were 38 above the year ago figure and double the consensus estimates adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda of 10 8 million fell short of analyst expectations although it was a record amount for growgeneration guidance also weighed on the stock as fourth quarter sales and profit margins will be pressured by an oversupply situation in california the largest marijuana market good for investors wall street forecasts that growgeneration will quadruple sales by the middle of the decade while ebitda will expand fivefold that makes the cannabis supplier company a discounted play and one investors might not want to wait too long to buy

by brian stelter cnn business a version of this article first appeared in the reliable sources newsletter you can sign up for free right here friday s satirical headline by the onion said it best nation nearly strings together 3 good days in row the blessing of thanksgiving on thursday was followed by a curse on friday urgent news about the new covid variant named omicron the reality is that we know almost nothing about the omicron variant as this headline on the atlantic s website helpfully states but the abrupt reactions to the news stock selloffs travel restrictions endless twitter threads made omicron the top story of the weekend across all sorts of news websites and networks now the world is in a sort of information holding pattern as reflected by this banner on cnn sunday afternoon questions concerns but still sparse data on new covid variant sociologist zeynep tufekci put it this way south africa has gifted us an early warning with omicron but earlier the warning the less we know author and podcaster derek thompson one of the smartest voices out there about the media and society said sunday that the gap between information and meaning at this moment in the omicron story is immense it s deeply impressive but also discombobulating to have access to so much genetic and virological data with the big picture takeaway being we don t really know what any of this means yet he added there s something uncanny about these sort of news purgatories where information is abundant but meaning is scarce and the only reasonable thing is to not draw conclusions from an abundance of factoids true but that s hard to do when the information sounds alarming and is repeated ad nauseam all across the media a two week wait wait two weeks seems to be the consensus at the moment dr paul burton the chief medical officer for moderna told cnn s paula reid on sunday we have to go through a couple of weeks here of uncertainty the white house s readout of president biden s meeting with dr anthony fauci and members of his covid response team made the same point dr fauci informed the president that while it will take approximately two more weeks to have more definitive information on the transmissibility severity and other characteristics of the variant he continues to believe that existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of covid so in the meantime get boosted if you haven t already there s no reason to panic but it s a great reason to get boosted nih director dr francis collins told dana bash on state of the union the biden administration is in a messaging bind on sunday dan diamond of the washington post observed that in interviews officials keep admitting that omicron and the current lack of data presents a messaging bind no one wants to sound an alarm unnecessarily diamond said but failing to warn about potential risks is a bigger sin in public health especially if actions now could protect people politico s alex thompson said on cnn s inside politics that he spoke with a white house official late saturday and the phrase they kept using over and over is we re not going to get caught flat footed that s why fauci and collins blanketed the sunday public affairs shows from abc to fox cbs to cnn but what s left unsaid thompson said is that they did get caught flat footed by delta last summer the risk now he added on twitter is that they are overcorrecting let s inform not speculate oliver darcy writes when there are information vacuums coupled with the need to fill cable news air time get eyeballs reading news stories and satisfy the seo gods it can be tempting to delve into the arena of speculation that s been quite clear over the past few days actual data has been more scarce than speculation on what the variant might mean for the world moving forward but journalists particularly newsroom leaders who set the tone of coverage should resist the temptation to hype conjecture we still have very little knowledge on what the new variant could mean for the world unnerving the public by playing out the worst case scenarios in stories and amplifying the worst fears of the scientific community in chyrons and headlines isn t the way to go audiences deserve better expert assessments when i asked cnn medical analyst dr jonathan reiner if omicron should be the lead story right now he said no because it s a story that is based entirely on speculation we will have data from really hard working scientists over the next few weeks that will help inform how we can put this new variant into context johns hopkins epidemiologist david dowdy criticized some of his colleagues over the weekend in this situation where data are early societal implications are large scientists have a duty not to oversell and we are doing exactly that shame on us dr peter hotez a regular presence across cable news said on msnbc my biggest concern is not omicron it s that we re about to undergo another big winter delta wave i have come to the conclusion that people love to panic science journalist erin biba remarked she called it completely and utterly exhausting that doomsday headlines and uninformed reporters create mass hysteria before we even have any details or information always wait before you panic wait wait until you have more info two years into this horror show new york times reporter stephanie nolen left south africa on thursday after spending time with scientists there and wound up reporting live from an airplane that was quarantined on the tarmac in amsterdam she wrote that europe apparently panicked about the variant news while i was somewhere over the sahara by the time we landed we were told we would not be permitted off the plane she eventually tested negative and was allowed to continue onward to canada on sunday afternoon nolen finished her multi day twitter thread by saying she is opting to self quarantine in an airbnb and keep testing after the airport exposure i had courtesy of the dutch authorities she expressed frustration with dutch and british officials plus the people on her flight who failed to wear masks even when i pleaded and we knew people were already testing positive she wrote two years into this horror show we ve just got to be smarter and better at managing i don t know how you make people care about each other covid is everything on sunday s reliable sources i talked with chris arnade the banker turned photographer who now walks the streets of american towns and writes about what he hears and learns he remarked about covid being the primary drag on voters perceptions of biden covid is everything those three words apply to more than biden s approval rating obviously covid continues to be the throughline of every story every struggle and folks who feel forgotten who feel exploited by elites feel like covid era policies benefited the zoom class and punished them arnade said there s a huge cynicism towards institutions he added and covid has made that cynicism worse the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
by brian stelter cnn business a version of this article first appeared in the reliable sources newsletter you can sign up for free right here one of president biden s many fights right now is a fight against perceptions of economic peril a never ending pandemic and his own political weakness in recent speeches he is issuing rebuttals and trying to change perceptions on wednesday for instance he gently skewered the news media if you ve watched the news recently you might think the shelves in all our stores are empty across the country that parents won t be able to get presents for their children but here s the deal for the vast majority of the country that s not what s happening biden ticked through his administration s actions taken in partnership with business and labor and said shelves are going to be stocked i felt like the entire speech was a response to recent coverage his message in effect was don t succumb to the sky is falling style of news coverage that is so commonplace at the moment he struck a similar tone on monday when he addressed americans about omicron and said it s not a cause for panic a subtle pushback to some of the panicked initial reactions to the variant news but are his arguments getting through that s very much debatable on a recent episode of reliable sources i talked about news whiplash as a viewer it s easy to feel like the country is lurching from crisis to emergency to calamity and by the time one is solved the next is already stealing all the headlines the fox distortion field i know i m a broken record about this but anti biden media coverage is critical to understanding the biden presidency for example fox showed biden s lunchtime speech live on wednesday but newsmax pointedly did not host john bachman said while interviewing seb gorka that we re monitoring the speech but i can t watch this guy squint into the teleprompter and tell us you know lies anymore so i m going to spare the audience that you know he s talking about the supply chain here but i want to go back to this issue with the vaccines and then bachman indulged anti vax talking points one of the banners on hannity on wednesday night reacting to the aforementioned speech said biden admin downplays the severity of the supply chain crisis another said desperate dems rely on deception and distortion to try and sell destructive agenda that s a lot of d s the distortion field is very well demonstrated through omicron biden has said several times this week that the country will fight covid not with shutdowns or lockdowns but with widespread vaccinations testing and more the words not with shutdowns or lockdowns have been baked into his public appearances he could not be any more clear and yet tucker carlson told his fan base on wednesday that the biden administration is once again locking down the country in response to the new variant one of carlson s banners said power hungry dems will only intensify lockdowns so the president said a but fox says the president is doing z is there any remedy for disinformation like that views from the left liberal defenders of biden are increasingly lambasting political coverage and not just fox s not by a long shot during biden s speech on wednesday eric boehlert said i m glad biden is calling out media s hysterical unglued inflation supply chain coverage elsewhere zachary pleat of media matters argued that the mainstream media missed the mark with their gloomy thanksgiving coverage writing there was no shortage of turkeys the predicted tsa staffing shortages didn t happen and black friday shopping increased 30 from last year but do those points match perception the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

yesterday together with the prime minister johnson and merkel and macron president macron we came together to to reiterate our shared belief that diplomacy diplomacy is the best way to prevent iran from gaining nuclear weapon and we discussed how best to encourage iran to resume serious good faith negotiations i think we re continuing to suffer from the very bad judgments that president trump made and pulling out of the jcpoa and uh so that s one issue and that issue is going to depend on whether and how that gets resolved is going to depend on their action and the willingness of our friends who are part of the original agreement to stick with us and make sure there s a price to pay economically for them to fail to come back with regard to the issue of how we re going to respond to actions taken by them against the interests of the united states whether their drone strikes or anything else is we re gonna respond we re going to continue to respond advertisement iran nuclear talks to restart as us emphasizes it s prepared to use other options if diplomacy fails share copy link copy the u s and its allies restart iran nuclear talks on monday unsure how tehran s new government will approach negotiations not optimistic about the prospects ahead and emphasizing that if diplomacy fails the u s is prepared to use other options the parties to the joint comprehensive plan of action will reconvene in vienna after almost six months to discuss a mutual return to the deal by both the u s and iran but the hiatus has given time for new obstacles to take root video above trump s iran deal exit very bad judgments biden said earlier this monthon friday iran announced yet more advances in its uranium enrichment which reduces the amount of time tehran would need to develop a nuclear weapon if it chooses to an announcement clearly meant to give iran leverage when it arrives in vienna for talks other parties to the agreement including germany the uk britain france china and russia are coming into the talks calling for negotiations to pick up where they left off european sources tell cnn they expect the iranians to treat the meeting as round one u s officials have expressed similar concerns the recently elected hardline government in tehran will send a new set of negotiators to vienna who have been emphasizing the need for complete u s sanctions relief not compliance with the deal while u s officials have said they have absolutely no plans to offer iran incentives to talk the time to choose is short and senior u s officials have repeatedly warned that if advances in iran s nuclear program and enrichment capability continue unabated they could render the benefits of the jcpoa moot a development that would force the u s to pursue other options we are still hopeful that diplomacy can find a way brett mcgurk the national security council s coordinator for the middle east and north africa told the manama dialogue organized by the international institute for strategic studies but if it cannot find a way we are prepared to use other options there is no question we are not going to allow iran to get a nuclear weapon period mcgurk said and when it came to military force for behavior change that is a pretty fuzzy objective for a military force when it comes to military force to prevent a country from obtaining a nuclear weapon that is a very achievable objective u s special envoy for iran rob malley said in a tweet after a nov 18 meeting with middle eastern allies and european parties to the deal that iran could choose one of two paths continued nuclear escalation crisis or mutual return to the jcpoa creating opportunities for regional economic diplomatic ties time to choose is short malley wrote sources familiar with preparations for the talks say that the parties were closely watching international atomic energy agency director rafael grossi s visit to tehran last week seeing it as an indication of iran s approach to the talks in vienna those sources said grossi told the iaea board afterward that the talks were inconclusive one of the contentious issues remaining is that iran is refusing inspectors from the iaea monitoring access to the karaj centrifuge production facility which reports suggest has resumed operations this is seriously affecting the ability to restore continuity of knowledge at the workshop which has been widely recognized as essential in relation to a return to the jcpoa grossi told a board of governors meeting on wednesday the arms control association noted that iran s refusal to allow the iaea to install new cameras or confirm that production hasn t restarted could undermine attempts to revitalize the jcpoa and its strict verification regime if it isn t possible to fully complete records of iran s nuclear program tehran s refusal to grant access to karaj also drives speculation and concern about what exactly iran is doing the aca said no choice on thursday the u s mission to international organizations in vienna told the iaea meeting that if iran s non cooperation is not immediately remedied especially the restoration of continuity of knowledge at karaj the board will have no choice but to reconvene in extraordinary session before the end of this year in order to address the crisis meanwhile on friday iran announced its stock of 60 enriched uranium has grown to 66 pounds and its amount of 20 enriched uranium had also increased both levels are much closer to weapons grade uranium which is enriched above 90 according to the arms control association enriching uranium to 20 constitutes about 90 percent of the necessary work to enrich to weapons grade as iran s stockpiles grow the aca says its breakout time or the time it would take to produce enough uranium enriched to weapons grade for one bomb decreases the aca estimates that iran s current breakout time is likely about one month down from 12 months when the jcpoa was fully implemented enrichment was limited under the jcpoa which the u s left unilaterally in may 2018 under former president donald trump iran restarted enrichment last year to pressure the u s to ease sanctions a very uncertain proposition state department spokesman ned price reflected the ambiguity surrounding the resumed talks on nov 22 calling the mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa a very uncertain proposition the next day price told reporters in washington that it is our hope that the new government in iran shows up in vienna and shows up in vienna ready to negotiate in good faith to build on the progress that had been achieved in the previous six rounds of negotiations but he added that the u s has been very clear that we are not prepared to take unilateral steps solely for the benefit of greasing the wheel to get the talks going again former president donald trump pulled the u s from the deal in 2018 sources familiar with the preparations for the talks have told cnn that the u s and its allies are not at a point where they would begin offering iran confidence building measures but one official said there is a possibility the u s and its allies could employ them down the road as a result incentives for iran won t be discussed at this week s meetings in vienna where the u s and allies will be focused on simply taking the temperature and seeking to advance from where they left off months ago u s and european sources explained plan b everyone involved in the talks is mindful of the ticking clock the sources told cnn that there s still time to reach a deal but it would likely run out by the end of next year for now they said there is no hard and fast plan b yet critics of the deal say that the biden administration has sacrificed leverage by easing pressure on iran while it builds up its nuclear program the biden administration s iran policy is failing and without a significant course correction that policy will either result in iranian nuclear weapons or in a war to stop that development said mark dubowitz the ceo of foundation for defense of democracies dubowitz argued that the administration s approach will allow iran to rebuild toward a lethal end state of with pathways to nuclear weapons and a robust nuclear infrastructure israel is going to have no choice but to use military force to stop iran s nuclear weapons before tehran reaches this lethal end state dubowitz said israeli prime minister naftali bennett has been making clear that israel will be prepared to act if necessary addressing delegates at a security conference near tel aviv on tuesday bennett said that if there is a return to the jcpoa israel obviously is not a party to the agreement and is not obligated by it bennett complained that after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015 the state of israel simply went to sleep we were occupied with other things we will learn from this mistake we will maintain our freedom of action he said western officials have tried to argue to the israelis that attacks on israel s nuclear program are not very useful when the overall goal is to come up with a comprehensive solution and especially when the iranians have sped up their capability to rebuild after attacks sources familiar with the iran talks have told cnn western officials have also raised the danger of iran responding with kinetic action but sources familiar with the talks say israeli officials still seem to think that it is still an effective tool to show their capabilities asked about those warnings price said that at the end of the day the united states and israel we share a common objective here and that is to see to it that iran is verifiably and permanently prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon and we continue to believe that diplomacy in coordination with our allies and partners and that of course includes israel is the best path to achieve that goal we ve also been very clear that this is not a process that can go on indefinitely and if the iranians through their actions or through their inactions demonstrate or suggest that they lack that good faith that they lack that clarity of purpose we ll have to turn to other means price said tuesday we have a variety of other means we re discussing those with our allies and partners diplomatic flurryin recent weeks u s officials have conducted a flurry of diplomacy with regional powers and other parties to the deal working to forge a united front president joe biden met with european partners to discuss iran during the june g7 meetings in the uk in recent weeks secretary of state antony blinken has also conferred with european allies as well as china and russia on iran and malley recently met with gulf countries israeli officials and european partners in the jcpoa i think the iranians believe they have some eastward option with russia and china in which they can circumvent the pressure of sanctions mcgurk said on sunday and that is just wrong and so i think we are

t he news as the second anniversary of the pandemic nears could be better the emergence of a covid 19 variant labelled omicron has sparked a wave of selling on financial markets seemingly on concern that a new highly transmissible strain of the virus could set back economic recoveries worldwide with luck omicron may prove manageable but continued disruptions from various variants of covid 19 represent just one of three formidable forces that will squeeze emerging markets in 2022 alongside tighter american monetary policy and slower growth in china listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element start with american policy markets knocked for a loop by omicron sagged further on november 30th after jerome powell the chairman of the federal reserve suggested that the central bank might accelerate its plan to taper its asset purchases thanks to the critical role of the dollar and treasury bonds in the global financial system a more hawkish fed is often associated with declining global risk appetite capital flows towards emerging markets tend to ebb the dollar strengthens which because of the greenback s role in invoicing reduces trade flows in order to assess which places face the biggest squeeze from a tightening fed the economist has gathered data on a few key macroeconomic variables for 40 large emerging economies see chart 1 large current account deficits high levels of debt and of that owed to foreigners especially rampant inflation and insufficient foreign exchange reserves are all indicators that can spell trouble for countries facing fickle capital flows as american monetary policy tightens combining countries performance on these measures yields a vulnerability index on which higher scores translate into greater fragility some places are already in serious trouble argentina which tops the list faces an inflation rate above 50 and a deepening economic crisis turkey s fundamentals look a little better but its woes are compounded by the government s stubborn desire to lower interest rates in the face of soaring prices the lira has been hammered losing 45 against the dollar in 2021 diminishing the purchasing power of turks wages and pensions the second element of danger comes from china s slowing economy when china falters exporters around the world feel the pain it is by a large margin the world s biggest consumer of aluminium coal cotton and soyabeans among other commodities and a major importer of goods ranging from capital equipment to wine ranking the same 40 economies by their exports to china as a share of their own gdp yields an index of vulnerability to the country many of the biggest exporters to china like vietnam are critical links in manufacturing supply chains which should be untroubled as china s domestic economy slows as long as americans keep shopping and sino american trade relations stay stable at greater risk are the poorer commodities exporters that have helped feed china s population and provide for its building boom this gauge of exposure to china can then be compared with our measure of vulnerability to american monetary policy tightening see chart 2 some countries fates are more linked to one of the giants than the other an unlucky bunch such as brazil and chile appear most likely to suffer from a double whammy despite high levels of debt and soaring inflation high commodity prices have enabled brazil to just about maintain investors confidence a softening chinese economy could deprive brazil of that benefit leading to a tumbling currency even higher inflation and the possibility of economic crisis the world has faced the combined pressure of hawkish american policy and a stumbling china before in the mid 2010s fragile emerging markets were squeezed by a rising dollar as the fed withdrew the monetary support provided during the global financial crisis while a badly managed round of financial market liberalisation and credit tightening triggered a slump in china growth across emerging markets excluding china sagged from 5 3 in 2011 to just 3 2 in 2015 the squeeze this time is almost certain to be worse that is in part because the fed is expected to tighten policy more quickly than it did in the 2010s when a weak recovery and stubbornly low inflation forced it to go slow then more than two and a half years elapsed between the fed s announcement of its intention to reduce its asset purchases and the first rise in its policy rate this time by contrast the 12 months following the fed s announcement of its plan to begin tapering in november are likely to involve a complete halt to bond buying and according to market pricing at least two interest rate rises china for its part also seems at greater risk of a hard landing today than it was a half decade ago most economists thought growth would slow to 4 5 5 5 even before the emergence of omicron that would with the exception of 2020 be the lowest growth rate since 1990 another reason for the pain this time around is the addition of a third hazard to emerging markets the spread of omicron and the risk of future variants little is yet known about the danger posed by omicron but the emerging world remains particularly vulnerable to nasty outbreaks of the virus with a few exceptions vaccination rates in poorer countries lag behind those in rich ones just a tenth of africa s population has received even one jab less than the share of americans that has received a third shot of our group of 40 countries vaccination rates are particularly low in egypt and pakistan two countries that are also especially vulnerable to american monetary tightening the spread of a new variant against which existing vaccines may be less effective could prove back breaking to tourism dependent economies and public purses in the emerging world more broadly are in no fit state to extend or reintroduce pandemic relief measures working out how the three threats might interact with each other is tricky but it is possible that their coincidence could lead to still more economic pain for poorer countries unforgiving capital markets as the fed tightens could leave emerging market governments fiscally hamstrung in the face of new outbreaks omicron induced local lockdowns in china could deal emerging market exporters another blow the tourist dependent countries of south east asia once popular destinations for chinese visitors are likely to remain deserted for a while longer the pandemic s third year was already destined to be a rocky one for emerging markets stuck as they are between the two poles of a tightening america and a slowing china new variants could make the journey still more perilous to keep up

yesterday together with the prime minister johnson and merkel and macron president macron we came together to to reiterate our shared belief that diplomacy diplomacy is the best way to prevent iran from gaining nuclear weapon and we discussed how best to encourage iran to resume serious good faith negotiations i think we re continuing to suffer from the very bad judgments that president trump made and pulling out of the jcpoa and uh so that s one issue and that issue is going to depend on whether and how that gets resolved is going to depend on their action and the willingness of our friends who are part of the original agreement to stick with us and make sure there s a price to pay economically for them to fail to come back with regard to the issue of how we re going to respond to actions taken by them against the interests of the united states whether their drone strikes or anything else is we re gonna respond we re going to continue to respond advertisement iran nuclear talks to restart as us emphasizes it s prepared to use other options if diplomacy fails share copy link copy the u s and its allies restart iran nuclear talks on monday unsure how tehran s new government will approach negotiations not optimistic about the prospects ahead and emphasizing that if diplomacy fails the u s is prepared to use other options the parties to the joint comprehensive plan of action will reconvene in vienna after almost six months to discuss a mutual return to the deal by both the u s and iran but the hiatus has given time for new obstacles to take root video above trump s iran deal exit very bad judgments biden said earlier this monthon friday iran announced yet more advances in its uranium enrichment which reduces the amount of time tehran would need to develop a nuclear weapon if it chooses to an announcement clearly meant to give iran leverage when it arrives in vienna for talks other parties to the agreement including germany the uk britain france china and russia are coming into the talks calling for negotiations to pick up where they left off european sources tell cnn they expect the iranians to treat the meeting as round one u s officials have expressed similar concerns the recently elected hardline government in tehran will send a new set of negotiators to vienna who have been emphasizing the need for complete u s sanctions relief not compliance with the deal while u s officials have said they have absolutely no plans to offer iran incentives to talk the time to choose is short and senior u s officials have repeatedly warned that if advances in iran s nuclear program and enrichment capability continue unabated they could render the benefits of the jcpoa moot a development that would force the u s to pursue other options we are still hopeful that diplomacy can find a way brett mcgurk the national security council s coordinator for the middle east and north africa told the manama dialogue organized by the international institute for strategic studies but if it cannot find a way we are prepared to use other options there is no question we are not going to allow iran to get a nuclear weapon period mcgurk said and when it came to military force for behavior change that is a pretty fuzzy objective for a military force when it comes to military force to prevent a country from obtaining a nuclear weapon that is a very achievable objective u s special envoy for iran rob malley said in a tweet after a nov 18 meeting with middle eastern allies and european parties to the deal that iran could choose one of two paths continued nuclear escalation crisis or mutual return to the jcpoa creating opportunities for regional economic diplomatic ties time to choose is short malley wrote sources familiar with preparations for the talks say that the parties were closely watching international atomic energy agency director rafael grossi s visit to tehran last week seeing it as an indication of iran s approach to the talks in vienna those sources said grossi told the iaea board afterward that the talks were inconclusive one of the contentious issues remaining is that iran is refusing inspectors from the iaea monitoring access to the karaj centrifuge production facility which reports suggest has resumed operations this is seriously affecting the ability to restore continuity of knowledge at the workshop which has been widely recognized as essential in relation to a return to the jcpoa grossi told a board of governors meeting on wednesday the arms control association noted that iran s refusal to allow the iaea to install new cameras or confirm that production hasn t restarted could undermine attempts to revitalize the jcpoa and its strict verification regime if it isn t possible to fully complete records of iran s nuclear program tehran s refusal to grant access to karaj also drives speculation and concern about what exactly iran is doing the aca said no choice on thursday the u s mission to international organizations in vienna told the iaea meeting that if iran s non cooperation is not immediately remedied especially the restoration of continuity of knowledge at karaj the board will have no choice but to reconvene in extraordinary session before the end of this year in order to address the crisis meanwhile on friday iran announced its stock of 60 enriched uranium has grown to 66 pounds and its amount of 20 enriched uranium had also increased both levels are much closer to weapons grade uranium which is enriched above 90 according to the arms control association enriching uranium to 20 constitutes about 90 percent of the necessary work to enrich to weapons grade as iran s stockpiles grow the aca says its breakout time or the time it would take to produce enough uranium enriched to weapons grade for one bomb decreases the aca estimates that iran s current breakout time is likely about one month down from 12 months when the jcpoa was fully implemented enrichment was limited under the jcpoa which the u s left unilaterally in may 2018 under former president donald trump iran restarted enrichment last year to pressure the u s to ease sanctions a very uncertain proposition state department spokesman ned price reflected the ambiguity surrounding the resumed talks on nov 22 calling the mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa a very uncertain proposition the next day price told reporters in washington that it is our hope that the new government in iran shows up in vienna and shows up in vienna ready to negotiate in good faith to build on the progress that had been achieved in the previous six rounds of negotiations but he added that the u s has been very clear that we are not prepared to take unilateral steps solely for the benefit of greasing the wheel to get the talks going again former president donald trump pulled the u s from the deal in 2018 sources familiar with the preparations for the talks have told cnn that the u s and its allies are not at a point where they would begin offering iran confidence building measures but one official said there is a possibility the u s and its allies could employ them down the road as a result incentives for iran won t be discussed at this week s meetings in vienna where the u s and allies will be focused on simply taking the temperature and seeking to advance from where they left off months ago u s and european sources explained plan b everyone involved in the talks is mindful of the ticking clock the sources told cnn that there s still time to reach a deal but it would likely run

a worrisome new strain of the coronavirus pushed the pandemic back to the forefront sunday spurring global travel restrictions and raising alarm about the south african variant s potential to deliver another medical and economic blow to the u s white house chief medical adviser dr anthony fauci said that no cases have been detected in the u s but said it was only a matter of time before the omicron variant reaches american shores as we all know when you have a virus that has already gone to multiple countries inevitably it will be here said dr fauci on abc s this week the question is will we be prepared for it and the preparation that we have ongoing for what we re doing now with the delta variant just needs to be revved up he warned indeed canadian officials announced sunday that the omicron variant had reached their country with two cases in the province of ontario putting the latest virus mutation on america s largest land border with its biggest trading partner australia also found two cases and the netherlands found 13 by sunday a strong indication that the virus already has spread far beyond southern africa see also canada confirms first two cases of omicron covid 19 variant the white house covid response team urged americans to get fully vaccinated or a booster shot as soon as possible after meeting sunday on the variant with president biden and dr fauci even before the first u s case the variant was taking a toll the dow jones industrial average fell 905 points or 2 5 friday for its biggest plunge since june 2020 as the world health organization who announced that omicron had been labeled a variant of concern the first since the delta variant was detected in december 2020 mr biden announced flight restrictions on south africa and seven other african countries slated to take effect monday others announcing travel limits to the southern africa region included the european union canada israel and singapore dr fauci acknowledged that travel bans are ineffective against viruses in the long run but said that they can slow things down giving countries a chance to prepare for the worst what you can do is you can delay it enough to get us better prepared and that s the thing that people need to understand he said if you re going to do the travel ban the way we ve done now and that we re implementing right now utilize the time that you re buying to fill in the gaps the variant has also raised concerns about another round of economically devastating and politically divisive lockdowns but dr fauci said it was really too early to say whether such steps would be necessary people talking about lockdowns people talking about that let s see what the information that we re getting in real time tells us and we ll make decisions based on the science and the evidence the way we always do he said but you want to be prepared to do anything and everything and that s the reason why we re paying such close attention to this and why we re all over it dr francis collins director of the national institutes of health acknowledged that it s certainly not good news we don t know yet how much of an impact this will have dr collins said on cnn s state of the union it ought to redouble our efforts to use the tools that we have which are vaccinations and boosters and to be sure we re getting those to the rest of the world too which the u s is doing more than any other country the virus is not tired of us whether the omicron variant spurs another round of shutdown orders hinges on its factors including severity and transmissibility neither of which is fully understood at this point according to the who in a sunday statement who said that the number of cases in south africa pushed by the variant is rising but that epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of omicron or other factors also under study is whether omicron causes more severe infections than other variants including delta preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in south africa but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected rather than a result of specific infection with omicron who said there is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with omicron are different from those from other variants another major question is whether the covid 19 vaccine is effective against the omicron variant but dr collins said there is reason for optimism based on what we ve learned so far with alpha beta gamma and delta the vaccines which are generated against the original virus still work and the boosters work particularly well dr collins told cnn he said the covid 19 booster basically enlarges the capacity of your immune system to recognize all kinds of different spike proteins it s never seen this is a great day to go and get boosted or find out how to do so at vaccines gov he said still unknown whether omicron could compete against delta referring to the highly contagious delta variant although omicron certainly shows the signs of being able to spread quickly said dr collins he cited the example of the beta variant which never really took off because delta was so incredibly effective in spreading that it couldn t compete we don t know what omicron will look like if it gets to our country and i hope it doesn t but it s fairly likely we ll see cases dr collins said will it be able to compete or will it fizzle in the next few weeks he said there should be more answers as medical experts gain data from south africa including information on the effectiveness of the vaccination in combating the variant though the issue is complicated by south africa s low vaccination rate we ll get some sense of that already from what s happening in south africa because about 37 of south africans are vaccinated dr collins said we should be able to find out in the next two or three weeks is the protection they re having somewhat better than the unvaccinated people he added the strain has already spurred political wrangling rep thomas massie kentucky republican mocked the biden administration s travel ban tweeting no worries travel ban begins next week because you know variants don t spread on holiday weekends he added ps who really believes this variant isn t already here the south africa ministry of international relations and cooperation accused other nations saturday of punishing the nation for reporting the variant by cutting off travel this latest round of travel bans is akin to punishing south africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker the foreign ministry said excellent science should be applauded and not punished the global community needs collaboration and partnerships in the management of the covid 19 pandemic the covid 19 variants are named after greek alphabet letters but who skipped the 13th and 14th letters nu and xi in labeling the omicron variant the decision to leapfrog letters prompted accusations of pandering to china a longstanding charge since the beginning of the virus in wuhan china the english spelling of xi is the same as the name of chinese president xi jinping although who said xi was skipped to avoid giving offense to regions and groups nu is too easily confounded with new and xi was not used because it is a common last name and who best practices for naming disease suggest avoiding causing offense to any cultural social national regional professional or ethnic groups the who said in an email the 14th letter of the greek alphabet although it is represented in english as xi is pronounced gz as in most english pronunciations of exactly it is unrelated to the chinese name xi which is a latin alphabet representation of a pictograph that is pronounced like the english feminine pronoun she among those who criticized the move were sen ted cruz texas republican and donald trump jr both longtime who critics if the who is this scared of the chinese communist party how can they be trusted to call them out the next time they re trying to cover up a catastrophic global pandemic asked mr cruz in a friday tweet the variant also presents another challenge for mr biden as he struggles with a free fall in the polls his approval rating on his handling of the pandemic has dropped from 69 in january to 48 as of saturday according to fivethirtyeight more than 770 000 people in the u s and 5 2 million people worldwide have died of covid 19 since the outbreak began in december 2019 in china dr collins said the variant means that we need to pay attention to those mitigation strategies that people are just really sick of like wearing masks when you re indoors with other people who might not be vaccinated and keeping that social distance i know america you re really tired of hearing those things but the virus is not tired of us and it s shape shifting itself he said if you imagine we re on a racetrack here

early evidence shows there s a higher risk of re infection for people who have previously had covid 19 example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video fort worth texas right now researchers across the world are working to learn more about the new omicron strain of covid 19 friday the world health organization who designated it a variant of concern after a cluster of cases were found in several african countries within hours stock markets plummeted and the biden administration restricted travel from south africa and seven other countries i didn t want people to be in a frenzy or in a panic mode like right now at this moment dr prathit kulkarni an infectious disease professor at baylor college of medicine said we re going to learn a lot more in the coming days and weeks about this particular variant lab tests are currently focusing on three questions that as of yet don t have definitive answers does it spread easier than delta does it cause more severe illness and does it evade vaccines what you can do is delay it enough to get us better prepared white house medical adviser dr anthony fauci said in an abc interview sunday fauci said the strain which has already been detected in europe and canada is probably already in the us and the mutations in the virus likely make it more transmissible than earlier strains whether it causes more severe illness and how effective vaccines are against it are still tough to gauge in south africa where just 25 of the population is vaccinated i don t think there s any possibility that this could completely evade any reach by the vaccines fauci said kulkarni said the mutations are like puzzle pieces researchers know what certain mutations can change but it s unclear what they ll mean when combined texas covid 19 hospitalizations have been flat for two weeks but cold weather states are seeing increases a sign the same could happen in texas where the positivity rate is already trending up the fundamental principles that everybody was doing yesterday we should still be doing those same things today kulkarni said no matter what scientists learn about omicron the best tools to stop it won t change masks still work free tests can still prevent the spread before it starts and free vaccines are the best way to avoid serious illness both pfizer and moderna say they re reviewing if an omicron specific booster would be necessary you use this time to really really put the pedal to the floor and get people vaccinated and get people boosted fauci said let s see what the information that we re getting in real time tells us and we ll make decisions based on the science and the evidence the way we always do kulkarni says at this point any family holiday travel plans are still as safe or risky as they were yesterday if we get some new information in the coming weeks you may have to make an adjustment kulkarni said the next step will be getting as much as the world vaccinated as quickly as possible to avoid future mutations
by roger straw november 28 2021 you think you re tired of this i ve about had it i m a news junkie every morning since i don t know when i ve gotten up in the morning and sat in front of the newspaper and tv news over 3 cups of coffee with cream well it can t be all work and no play but waking this morning i almost couldn t bring myself to do it i didn t want to see the daily news shows i d heard the early reports yesterday about the outbreak of the new covid variant omicron in southern africa and its early spread to europe and i actually dreaded learning more but no i m the one pushing covid news here in benicia solano county right almost daily since april 2020 i ve monitored the local and regional covid news and let you know i ve spent over a year and a half immersed in the daily toll numbers with faces behind each one totals that belie pain and loss and grief words and spreadsheets and blog postings that failed really at every turn to tell the heart rending stories of friends and families i was actually tired of it long ago and now this you know that i m not among those saying we are almost out of the danger zone i ve never let up on the alarm bells but when omicron surfaced it seemed too much even for me please not again not more not more how many of you out there have long ago turned off the tv reports on covid or at least diverted your attention we keep on with the masking and social distancing but increasingly we need to plug our ears i know my readership is down on the benindy people are really really tired of hearing about covid brian stelter of cnn s reliable sources outlines the difficulty we all are facing early warnings about omicron with no certainty as to what is coming i ll leave it to him to sum up what we know and don t know and to help clarify our anxiety ridden responses to omicron this is really good and well written read on
by brian stelter cnn business a version of this article first appeared in the reliable sources newsletter you can sign up for free right here one of president biden s many fights right now is a fight against perceptions of economic peril a never ending pandemic and his own political weakness in recent speeches he is issuing rebuttals and trying to change perceptions on wednesday for instance he gently skewered the news media if you ve watched the news recently you might think the shelves in all our stores are empty across the country that parents won t be able to get presents for their children but here s the deal for the vast majority of the country that s not what s happening biden ticked through his administration s actions taken in partnership with business and labor and said shelves are going to be stocked i felt like the entire speech was a response to recent coverage his message in effect was don t succumb to the sky is falling style of news coverage that is so commonplace at the moment he struck a similar tone on monday when he addressed americans about omicron and said it s not a cause for panic a subtle pushback to some of the panicked initial reactions to the variant news but are his arguments getting through that s very much debatable on a recent episode of reliable sources i talked about news whiplash as a viewer it s easy to feel like the country is lurching from crisis to emergency to calamity and by the time one is solved the next is already stealing all the headlines the fox distortion field i know i m a broken record about this but anti biden media coverage is critical to understanding the biden presidency for example fox showed biden s lunchtime speech live on wednesday but newsmax pointedly did not host john bachman said while interviewing seb gorka that we re monitoring the speech but i can t watch this guy squint into the teleprompter and tell us you know lies anymore so i m going to spare the audience that you know he s talking about the supply chain here but i want to go back to this issue with the vaccines and then bachman indulged anti vax talking points one of the banners on hannity on wednesday night reacting to the aforementioned speech said biden admin downplays the severity of the supply chain crisis another said desperate dems rely on deception and distortion to try and sell destructive agenda that s a lot of d s the distortion field is very well demonstrated through omicron biden has said several times this week that the country will fight covid not with shutdowns or lockdowns but with widespread vaccinations testing and more the words not with shutdowns or lockdowns have been baked into his public appearances he could not be any more clear and yet tucker carlson told his fan base on wednesday that the biden administration is once again locking down the country in response to the new variant one of carlson s banners said power hungry dems will only intensify lockdowns so the president said a but fox says the president is doing z is there any remedy for disinformation like that views from the left liberal defenders of biden are increasingly lambasting political coverage and not just fox s not by a long shot during biden s speech on wednesday eric boehlert said i m glad biden is calling out media s hysterical unglued inflation supply chain coverage elsewhere zachary pleat of media matters argued that the mainstream media missed the mark with their gloomy thanksgiving coverage writing there was no shortage of turkeys the predicted tsa staffing shortages didn t happen and black friday shopping increased 30 from last year but do those points match perception the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
new york times by dana g smith march 1 2024 we re four years into the pandemic and by this point most americans have had covid at least once but when the virus comes for us again it can still feel just as alarming as your first bout here s a guide to what covid looks like now and how to treat it symptoms the most common covid symptoms haven t changed much since the start of the pandemic and they remain consistent for the latest dominant variant jn 1 said dr soniya gandhi the associate chief medical officer at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles they include fatigue sore throat congestion runny nose headache body aches and cough all or any of those in isolation can still be covid dr gandhi said some people may develop conjunctivitis also known as pink eye or experience gastrointestinal issues like nausea vomiting and diarrhea but those symptoms are rarer anecdotally experts said one of the most notable symptoms early in the pandemic the loss of taste and smell also appears to be less common these days the biggest change is that people are having milder symptoms overall said dr amanda casto an acting assistant professor of allergy and infectious diseases at the university of washington that s because virtually everyone has some pre existing immunity from vaccines a prior infection or both while covid is mild for most people it can be dangerous and even fatal for some data from the centers for disease control and prevention indicated that as of mid february more than 21 000 people were hospitalized with covid and there had been roughly 10 000 covid related deaths in 2024 severe illness is a lot less prevalent now than during the first few years of the pandemic but we re still seeing it said dr stuart ray a professor in the division of infectious diseases at johns hopkins medicine in baltimore the people who are getting sickest tend to be those with compromised immune systems and underlying health conditions such as heart disease diabetes or lung problems adults over age 65 are also at higher risk for severe infections since mild covid can look like a cold or the flu it s important to test yourself if you have symptoms or have had a known exposure dr gandhi said knowing what you have can affect your treatment and how long you isolate from others on march 1 the c d c updated its guidance for preventing the spread of covid and other respiratory viruses the agency recommended that people isolate until their symptoms have started to improve and they have been fever free for at least 24 hours the agency acknowledged that people may still be contagious at this point and should continue to take precautions like masking and physical distancing for the next five days treatment the antiviral pill paxlovid is very effective against severe covid reducing the risk of death by 73 percent if taken within the first five days of an infection according to a preliminary study conducted by the national institutes of health experts urged people who are high risk to contact their doctors about getting a prescription as soon as they have symptoms or test positive if you re elderly or you have comorbidities before you even get worse you should already seek medical care said dr bernard camins the medical director for infection prevention at the mount sinai health system in new york your health care provider will then evaluate you if you re a candidate for antivirals paxlovid isn t recommended for everyone it can interact with several medications including common ones used to lower blood pressure or prevent blood clots and it s also not advised for people with severe kidney disease if you can t take paxlovid the drug remdesivir could be an option but it has to be delivered intravenously so it s less convenient and harder to obtain paxlovid also doesn t appear to provide much benefit to young healthy adults whose risk of severe infection is low so it isn t broadly recommended for those groups for most people covid symptoms can be managed at home and treated like any other respiratory illness with an emphasis on rest and staying hydrated if you have congestion or cough you re losing more fluids than you normally would dr casto said so i would definitely recommend that people stay on top of fluid if you have a fever or body aches take acetaminophen tylenol or ibuprofen advil or motrin you can also take over the counter cold and flu medicines with decongestants or cough suppressants though the experts didn t recommend them strongly because they don t work for everybody and can cause drowsiness when to seek medical care if you re experiencing shortness of breath meaning you can t catch your breath or are taking quick and shallow breaths it s important to seek medical attention right away the thing that i worry most about is the breathing dr casto said that s the most concerning sign because people can get worse really quickly if you re having trouble breathing she advised going to the emergency room rather than to your doctor or an urgent care clinic experts also said you should see a provider if you experience confusion or chest pain if your symptoms don t improve after several days or improve and then regress it could be a sign you have a secondary infection like pneumonia dr casto said in that case or if you re concerned about your symptoms at all don t hesitate to call your doctor dana g smith is a times reporter covering personal health particularly aging and brain health
amir peay had high hopes when he salvaged the abandoned 140 year old james e pepper distillery near the heart of lexington kentucky after years of planning and renovations it was finally ready to produce whiskey on site in 2017 but peay s hopes were dashed a few months later as the european union imposed tariffs on american whiskey we thought we could really grow our business over there says peay that is of course until june of 2018 when out of the blue american whiskey got dragged into a trade war but now peay and whiskey distillers across the u s are raising their glasses and setting their sights once again on europe the u s and european union announced a trade agreement last month that effectively lifts the 25 percent tariffs on american whiskey come january the tariffs which had been levied as part of a growing trade dispute between the trump administration and the e u over steel and aluminum also targeted american exports such as motorcycles and denim and stymied international growth for the burgeoning american whiskey industry jeff dean npr jeff dean npr the james e pepper distillery jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch walks through the distillery europe is a major importer of american spirits yet distillers saw a 53 decline in american whiskey exports to the u k and a 37 decline to the e u while the tariffs were in place resulting in over 300 million in lost revenue according to the distilled spirits council then covid 19 exacerbated the pain of small distillers as they were forced to close their doors to tours and tastings and bars and restaurants shut down in the beginning when the pandemic hit you know myself and us as a company we were really really nervous and scared says peay adding that bars and restaurants made up nearly half of his business at the time jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch inspects the mash jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch weighs containers of rye the distillery pivoted to retail sales and with more people drinking at home throughout the pandemic the company sold a record number of cases of whiskey in 2020 peay says we had very strong domestic growth says peay but it made us change how we wanted to allocate stock to europe and it altered what was going to be our growth trajectory in europe jeff dean npr jeff dean npr rye is transferred from a silo into storage containers it could be hard for smaller craft distillers to reclaim the space they lost on european store shelves when the tariffs were imposed now that distributors have adjusted their purchasing strategies once you re off the shelves it s like 300 times harder to get back on says sonat birnecker hart president of koval distillery in chicago illinois jeff dean npr jeff dean npr distillery employee cody giles left uses a forklift to pick up a container of malt jeff dean npr jeff dean npr bottles sit on bottling line at the james e pepper distillery hart says koval decided to keep its prices steady essentially eating the excess cost of the tariffs in order to maintain existing relationships we had to show them that we were in it for the long term says hart so when the biden administration announced that it had come to an agreement with the e u to lift the tariffs hart saw reason to celebrate we took out the bourbon cocktails to toast that the tariffs had gone away says hart that being said you know there s still work to be done jeff dean npr jeff dean npr boxes are stacked at the james e pepper distillery jeff dean npr jeff dean npr travis kitchens pours a tasting flight at the james e pepper distillery especially when it comes to britain the u k is no longer part of the e u thanks to brexit and has yet to remove its tariffs on american whiskey yet amir peay in lexington is optimistic a deal will be struck and demand for u s whiskey will increase it s not a light switch we can t just flick it and immediately just let s go back to what we had he says i m not sure about 2022 but i am confident that 2023 and beyond it s a very bright future for american whiskey in europe copyright 2023 npr to see more visit
what to know about eris the new covid 19 subvariant sweeping the us today by caroline kee august 10 2023 the eg 5 eris variant is now the dominant covid 19 strain in the u s here s what to know about transmission and symptoms a new covid 19 variant called eg 5 is sweeping across the united states as cases and hospitalizations rise the fast spreading new covid subvariant also referred to as eris is now the dominant strain circulating in the u s health officials say as of last week eg 5 accounted for the largest proportion of covid 19 infections in the country compared to any other variant according to the latest data from the u s centers for disease control and prevention eris is also on the rise in several other countries around the globe on wednesday aug 9 the world health organization decided to classify eg 5 as a variant of interest the new subvariant which experts nicknamed eris on social media started circulating in the u s earlier this spring last month eg 5 quickly overtook the prevailing omicron xbb subvariants which had been driving the largest share of cases in the country during a two week period ending on aug 5 eris accounted for an estimated 17 3 of new confirmed covid 19 cases in the u s up from 12 two weeks prior according to the latest cdc data many are wondering if the eg 5 subvariant is more transmissible or severe and whether it s causing different symptoms what is eg 5 aka eris eg 5 is a descendant of the omicron xbb sublineage of the virus specifically xbb 1 9 2 but it has an extra mutation in its spike protein according to a who risk evaluation report when we look at its sequence eg 5 is really similar to the other xbb variants that are circulating right now with a couple of small changes dr andrew pekosz a virologist at johns hopkins university tells today com the who added eg 5 to its list of variants under monitoring on july 19 2023 but the variant was first detected in february 2023 scientists have known about this variant and it s been present in other countries as well says pekosz so far eg 5 has been reported in 51 countries and there has been a steady increase in prevalence globally the majority of sequences are from china followed by the u s south korea japan and canada per who xbb 1 16 also called the arcturus variant remains the most prevalent strain of covid 19 worldwide who considers the public health risk posed by eg 5 to be low and similar to that of xbb 1 16 and other variants of interest is eg 5 more transmissible the eg 5 variant is very similar to other omicron variants which means it s highly transmissible dr albert ko an infectious disease physician and professor at yale school of public health tells today com however eg 5 is likely more transmissible than other xbb variants dr sharon nachman chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at stony brook children s hospital tells today com if it was equally transmissible then we wouldn t see it gaining strength number wise compared to some of the other variants says nachman adding that eg 5 quickly pushed out other xbb variants in the u s which were dominant over the summer why exactly eg 5 is more transmissible is not yet known ko says whether it s escaping population immunity or it has some intrinsic factor that makes it better able to transmit from one person to another it s hard to separate he adds according to who eg 5 has increased immune escape properties compared to other variants eg 5 may cause a rise in case incidence and become dominant in some countries or even globally who said in a report however pekosz notes that the eg 5 variant may not be the sole reason for the u s summer uptick when you have a new variants and cases creeping up there s always concern about whether that variant could be driving the increase says pekosz right now it doesn t look like that variant alone is driving the case increases in the u s there s still a lot of other variants co circulating he adds according to cdc estimates eg 5 accounted for about 17 of covid 19 cases in the u s during the two week period ending on aug 3 after eg 5 the next most common variants were xbb 1 16 xbb 2 3 and xbb 1 5 which accounted for 15 11 and 10 of cases respectively we re keeping an eye on eg 5 because of the uptick in cases but it doesn t look like there s anything particularly concerning about this variant says pekosz more data is needed to understand how eg 5 s transmissibility compares to other strains however decreased levels of testing and genomic sequencing are making it harder to accurately track new covid 19 cases and which variants are driving them pekosz notes right now there s an awful lot of guesswork he says is eg 5 more severe the data available do not indicate that eg 5 causes a more severe infection compared to other variants the experts note in its risk assessment of eg 5 who said there have been no reported changes in disease severity to date although the u s recently saw the first increase in covid 19 hospitalizations of the year there isn t evidence that eg 5 is causing this uptick or that it s more likely to cause hospitalizations in general nachman notes the people that are getting hospitalized often have lots of co morbidities and they re at risk no matter what covid strain they get says nachman however it s possible that hospitalizations could increase even more because of more people getting infected with eg 5 says ko there s no clear evidence of that at this point but we have to keep on evaluating ko adds population immunity from vaccination and prior infection should protect people from severe illness as eg 5 continues to circulate what are the symptoms there isn t enough clinical data about the most common symptoms of eg 5 yet nbc news previously reported there s no change in eg 5 symptoms right now says pekosz so far the symptoms of eg 5 look very similar to the standard omicron symptoms says ko these include cough sore throat runny nose sneezing fatigue headache muscle aches altered sense of smell it may progress to some more significant feelings of difficulty in breathing as the infection spreads into your lungs says pekosz certain groups are at higher risk of developing severe illness or complications including people over 65 and those who are immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions can covid 19 tests detect eg 5 all covid 19 tests including pcr tests performed by a medical provider and rapid at home antigen tests sold over the counter should be detecting eg 5 says pekosz the experts emphasize the importance of getting tested as covid 19 cases increase and especially during the fall when viruses that cause similar symptoms such as flu and rsv are circulating if you re in one of the high risk groups for getting severe covid you really shouldn t hesitate to get a test says pekosz adding that early detection and treatment is key covid 19 antivirals such as paxlovid are effective against eg 5 and other variants but they work best when taken early he adds whether your insurance covers covid 19 testing may have changed since the end of the u s federal public health emergency in may today com previously reported so check with your insurer if you have questions about testing costs it s also important to check the expiration date of at home tests the shelf life of rapid tests ranges from four to 24 months according to the u s food and drug administration but the expiration dates of some tests have been extended will i need a covid 19 booster this fall the experts encourage everyone to stay up to date on covid 19 vaccines which may include a new booster dose in the coming months in june 2023 the fda advised vaccine manufacturers to update their boosters to target omicron xbb 1 5 which was the dominant strain at the time these shots haven t been approved yet but the fda could authorize pfizer s booster shot by the end of august nbc news reported although the new boosters will not include the eg 5 strain they may still provide protection the experts note if i vaccinate you with the vaccine that contains xbb you will make antibodies that are specific to xbb and pretty close to eg 5 says nachman right now eg 5 looks like it s very closely matched to the vaccine that s going to be available this fall says pekosz however the cdc has not yet released any firm guidance or recommendations around booster doses for the fall the message is to pay attention to the covid vaccine program that s going to come out in the fall it s a vaccine that many people especially high risk individuals should consider taking says pekosz how to protect yourself from eg 5 in addition to staying up to date on covid 19 vaccinations the experts emphasize taking precautions to protect yourself and curb transmission of covid 19 including
london reuters the omicron coronavirus variant spread around the world on sunday with new cases found in the netherlands denmark and australia even as more countries imposed travel restriction to try to seal themselves off the world health organization who said it was not yet clear whether omicron first detected in southern africa is more transmissible than other variants or if it causes more severe disease preliminary data suggests that there are increasing rates of hospitalization in south africa but this may be due to increasing overall numbers of people becoming infected rather than a result of specific infection who said it said understanding the level of severity of omicron will take days to several weeks the detection of omicron triggered global alarm as governments around the world scrambled to impose new travel curbs and financial markets sold off fearing the variant could resist vaccinations and upend a nascent economic reopening after a two year global pandemic in its statement the who said it was working with technical experts to understand the potential impact of the variant on existing countermeasures against covid 19 including vaccines britain said it will convene an urgent meeting of g7 health ministers on monday to discuss the developments dutch health authorities said 13 cases of the variant were found among people on two flights that arrived in amsterdam from south africa on friday authorities had tested all of the more than 600 passengers on the flights and found 61 coronavirus cases going on to test those for omicron this could possibly be the tip of the iceberg health minister hugo de jonge told reporters dutch military police said they arrested a married couple who left a hotel where they were in quarantine after testing positive for covid 19 and were attempting to flee the country omicron dubbed a variant of concern last week by the who that is potentially more contagiousthan previous variants has now been detected in australia belgium botswana britain denmark germany hong kong israel italy the netherlands france canada and south africa many countries have imposed travel bans or curbs on southern africa to try to stem the spread financial markets dived on friday and oil prices tumbled a south african doctor who was one of the first to suspect a different coronavirus strain said on sunday that symptoms of omicron were so far mild and could be treated at home dr angelique coetzee chair of south african medical association told reuters that unlike with delta so far patients have not reported loss of smell or taste and there has been no major drop in oxygen levels with the new variant israeli measures in the most far reaching effort to keep the variant at bay israel announced late on saturday it would ban the entry of all foreigners and reintroduce counter terrorism phone tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant prime minister naftali bennett said the ban pending government approval would last 14 days officials hope that within that period there will be more information on how effective vaccines are against omicron the top u s infectious disease official dr anthony fauci told president joe biden on sunday it will take about two weeks to have more definitive information about the transmissibility and other characteristics of omicron the white house said in a statement adding that fauci believes existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of protection against severe cases of covid biden will give an update on the new variant and the u s response on monday the white house said in britain the government has announced measures including stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country and requiring mask wearing in some settings more countries announced new travel curbs on southern african nations on sunday including indonesia and saudi arabia south africa has denounced the measures as unfair and potentially harmful to its economy saying it is being punished for its scientific ability to identify coronavirus variants early south africa s president cyril ramaphosa said on sunday that his government was considering imposing compulsory covid 19 shots for people in certain places and activities and he slammed rich western countries for what he called their knee jerk imposition of travel bans the prohibition of travel is not informed by science nor will it be effective in preventing the spread of this variant ramaphosa said the only thing it will do is to further damage the economies of the affected countries and undermine their ability to respond to the pandemic omicron has emerged as many countries in europe are already battling a surge in covid 19 infections with some reintroducing restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread the new variant has also thrown a spotlight on huge disparities in vaccination rates around the globe even as many developed countries are giving third dose boosters less than 7 of people in poorer countries have received their first covid 19 shot according to medical and human rights groups

according to foreign media reports the tamarak mine in aitkin county mainly produces nickel and will soon begin the minnesota licensing process it may face the struggle of environmental problems brian goldner vice president of exploration at talon metals inspected nickel rich drill cores in tamarak minnesota talon metals brian goldner of talon metals picks up a drill core and points to nickel rich concentrations in an ornate shack used as a rock sample bank in tamarak minnesota it s ridiculous it s world class said goldner vice president of exploration at talon i ve never seen anything like this in my career in fact analysts who have reviewed the company s drilling results and securities filings say talon and its mining giant partner rio tinto rio tinto are sitting on potential nickel rich deposits which is rare in the united states it s a barn burner it s very impressive said david hammond a mining economist in colorado talon s promotion for the mine includes a direct air carbon capture system that absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and permanently stores it in the mine s rock waste it sounds like alchemy but a project based on similar ideas was launched in iceland earlier this year nonetheless even if a high grade nickel is found talon must prove to investors that the mine is economical and it has not yet gone through national environmental and mine licensing procedures which are expected to begin next year other proposed sulphide mines in northern minnesota the polymet and antofagasta twin metals projects are facing strong opposition from environmental groups and the band ojibwe which are linked to acid waste polluting lakes rivers and wetlands the tamarak mine is unlikely to escape its own battle fundamentally sulphide mining has failed to protect water quality in water rich environments for a long time said paula maccabi paula maccabee director of advocacy for the environmental group waterlegacy nickel will be the king of tamarak the tamarack mine which will cost about 400m and employ about 450 people will be located in the same great lakes geological belt the mid continental rift as the mines in polymet and antofagasta talon said but the two projects in northeastern minnesota are first copper mines with low grade nickel and other metals as by products high grade nickel is the king of tamarak copper is a secondary metal cobalt and other low grade metals there is only one high grade nickel mine in the united states the iger mine on the upper peninsula of michigan which is expected to run out by 2025 after nine years of operation the united states is almost always dependent on imported nickel said adrian gardner a nickel market analyst at consulting firm wood mackenzie only 7 per cent of global refined nickel production is used to produce ev batteries for electric vehicles he says 65 to 75 per cent is used to make stainless steel but electric vehicle batteries are expected to account for about 22 of the market by 2030 what excites everyone is the growth rate gardner said now is a good time for a mine like tamarak demand for nickel in both stainless steel and electric vehicles is strong but for all the discussion of the electric car market the nickel processing of batteries is usually done in china there are not even nickel refineries in the united states to produce almost pure nickel products there is no structure for making nickel based batteries in north america says mr gardner talon is betting that the us nickel supply chain will emerge in the coming years pointing to the efforts of president joe biden s administration earlier this month the usgs designated nickel as a key mineral and more importantly the biden administration suggested that the federal government help finance new nickel refineries the federal infrastructure measures signed into law this month include 6 billion in loans and grants for the processing of battery materials a large number of projects will compete for the money todd malan talon s chief external affairs officer said talon would work with other companies nickel refiners battery technology companies and carmakers to promote nickel processing projects to the federal government especially an oil refinery in minnesota we have to build a team to do that malan said rio tinto is considering participation the muscles behind the rio tinto project rio tinto s kennicott subsidiary began looking for copper and nickel in aitkin county as early as 1991 but did not start drilling until 11 years later after 42 drills rio tinto finally achieved encouraging results in 2008 anglo australian rio tinto is the world s second largest mining company operating mines smelters and metal refineries in 35 countries dealing with minerals from iron ore to copper to diamonds in 2018 rio tinto signed a contract with talon to become a joint venture partner of the tamarack project mining economist hammond said rio tinto does not engage in the business of developing small mines so they will transfer to talon talon is headquartered in the british virgin islands and operates in canada its shares trade on the toronto stock exchange at about 70 cents this is a junior miner a company dedicated to mining and exploration usually targeting only one project polymet s mine which is closest to minnesota s reality is also a junior miner backed by global mining giant glencore but there is a key difference between the two glencore owns more than 70 per cent of polymet and has been increasing its shares over time talon has been buying projects originally as rio and now owns 51 per cent of the tamarack joint venture and could hold up to 60 per cent rio in turn owns 6 per cent of talon this year talon s drilling program which will last six to nine months produces core samples with higher nickel and copper grades than the mine plan it currently submits to the securities regulator of course the rank is good but the second question is quantity how big is it said nitin laddha an equity analyst at couloir capital in other words are the nickel copper deposits near tamarak rich enough to eventually accommodate several relatively small deposits talon s mineral lease covers about 31000 acres mainly with minnesota the project does not involve federal land even a small mine can still be hugely profitable for talon owners because of its high grade minerals the details of the environment have not yet been made public talon says the mine s environmental footprint is relatively small waste rock called tailings is not stored in the dam reducing the risk of sulfuric acid leaking into the surrounding water system instead a large part of the tailings will be mixed with cement and pumped back underground the rest will be dried stacked and covered with soil nevertheless the environmental details of the tamarak mine have not been made public when they show up ojibwe s mille lacs band will keep a close eye on them part of the band s reservation is less than 10 miles from tamarak tamarack the same is true of the main waters of wild rice which is a mecca for the ogibwe people kelly applegate mille lac s natural resources commissioner says the band does not yet have a place in the mine but it has a lot of concerns especially about the possible toxic leaching of buried tailings we are worried that the groundwater may come into contact with the disturbed rock applegate said talon and rio tinto announced last month a carbon dioxide reduction project linked to the mine they are working with california based carbon capture inc work together to develop a technology that can remove carbon dioxide directly from the air rio tinto has invested 4 million in the company and has raised more than 40 million so far the carbon dioxide removed from the air by carbon capture s machine is mixed with a mixture of tailings and cement and then stored underground magnesium rich rocks that are usually accompanied by high grade nickel deposits react naturally with carbon dioxide to turn them into rocks this has happened for thousands of years the trick of direct carbon capture is to greatly accelerate the mineralization process direct carbon capture technology is still in its infancy and may never prove to be cost effective on any significant scale still the world s first commercial direct carbon capture project opened with great fanfare in iceland two months ago it injects carbon into the depths of basalt strata which can also convert carbon dioxide into rock icelandic companies sell carbon credits including to big companies such as microsoft and audi the tamarack program also depends on the company s purchase of carbon credits and the federal tax credit used to capture carbon
what to know about eris the new covid 19 subvariant sweeping the us today by caroline kee august 10 2023 the eg 5 eris variant is now the dominant covid 19 strain in the u s here s what to know about transmission and symptoms a new covid 19 variant called eg 5 is sweeping across the united states as cases and hospitalizations rise the fast spreading new covid subvariant also referred to as eris is now the dominant strain circulating in the u s health officials say as of last week eg 5 accounted for the largest proportion of covid 19 infections in the country compared to any other variant according to the latest data from the u s centers for disease control and prevention eris is also on the rise in several other countries around the globe on wednesday aug 9 the world health organization decided to classify eg 5 as a variant of interest the new subvariant which experts nicknamed eris on social media started circulating in the u s earlier this spring last month eg 5 quickly overtook the prevailing omicron xbb subvariants which had been driving the largest share of cases in the country during a two week period ending on aug 5 eris accounted for an estimated 17 3 of new confirmed covid 19 cases in the u s up from 12 two weeks prior according to the latest cdc data many are wondering if the eg 5 subvariant is more transmissible or severe and whether it s causing different symptoms what is eg 5 aka eris eg 5 is a descendant of the omicron xbb sublineage of the virus specifically xbb 1 9 2 but it has an extra mutation in its spike protein according to a who risk evaluation report when we look at its sequence eg 5 is really similar to the other xbb variants that are circulating right now with a couple of small changes dr andrew pekosz a virologist at johns hopkins university tells today com the who added eg 5 to its list of variants under monitoring on july 19 2023 but the variant was first detected in february 2023 scientists have known about this variant and it s been present in other countries as well says pekosz so far eg 5 has been reported in 51 countries and there has been a steady increase in prevalence globally the majority of sequences are from china followed by the u s south korea japan and canada per who xbb 1 16 also called the arcturus variant remains the most prevalent strain of covid 19 worldwide who considers the public health risk posed by eg 5 to be low and similar to that of xbb 1 16 and other variants of interest is eg 5 more transmissible the eg 5 variant is very similar to other omicron variants which means it s highly transmissible dr albert ko an infectious disease physician and professor at yale school of public health tells today com however eg 5 is likely more transmissible than other xbb variants dr sharon nachman chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at stony brook children s hospital tells today com if it was equally transmissible then we wouldn t see it gaining strength number wise compared to some of the other variants says nachman adding that eg 5 quickly pushed out other xbb variants in the u s which were dominant over the summer why exactly eg 5 is more transmissible is not yet known ko says whether it s escaping population immunity or it has some intrinsic factor that makes it better able to transmit from one person to another it s hard to separate he adds according to who eg 5 has increased immune escape properties compared to other variants eg 5 may cause a rise in case incidence and become dominant in some countries or even globally who said in a report however pekosz notes that the eg 5 variant may not be the sole reason for the u s summer uptick when you have a new variants and cases creeping up there s always concern about whether that variant could be driving the increase says pekosz right now it doesn t look like that variant alone is driving the case increases in the u s there s still a lot of other variants co circulating he adds according to cdc estimates eg 5 accounted for about 17 of covid 19 cases in the u s during the two week period ending on aug 3 after eg 5 the next most common variants were xbb 1 16 xbb 2 3 and xbb 1 5 which accounted for 15 11 and 10 of cases respectively we re keeping an eye on eg 5 because of the uptick in cases but it doesn t look like there s anything particularly concerning about this variant says pekosz more data is needed to understand how eg 5 s transmissibility compares to other strains however decreased levels of testing and genomic sequencing are making it harder to accurately track new covid 19 cases and which variants are driving them pekosz notes right now there s an awful lot of guesswork he says is eg 5 more severe the data available do not indicate that eg 5 causes a more severe infection compared to other variants the experts note in its risk assessment of eg 5 who said there have been no reported changes in disease severity to date although the u s recently saw the first increase in covid 19 hospitalizations of the year there isn t evidence that eg 5 is causing this uptick or that it s more likely to cause hospitalizations in general nachman notes the people that are getting hospitalized often have lots of co morbidities and they re at risk no matter what covid strain they get says nachman however it s possible that hospitalizations could increase even more because of more people getting infected with eg 5 says ko there s no clear evidence of that at this point but we have to keep on evaluating ko adds population immunity from vaccination and prior infection should protect people from severe illness as eg 5 continues to circulate what are the symptoms there isn t enough clinical data about the most common symptoms of eg 5 yet nbc news previously reported there s no change in eg 5 symptoms right now says pekosz so far the symptoms of eg 5 look very similar to the standard omicron symptoms says ko these include cough sore throat runny nose sneezing fatigue headache muscle aches altered sense of smell it may progress to some more significant feelings of difficulty in breathing as the infection spreads into your lungs says pekosz certain groups are at higher risk of developing severe illness or complications including people over 65 and those who are immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions can covid 19 tests detect eg 5 all covid 19 tests including pcr tests performed by a medical provider and rapid at home antigen tests sold over the counter should be detecting eg 5 says pekosz the experts emphasize the importance of getting tested as covid 19 cases increase and especially during the fall when viruses that cause similar symptoms such as flu and rsv are circulating if you re in one of the high risk groups for getting severe covid you really shouldn t hesitate to get a test says pekosz adding that early detection and treatment is key covid 19 antivirals such as paxlovid are effective against eg 5 and other variants but they work best when taken early he adds whether your insurance covers covid 19 testing may have changed since the end of the u s federal public health emergency in may today com previously reported so check with your insurer if you have questions about testing costs it s also important to check the expiration date of at home tests the shelf life of rapid tests ranges from four to 24 months according to the u s food and drug administration but the expiration dates of some tests have been extended will i need a covid 19 booster this fall the experts encourage everyone to stay up to date on covid 19 vaccines which may include a new booster dose in the coming months in june 2023 the fda advised vaccine manufacturers to update their boosters to target omicron xbb 1 5 which was the dominant strain at the time these shots haven t been approved yet but the fda could authorize pfizer s booster shot by the end of august nbc news reported although the new boosters will not include the eg 5 strain they may still provide protection the experts note if i vaccinate you with the vaccine that contains xbb you will make antibodies that are specific to xbb and pretty close to eg 5 says nachman right now eg 5 looks like it s very closely matched to the vaccine that s going to be available this fall says pekosz however the cdc has not yet released any firm guidance or recommendations around booster doses for the fall the message is to pay attention to the covid vaccine program that s going to come out in the fall it s a vaccine that many people especially high risk individuals should consider taking says pekosz how to protect yourself from eg 5 in addition to staying up to date on covid 19 vaccinations the experts emphasize taking precautions to protect yourself and curb transmission of covid 19 including
during those terrifying early days of the pandemic scientists offered one piece of reassuring news about the novel coronavirus it mutated slowly the earliest mutations did not appear to be consequential a vaccine if and when it was invented might not need regular updating over time the coronavirus sars cov 2 has had billions of chances to reconfigure itself as it has spread across the planet and it continues to evolve generating new variants and subvariants at a clip that has kept scientists on their toes two and a half years after it first spilled into humans the virus has repeatedly changed its structure and chemistry in ways that confound efforts to bring it fully under control and it s not showing signs of settling down into a drowsy old age even with all the changes so far it still has abundant evolutionary space to explore according to virologists who are tracking it closely what that means in practical terms is that a virus that s already extremely contagious could become even more so this virus has probably got tricks we haven t seen yet virologist robert f garry of tulane university said we know it s probably not quite as infectious as measles yet but it s creeping up there for sure the latest member of the rogue s gallery of variants and subvariants is the ungainly named ba 2 12 1 part of the omicron gang preliminary research suggests it is about 25 percent more transmissible than the ba 2 subvariant that is currently dominant nationally according to the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc said the subvariant has rapidly spread in the northeast in particular where it accounts for the majority of new infections we have a very very contagious variant out there it is going to be hard to ensure that no one gets covid in america that s not even a policy goal president biden s new covid 19 coordinator ashish jha said in his inaugural news briefing tuesday he was answering a question about vice president harris who recently tested positive for the virus and went into isolation harris had recently been boosted for the second time her fourth shot of vaccine her case highlights what has become painfully obvious in recent months no amount of vaccination or boosting can create a perfect shield against infection from sars cov 2 what the vaccines do very well however is greatly reduce the risk of severe illness that is hugely consequential as a matter of public health as is the wider use of therapeutics such as the antiviral paxlovid the vaccines currently deployed were all based on the genomic sequence of the original strain of the virus that spread in late 2019 in wuhan china they essentially mimic the spike protein of that version of the virus and trigger an immune response that is protective when the real virus shows up but the variants that have emerged can evade many of the neutralizing antibodies that are the immune system s front line of defense it s evolving at a fairly rapid rate said jesse bloom a computational biologist at the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle i do think we need to aggressively consider whether we should update vaccines and do it soon ba 2 12 1 brings the novel coronavirus up another step on the contagiousness scale its close relative ba 2 was already more transmissible than the first omicron strain that hit the country in late 2021 and omicron was more transmissible than delta and delta was more transmissible than alpha and alpha was more transmissible than earlier variants that did not have the glory of a greek alphabet name most mutations are not advantageous to the virus but when a mutation offers some advantage the process of natural selection will favor it there are two fundamental ways that the virus can improve its fitness through mutation the first could be described as mechanical it can become innately better at infecting a host perhaps it improves its ability to bind to a receptor cell or perhaps the mutation allows the virus to replicate in greater numbers once an infection has begun increasing the viral load in the person and commensurately the amount of virus that is shed potentially infecting other people the other strategy involves the workaround of immunity the human immune system when primed by vaccines or previous infection to be alert for a specific virus will deploy antibodies that recognize and neutralize it but mutations make the virus less familiar to the immune system s front line defense the omicron subvariants keep coming scientists in south africa have identified ba 4 and ba 5 which have mutations that were seen in earlier variants and are associated with immune evasion caseloads there are rising new laboratory research posted online sunday but not yet peer reviewed indicated that the emerging subvariants are adept at eluding the neutralizing antibodies seen in people who recovered from infections with the original omicron variant the authors of the study concluded that ba 4 and ba 5 have the potential to result in a new infection wave the evolution is much more rapid and expansive than we initially estimated said michael t osterholm a university of minnesota infectious disease expert every day i wake up i fear there will be a new subvariant that we will have to consider we re seeing subvariants of subvariants garry the tulane scientist points out that mutations in the virus do not change its appearance dramatically in fact he said even the heavily mutated variants don t look much different from the original wuhan strain or different from other coronaviruses that cause common colds these are subtle changes garry has a software program that allows him to create a graphic image of the virus and even rotate it to observe the locations of mutations and draw inferences for why they matter on friday asked about ba 2 12 1 and why it is spreading he noted it has a mutation named s704l that probably destabilizes a portion of the spike protein on the virus s surface that essentially loosens up part of the spike in a way that facilitates infection this s704l mutation distinguishes this subvariant from ba 2 the 704 refers to the 704th position for an amino acid on a chain of roughly 1 100 amino acids that form the protein the s is one type of amino acid serine seen in the original strain of the virus and the l leucine is what is there after the mutation the mutation is caused by a change in one nucleotide or letter in the genetic code of the virus three nucleotides encode for an amino acid the virus is spreading today in the united states on an immunological landscape much different from the one it first encountered in early 2020 between vaccinations and infections there aren t many people entirely naive to the virus the latest cdc data suggest the virus has managed to infect nearly 200 million people in the nation which has a population of about 330 million among children and teenagers about three out of four have been infected the cdc estimates for the new cdc study researchers looked at blood samples from thousands of people and searched for an antibody that is found after a natural infection but not found after vaccination the cdc concluded that the omicron variant managed to plow through the united states population during the winter almost as if it were an entirely new virus the country by then was largely vaccinated and yet 80 million people approximately became infected for the first time in that omicron wave on the family tree of this coronavirus omicron is a distant cousin of delta alpha and the other variants that had spread earlier it came out of virologic left field no one is sure of the origin of omicron but many disease experts assume it came from an immunocompromised patient with a very lengthy illness and the virus continued to use mutations to evade the immune system s efforts to clear it omicron was mercifully less likely to kill a person than previous variants but infectious disease experts are clear on this point future variants could be more pathogenic as if mutation wasn t enough of a problem the virus has another trick up its sleeve recombination it happens when two distinct strains infect a single host simultaneously and their genes becoming entangled the recombination process is the origin of what s known as omicron xe that recombinant probably emerged from a person co infected with the original omicron variant and the ba 2 subvariant it was always possible in theory but the identification of actual recombinants provides proof of concept as jeremy luban a virologist at the university of massachusetts medical school puts it the worst case scenario would be the emergence of a variant or recombinant that renders current vaccines largely ineffective at blocking severe disease but so far that hasn t happened and no recombinant has spread like omicron or other recent variants and subvariants this is the first catastrophic pandemic to occur in the age of modern genomic sequencing a century ago no one knew what a coronavirus was and even a virus was a relatively new concept but today with millions of samples of the virus analyzed at the genetic level scientists can track mutations virtually in real time and watch the virus evolve scientists across the planet have uploaded millions of sequences to the database known as gisaid genomic sequencing has a major limitation in that although scientists can track changes in the genome they don t automatically know what each of those changes is doing to the virus which mutations matter most is a question that can be discerned through laboratory experiments modeling or epidemiological surveillance but it s not always simple or obvious erica saphire president of the la jolla institute for immunology speculates that omicron has mutations that have changed the virus in ways not yet understood but which make it more resistant to antibody mediated neutralization it may have acquired some new trick that we haven t uncovered yet saphire said it s harder to neutralize than i would have expected based on the number of mutations alone a reality check comes from jeremy kamil associate professor of microbiology and immunology at louisiana state university health shreveport these are all sars cov 2 what he means is that these are all variations of the same virus despite what seems like a tremendous amount of mutation correspondingly someone who gets infected with one of these new variants has the same disease as people who got infected previously
airlines passengers and businesses scrambled to respond to a deluge of travel restrictions announced over the weekend intended to slow the spread of the omicron covid 19 variant an initial spate of bans on flights from southern africa where omicron was first detected gave way to more wide ranging measures that will make travel more expensive and less convenient if possible at all recalling earlier days in the pandemic the u k reintroduced mandatory pcr tests for all arriving passengers and said they must self isolate until they receive a negative result israel closed to all inbound foreign nationals for 14 days the philippines said travelers from european countries including switzerland and the netherlands won t be welcome for several weeks and singapore delayed the launch of travel lanes for vaccinated travelers from qatar the united arab emirates and saudi arabia
yesterday together with the prime minister johnson and merkel and macron president macron we came together to to reiterate our shared belief that diplomacy diplomacy is the best way to prevent iran from gaining nuclear weapon and we discussed how best to encourage iran to resume serious good faith negotiations i think we re continuing to suffer from the very bad judgments that president trump made and pulling out of the jcpoa and uh so that s one issue and that issue is going to depend on whether and how that gets resolved is going to depend on their action and the willingness of our friends who are part of the original agreement to stick with us and make sure there s a price to pay economically for them to fail to come back with regard to the issue of how we re going to respond to actions taken by them against the interests of the united states whether their drone strikes or anything else is we re gonna respond we re going to continue to respond advertisement iran nuclear talks to restart as us emphasizes it s prepared to use other options if diplomacy fails share copy link copy the u s and its allies restart iran nuclear talks on monday unsure how tehran s new government will approach negotiations not optimistic about the prospects ahead and emphasizing that if diplomacy fails the u s is prepared to use other options the parties to the joint comprehensive plan of action will reconvene in vienna after almost six months to discuss a mutual return to the deal by both the u s and iran but the hiatus has given time for new obstacles to take root video above trump s iran deal exit very bad judgments biden said earlier this monthon friday iran announced yet more advances in its uranium enrichment which reduces the amount of time tehran would need to develop a nuclear weapon if it chooses to an announcement clearly meant to give iran leverage when it arrives in vienna for talks other parties to the agreement including germany the uk britain france china and russia are coming into the talks calling for negotiations to pick up where they left off european sources tell cnn they expect the iranians to treat the meeting as round one u s officials have expressed similar concerns the recently elected hardline government in tehran will send a new set of negotiators to vienna who have been emphasizing the need for complete u s sanctions relief not compliance with the deal while u s officials have said they have absolutely no plans to offer iran incentives to talk the time to choose is short and senior u s officials have repeatedly warned that if advances in iran s nuclear program and enrichment capability continue unabated they could render the benefits of the jcpoa moot a development that would force the u s to pursue other options we are still hopeful that diplomacy can find a way brett mcgurk the national security council s coordinator for the middle east and north africa told the manama dialogue organized by the international institute for strategic studies but if it cannot find a way we are prepared to use other options there is no question we are not going to allow iran to get a nuclear weapon period mcgurk said and when it came to military force for behavior change that is a pretty fuzzy objective for a military force when it comes to military force to prevent a country from obtaining a nuclear weapon that is a very achievable objective u s special envoy for iran rob malley said in a tweet after a nov 18 meeting with middle eastern allies and european parties to the deal that iran could choose one of two paths continued nuclear escalation crisis or mutual return to the jcpoa creating opportunities for regional economic diplomatic ties time to choose is short malley wrote sources familiar with preparations for the talks say that the parties were closely watching international atomic energy agency director rafael grossi s visit to tehran last week seeing it as an indication of iran s approach to the talks in vienna those sources said grossi told the iaea board afterward that the talks were inconclusive one of the contentious issues remaining is that iran is refusing inspectors from the iaea monitoring access to the karaj centrifuge production facility which reports suggest has resumed operations this is seriously affecting the ability to restore continuity of knowledge at the workshop which has been widely recognized as essential in relation to a return to the jcpoa grossi told a board of governors meeting on wednesday the arms control association noted that iran s refusal to allow the iaea to install new cameras or confirm that production hasn t restarted could undermine attempts to revitalize the jcpoa and its strict verification regime if it isn t possible to fully complete records of iran s nuclear program tehran s refusal to grant access to karaj also drives speculation and concern about what exactly iran is doing the aca said no choice on thursday the u s mission to international organizations in vienna told the iaea meeting that if iran s non cooperation is not immediately remedied especially the restoration of continuity of knowledge at karaj the board will have no choice but to reconvene in extraordinary session before the end of this year in order to address the crisis meanwhile on friday iran announced its stock of 60 enriched uranium has grown to 66 pounds and its amount of 20 enriched uranium had also increased both levels are much closer to weapons grade uranium which is enriched above 90 according to the arms control association enriching uranium to 20 constitutes about 90 percent of the necessary work to enrich to weapons grade as iran s stockpiles grow the aca says its breakout time or the time it would take to produce enough uranium enriched to weapons grade for one bomb decreases the aca estimates that iran s current breakout time is likely about one month down from 12 months when the jcpoa was fully implemented enrichment was limited under the jcpoa which the u s left unilaterally in may 2018 under former president donald trump iran restarted enrichment last year to pressure the u s to ease sanctions a very uncertain proposition state department spokesman ned price reflected the ambiguity surrounding the resumed talks on nov 22 calling the mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa a very uncertain proposition the next day price told reporters in washington that it is our hope that the new government in iran shows up in vienna and shows up in vienna ready to negotiate in good faith to build on the progress that had been achieved in the previous six rounds of negotiations but he added that the u s has been very clear that we are not prepared to take unilateral steps solely for the benefit of greasing the wheel to get the talks going again former president donald trump pulled the u s from the deal in 2018 sources familiar with the preparations for the talks have told cnn that the u s and its allies are not at a point where they would begin offering iran confidence building measures but one official said there is a possibility the u s and its allies could employ them down the road as a result incentives for iran won t be discussed at this week s meetings in vienna where the u s and allies will be focused on simply taking the temperature and seeking to advance from where they left off months ago u s and european sources explained plan b everyone involved in the talks is mindful of the ticking clock the sources told cnn that there s still time to reach a deal but it would likely run out by the end of next year for now they said there is no hard and fast plan b yet critics of the deal say that the biden administration has sacrificed leverage by easing pressure on iran while it builds up its nuclear program the biden administration s iran policy is failing and without a significant course correction that policy will either result in iranian nuclear weapons or in a war to stop that development said mark dubowitz the ceo of foundation for defense of democracies dubowitz argued that the administration s approach will allow iran to rebuild toward a lethal end state of with pathways to nuclear weapons and a robust nuclear infrastructure israel is going to have no choice but to use military force to stop iran s nuclear weapons before tehran reaches this lethal end state dubowitz said israeli prime minister naftali bennett has been making clear that israel will be prepared to act if necessary addressing delegates at a security conference near tel aviv on tuesday bennett said that if there is a return to the jcpoa israel obviously is not a party to the agreement and is not obligated by it bennett complained that after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015 the state of israel simply went to sleep we were occupied with other things we will learn from this mistake we will maintain our freedom of action he said western officials have tried to argue to the israelis that attacks on israel s nuclear program are not very useful when the overall goal is to come up with a comprehensive solution and especially when the iranians have sped up their capability to rebuild after attacks sources familiar with the iran talks have told cnn western officials have also raised the danger of iran responding with kinetic action but sources familiar with the talks say israeli officials still seem to think that it is still an effective tool to show their capabilities asked about those warnings price said that at the end of the day the united states and israel we share a common objective here and that is to see to it that iran is verifiably and permanently prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon and we continue to believe that diplomacy in coordination with our allies and partners and that of course includes israel is the best path to achieve that goal we ve also been very clear that this is not a process that can go on indefinitely and if the iranians through their actions or through their inactions demonstrate or suggest that they lack that good faith that they lack that clarity of purpose we ll have to turn to other means price said tuesday we have a variety of other means we re discussing those with our allies and partners diplomatic flurryin recent weeks u s officials have conducted a flurry of diplomacy with regional powers and other parties to the deal working to forge a united front president joe biden met with european partners to discuss iran during the june g7 meetings in the uk in recent weeks secretary of state antony blinken has also conferred with european allies as well as china and russia on iran and malley recently met with gulf countries israeli officials and european partners in the jcpoa i think the iranians believe they have some eastward option with russia and china in which they can circumvent the pressure of sanctions mcgurk said on sunday and that is just wrong and so i think we are approaching the talks at the end of november as a pretty united front with the p5 1
reeling in a deal to save the ocean the ocean covers more than 70 of our planet s surface produces half of the oxygen we breathe feeds billions of people and provides hundreds of millions of jobs it also plays a major role in mitigating climate change over 80 of the global carbon cycle passes through the ocean but this precious natural resource is not invincible despite all the benefits it affords us the ocean today faces unprecedented man made crises that threaten its health and its ability to sustain life on earth the greatest threat to marine biodiversity is overfishing more than one third of global fish stocks are overfished and a further 60 are fully fished each year governments around the world encourage overfishing by providing 22 billion in harmful fisheries subsidies although these subsidies are designed to help support coastal communities they instead prop up unsustainable and unprofitable fishing activity depleting the very resource on which local populations livelihoods depend this problem is not new in fact the world trade organization s members have been trying to negotiate a deal to curb these damaging payments since 2001 world leaders reiterated their commitment to tackling the issue when they agreed in 2015 to the sustainable development goals sdgs under sdg 14 which aims to put a healthy ocean at the heart of the global sustainable development agenda leaders promised by 2020 to reach an agreement at the wto that would reduce fisheries subsidies but they missed the deadline as negotiations slowed during the worst of the covid 19 pandemic research shows that if wto members were to eliminate all harmful fisheries subsidies the most ambitious scenario global fish biomass could increase by 12 5 by 2050 that s an additional 35 million metric tons of fish or more than four times north america s annual fish consumption in 2017 and this is a conservative estimate removing destructive subsidies really will mean more fish in the sea the aim is not to remove support from fishing communities but rather to redirect it in a more meaningful and less damaging way even if a deal does not eliminate all harmful subsidies it would create a global framework of accountability and transparency for subsidy programs that in turn would spur dialogue between governments fishing communities and other stakeholders to spur the development of redesigned policies that better support fisherfolk while protecting our global commons moreover an agreement is within reach if the political will is there to deliver it the most recent lapse of the negotiations resulted from differences over how to structure flexibility in subsidy regimes for developing countries as well as how to define and enforce rules on illegal fishing and sustainable stocks but after numerous proposals and discussions the comprehensive draft now on the table combines measures to curb harmful subsidies with specific exceptions for developing countries with the start of the wto s 12th ministerial conference in geneva just days away now is the moment for a deal failure to conclude one would not only harm the ocean and the livelihoods of those who depend upon it but also would diminish the global rules based system and damage the pursuit of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development in contrast ending harmful fisheries subsidies would reduce the cumulative pressures on the ocean and increase its resilience in the face of climate change in the wake of the united nations climate change conference cop26 in glasgow governments must demonstrate their willingness to use every tool at their disposal to tackle the climate crisis the stakes at the upcoming wto ministerial conference have perhaps never been higher the future of multilateral trade cooperation is at risk but above all jobs food security and the health of our global commons are on the line that is why 33 former government leaders and ministers from around the world have joined forces with nearly 400 scientists in urging wto members to harness their political mandate to protect the health of the ocean and the well being of society governments have given their word that they will curb destructive fisheries subsidies next week s meeting in geneva will test the credibility of that pledge co authors arancha gonzález is a former foreign minister of spain 2020 21 susana malcorra is a former foreign minister of argentina 2015 17 james michel is a former president of the republic of seychelles 2004 2016 copyright project syndicate contact us at

cci by walking out of the proceedings and such act is a display of outright contempt for an indian statutory authority the kishore biyani led future group has alleged on november 24 2021 during the proceedings of the competition commission of india cci the team representing amazon walked out of the hearing when the regulator declined to grant the us based company extra time and postponement of the matter as they had sought in a regulatory filing on sunday future retail ltd frl said on november 24 2021 amazon at the commencement of the hearing tried to stall the personal hearing on the plea that they had filed a petition in the supreme court against the delhi high court order dated november 16 2021 the cci refused to postpone the hearing and continued with the same amazon s counsels chose to stay on and participate in the hearing during the submissions by fcpl however when their turn came for making the submissions amazon s counsel stated that amazon has not been given as much time as fcpl future coupons pvt ltd and hence more time should be given to amazon as per the filing the cci after internal consultation told amazon that postponement cannot be given and to make their oral submissions and at this stage the counsels to amazon in utter disregard to the norms and in utter disrespect to the indian statutory regulatory authority refused to argue the matter and walked out of the proceedings in an attempt to browbeat the cci the filing claimed amazon did not respond to emailed queries seeking its response on the matter frl firmly believes that the cci will not be intimidated by this arrogance of amazon and will take action on its scn show cause notice against amazon in accordance with law and regulations the filing noted the cci was conducting a hearing on november 24 to revisit its approval given to a 2019 deal between amazon and kishore biyani led group where the e commerce major had bought 49 per cent stake in fcpl fcpl is a shareholder in future retail after hearing the counsel the commission has decided to pass an appropriate order in due course the filing that included a letter by the cci secretary to fcpl stated apart from fcpl trade body

firm the conduct of amazon smacks of arrogance it has shown scant respect to the delhi high court the supreme court and to this commission the law firm said adding that amazon could have moved the delhi high court for an extension of time or for a suspension of the order but it perhaps did not find it necessary to do so instead it moved the supreme court by an interim application relating to the arbitration proceedings establishing its mistaken belief that the supreme court would not deny relief to amazon throwing established rules of cause of action to the winds the law firm said after it failed to get relief from the supreme court it then sought an adjournment from the cci and when that was refused amazon in a display of outright contempt for an indian statutory authority the

the top u s infectious disease official dr anthony fauci told president joe biden on sunday it will take about two weeks to have definitive information on the new coronavirus variant omicron that has sparked new travel restrictions and shaken financial markets biden returning to washington following the thanksgiving holiday weekend was briefed in person by his coronavirus response team on sunday afternoon as officials expect the new variant to reach the united states despite an impending ban on travelers from southern africa where it was first detected fauci said he believes existing vaccines are likely to provide a degree of
advertisement medical experts suspect even people who have already had covid will be highly susceptible to reinfection by the new omicron strain of the virus as it begins to spread worldwide epidemiologist nancy baxter who is the head of melbourne school of population and global health at university of melbourne said there s reason to be concerned but no reason to panic about the new variant australia has temporarily introduced a hard border with nine countries in southern africa the source of the new strain and state and federal leaders are on high alert with three cases already detected in returned travellers and a fourth under investigation experts say information on the new variant is sketchy and given how fresh its emergence is it s too early to determine exactly how rapidly it might spread or how potent it might be anecdotal evidence from medics in southern africa suggests omicron is more contagious than the now common delta strain but symptoms are milder particularly in the vaccinated population the world health organisation indicated omicron may pose a greater risk of reinfection than previous variants meaning even those who have already been infected with and recovered from covid could be at risk again here daily mail australia explains what we know so far about the latest covid strain gripping the globe epidemiologists say it is likely omicron has already spread worldwide despite cases only being recorded in a handful of countries so far pictured in red australia has temporarily introduced a hard border with nine countries in southern africa and state and federal leaders are on high alert with three cases already detected in quarantine and a fourth under investigation pictured is an unrelated reunion at adelaide airport when south australia recently reopened its state borders how many countries are already infected with omicron omicron was first detected in botswana on november 9 but there is not yet any data about where it originated or how it mutated just 25 per cent of the adult population in south africa is fully vaccinated and this accounts for how rapidly it has run through communities there ian sanne an infectious disease specialist and member of south africa s ministerial advisory council on covid 19 said his team believe omicron is now becoming the most dominant strain of the virus in the southern part of the continent succeeding delta overall we do think it s more transmissible he said since its initial discovery the new strain has been identified in britain belgium botswana the czech republic denmark germany hong kong israel italy and canada as well as at least three cases in australia while the united states is yet to confirm any cases of omicron president joe biden is said to be on high alert and has already issued an urgent plea for eligible americans to get their booster shots while his chief health advisor anthony fauci said it is highly likely the strain has already entered the country eric feigel ding an epidemiologist told dailymail com on friday that he believed the new variant was probably worldwide already anyone arriving from south africa lesotho botswana zimbabwe mozambique namibia eswatini and malawi will now need to isolate at a health facility for 14 days under the new emergency measures pictured swab testing in sydney airport what makes omicron a variant of concern the new covid strain is different to previous variants because there is a greater number of mutations in the cells omicron s genetic profile is unique representing a new lineage of the virus that has not yet been traced back to a specific time or place but experts are calling for calm globally as further testing is underway indicating it could actually be a good thing that omicron is spreading so rapidly if this particular genetic mutation is less deadly and causes milder symptoms it could be beneficial for the new strain to spread and replace delta dr nick coatsworth said early reports from southern africa suggested the new strain may spread throughout communities faster but the symptoms were far milder in vaccinated patients if this is milder than delta you actually want it to spread within your community the former deputy chief medical officer told nine s today show on monday you want it to out compete delta and become the predominant circulating virus it could be that we want omicron to spread around the world as quickly as possible the world health organisation said on friday preliminary evidence suggests this variant which has more than 30 mutations within the spike protein may have an increased risk of reinfection compared with other covid strains viruses regularly mutate there have been 13 mutations of covid 19 seen in australia alone and normally they make very little difference to the way a virus spreads but in some cases mutations can make a virus spread faster or more prone to evading a vaccine or tolerance built through previous exposure a variant of concern is only declared after scientists determine the strain to be more contagious lead to more serious illness or limit the impact of public health measures protecting against other strains of the virus the world health organisation said on friday preliminary evidence suggests this variant which has more than 30 mutations within the spike protein may have an increased risk of reinfection compared with other covid strains pictured a visual distinction between the delta are vaccines effective against omicron there are concerns the omicron variant will be less responsive to the vaccines already on the market both the united kingdom and united states have already called on eligible residents to receive their booster shots to offer maximum protection against omicron australian virus expert professor tony blakely it will take weeks before we know if booster shots are worthwhile or useless in tackling the new strain it s quite likely that this will precipitate new branches of vaccine development there s just so many mutations on this virus it would seem most likely we will need new vaccines he said the worst case scenario is it s more infectious it s more virulent and it s resistant to current vaccines health minister greg hunt revealed on monday morning he s in discussions with the australian technical advisory group on immunisation on the time frame of australia s booster shot rollout in light of the recent developments according to a spokeswoman from biontech which developed a vaccine in coordination with pfizer scientists could produce an adjusted vaccine within six weeks if required several nations australia included imposed a hard border with african countries that have been exposed to the virus within hours of omicron being declared a variant of concern pictured passengers arriving at sydney airport on monday morning will omicron cause severe illness and will existing treatments work the doctor who first raised the alarm about omicron said patients are presenting with unusual symptoms dr angelique coetzee who runs a private practice in the south african capital of pretoria said she first noticed earlier this month covid patients were testing positive despite not having any of the hallmark symptoms the doctor who has practiced for over 30 years and chairs the south african medical association said none of the omicron patients suffered a loss of taste or smell which is typically associated with covid instead they presented with markers like intense fatigue and a rapid pulse their symptoms were so different and so mild from those i had treated before dr coetzee told the telegraph she was compelled to inform south africa s vaccine advisory board on november 18 when she treated a family of four all of whom were suffering with intense fatigue after testing positive for covid globally there are still a relatively small amount of confirmed omicron cases making it hard for medical professionals to determine just how dangerous the variant is it will likely take several more weeks to notice if there is a spike in hospitalisations and deaths what s being done to halt the spread of omicron and how far could it have already spread us and europe earlier placed six countries on the red list before australia added another three malawi mozambique and seychelles several nations australia included imposed a hard

namibia eswatini formerly swaziland and malawi will now need to isolate at a health facility for 14 days under the new emergency measures new arrivals in nsw from anywhere else in the world will need to isolate at home or their accommodation and await further health advice at this stage state premier dominic perrottet said there were no plans to bring back hotel quarantine and he stressed the importance of the state s high vaccination rate in protecting the community we re very confident based on our higher vaccination rates he said that is not the case in these southern african nations vaccination is key to nsw being able to continue to open up safely our number one priority is to keep our people safe keep businesses open and keep people in work but public health experts say it s likely the new variant is already spreading rapidly through nations even beyond those where cases have already been detected the first known case in hong kong is a traveller who landed on november 11 meaning they ve been potentially infectious for two weeks in the community meanwhile in belgium a young unvaccinated woman has been diagnosed with the variant despite not travelling to southern africa she is understood to have developed symptoms 11 days after travelling to egypt via turkey will emergence of omicron upend plans to return to covid normal in australia in short it s not yet clear what

who had recently arrived after travelling through pakistan they are together in hotel quarantine as a family unit while testing is underway to identify the strain they are infected with deputy premier steven miles said the state would be taking a cautious approach before implementing any new restrictions as they always do the health officials are monitoring issues around the world and if that should affect things here he said nothing has changed at this moment south australia and western australia tightened border restrictions as other premiers around the nation also start to consider harsher controls trade and tourism minister dan tehan said he couldn t rule out restrictions to other nations if the outbreak spreads or more drastic measures if omicron turned out to be dangerous we ve taken a cautionary approach that s what we ll continue to take as we work through what this variant is all about and what potential impacts it may have he said we think that s got the balance right at the moment but there s obviously more work that needs to be done in understanding the new variant and the potential impacts it might have why is it called omicron the world health organisation is responsible for naming covid variants and has followed a trend of using letters of the greek alphabet in naming omicron the who skipped both nu and xi it s understood this was done to avoid confusion or offence nu is too easily confounded with new and xi was not used because it is a common surname the who said in a statement best practices for naming new diseases suggest avoiding causing offence

the losses moderated within the first hour after panic selling was followed by quick bargain hunting ig market analyst kyle rodda said investors are concerned that a vaccine resistant variant that could cause economic damage by sparking more lockdowns and travel restrictions there are a series of unanswered questions about what this actually means for the global economy and the global growth outlook more broadly he told daily mail australia on monday until those questions are basically answered we re going to see a high level of uncertainty reign in financial markets any time there s a high level of uncertainty it means a high level of volatility and normally that s really bad for equities at the moment we re in an environment where the ultimate fear is that we re back to something pre vaccines the horrible days of 2020 where we have a virus that s more virulent than delta that maybe leads to more severe outcomes potentially and is vaccine resistant during times of turmoil safe

correspondence to s wu shishi wu at utoronto ca shishi wu and colleagues examine three distinct response strategies for covid 19 in eight countries and argue that aggressive containment is the optimal approach to limiting loss of lives and livelihoods and achievable in the absence of vaccines and effective therapies early modelling studies in the covid 19 pandemic proposed two distinct response strategies suppression and mitigation 123 as the pandemic evolved researchers proposed a third strategy aggressive containment drawing on successful lessons from countries that had achieved covid 19 elimination in the interim 45 we review the application of these three strategies in eight countries in the first year of the pandemic and relate the findings to trade offs that occurred as a result of implementation we aim to provide guidance for optimising health and economic outcomes in the absence of vaccines and effective treatments defining response strategies aggressive containment is usually defined as zero community transmission for more than 28 days with the understanding that outbreaks might arise from border control failure 46 this strategy rapidly reduces disease burden by lowering covid 19 cases deaths and the risk of overwhelming the health system after community transmission is eliminated domestic control measures can be lifted and daily activities can resume largely without restriction suppression on the other hand aims to minimise the number of covid 19 cases without expecting to end community transmission modelling studies indicate that suppression cannot prevent an epidemic but can delay it until population immunity is reached through immunisation or natural infection 157 mitigation aims to minimise the effects of the pandemic on vulnerable populations and to avoid overwhelming health systems by permitting controlled transmission in low risk groups 8 different response strategies are put into use through combinations of public health interventions which can be categorised into three groups case based such as case detection contact tracing and isolation population based such as mask wearing and physical distancing and border control measures such as travel bans and mandatory quarantine requirements 9 community engagement whereby individuals and groups are involved in delivering services and supporting the uptake of control measures was commonly included in the response strategy we looked at the public health interventions and community engagement activities implemented in eight countries with different response strategies box 1 we also examined the preceding determinants to developing and sustaining these interventions box 1 how countries were categorised by their response strategies we purposively selected eight countries and categorised their responses to the initial stages of the pandemic in 2020 into three distinct strategic approaches for countries that did not explicitly announce their response strategies the categorisation was derived from position statements on the goals of national responses by government officials or the intention of public health interventions implemented in the first wave of the pandemic the strategies were defined as aggressive containment countries aimed to eliminate community transmission and achieved elimination status for 28 consecutive days by implementing public health interventions suppression countries aimed to suppress and minimise community infections by implementing public health interventions mitigation countries aimed to avoid overwhelming health systems by flattening the epidemic curve or achieving herd immunity in the population the public health interventions focused on protecting vulnerable and high risk groups while allowing transmission among low risk groups public health interventions were categorised as population based interventions such as lockdowns face masks social distancing and personal hygiene case based interventions include case detection contact tracing of confirmed cases isolation and surveillance of cases border control measures such as travel restrictions for travellers from high risk countries or mandatory quarantine requirements return to text aggressive containment aggressive containment was the predominant strategy in asian and pacific countries such as china new zealand and singapore table 1 with clearly defined targets these countries achieved zero community cases in the first year of the pandemic as of 16 november 2021 china 3 2 and new zealand 6 8 are among the countries with the least cumulative deaths per million people this number has rapidly increased in singapore 112 2 since the country transitioned towards endemicity in september 2021 13 table 1 performance of countries that adopted the aggressive containment strategy in the first year of the pandemic view this table case based interventions strict measures to identify trace and isolate covid 19 cases were commonly implemented in these countries 14 surveillance needs to be sensitive and geographically comprehensive to provide a timely and accurate understanding of disease burden 15 in addition to passive testing of symptomatic people these countries also took an active surveillance approach in china multiple rounds of population testing were conducted for all residents in cities where outbreaks occurred surveillance testing of high risk groups was also implemented in china new zealand and singapore aiming to identify community cases at an early stage these countries made great efforts to increase capacities for testing contact tracing and isolation china and singapore ramped up test kit production to meet accelerating demand all three countries scaled up laboratory capacity including building new laboratories decentralising testing services and training laboratory personnel contact tracing was implemented stringently all three countries required contact tracing for all cases using a forward tracing approach that looks for case contacts from symptom onset close contacts were isolated either in government designated facilities or at home in singapore spot checks were carried out to ensure people adhered to quarantine orders innovative technologies were widely used to facilitate contact tracing 16 an app that allows people to scan a qr code at businesses they visit was used in all three countries to document their location and visit time 17 population based interventions countries that aimed for containment implemented intensive population level interventions to curb community transmission early in the pandemic china new zealand and singapore implemented lockdown18 either in high burden regions or nationally initial lockdowns were more stringent and longer than in countries pursuing other strategies venues and events involving gatherings were banned and mobility restrictions were imposed such as limited access to public spaces except for essential business china implemented mandatory mask wearing soon after the outbreak in wuhan in january 2020 singapore and new zealand adopted it in april and june 2020 respectively to mitigate the effects of population based interventions all three countries launched socioeconomic support for businesses households and the economy such as subsidised loans for small businesses new zealand poverty subsidies china or job support programmes singapore these countries viewed the route to economic recovery as only possible by containing the pandemic border control measures countries implemented strict travel restrictions to keep their borders closed to most visitors testing and mandatory 14 day quarantine were required for travellers entering china new zealand and singapore the governments provided surveillance testing for workers at ports of entry phone based technology was used to monitor the health status of inbound travellers in quarantine community engagement all three countries rolled out comprehensive media campaigns across multiple platforms urging the public to adhere to prevention measures they also proactively engaged communities to plan deliver or promote adherence china used community workers to educate residents about covid 19 prevention measures provide directions to nearby testing and quarantine facilities and distribute necessities to residents singapore used volunteers to educate older people who lived by themselves about prevention measures factors influencing strategic choices and actions a strong commitment to tackling covid 19 from the heads of government prompted immediate action at the beginning of the pandemic learning from past experiences with the sars outbreak in 2003 china and singapore had strengthened their preparedness for public health emergencies the singaporean government was committed to improving pandemic preparedness and constructed a fit for purpose infectious diseases centre to be used in times of emergencies policy makers were receptive to scientific input from expert groups and committees enabling these countries to formulate evidence driven national covid 19 responses for example an expert committee of infectious disease experts public health specialists and clinical infectious disease doctors was formed during the first month of the outbreak in wuhan which played a central role in making decisions on response strategies suppression countries that adopted the suppression strategy include argentina uganda and the united states table 2 as of 16 november 2021 argentina 2549 9 and the us 2300 3 were among the countries with the most cumulative deaths per million people uganda 68 8 had much lower cumulative deaths per million people than other countries using the suppression strategy 13 table 2 performance of countries that adopted the suppression strategy in the first year of the pandemic view this table case based interventions guidance on testing eligibility was based on available resources and the epidemiological situation in each country argentina and the us prioritised testing for high risk groups in the first half of 2020 and decentralised testing services to private laboratories uganda surged testing capacity by modifying existing laboratories to make them appropriate for testing covid 19 and purchased test kits on the international market to ensure adequate stocks the testing capacity in these countries was stretched by limited testing sites and laboratories and shortage of testing kits and technicians contact tracing was implemented with different approaches and stringency in each country argentina did not implement consistent contact tracing until may 2020 with the detectar programme 20 in the us contact tracing was the responsibility of states and counties which used different implementation models funding workforce and policies 21 as cases increased financial shortage and overwhelming workload were the common challenges for implementing contact tracing stringently in the us and uganda in the us reluctance to provide contacts was an additional challenge leading to less than one contact per case identified on average in some regions 21 to support its surveillance system the us launched syndromic surveillance which monitors cases that meet the clinical definition of covid 19 without confirmation by testing population based interventions these countries implemented intensive population interventions to contain community transmission in the early phase of the pandemic see supplementary file for specific interventions in argentina a national lockdown started in march 2020 with exemptions for people providing essential services many states in the us issued stay at home orders in march or april 2020 which remained in place until mid may schools and non essential businesses were closed a national lockdown was imposed in uganda at the end of march 2020 but lockdown in these countries was relaxed before community transmission was eliminated as evidence on face masks emerged argentina uganda and many us states introduced mandatory mask wearing in april and may 2020 countries that aimed for suppression saw a trade off between public health measures and economic growth emphasising economic recovery during relaxation periods despite this multiple epidemic waves and subsequent tightening of restrictions resulted in all countries providing fiscal stimulus for businesses and employment protection border control measures travel restrictions such as suspension of flights from high risk countries and temporary border closure were imposed in all three countries in the early months of the pandemic but were gradually lifted towards the end of 2020 although proof of negative test results was commonly required for inbound travellers quarantine requirements varied in stringency across countries all travellers to uganda were required to isolate at government facilities for 14 days whereas home quarantine was allowed in the us and argentina community engagement countries aiming for suppression developed risk communication strategies that leveraged media platforms to reach the masses while local non governmental organisations reached out to communities on the ground community engagement activities were also common in these countries in uganda for example community volunteers warned the public about the consequences of violating control measures when fewer deaths and cases led to a rise in complacency among the public factors influencing strategic choices and actions partisan politics in countries such as the us led to mixed messages and lack of commitment from the government to mount a timely and effective response to the pandemic resulting in high loss of lives 22 us political leaders discredited scientific advisers contributing to delay and lack of coordination in its covid 19 response 23 uganda was relatively better prepared for public health emergencies having previously dealt with ebola outbreaks argentina and the us were less prepared partially owing to limited experiences of responding to large scale epidemics or underfunded public health systems mitigation sweden maintained a mitigation strategy from the start of the pandemic the united kingdom initially aimed for mitigation but shifted towards suppression as the pandemic escalated table 3 by 16 november 2021 sweden 1485 6 and the uk 2105 3 were among the countries with the highest cumulative deaths per million people in the world 13 table 3 performance of countries that adopted the mitigation strategy in the first year of the pandemic view this table case based interventions countries that aimed for mitigation delayed efforts to increase capacity for testing and contact tracing capacity sweden introduced testing for travellers returning from high risk countries in february 2020 after the eligibility for testing was expanded to priority groups insufficient access to testing was reported in many regions in the uk people with symptoms suspected of covid 19 were not eligible for testing in the early months of the pandemic after the government decided to increase testing capacity in may 2020 eligibility expanded contact tracing policies were inconsistent over the course of the pandemic with delayed efforts to increase capacity in sweden contact tracing was implemented at the start of the pandemic but was abandoned after a few weeks due to stretched human resources in the uk full contact tracing was abandoned in line with the move from contain to delay phase in march 2020 after receiving additional funding from the government a new contract tracing system was launched in may 2020 however it did not function effectively as expected as tracers failed to get in touch with one in eight confirmed cases 21 both countries took measures to strengthen surveillance of covid 19 cases such as conducting large scale surveillance studies or deploying sentinel surveillance population level interventions countries that adopted the mitigation strategy had less stringent population level interventions see supplementary file for specific interventions but gradually tightened them as the pandemic evolved instead of imposing lockdowns sweden issued recommendations for maintaining physical distance in schools workplaces and public places social and mass gatherings were banned in both countries as daily cases increased the uk moved towards a suppression strategy marked by the announcement of lockdown in march 2020 the lockdown relaxed in june 2020 as the epidemic curve flattened mask wearing was not recommended for the public in these countries in the first six months given the lack of evidence on its effectiveness there was no national recommendation for mask wearing for the public in sweden in the uk mask wearing was not mandatory until june 2020 both countries offered socioeconomic support such as the furlough scheme that paid wages of employees who lost their jobs owing to the pandemic uk and small businesses loans sweden border control measures sweden did not require testing for symptom free travellers before entering and arriving travellers were not obliged to quarantine the uk initially had no specific testing requirements for travellers the government advised against non essential travelling to high risk countries but did not impose travel bans or border closure in june 2020 however the uk tightened measures at the borders including 14 day self isolation for arriving travellers community engagement risk communication was largely conducted on media platforms with limited community engagement press conferences by the swedish public health agency were held regularly and broadcast on television and the internet digital platforms and hotlines were established to help people with migrant backgrounds access covid 19 information similarly in the uk updates on the epidemic situation or control measures were disseminated through regular press briefings factors influencing strategic choices and actions there was broad consensus on adopting a more relaxed response to covid 19 among politicians in sweden in line with its constitution but policy makers in the uk took a wait and see approach through public statements reassuring the public despite increasing domestic cases when public health interventions were enacted the population had already heard mixed messages about the need for a response benefits challenges and trade offs the three strategies have their own benefits challenges and trade offs table 4 although factors such as culture demographics and geography have contributed to how the pandemic and responses unfolded countries that opted for aggressive containment had lower deaths per million than those that took other approaches table 4 summary of benefits challenges and trade offs of each strategy view this table a concern of aggressive containment is the potential economic cost attributable to the maintenance of stringent measures we found however that countries using all strategies needed to introduce similar socioeconomic support measures this supports emerging research that containment might actually protect the economy by reducing uncertainty and allowing for a faster recovery resulting in less spending on socioeconomic measures and better economic returns owing to lower morbidities and mortalities 242526 most countries employing aggressive containment achieved economic growth in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 table 1 whereas countries following other strategies showed a sustained decline in gross domestic product gdp table 2 table 3 overall countries that implemented aggressive containment saw less fluctuation in weekly gdp and quicker recovery in the first year of the pandemic which supports the strategy s potential to protect lives and livelihoods better than suppression or mitigation approaches 27 successful containment is underpinned by a country s ability to rapidly mobilise resources and expand health system capacity so lower income countries might face challenges even if countries manage to implement aggressive containment measures some trade offs remain despite favourable health and economic outcomes aggressive containment has been criticised for restricting civil liberties and raises concerns about privacy infringement when aggressive contact tracing measures are taken 28 but civil liberties can be restored quickly in countries that achieved containment whereas research shows that liberties were severely impacted in countries following other strategies where mobility restrictions were often implemented more strictly 29 aggressive containment also disrupts employment and reduces access to social and health services bearing social and economic costs that need to be balanced with the cost of lives lost 30 suppression can reduce covid 19 burden in the short term but easing control measures before eliminating community transmission can lead to a resurgence of cases resulting in epidemic waves and excessive deaths recurrent public health interventions can cause fatigue in the population leading to higher non compliance in subsequent pandemic waves 31 countries employing the suppression strategy such as argentina and the us had some of the highest mortalities in the world and also experienced steep economic downturns and slow recovery in 2020 table 2 having much lower deaths per million uganda seems to be more resilient to the health effects of the pandemic possibly as lower income countries have younger populations that are less affected by the disease than higher income countries 7 owing to a large informal labour sector however lower income countries are more vulnerable to the socioeconomic repercussions of stringent public health interventions the governments often lack fiscal space and an accountable administrative system to tackle these unintended consequences 3233 thus the benefits of adopting the suppression strategy to reduce mortality might be less substantial when compared to the corresponding economic loss 34 countries that opted for mitigation preserved the freedom of movement of their citizens but this seems risky particularly in higher income countries with older populations where health systems might get stretched or even overwhelmed resulting in excessive deaths 27 both sweden and the uk had death rates comparable to countries adopting the suppression strategy table 3 these countries also experienced a slow economic recovery after a steep economic decline in the second quarter of 2020 as seen in sweden s and the uk s economic contraction in the third and fourth quarter of 2020 table 3 steps to achieving successful containment our analysis shows that containing community transmission is the optimal strategy to save lives and protect the economy and is achievable in the absence of vaccines and effective drugs we identified the interventions actions and determinants that contribute to successful containment fig 1 determining when public health interventions are implemented and lifted is central to success countries must take immediate action in response to a disease outbreak premature lifting of public health interventions leads to epidemic waves causing even more deaths and damage to the economy 3536 countries that aimed for containment clearly defined the goal of eliminating community transmission and made exit decisions based on explicit indicators fig 1 an illustration of steps to achieving successful containment by using public health interventions built on trust and community engagement coupled with strong political will health system preparedness and receptiveness to scientific inputs countries need to implement all three categories of public health interventions comprehensively with support measures for increasing capacity and mitigating the socioeconomic repercussions countries successful in containment implemented intensive population based interventions such as multiple national or subnational lockdowns to curb community transmission they delivered a range of socioeconomic support to provide safety nets for affected and vulnerable populations and quickly introduced measures to identify trace and isolate cases in communities and at borders to ensure these measures could be delivered comprehensively and stringently these countries made efforts to increase public health capacity and strengthen border control as the pandemic escalated support packages also improved the effectiveness of case based interventions like isolation in the us for example provision of food deliveries and additional financial support to those in isolation was found to enhance compliance 37 countries that opted for mitigation or suppression focused on population based interventions but they often sidelined or were hesitant towards case based and border control measures most of these countries delayed efforts to increase public health capacity suspended contact tracing and maintained relaxed border control successful containment is underpinned by the public s trust in policy makers and the government effective community engagement achieved through strong community leadership and coordination was fundamental to ebola responses leading to increased trust in health authorities 383940 during the covid 19 pandemic new zealanders trusted and supported the interventions implemented by their government resulting in high compliance initially which declined over time owing to fatigue and complacency 41 to maintain adherence two way community engagement through a whole of society approach ensures that all stakeholders understand the rationale for tightening or sustaining measures notably trust and community engagement are integral when technology is involved in contact tracing the us and uk faced challenges in their populations trust in the government s data management and privacy regulations which affected the uptake of contact tracing applications and thus reduced their effectiveness 4243 by engaging the community and implementing privacy safeguards contact tracing applications offer faster tracing and ringfencing and is therefore postulated to contribute to successful containment 44 three factors influence strategic choices and the success of containment first strong political will and commitment to tackling covid 19 prompted immediate actions multi sectoral collaboration and rapid resource mobilisation through a whole of government whole of society governance approach in successful countries 45 second a country s response capacity depends on its public health preparedness 46 the effectiveness of responses depends on the country having a well maintained public health system to perform its core functions and manage logistics in emergencies 47 countries have been asked to strengthen their preparedness for public health emergencies by implementing the global health security agenda and international health regulations 48 but most countries lack robust preparedness plans and core public health capacities as their public health systems are vastly underfunded and neglected 4950 successful countries drew lessons from past outbreaks to inform decisions on control measures and adapt their public health systems quickly 51 the lack thereof coupled with the absence of aggressive containment measures has been documented to overwhelm health systems increasing the mortality risks for patients with covid 19 50 finally successful containment is more likely to be achieved with scientific input up to date research evidence is the foundation for making optimal decisions on control measures to be implemented or relaxed but the supply of scientific evidence does not guarantee its uptake hence it is critical to establish mechanisms to ensure that evidence is incorporated in policy making in countries adopting the aggressive containment strategy independent expert committees formed after the declaration of the pandemic commonly spearheaded the formulation of response strategies and took on key advisory roles in high level policy decision making going forward as the world proceeds into covid 19 endemicity aggressive containment might not be the best way forward some but not all countries that permitted controlled spread of the virus thus generating higher natural immunity levels and had robust vaccination campaigns have been seen to relax public health interventions and are reopening sooner than countries that used aggressive containment and have more naive populations that rely predominantly on the rapid expansion of vaccination coverage 5253 countries that are reopening faster have paid the price in terms of a higher death toll in the earlier stages the containment strategy was arguably intended to provide time to develop covid 19 treatments and vaccines to strengthen health systems and for informed decision making but not to be a long term response 3654 as we cross the pandemic s two year mark a more sustainable approach that amalgamates acceptable levels of community transmission and high vaccination rates may be the best way for countries that have used aggressive containment to reach a new equilibrium 5556 implication of our analysis containing community transmission is the optimal strategy for new emerging infectious hazards and achievable in the absence of vaccines our findings further bolster recent research in favour of more stringent responses and extends those findings by including a diverse geographic sociocultural and economic sample of countries to analyse response strategies 273036 the lessons drawn from eight countries are useful to guide the development of a comprehensive response to covid 19 and future pandemics although the development of vaccines has raised the hope of returning to normal life relying solely on vaccines to control the pandemic is uncertain given the inequitable global vaccination rollout implementing the aggressive containment strategy which uses public health interventions built on trust and community engagement coupled with strong political will health system preparedness and receptiveness to scientific inputs will reduce the impact on lives and livelihoods particularly at the earlier stages of the pandemic as more countries including those successful in containment transition to covid 19 endemicity continuing investments and efforts are needed to reduce inequalities enhance health system capacities and strengthen public health preparedness in the event of potential emergent strains and waning vaccine immunities key messages aggressive containment of community transmission is the optimal strategy in emerging pandemics to save lives and protect the economy and achievable in the absence of vaccines and treatments successful containment requires countries to take immediate action in response to emerging outbreaks and clearly define the targets for relaxing interventions a comprehensive package of public health interventions needs to be implemented stringently with support measures for mitigating the adverse effects and increasing capacity success is underpinned by trust and community engagement and facilitated by strong political commitment well prepared public health systems and scientific input into policy making aggressive containment might not be sustainable in the long term a more sustainable approach which amalgamates acceptable levels of community transmission and high vaccination rates may be the best way forward footnotes provenance and peer review commissioned externally
