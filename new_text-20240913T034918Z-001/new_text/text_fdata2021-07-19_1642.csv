bezos and his passengers bezos on board bezos created blue origin in 2000 a move that he said prompted his high school girlfriend to observe jeff started amazon just to get enough money to do blue origin and i can t prove her wrong he has said he finances the rocket company by selling 1 billion in amazon stock a year bezos caught the space bug at age 5 while watching neil armstrong and buzz aldrin s moon landing on july 20 1969 he chose the 52nd anniversary for his own launch enamored by space history bezos named his new shepard rocket after alan shepard the first american in space and his bigger still in development new glenn rocket after john glenn the first american in orbit the 57 year old bezos who also owns the washington post stepped down as amazon s ceo earlier this month and last week donated 200 million to the smithsonian institution to renovate its national air and space museum and launch an education center to see the earth from space it changes you it changes your

60 foot 18 meter new shepard rocket will accelerate toward space at three times the speed of sound or mach 3 before separating from the capsule and returning for an upright landing the passengers will experience three to four minutes of weightlessness before their capsule parachutes onto the desert just 10 minutes after liftoff that s five minutes less than alan shepard s 1961 mercury flight blue

landing on the first trip all the demos were successful one rocket ended up flying seven times and another five the capsules also were recycled blue origin deliberately aborted a couple flights after liftoff to test the emergency escape system on the capsule the pace seemed slow compared with the competition and many wondered why blue origin its motto gradatim ferociter or step by step ferociously was taking so long to launch people based in kent washington the company kept fairly mum on its launch plans bezos finally announced it s time following the last test flight in april a dress rehearsal that saw mock passengers briefly climb aboard before liftoff the rocket and capsule that will be used tuesday have flown twice before what s next blue origin is expected to open ticket sales soon after bezos flies and has already lined up some of the other auction bidders the company hasn t disclosed the cost of a ride the fourth seat on the upcoming flight was auctioned off for 28 million nineteen space advocacy and education groups are getting 1 million each as a result with the rest to be used by blue origin s club for the future for its own education effort while the diminutive new shepard is meant to launch people on brief flights to the edge of space the mega new glenn will be capable of hauling cargo and eventually crew into orbit from cape canaveral florida possibly beginning late next year blue origin also has its eyes on the moon its proposed lunar lander blue moon lost to spacex s starship in nasa s recent commercial competition to develop the technology for

an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military grade malware from israel based nso group the world s most infamous hacker for hire outfit is being used to spy on journalists human rights activists and political dissidents from a list of more than 50 000 cellphone numbers obtained by the paris based journalism nonprofit forbidden stories and the human rights group amnesty international and shared with 16 news organizations journalists were able to identify more than 1 000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by nso clients for potential surveillance they include 189 journalists more than 600 politicians and government officials at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists and several heads of

that the data on which the report was based was leaked from its servers since such data never existed on any of our servers it called the forbidden stories report full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories the company reiterated its claim that it only sells to governments for use against terrorists and major criminals critics call those claims dishonest and say repeated abuse of pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry the source of the leak and how it was authenticated was not disclosed while a phone number s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device the consortium said it believed the data represented potential targets of nso s government clients the post said it identified

in targeted surveillance chiefly in the middle east and mexico saudi arabia is reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan

resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying ap s director of media relations lauren easton said the company is deeply troubled to learn that two ap journalists along with journalists from many news organizations are among those who may have been targeted by pegasus spyware she said the ap has taken steps to ensure the security of its journalists devices and is investigating the consortium s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers primarily from the university of toronto based watchdog citizen lab nso targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of al jazeera journalists and executives new york times beirut bureau chief ben hubbard moroccan journalist and activist omar radi and prominent mexican anti corruption reporter carmen aristegui her phone number was on the list the post reported among more than two dozen previously documented mexican targets

what is the truth about the money printing story in sri lanka is it the art of discourse in politics by edward theophilus money printing has become a folk story of opposition politicians in sri lanka where the story has been popular political rhetoric since the 1970s and many people and news media in the country use this discourse without a clear understanding of the process of money printing is it a process like political leaflets printing in local print shops when listening to political speeches of the opposition the public gets an impression that money printing is like death notice printing for funerals why this point has been reiterated on the political platforms no other reason to show the economic truth of printed money which is tangible assets that deteriorate the value of money when more money is available in the market whilst the supply of goods and services is in a shortage or deteriorating many negative economic outcomes could be seen in the country when more money is in the hands of people prices of goods and services would be skyrocketed this environment would create hyperinflation the prices of demand and supply will go up unless the production process has an increasing trend proportionately to the increase in money supply inflation will achieve a rising trend therefore it needs to maintain economic stability than printing money production of paper money it is observed that when politicians are in the opposition the rhetoric of money printing uses either to popular on political platforms or attracting clapping of people to the discourse money printing is an economic issue in every country and many countries have not used this as a political issue developed countries such as the usa print money but the political power of such countries money printing has not become an issue the purchasing power of the us dollar has radically declined during the last several decades the major reason for such a situation is they attempt to control the negative effects of money printing with a genuine attempt to maintain the value of money negative effects on money printing peaked when mr r premadasa was president and international monetary fund imposed controls against money printing however the weak policy has been continuing in the country as the economic policies used did not support building a production economy the open economic policy adopted in that period sanctioned imports when shortage incurred in consumer goods with the support of borrowed money people used to the policy and if there is no borrowed or earned money printing has been the popular policy of the government the technique was to issue bonds when investors have not bought bonds the central bank invested with printed money this has been the popular show of the monetary policy of sri lanka money printing is theoretically based on several factors they are the volume of exports the volume of foreign reserves inward foreign investment inward remittances increasing population and many other factors as a member of the imf sri lanka cannot print money though it wants imf monitors the monetary policy of all countries and sri lanka cannot overrule the imf neither the opposition nor the public in sri lanka knows about this process and they shout like parrots the most popular government policy is to present deficit budgets and supplement estimates besides the budget for expenditure the covering of the budget gap is done printed money by the central bank as the investors of government bonds are much less than expected the truth of the money printing story in the country is this and people are not explained by the government and money printing rhetoric is continuing however the discourse of money printing is bashful and the situation should explain people using simple examples as long as current economic policy is used without deviation by either government or the opposition the money printing story remains in the country and the option to get out of the problem is to begin a unity government without opposition and explain the public true economic situation of the country

die selbstgerechten the self righteous the latest book by sahra wagenknecht is a völkisch nationalist diatribe wagenknecht a leading member of the left party rages venomously against cosmopolitanism and cultural openness while promoting protectionism and a strong state she denounces migrants and refugees as wage depressors st rikebreakers and foreign cultural elements and seeks to drive a wedge between working people who have a university degree and those who do not there are paragraphs in the book that can also be found almost verbatim in texts of the far right afd and the nazis as we have demonstrated in the first part of this article economic nationalism in the sphere of economic policy wagenknecht also draws upon the nationalist ideology associated with the far right she advocates de globalisation protective tariffs and other protectionist measures to protect german companies from foreign competition and the return of value chains back into the country at the same time she wants to maintain the export orientation of the german economy an international leader with an export quota of almost 50 percent of gdp de globalisation would increase our prosperity and make our economy less vulnerable to crises she claims this is not about saying goodbye to international trade but about global value chains under conditions where 80 percent of this world trade today takes place within the manufacturing chain of large multinational corporations it is not free trade but protectionism that has made germany and the usa rich wagenknecht writes demanding we must change the rules in such a way that each country once again has greater leeway to shape its economic policy those who expose themselves without protection to imports that undermine their own standards are not open to the world but stupid protecting workers and domestic suppliers from cheap imports and hostile takeovers is in this sense a democratic duty a simple means of doing this she writes is protective tariffs we need to bring industrial value creation back to europe and overcome our dependency in key sectors such as the digital economy the more value created in the country the greater the prevailing prosperity the claim that tariff walls and other protectionist measures serve to protect the socially disadvantaged and economic prosperity is factually false and politically reactionary the absolute and active domination of the world economy over all national economies is a fundamental fact of modern life the globalisation of production combined with outstanding technological advances in it communications and transport has led to a historically unprecedented integration of the world economy and significantly increased the productivity of labour scientific progress modern technology and the global division of labour have created the conditions to solve all society s basic problems and enormously enrich the lives and culture of all humanity for this to happen however it is necessary to liberate the productive forces from the shackles of private property and the nation state upon which capitalism is based the subordination of all aspects of economic life to private profit interests leads to the paradoxical situation in which the increase in social wealth leads to an increase in poverty a handful of billionaires wallow in fabulous luxury while the vast majority can barely make ends meet or live in abject poverty the concentration of the economy under the control of finance capital and a handful of monopolies intensifies the global struggle of the imperialist powers for markets profits and raw materials to the point of open military conflict economic nationalism and trade war are intensifying worldwide all imperialist powers including germany are massively rearming spending billions on renewing nuclear arsenals preparations for war especially against china are well advanced only an international offensive of the working class the overthrow of capitalism and the reorganisation of the world economy on a socialist basis can overcome social inequality unleash the potential of modern productive forces for social progress and prevent a third world war the objective conditions for such a socialist offensive are developing rapidly the ranks of the international working class have grown enormously according to the ilo the global workforce has risen from 2 6 billion to 3 3 billion since the beginning of this century alone for the first time the vast majority of humanity lives in cities entire regions of the world that used to be predominantly agrarian have been integrated into the global production process wagenknecht s economic nationalism serves to divide the international working class and support the german bourgeoisie in trade war and war preparations against china the us and other rivals her attempt to lock up the global economy in the cage of the nation state is directed against the working class whose existence is bound up with modern productive forces once again wagenknecht draws on extreme right wing models mussolini and hitler had already blamed the world economy for the deep recession of the 1930s and pursued a nationalist economic policy leon trotsky wrote about this in 1933 attempts to save economic life by inoculating it with virus from the corpse of nationalism result in blood poisoning which bears the name of fascism instead of clearing away a suitably large arena for the operations of modern technology the rulers chop and slice the living organism of economy to pieces trotsky warned that fascist nationalism was preparing volcanic explosions and grandiose clashes in the world arena all our experiences on this score during the last 25 or 30 years will seem only an idyllic overture compared to the music of hell that is impending the confirmation of trotsky s warning took just six years in 1939 germany invaded poland and launched a war that meant as he predicted complete economic devastation and the destruction of an entire culture from stalinism to right wing nationalism sahra wagenknecht began her political career in the 1990s as a spokesperson for the so called communist platform of the party of democratic socialism pds the predecessor of the left party at that time she employed marxist vocabulary and made regular pilgrimages to rosa luxemburg s memorial while physically adopting her appearance at the age of 20 and shortly before the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 she had joined the stalinist socialist unity party sed the ruling party of former east germany the pds was founded in 1990 succeeding the stalinist sed the marxist phraseology of that period has disappeared in wagenknecht s latest book she even carefully avoids the terms socialism and socialist an electronic search does not yield a single hit instead she explicitly promotes capitalism a capitalism without globalisation a real meritocracy where competition works and private property and the pursuit of profit drive technological progress where property based on real performance makes life easier for entrepreneurs on the surface wagenknecht has made a 180 degree turn but this appearance is deceptive her development follows a political logic the communist platform was an amalgamation of former stalinists it did not defend the socialised property of the gdr and east germany s attendant social achievements but rather the stalinist sed dictatorship and its repression of the working class including the suppression of the june 17 1953 uprising and the building of the berlin wall stalinism developed in the soviet union in the 1920s stalin s dictatorship embodied the rule of a privileged bureaucracy that had grown disproportionately and usurped soviet power due to the isolation and economic backwardness of the first workers state basing its privileges on the socialised property created by the october revolution the bureaucracy felt compelled to adhere to the marxist phraseology of revolution but in fact transformed it into its opposite at the heart of the stalinist offensive against marxism was a vehement advocacy of nationalism and bitter hostility to world socialist revolution in 1924 the stalin faction promulgated the theory of building socialism in one country which was diametrically opposed to proletarian internationalism this became the starting point for a campaign against revolutionary marxists that culminated in the great terror of 1937 38 hundreds of thousands of those who had played a leading role in the october revolution in the initial years of the soviet republic and the communist international died in the course of the terror leon trotsky leader of the left opposition was murdered in exile in mexico in 1940 after the second world war stalin transferred the soviet union s forms of rule and ownership to eastern europe and the eastern part of germany in order to protect the soviet union against renewed imperialist attack with a chain of buffer states unlike the soviet union these states including the gdr were not the result of a proletarian revolution the expropriation of capital and large landholdings represented social progress but at the same time the sed regime suppressed any independent political movement of the working class although stalinism and fascism were based on completely different social foundations stalinism was a parasitic cancer on the workers state fascism embodied the dictatorship of finance capital there were similarities between the two both were terrified at the prospect of a revolutionary movement of the working class leon trotsky wrote in his book the revolution betrayed the crushing of soviet democracy by an all powerful bureaucracy and the extermination of bourgeois democracy by fascism were produced by one and the same cause the dilatoriness of the world proletariat in solving the problems set for it by history stalinism and fascism in spite of a deep difference in social foundations are symmetrical phenomena in many of their features they show a deadly similarity a victorious revolutionary movement in europe would immediately shake not only fascism but soviet bonapartism trotsky also predicted in the revolution betrayed that the bureaucracy would inevitably reintroduce capitalism if the working class failed to overthrow the bureaucracy in a political revolution his prognosis was confirmed in 1989 90 when the stalinist rulers in eastern europe the soviet union and china introduced private property looted state property and demolished all of the remaining social gains of the working class the sed pds also supported capitalist restoration in 1989 it considered the path to german unity inevitably necessary and undertook this task with determination as its last prime minister hans modrow wrote in his memoirs gregor gysi the long time chairman of the pds later expressed his pride in having led the east s elites including the middle functionary level into german unity in the course of capitalist restoration many former stalinists turned into open fascists in russia and many eastern european countries the transition between neo stalinist and fascist organisations remains fluid to this day in greece syriza the sister party of the left party had no problem forming a government alliance with the far right independent greeks in 2015 to impose the brutal austerity dictates of the troika in the face of fierce resistance by the working class wagenknecht is thus just one of the many stalinists turncoats who has ended up on the right corporatism and strong unions wagenknecht s right wing nationalism is part of a sharp turn to the right by the entire trade union and social democratic milieu since the 2000s she has aligned her politics with oskar lafontaine to whom she is currently married after a 40 year career in the spd lafontaine united a group of breakaway social democrats and trade union officials with the pds to form the left party for lafontaine the most important task of the spd had been to preserve social peace i e suppress the class struggle and ensure the stability of capitalist rule in 1999 he resigned as spd leader and federal finance minister because he believed that chancellor gerhard schröder s policies were undermining the spd s ability to keep the working class under control lafontaine s vision for the left party which he headed in its early years together with gregor gysi was to replace the spd as the main anchor of stability in capitalist society wagenknecht now began to sing the praises of the free market and meritocracy and extol the type of ordoliberal economic policies associated with the post war rule of chancellor konrad adenauer her book freiheit und kapitalismus freedom and capitalism was published in 2011 and reichtum ohne gier wealth without greed in 2016 both books feature many of the motifs to be found in her latest book for example in wealth without greed she writes we need what the neoliberals are so fond of writing on their banners but obliterate in reality freedom initiative competition performance based pay protection of self earned property in the self righteous wagenknecht cites the federal republic of the 1950s to the late 1970s as a role model she describes it as an equitable middle class society in which there are no longer stark social contrasts and everyone who makes an effort and follows rules is given the chance for social advancement and a life of solid prosperity in which values such as achievement diligence discipline order security stability and normality were shared by the working classes as well as by the traditional bourgeois and petty bourgeois classes in which society was regarded as a joint affair in which social cohesion public spirit and responsibility counted not just for oneself but also for others the basis of this capitalist land of milk and honey according to wagenknecht were powerful trade unions and a state that imposed rules and restrictions on the pursuit of profit she concludes capitalism works best in highly competitive industries where laws and strong trade unions ensure rising wages and high social and environmental standards all of this is a grotesque distortion of historical reality the post war era was marked by the cold war and a climate of social reaction the top echelons of german business circles politics government and universities were teeming with former nazis the social gains won at that time were the result of bitter class battles in germany itself and also internationally in 1956 57 for example metalworkers in the state of schleswig holstein achieved sick pay in a 16 week strike in france 10 million workers went on general strike in 1968 bringing bourgeois rule to the brink of collapse in 1969 spontaneous mass strikes in the german steel metal and textile industries put an end to the miserable wage settlements agreed by the union in the early 1970s extensive industrial action in the chemical metal printing and steel industries as well as in the public sector resulted in substantial wage increases six weeks annual leave and other significant concessions the unions were not the initiators of these struggles instead they worked closely with the employers and government within the framework of the german system of co determination and intervened to ensure that industrial struggles did not endanger capitalism if they nevertheless achieved significant social improvements it was only because companies could pay under conditions of post war economic recovery the situation changed after the first deep recession in the 1970s the trade unions reverted into open opponents of the working class deprived by the process of globalisation of the ability to negotiate compromises within a national framework they drew up and enforced the companies plans for layoffs and rationalisation under the banner of competitiveness and defending production sites today the unions are deeply integrated into the state and big business their functionaries and works council leaders earn many times that of an ordinary worker they move seamlessly from the union to the company boardroom and government posts and act as co managers and company cops almost without exception they support domestic and external rearmament not a few of the bureaucrats support the far right afd wagenknecht s call for strong trade unions aims to strengthen these reactionary corporatist apparatuses she praises the trade unions to the skies while blaming left liberals for all the negative consequences of globalisation she is silent on the role of the trade unions and their officials who have signed deals involving the shedding of millions of jobs agreed significant wage cuts and in their role as government ministers have overseen the reduction of unemployment benefits pensions and other social benefits with her advocacy of corporatist unions wagenknecht is not reinventing the wheel the tendency to cooperate with big business and the state has long characterised the trade unions especially in times of crisis and war they tend to merge with the state fascism took corporatism to its ultimate consequence transforming trade unions into direct organs of the state conclusion the political evolution of wagenknecht and the left party can only be understood against the background of objective social changes the class struggle and the tensions between the major imperialist powers have reached a degree of intensity that no longer permits half measures all political tendencies are forced to show their true colours capitalism is in its deepest international crisis since the end of world war ii the profit before life policy of the ruling classes in response to the coronavirus pandemic has claimed millions of lives and created widespread social misery with no end in sight at the same time the stock market and the fortunes of billionaires climb from one record to another explosive class struggles are looming worldwide which will inevitably assume an international and socialist direction the left party is reacting to this development with a sharp lurch to the right the idea that this party can contribute to socialism fomented by pseudo left currents in and around its ranks has always been a colossal fraud historically the left party is rooted in stalinism the most bitter opponent of socialism socially it relies on members of the middle class and bureaucratic apparatuses who fear that an uprising by workers would threaten their privileged positions and bank accounts politically the party is a staunch pillar of capitalist rule the greek sister party of the left party syriza already demonstrated where it stood in 2015 faced with the alternative of accepting the troika s austerity dictates or fighting against them syriza in power disregarded the very referendum it had organised and enforced unprecedented social cutbacks in the face of fierce resistance by workers the ruling class all over the world is responding to the global crisis of capitalism by turning to militarism and dictatorship staggering social inequality unceasing attacks on jobs and wages millions of avoidable coronavirus deaths and massive preparations for war are incompatible with democratic forms of rule in the us donald trump is transforming the republican party into a fascist movement while joe biden pleads for unity with the republicans in germany one reactionary police law follows the next right wing terrorist networks are spreading throughout the country s security forces and the afd an extreme right wing party sits in the bundestag where it is courted by the other parties wagenknecht s book makes clear that the left party is an integral part of this right wing front a socialist movement of the working class can only be built in opposition to the left party and its pseudo left hangers on the international committee of the fourth international to which the socialist equality party sgp is affiliated was founded in 1953 to defend the programme of world socialist revolution against all those who aligned themselves with stalinism social democracy and petty bourgeois nationalism today the icfi s political and theoretical struggle is gaining enormous importance under conditions where the working class is radicalising worldwide and its struggle is taking on international dimensions the left party and other pseudo left organisations are moving rapidly to the right as wagenknecht s book underlines anyone who seriously wants to fight for a socialist perspective must join the icfi and sgp and support the struggle to mobilise the international working class for the overthrow of capitalism and the

probe journalists activists among firm s spyware targets file in this july 3 2020 file photo hatice cengiz the fiancee of slain saudi journalist jamal khashoggi talks to members of the media in istanbul amnesty international reported that its forensic researchers had determined that nso group s flagship pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of cengiz just four days after khashoggi was killed ap photo emrah gurel file boston an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military grade malware from israel based nso group the world s most infamous hacker for hire outfit is being used to spy on journalists human rights activists and political dissidents from a list of more than 50 000 cellphone numbers obtained by the paris based journalism non profit forbidden stories and the human rights group amnesty international and shared with 16 news organizations journalists were able to identify more than 1 000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by nso clients for potential surveillance they include 189 journalists more than 600 politicians and government officials at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists and several heads of state according to the washington post a consortium member the journalists work for organizations including the associated press reuters cnn the wall street journal le monde and the financial times amnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that nso group s flagship pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of post journalist jamal khashoggi s fiancee hatice cengiz just four days after he was killed in the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 the company had previously been implicated in other spying on khashoggi nso group denied in an emailed response to ap questions that it has ever maintained a list of potential past or existing targets and said it has no visibility into its customers data in a separate statement it called the forbidden stories report full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories the company reiterated its claim that it only sells to vetted government agencies for use against terrorists and major criminals critics call those claims dishonest and say repeated abuse of pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry the source of the leak and how it was authenticated was not disclosed while a phone number s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device the consortium said it believed the data indicated potential targets of nso s government clients the post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list the guardian another consortium member reported that amnesty had found traces of pegasus infections on the cellphones of 15 journalist s who let their phones be examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data the most numbers on the list 15 000 were for mexican phones with a large share in the middle east nso group s spyware has been implicated in targeted surveillance chiefly in the middle east and mexico saudi arabia is reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan kazakhstan and pakistan the number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media it is about controlling public narrative resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying ap s director of media relations lauren easton said the company is deeply troubled to learn that two ap journalists along with journalists from many news organizations are on the list of the 1 000 potential targets for pegasus infection she said the ap was investigating to try to determine if its two staffers devices were compromised by the spyware the consortium s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers primarily from the university of toronto based watchdog citizen lab nso targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of al jazeera journalists and executives new york times beirut bureau chief ben hubbard moroccan journalist and activist omar radi and prominent mexican anti corruption reporter carmen aristegui her phone number was on the list the post reported among more than two dozen previously documented mexican targets are proponents of a soda tax opposition politicians human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist in the middle east the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents allegedly targeted by the saudi and united arab emirates governments the consortium s pegasus project reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments including india and mexico have used nso group s pegasus spyware for political ends its members who include le monde and sueddeutsche zeitung of germany are promising a series of stories based on the leak pegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone s microphones and cameras in the case of journalists that lets hackers spy on reporters communications with sources the program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity nso group s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction the so called zero click option in 2019 whatsapp and its parent company facebook sued nso group in u s federal court in san francisco accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target with missed calls alone some 1 400 users nso group denies the accusations the israeli company was sued the previous year in israel and cyprus both countries from which it exports products the plaintiffs include al jazeera journalists as well as other qatari mexican and saudi journalists and activists who say the company s spyware was used to hack them several of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to abdullah al athbah editor of the qatari newspaper al arab and one of the alleged victims the material appears to show officials in the united arab emirates discussing whether to hack into the phones of senior figures in saudi arabia and qatar including members of the qatari royal family nso group does not disclose its clients and says it sells its technology to israeli approved governments to help them target terrorists and break up pedophile rings and sex and drug trafficking rings it says its spyware is neither designed nor licensed for use against human rights activists or journalists it says it has helped save thousands of lives in recent years it denies its technology was in any way associated with khashoggi s murder nso group also denies involvement in elaborate undercover operations uncovered by the ap in 2019 in which shadowy operatives targeted nso critics including a citizen lab researcher to try to discredit them last year an israeli court dismissed an amnesty international lawsuit seeking to strip nso of its export license citing insufficient evidence amnesty spokesman gil naveh said of the company they are the most dangerous cyber weapon that we know of and they re not being properly overseen nso group is far from the only merchant of commercial spyware but its behaviour has drawn the most attention and critics say that is with good reason last month it published its first transparency report in which it says it has rejected more than 300 million in sales opportunities as a result of its human rights review processes eva galperin director of cybersecurity at the electronic frontier foundation and a strident critic tweeted if this report was printed it would not be worth the paper it was printed on a new interactive online data platform created by the group forensic architecture with support from citizen lab and amnesty international catalogues nso group s activities by country and target the group partnered with filmmaker laura poitras best known for her 2014 documentary citzenfour about nsa whistleblower edward snowden who offers video narrations since 2019 the u k private equity firm

pascagoula miss business wire jul 18 2021 merchants marine bancorp inc otcqx mnmb the parent company of merchants marine bank reports net income through the first six months of 2021 of 1 44 million or 1 08 per share compared with net income of 3 50 million or 2 63 per share during the same period in 2020 it should be noted that during the same period in 2020 the company monetized a 3 1 million gain pretax by liquidating a portion of its securities portfolio which materially affected per share earnings data during that period the company has been in an investment cycle since the last quarter of 2020 when its subsidiary merchants marine bank acquired a branch in mobile alabama from a regional bank who was exiting the market in the same quarter merchants marine bank also established a loan and deposit production office in hattiesburg mississippi during the first half of 2021 the company entered the secondary market mortgage business through the formation of canvas mortgage a division of merchants marine bank with any large investment into new markets and business lines particularly those of a de novo nature like canvas mortgage and our new hattiesburg office there is a j curve effect on income we hit the bottom of that j curve in april 2021 i m very pleased to report that since then in may and june the company s core income net of non recurring items has returned to net profitability and is accelerating said casey hill the company s chief financial officer the timing of ppp forgiveness and the income associated with it could not have been a better fit with our expansion plans such that this non recurring revenue covered the trough in the return curve nearly perfectly the company s balance sheet grew significantly over the trailing twelve months by 89 43 million or 13 86 percent the company s cash position has increased over 80 percent during the same period to 260 31 million while the bank grew significantly it was almost entirely due to unanticipated federal stimulus this has left the company in an exceptionally liquid position but without the traditional avenues of investment due to the current yield curve and expectations on future changes in interest rates we do not want to make short term investment decisions to garner yield now that will handicap the bank in the future commented hill we currently have a large unrealized gain in our securities portfolio to invest at the bottom of the market would mean a likely evaporation of that gain our strategic plan in place since last year is to deliberately shrink the balance sheet by ridding the bank of higher cost municipal deposits all things held equal the elimination of these accounts should mean six figure increases in net income per month beginning in the 3 rd quarter of 2022 the bank s current liquidity position allows us to support this planned outflow of deposits as well as possible additional outflows as federal stimulus bloat begins to wane while also growing the loan portfolio while we could have never planned for the effects of covid 19 we are working diligently to position the bank such that it emerges from the economic effects of the pandemic in as strong a posture as possible continued hill this can also be seen in the marked improvement in asset quality indicators over the past two quarters a significant improvement in non performing assets is a testament to the hard work of our lending staff and risk function selected financial highlights as of june 30 2021 deposits increased year over year by 16 94 percent to 638 million from 545 million demand deposits made up the bulk of the growth increasing 27 03 percent to 466 million from 366 million with 34 million of this increase centered in higher cost contractual public funds deposits that will be exiting over the course of the coming year interest expense decreased during the first half of 2021 when compared with the same period last year by 28 61 percent a decrease to 493 thousand from 1 72 million this is due primarily to the adoption and implementation of a dynamic pricing strategy on time deposits time deposit balances have decreased 22 percent over the past 12 months even with the significant increase in overall deposit balances operating expenses saw a significant increase over the same period last year increasing to 11 52 million from 9 00 million an increase of 28 01 percent this occurred in part due to non recurring expenses associated with a rebranding effort and startup costs associated with the establishment of the new canvas mortgage division also contributing to the increase is heightened operational costs and personnel expenses related to new market expansions undertaken in the last year asset quality indicators improved substantially during the first six months of 2021 with past due but accruing loans decreasing to 0 54 percent of total loans at june 30th of this year from 1 67 percent at the end of 2020 nonaccrual loans also decreased to 2 39 percent of total loans from 2 62 percent at the end of 2020 the improvement in these ratios was achieved despite a more than 11 00 percent reduction in the overall loan portfolio during the first half of 2021 the majority of which is due to paydowns in ppp loans it should be noted that during the same period in 2020 the company monetized a 3 1 million gain pretax by liquidating a portion of its securities portfolio this materially affected per share earnings data during that period as reflected in the opening paragraph of this release i am very pleased with our second quarter results and i am especially proud of what produced them strong continued progress by our team in executing our strategic plans commented clayton legear the company s president chief executive officer the investments we have made and the plans we are executing are designed to put the bank in a position to chart its own course over the long term even in uncertain economic conditions like the ones in which we are operating today as we move into the second half of the year we look forward to continued improvement in core earnings more sustainable organic growth stronger credit quality and significantly enhanced operational capacity through the investments that have been made we consider these key to our future growth plans and scaling in an efficient and controlled manner merchants

boston an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military grade malware from israel based nso group the world s most infamous hacker for hire outfit is being used to spy on journalists human rights activists and political dissidents from a list of more than 50 000 cellphone numbers obtained by the paris based journalism non profit forbidden stories and the human rights group amnesty international and shared with 16 news organizations journalists were able to identify more than 1 000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by nso clients for potential surveillance they include 189 journalists more than 600 politicians and government officials at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists and several heads of state according to the washington post a consortium member the journalists work for organizations including the associated press reuters cnn the wall street journal le monde and the financial times amnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that nso group s flagship pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of post journalist jamal khashoggi s fiancee hatice cengiz just four days after he was killed in the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 the company had previously been implicated in other spying on khashoggi nso group denied in an emailed statement that the data on which the report was based was leaked from its servers since such data never existed on any of our servers it called the forbidden stories report full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories the company reiterated its claim that it only sells to governments for use against terrorists and major criminals critics call those claims dishonest and say repeated abuse of pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry the source of the leak and how it was authenticated was not disclosed while a phone number s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device the consortium said it believed the data represented potential targets of nso s government clients the post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list the guardian another consortium member reported that amnesty had found traces of pegasus infections on the cellphones of 15 journalist s who let their phones be examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data the most numbers on the list 15 000 were for mexican phones with a large share in the middle east nso group s spyware has been implicated in targeted surveillance chiefly in the middle east and mexico saudi arabia is reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan kazakhstan and pakistan the number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media it is about controlling public narrative resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying the consortium s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers primarily from the university of toronto based watchdog citizen lab nso targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of al jazeera journalists and executives new york times beirut bureau chief ben hubbard moroccan journalist and activist omar radi and prominent mexican anti corruption reporter carmen aristegui her phone number was on the list the post reported among more than two dozen previously documented mexican targets are proponents of a soda tax opposition politicians human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist in the middle east the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents allegedly targeted by the saudi and united arab emirates governments the consortium s pegasus project reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments including india and mexico have used nso group s pegasus spyware for political ends its members who include le monde and sueddeutsche zeitung of germany are promising a series of stories based on the leak pegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone s microphones and cameras in the case of journalists that lets hackers spy on reporters communications with sources the program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity nso group s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction the so called zero click option in 2019 whatsapp and its parent company facebook sued nso group in u s federal court in san francisco accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target with missed calls alone some 1 400 users nso group denies the accusations the israeli company was sued the previous year in israel and cyprus both countries from which it exports products the plaintiffs include al jazeera journalists as well as other qatari mexican and saudi journalists and activists who say the company s spyware was used to hack them several of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to abdullah al athbah editor of the qatari newspaper al arab and one of the alleged victims the material appears to show officials in the united arab emirates discussing whether to hack into the phones of senior figures in saudi arabia and qatar including members of the qatari royal family nso group does not disclose its clients and says it sells its technology to israeli approved governments to help them target terrorists and break up pedophile rings and sex and drug trafficking rings it says its spyware is neither designed nor licensed for use against human rights activists or journalists it says it has helped save thousands of lives in recent years it denies its technology was in any way associated with khashoggi s murder nso group also denies involvement in elaborate undercover operations uncovered by the ap in 2019 in which shadowy operatives targeted nso critics including a citizen lab researcher to try to discredit them last year an israeli court dismissed an amnesty international lawsuit seeking to strip nso of its export license citing insufficient evidence amnesty spokesman gil naveh said of the company they are the most dangerous cyber weapon that we know of and they re not being properly overseen nso group is far from the only merchant of commercial spyware but its behaviour has drawn the most attention and critics say that is with good reason last month it published its first transparency report in which it says it has rejected more than 300 million in sales opportunities as a result of its human rights review processes eva galperin director of cybersecurity at the electronic frontier foundation and a strident critic tweeted if this report was printed it would not be worth the paper it was printed on a new interactive online data platform created by the group forensic architecture with support from citizen lab and amnesty international catalogues nso group s activities by country and target the group partnered with filmmaker laura poitras best known for her 2014 documentary citzenfour about nsa whistleblower edward snowden who offers video narrations since 2019 the u k private equity firm novalpina capital has controlled a majority stake in nso group earlier this year

central banks throughout the world implemented an array of monetary policies to fight the covid 19 crisis in contrast to some advanced economies in response to negative shocks in the past emerging economy central banks tended to increase policy interest rates as sharp exchange rate depreciations and pass through pushed inflation higher 1 during the covid crisis however central banks in many emerging economies reduced policy interest rates to close to an effective lower bound see figure 1 they also provided substantial liquidity especially to banks and to governments aguilar and cantú 2020 nuguer and powell 2020 central banks and governments worked together with the common objective of supporting economies figure 1 policy interest rates in latin america and the caribbean source idb staff calculations based on central bank data note the figure does not incorporate the 25 basis point rise in the policy interest rate in mexico on 24 june or in chile on 14 july in this column we trace the main policies of central banks in latin america and the caribbean lac through the covid crisis our contribution is to detail employing a common framework how balance sheets expanded as a response to the crisis we argue some central banks went beyond accommodating the increased demand for liquidity inducing monetary injections that then returned through excess bank reserves and sterilisation liabilities for those central banks that fixed an interest rate and through sales of international reserves for those that favoured stable exchange rates we conclude by outlining selected risks confronting central banks for the months ahead 2 given the high level of economic uncertainty induced by the pandemic there was a substantial increase in the demand for liquidity in lac as in other regions figure 2 graphs the trajectory of monetary aggregates through the crisis households firms and banks sought to exchange illiquid assets e g long term investments for liquid ones e g cash and short term deposits to keep funds safe and to pay obligations through the crisis central bank actions more than accommodated this rush for liquidity apart from reducing policy interest rates virtually all central banks lowered the rates of required reserves on bank deposits central banks also found other ways to boost liquidity depending on their ability to conduct different operations under their respective charters the mechanisms varied across countries but many extended credit or repo s to banks and bought government securities on secondary markets most central banks in the region are restricted from otherwise lending to the private sector or financing fiscal authorities in turn banks increased credit to the non financial private sector in most countries and bought government bonds in some bonds as a percentage of total assets rose on bank balance sheets cavallo and powell 2021 figure 2 stock of m2 source idb staff calculations based on imf and central banks data notes the figures plot the estimated residuals in each country from the regression relative to the estimated error in february 2020 where bt is the linear trend and d_i are monthly dummies the sample period in each country starts in december 2008 these policy measures together with the greater demand for liquidity resulted in the expansion of the balance sheets of the central banks in the region table 1 ranks a group of countries by the maximum expansion of central bank balance sheets through the crisis in percentage points of 2019 gdp and computed as the cumulative variation in total assets which by definition is the same as that of liabilities plus net worth for brazil chile and peru the central bank balance sheet expansion was well in excess of 10 of gdp approaching that of some advanced economy central banks table 1 maximum cumulative variation in the balance sheets of central banks in 2020 2021 of 2019 gdp source idb staff calculations based on imf and central banks data in both chile and peru the central bank provided substantial liquidity to the domestic financial system in chile the central bank bought bonds issued by banks while banks bought government bonds and boosted credit to the non financial private sector backed by a substantial public sector guarantee scheme in peru the central bank extended repos to the banks and allowed guaranteed bank loans to firms to act as collateral this may have sharpened the incentives for banks to lend to firms with partial guarantees in the case of brazil an exchange rate depreciation resulted in an increase in the value of international reserves in local currency on the asset side and an increase in the net worth of the central bank new legislation allowed the central bank to pass some of that increase in net worth to the government which was then transferred to a deposit account of the government at the central bank as the government drew down its deposits for covid related spending the central bank issued sterilisation liabilities several central banks pushed these measures to the limit policy interest rates were lowered to an effective lower bound central banks injected liquidity through lowering required reserves on deposits and through asset purchases some to purchase foreign currency from external debt issuance 3 still in the end it is households firms and banks themselves that decide how much liquidity they are willing to hold in several countries policy interest rates acted as a floor system and the excess liquidity returned to the central bank resinek 2019 highly liquid banks started to increase their reserve holdings at the central bank and to purchase sterilisation liabilities as the old adage goes at the limit monetary policy becomes pushing on a piece of string a phrase often ascribed to both keynes and the federal reserve chair marriner eccles in the 1930s see also the continuing discussion regarding the efficacy of quantitative easing 4 looking forward there are several potential risks depending on the underlying scenarios for the health crisis and economic recovery one risk is that as demand recovers even as fiscal impulses are reigned in supply remains constrained and prices are pushed higher this has already happened in some countries led by rises in the price of food brazil is a case in point and the central bank has already reacted increasing the policy interest rate by 225 basis points since march 2021 and has signalled that further rate rises might be forthcoming one view is that such price rises should be temporary and while inflation may be pushed above the inflation target it should come back down without the need for central bank action however this presupposes inflation expectations will remain anchored to a fully credible target despite central bank inaction emerging economies may not be able to afford to take such risks mariscal et al 2016 find that if inflation runs above target then there may be a price to pay as expectations for latin american inflation targetters may become de anchored moreover given the calibration of a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium dsge model for latin american countries in cavallo and powell 2018 the growth impacts of a rise of policy rates may be relatively muted while the impact on inflation is relatively strong in other words the action tends to work and the costs may not be so great perhaps this risk of somewhat higher inflation as recovery takes hold with a normalisation of interest rates is a good problem to have still treasury central bank tensions may arise if the latter sees fit to tighten monetary policy raising the cost of short term domestic government debt perhaps of greater concern however is a scenario in which vaccine roll out is slow and the spread of new mutations prolongs the health crisis delaying recovery and requiring greater fiscal spending while at the same time there is a change in the patient stance regarding monetary policy in the us on the one hand this would create the need for greater fiscal financing but on the other hand may limit access or increase the cost of that financing in international markets especially for those countries where debt has risen more strongly and financing requirements have soared 5 while central banks and governments worked together closely to support economies during 2020 in this scenario tensions might arise there might be greater pressure to seek new ways to finance fiscal spending either by adopting more creative accounting under current legislation or even attempting to change central bank frameworks a persistent monetary financing of deficits could create the conditions for higher inflation which may be costly to bring back down the region s history amply demonstrates the risks see the various chapters in kehoe and nicolini 2021 central bank independence and the quality of balance sheets going forward are key to avoiding these inflationary risks a further potential risk relates to the stock of short term sterilisation liabilities on the balance sheets of central banks these are mostly in local currency and central banks appear to have ample buffers of international reserves to back the commitments but some governments are also faced with considerable debt service obligations coming due and central banks may need to resist sharp depreciations which would boost the value of buffers in dollars relative to these local currency obligations given inflation objectives and corporate debts in dollars the dual treasury and central bank roll over risks should therefore be closely monitored authors note the views are strictly those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of the inter american development bank or

middle east and mexico saudi arabia is reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan kazakhstan and pakistan the number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media it is about controlling public narrative resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying ap s director of media relations lauren easton said the company is deeply troubled to learn that two ap journalists along with journalists from many news organizations are on the list of the 1 000 potential targets for pegasus infection she said the ap was investigating to try to determine if its two staffers devices were compromised by the spyware the consortium s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers primarily from the university of toronto based watchdog citizen lab nso targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of al jazeera journalists and executives new york times beirut bureau chief ben hubbard moroccan journalist and activist omar radi and prominent mexican anti corruption reporter carmen aristegui her phone number was on the list the post reported the times said hubbard and its former mexico city bureau chief azam ahmed were on the list two hungarian investigative journalists andras szabo and szabolcs panyi were among journalists on the list whose phones were successfully infected with pegasus the guardian reported among more than two dozen previously documented mexican targets are proponents of a soda tax opposition politicians human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist in the middle east the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents allegedly targeted by the saudi and united arab emirates governments the consortium s pegasus project reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments including india and mexico have used nso group s pegasus spyware for political ends its members who include le monde and sueddeutsche zeitung of germany are promising a series of stories based on the leak pegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone s microphones and cameras in the case of journalists that lets hackers spy on reporters communications with sources the program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity nso group s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction the so called zero click option in 2019 whatsapp and its parent company facebook sued nso group in u s federal court in san francisco accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target with missed calls alone some 1 400 users nso group denies the accusations the israeli company was sued the previous year in israel and cyprus both countries from which it exports products the plaintiffs include al jazeera journalists as well as other qatari mexican and saudi journalists and activists who say the company s spyware was used to hack them several of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to abdullah al athbah editor of the qatari newspaper al arab and one of the alleged victims the material appears to show officials in the united arab emirates discussing whether to hack into the phones of senior figures in saudi arabia and qatar including members of the qatari royal family nso group does not disclose its clients and says it sells its technology to israeli approved governments to help them target terrorists and break up pedophile rings and sex and drug trafficking rings it says its spyware is neither designed nor licensed for use against human rights activists or journalists it says it has helped save thousands of lives in recent years it denies its technology was in any way associated with khashoggi s murder nso group also denies involvement in elaborate undercover operations uncovered by the ap in 2019 in which shadowy operatives targeted nso critics including a citizen lab researcher to try to discredit them last year an israeli court dismissed an amnesty international lawsuit seeking to strip nso of its export license citing insufficient evidence nso group is far from the only merchant of commercial spyware but its behavior has drawn the most attention and critics say that is with good reason last month it published its first transparency report in which it says it has rejected more than 300 million in sales opportunities as a result of its human rights review processes eva galperin director of cybersecurity at the electronic frontier foundation and a strident critic tweeted if this report was printed it would not be worth the paper it was printed on a new interactive online data platform created by the group forensic architecture with support from citizen lab and amnesty international catalogs nso group s activities by country and target the group partnered with filmmaker laura poitras best known for her 2014 documentary citzenfour about nsa whistleblower edward snowden who offers video narrations stop what you re doing and read this snowden tweeted sunday referencing the consortium s findings this leak is going to be the story of the year since 2019 the u k private equity firm novalpina capital has controlled a majority stake in nso group earlier this year israeli media reported the company was considering an initial public offering most likely on the tel aviv stock exchange

just bezos his brother an 82 year old aviation pioneer and a teenage tourist the capsule is entirely automated unlike richard branson s virgin galactic rocket plane that required two pilots to get him to space and back a week ago branson s advice just sit back relax look out of the window just absorb the view outside he said on cbs the late show with stephen colbert differences in quirks and rockets aside the billionaire rivals are gearing up to launch just about anybody willing to shell out hundreds of thousands of dollars for a brief up and down space hop a brief look at what awaits bezos and his passengers bezos on board bezos created blue origin in 2000 a move that he said prompted his high school girlfriend to observe jeff started amazon just to get enough money to do blue origin and i can t prove her wrong he has said he finances the rocket company by selling 1 billion in amazon stock a year bezos caught the space bug at age 5 while watching neil armstrong and buzz aldrin s moon landing on july 20 1969 he chose the 52nd anniversary for his own launch enamored by space history bezos named his new shepard rocket after alan shepard the first american in space and his bigger still in development new glenn rocket after john glenn the first american in orbit the 57 year old bezos who also owns the washington post stepped down as amazon s ceo earlier this month and last week donated 200 million to the smithsonian institution to renovate its national air and space museum and launch an education center to see the earth from space it changes you it changes your relationship with this planet with humanity he said it s a thing i ve wanted to do all my life who else is flying bezos personally invited two of his fellow passengers his 50 year old brother mark an investor and volunteer firefighter and female aviation pioneer wally funk joining them will be oliver daemen a last minute fill in for the winner of a 28 million charity auction who had a scheduling conflict at age 82 funk will become the oldest person in space she was among 13 female pilots the so called mercury 13 who took the same tests in the early 1960s as nasa s mercury 7 astronauts but were barred because of their gender finally funk exclaimed when offered a seat alongside bezos as for the dutch daemen who at 18 will become the youngest person in space his financier father bid on the capsule seat in june but dropped out when the price soared blue origin came calling just over a week ago after the unidentified auction winner switched to a later flight the teenage space fanatic who starts college this fall is blue origin s first paying customer no word on what his ticket cost rocket and capsule while bezos won t be the first boss to ride to space on his own rocket he can lay claim to strapping in for his company s first human launch he s also aiming higher with an anticipated altitude of about 66 miles 106 kilometers versus branson s 53 5 miles 86 kilometers blue origin s 60 foot 18 meter new shepard rocket will accelerate toward space at three times the speed of sound or mach 3 before separating from the capsule and returning for an upright landing the passengers will

landing on the first trip all the demos were successful one rocket ended up flying seven times and another five the capsules also were recycled blue origin deliberately aborted a couple flights after liftoff to test the emergency escape system on the capsule the pace seemed slow compared with the competition and many wondered why blue origin its motto gradatim ferociter or step by step ferociously was taking so long to launch people based in kent washington the company kept fairly mum on its launch plans bezos finally announced it s time following the last test flight in april a dress rehearsal that saw mock passengers briefly climb aboard before liftoff the rocket and capsule that will be used tuesday have flown twice before what s next blue origin is expected to open ticket sales soon after bezos flies and has already lined up some of the other auction bidders the company hasn t disclosed the cost of a ride the fourth seat on the upcoming flight was auctioned off for 28 million nineteen space advocacy and education groups are getting 1 million each as a result with the rest to be used by blue origin s club for the future for its own education effort while the diminutive new

by david shepardson washington reuters a u s appeals court late saturday in a 2 1 ruling put on hold a lower court decision that said the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc could not enforce its coronavirus cruise ship rules in the state last month u s district judge steven merryday in siding with republican led florida found the state was highly likely to show the cdc exceeded its authority in adopting rules governing the resumption of cruise ship sailing the brief order from the 11th circuit panel came about 10 minutes before merryday s ruling was to take effect on sunday which would have made the cdc rules a non binding recommendation rather than mandatory the cdc in may began approving some cruise operations after lengthy talks with the industry about health and safety protocols its conditional sail order said cruise lines that ensured at least 95 of passengers and nearly all crew were vaccinated could bypass simulated voyages and move more quickly to resuming commercial trips the justice department said last week in a filing with the appeals court that there is no basis to lift the covid 19 health and safety protocols that were developed by cdc in collaboration with the cruise ship industry the cdc declined to comment sunday the offices of florida governor ron desantis and state attorney general ashley moody did not immediately comment on sunday desantis had argued the cdc rules disregarded the freedom of floridians to make decisions for their families florida a major hub for cruise operators said in april its ports had suffered a decline in operating revenue of almost 300 million since the pandemic started on tuesday norwegian cruise line nyse holdings sued the state of florida saying a state law was preventing it from safely and soundly resuming passenger cruise operations from miami starting august 15 a judge has set an aug 6 preliminary injunction hearing florida state law expressly prohibits cruise lines from requiring documentation of covid 19 vaccines
bumpy road the road is long because europe currently lacks the instruments needed to see the journey through us president joe biden has found his mission to secure the west by strengthening its liberal democracies against authoritarian temptations both foreign and domestic having witnessed both an attempted coup and steeply rising socioeconomic inequalities in his own country biden knows that democracies will not find support abroad until they have fulfilled their promises of fairness justice and security at home if europe wants to be a partner in this democratic revival it can start by recognising the realism behind the us administration s rhetoric biden is not pining for some mythical lost era of american greatness as his predecessor did he is focusing on the future and he is concerned with questions that animate democratic liberals and conservatives alike for example how do we create opportunities for those left behind by global capitalism so that they will not fall prey to populists false promises how do we restore other developed democratic countries commitment to democratic values how do we rein in overpowered financial and tech industries or forge a more dynamic global order the idea of the west was always meant to be universal offering a normative framework for peaceful prosperous coexistence among all people human rights freedom of expression democratic self determination and the rule of law are not exclusive to any region or group of countries but if you are a chinese leader you will ask why your country should follow the west especially now that most chinese regard the western designed international order as hostile to their own aspirations from this perspective the european american era is over signs of western decadence are ubiquitous from the iraq war debacle and the trump presidency to the united kingdom s exit from the european union while americans and europeans argue for the importance of individual human rights the self confident chinese rebuttal is that there are also social human rights to education nutrition adequate housing and so forth here china has undeniably achieved great things lifting more than 800 million people out of abject poverty over the past four decades the lines then have been drawn for europe to make a meaningful contribution to biden s mission it must become stronger and because its common foreign and security policy tends to evolve only very slowly europe must also continue to press ahead with the expansion of the single market which will remain europe s main attraction and source of strength but the single market can retain its attractiveness only if it allows for greater dynamism to become a technological leader with less dependence on china and the united states europe must invest more in research and development r d digitalisation and artificial intelligence it should be pursuing a joint climate policy with the us and while the g7 recently agreed on a build back better world partnership to compete with china s belt and road initiative in central asia africa and latin america the eu must do more to support this program while also bolstering nato s deterrent power with federal elections coming in september germany the eu s biggest economy should be debating how it intends to strengthen the bloc in the coming years yet all the main german parties and politicians have been silent on this issue presumably because they are still waiting to see how the pandemic will evolve many fear that richer northern member states will regain their economic strength quickly while others namely italy and france fall further behind the eu s 750bn recovery fund will not be enough to achieve anything close to a convergence between southern and northern member states indeed it will not even be enough to prevent them from drifting further apart since the eu s poorer member states are already over indebted they cannot borrow much more particularly if interest rates rise whenever inflation begins to increase again the european central bank s implicit policy of monetising member state debt through the unlimited purchase of government bonds from poorer countries will have to end under these conditions the only remaining way out would be a transfer union with richer countries like germany increasing their own financial investments in poorer member states greater investments in infrastructure digitalisation and r d are needed not only to boost efficiency and productivity in the economically weaker member states but also to hold the eurozone and the eu together the road is long however and longer still because europe currently lacks the instruments needed to see the journey through from the perspective of german fiscal policy investing in a more economically and socially stable europe would offer enormous returns yes the prevailing view in germany is that the country already puts more into europe than it gets out but that is nonsense as an export champion with a massive persistent trade surplus germany by definition receives more than it pays out instead of creating the impression that germany is dependent on the chinese export market german leaders should make clear that the country s real dependence is on the european market germany s exports to other eu member states account for over 50 of its total exports whereas china and the us each account for only about 10 in the long run germany will do only as well as its european neighbours the sooner we recognise that the better off we will be biden s credo about fixing things at home applies to us too we must show that our own democratically constituted societies are better than the autocratic alternatives otherwise the normative idea of the west will continue to lose its lustre

taste of the nation brings relief to local families by rebecca cook it certainly isn t news that in this land of the bmw and 100 nikes many people go hungry last year over 21 million people including eight million children sought relief through emergency food assistance programs many of these folks were working at minimum wage jobs or already receiving food stamps which somehow never seemed to stretch far enough tucson s community food bank works diligently to fill the needs of local families but a rising demand for services coupled with a dwindling shelf stock are worrisome especially now that our more charitable holiday seasons are behind us this year however the food bank will receive a substantial shot in the arm from community members who deal with hunger from the other end of the socioeconomic spectrum on may 3 several local restaurants and resorts will join forces to present the first annual taste of the nation fundraiser an evening of fabulous food wine and soulful music the

the winter holiday season traditionally begin to wane this time a year a season of particularly great need due to children being out of school and home for all meals for many low income families this creates a financial burden they wouldn t be able to overcome without the assistance of a few emergency food boxes one arizona food bank association along with the community food bank recently commissioned a state and local study from an independent research firm to help identify the people who were using their services the research produced a profile very different from the one many expected among the findings twenty eight percent of food bank clients in tucson were employed thirty two percent of tucson clients were receiving food stamps but most indicated the aid wasn t enough to get them through an entire month forty one percent of food bank recipients in tucson told researchers they had to choose between food and medical care within the past year most had no health insurance no doubt about it tucson is straining to meet local hunger needs forty five bucks can make a tremendous difference in this struggle and you re guaranteed a good time in the bargain taste of

an exploratory analysis in patients on dexamethasone as part of their standard of care with 90 day mortality being reduced by 77 compared to controls under 65 who received dexamethasone 14 vs 48 hr 0

function as assessed by ards severity and overall clinical improvement on a 7 point ordinal scale despite a treatment related improvement in respiratory function at day 7 there was no mortality reduction in the 97 treated patients over age 65 suggesting the need for more prolonged or higher dosing of anti inflammatory therapy in these patients who may have a more exuberant inflammatory response associated with defective immune mediated viral clearance mechanisms recently published guidance to industry by the u s food and drug administration fda 3 has recommended demonstration of mortality benefit for at least 60 days in critically ill patients mesoblast will be meeting shortly with the fda to discuss the durable mortality reduction seen in patients under 65 years old who received remestemcel l in this randomized controlled trial and the regulatory pathway for remestemcel l in this patient population mesoblast entered into a license and collaboration agreement with novartis for the development manufacture and commercialization of remestemcel l with an initial focus on the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards including that associated with covid 19 the agreement remains subject to certain closing conditions including time to analyze the results from this covid 19 ards trial about the trial of remestemcel l in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards due to covid 19 the trial enrolled 222 mechanically ventilated covid 19 patients with moderate severe ards across the us of whom 217 were randomized 1 1 and received either standard of care alone or standard of care plus 2 intravenous infusions of remestemcel l at a dose of 2 million cells kg 3 5 days apart this was the same remestemcel l dosing regimen used in the earlier compassionate use program where 11 of 12 patients were younger than 65 and 75 successfully came off ventilatory support the trial was halted in december 2020 after the data safety monitoring board dsmb performed a third interim analysis on the trial s first 180 patients noting that the trial was not likely to meet the 30 day mortality reduction endpoint at the planned 300 patient enrolment the trial was powered to achieve a primary endpoint of 43 reduction in mortality at 30 days for treatment with remestemcel l on top of maximal care the dsmb recommended that the trial complete with the enrolled 222 patients and that all be followed up as planned at follow up through day 60 remestemcel l showed a positive but non significant trend in overall mortality reduction across the entire population of treated patients n 217 in the pre specified population of patients under age 65 n 123 remestemcel l reduced mortality through day 60 by 46 but not in patients 65 or older n 94 in an exploratory analysis through day 60 remestemcel l reduced mortality by 75 and increased days alive off mechanical ventilation in patients under age 65 when combined with dexamethasone in comparison

the company has been in an investment cycle since the last quarter of 2020 when its subsidiary merchants marine bank acquired a branch in mobile alabama from a regional bank who was exiting the market in the same quarter merchants marine bank also established a loan and deposit production office in hattiesburg mississippi during the first half of 2021 the company entered the secondary market mortgage business through the formation of canvas mortgage a division of merchants marine bank with any large investment into new markets and business lines particularly those of a de novo nature like canvas mortgage and our new hattiesburg office there is a j curve effect on income we hit the bottom of that j curve in april 2021 i m very pleased to report that since then in may and june the company s core income net of non recurring items has returned to net profitability and is accelerating said casey hill the company s chief financial officer the timing of ppp forgiveness and the income associated with it could not have been a better fit with our expansion plans such that this non recurring revenue covered the trough in the return curve nearly perfectly merchants marine bancorp inc otcqx mnmb the parent company of merchants marine bank reports net income through the first six months of 2021 of 1 44 million or 1 08 per share compared with net income of 3 50 million or 2 63 per share during the same period in 2020 it should be noted that during the same period in 2020 the company monetized a 3 1 million gain pretax by liquidating a portion of its securities portfolio which materially affected per share earnings data during that period the company s balance sheet grew significantly over the trailing twelve months by 89 43 million or 13 86 percent the company s cash position has increased over 80 percent during the same period to 260 31 million while the bank grew significantly it was almost entirely due to unanticipated federal stimulus this has left the company in an exceptionally liquid position but without the traditional avenues of investment due to the current yield curve and expectations on future changes in interest rates we do not want to make short term investment decisions to garner yield now that will handicap the bank in the future commented hill we currently have a large unrealized gain in our securities portfolio to invest at the bottom of the market would mean a likely evaporation of that gain our strategic plan in place since last year is to deliberately shrink the balance sheet by ridding the bank of higher cost municipal deposits all things held equal the elimination of these accounts should mean six figure increases in net income per month beginning in the 3rd quarter of 2022 the bank s current liquidity position allows us to support this planned outflow of deposits as well as possible additional outflows as federal stimulus bloat begins to wane while also growing the loan portfolio while we could have never planned for the effects of covid 19 we are working diligently to position the bank such that it emerges from the economic effects of the pandemic in as strong a posture as possible continued hill this can also be seen in the marked improvement in asset quality indicators over the past two quarters a significant improvement in non performing assets is a testament to the hard work of our lending staff and risk function selected financial highlights as of june 30 2021 deposits increased year over year by 16 94 percent to 638 million from 545 million demand deposits made up the bulk of the growth increasing 27 03 percent to 466 million from 366 million with 34 million of this increase centered in higher cost contractual public funds deposits that will be exiting over the course of the coming year interest expense decreased during the first half of 2021 when compared with the same period last year by 28 61 percent a decrease to 493 thousand from 1 72 million this is due primarily to the adoption and implementation of a dynamic pricing strategy on time deposits time deposit balances have decreased 22 percent over the past 12 months even with the significant increase in overall deposit balances operating expenses saw a significant increase over the same period last year increasing to 11 52 million from 9 00 million an increase of 28 01 percent this occurred in part due to non recurring expenses associated with a rebranding effort and startup costs associated with the establishment of the new canvas mortgage division also contributing to the increase is heightened operational costs and personnel expenses related to new market expansions undertaken in the last year asset quality indicators improved substantially during the first six months of 2021 with past due but accruing loans decreasing to 0 54 percent of total loans at june 30th of this year from 1 67 percent at the end of 2020 nonaccrual loans also decreased to 2 39 percent of total loans from 2 62 percent at the end of 2020 the improvement in these ratios was achieved despite a more than 11 00 percent reduction in the overall loan portfolio during the first half of 2021 the majority of which is due to paydowns in ppp loans it should be noted that during the same period in 2020 the company monetized a 3 1 million gain pretax by liquidating a portion of its securities portfolio this materially affected per share earnings data during that period as reflected in the opening paragraph of this release i am very pleased with our second quarter results and i am

an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military grade malware from israel based nso group the world s most infamous hacker for hire outfit is being used to spy on journalists human rights activists and political dissidents from a list of more than 50 000 cellphone numbers obtained by the paris based journalism nonprofit forbidden stories and the human rights group amnesty international and shared with 16 news organizations journalists were able to identify more than 1 000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by nso clients for potential surveillance they include 189 journalists more than 600 politicians and government officials at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists and several heads of state according to the washington post a consortium member the journalists work for organizations including the associated press reuters cnn the wall street journal le monde and the financial times amnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that nso group s flagship pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of post journalist jamal khashoggi s fiancee hatice

maintained a list of potential past or existing targets in a separate statement it called the forbidden stories report full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories the company reiterated its claims that it only sells to vetted government agencies for use against terrorists and major criminals and that it has no visibility into its customers data critics call those claims dishonest and have provided evidence that nso directly manages the high tech spying they say the repeated abuse of pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry the source of the leak and how it was authenticated was not disclosed while a phone number s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device the consortium said it believed the data indicated potential targets of nso s government clients the post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list the guardian another consortium member

reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan kazakhstan and pakistan the number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media it is about controlling public narrative resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying in one casehighlighted by the guardian mexican reporter cecilio pineda birto was assassinated in 2017 a few weeks after his cell phone number appeared on the leaked list ap s director of media relations lauren easton said the company is deeply troubled to learn that two ap journalists along with journalists from many news organizations are on the list of the 1

hong kong bloomberg for two decades chinese tech firms have flocked to the us stock market drawn by a friendly regulatory environment and a vast pool of capital eager to invest in one of the world s fastest growing economies now the juggernaut behind hundreds of companies worth us 2 trillion s 2 72 trillion appears stopped in its tracks beijing s july 10 announcement that almost all businesses trying to go public in another country will require approval from a newly empowered cyber security regulator amounts to a death knell for chinese initial public offerings in the united states according to long time industry watchers it s unlikely there will be any us listed chinese companies in five to 10 years other than perhaps a few big ones with secondary listings said professor paul gillis from peking university s guanghua school of management in beijing the clampdown triggered by didi global s decision to push ahead with a new york listing despite objections from regulators is already sending shockwaves through markets a gauge of us traded chinese stocks has dropped almost 30 per cent from its recent high for investors in companies that have yet to list there is growing uncertainty over when they may get their money back wall street firms are bracing themselves for lucrative underwriting fees to dry up while hong kong is set to benefit as chinese companies look for alternative and politically safer venues closer to home it s hard to overstate the importance us markets have held for chinese firms the first wave began selling american depositary receipts surrogate securities that allow investors to hold overseas shares in 1999 since then more than 400 chinese companies picked us exchanges for their primary listings raising more than us 100 billion including most of the country s technology industry their stocks later benefited from one of the longest bull markets in history hong kong based website operator china com corp began the trend when it went public on the nasdaq in 1999 during the dotcom bubble the stock under the symbol china surged 236 per cent on its debut enriching founders and backers and showing chinese internet firms a pathway to foreign capital if they could only find a way around the communist party s strict regulatory controls unlike companies in hong kong whose laissez faire approach to business meant there were few rules on company fund raising mainland based private enterprises faced much higher hurdles foreign ownership in many industries especially in the sensitive internet industry was restricted while an overseas listing required approval from china s state council or cabinet to get around these obstacles a compromise was found in the shape of a variable interest entity vie a complex corporate structure used by most adrs including didi and alibaba group holding under a vie which was pioneered by now private sina corp in 2000 chinese companies are turned into foreign firms with shares that overseas investors can buy legally shaky hard to understand this solution nonetheless proved acceptable to us investors wall street and the communist party alike

tommy williams this week i was once again questioned about volatility are we at the top how far can this thing go etc etc i m not one who excels at calling tops or bottoms for that matter so i reached out to my friends at nuveen investments for their take on the subject saira malik chief investment officer of nuveen equities offered her perspective here is a brief summary the covid 19 pandemic remains the driving force of volatility especially as we see how vaccines and variants play out i continue to refer to it as public enemy number 1 but am painfully clear that many don t agree with me that s part of what makes america great i think the ability to agree to disagree and move on to find common ground although the economic expansion is decelerating the u s remains in recovery mode economic data will likely become more mixed they expect earnings growth to peak in the second quarter reporting season where we are now making stock selection increasingly critical as growth rates decline investors remain focused on federal reserve tapering of their bond purchases but the central bank does not appear to be ready to shift policy looking at numerous research sources i think she summed up what i call the credible consensus in fact their call for earnings growth in the second quarter is a 60 increase over that same number a year ago of course we don t need to be reminded that 12 months ago we were all hunkered down in the pandemic lockdown mode wondering if march 23rd had truly been the bottom of the market decline but just because it sounds good let it be known that 60 growth would be the largest year over year increase since the quarters immediately following the global financial crisis in 2009 what does this mean for you that depends on how you invest as far as u s stocks are concerned those embracing what s stated above may not be able to rely on a rising tide lifts all ships approach stated differently owning the s p 500 index may have its rewards but a bottoms up approach may be more advantageous that means looking at individual companies closely and determining how they might fare in whatever upcoming economic environment you anticipate will present itself just for good measure i checked in with my old friend of a friend brian wesbury chief economist at first trust advisors i m not sure how he keeps up with the economy between his financial news television appearances but he seems to have his finger on the pulse he boldly states that the s p 500 is going to 4500 or higher he noted that many are convinced that the u s stock market is headed down some even think a bear market that s a 20 decline by definition is inevitable recently when the market took a 1 6 dive many thought it had arrived then of course the market immediately reversed itself and hit a new all time high being a pessimist about stocks hasn t worked in a long time wesbury goes on to say that focusing on fundamentals like profits earnings and interest rates has worked better for him than trying to be a market timer he closes with some real basic stuff if we re talking about serious nest egg money remember you are by definition in it for the long term you are not a speculator looking for a home run sounds like a good reminder for all of us the opinions voiced in this material are for general information only and are not intended to provide specific advice or recommendations for any individual to determine which investment s may be appropriate for you consult your financial advisor prior to investing the economic forecasts set forth in the presentation may not develop as predicted and there can be no guarantee that strategies promoted will be successful performance referenced is historical and is no guarantee of future results all indices are unmanaged and may not be invested into directly investing involves risk including loss of principal rfg advisory and its investment advisor representatives do not provide tax legal or accounting advice this material has been prepared for informational purposes only and is not intended to provide and should not be relied on for tax legal or accounting advice please consult your own tax legal and accounting professional for guidance on such matters visit us at www williamsfa com tommy williams is a certified financial planner professional with williams financial advisors llc securities offered by registered representatives through private client services member finra sipc advisory products and services offered by investment advisory representatives through rfg advisory a registered investment advisor rfg advisory williams financial advisors llc and private client services are unaffiliated entities branch office is located at 6425 youree drive suite 180 shreveport la 71105

an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military grade malware from israel based nso group the world s most infamous hacker for hire outfit is being used to spy on journalists human rights activists and political dissidents from a list of more than 50 000 cellphone numbers obtained by the paris based journalism nonprofit forbidden stories and the human rights group amnesty international and shared with 16 news organizations journalists were able to identify more than 1 000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by nso clients for potential surveillance they include 189 journalists more than 600 politicians and government officials at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists and several heads of state according to the washington post a consortium member the journalists work for organizations including the associated press reuters cnn the wall street journal le monde and the financial times amnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that nso group s flagship pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of post journalist jamal khashoggi s fiancee hatice cengiz just four days after he was killed in the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 the company had previously been implicated in other spying on khashoggi get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters nso group denied in an emailed response to ap questions that it has ever maintained a list of potential past or existing targets in a separate statement it called the forbidden stories report full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories the company reiterated its claims that it only sells to vetted government agencies for use against terrorists and major criminals and that it has no visibility into its customers data critics call those claims dishonest and have provided evidence that nso directly manages the high tech spying they say the repeated abuse of pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry the source of the leak and how it was authenticated was not disclosed while a phone number s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device the consortium said it believed the data indicated potential targets of nso s government clients the post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list the guardian another consortium member reported that amnesty had found traces of pegasus infections on the cellphones of 15 journalists who let their phones be examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data the most numbers on the list 15 000 were for mexican phones with a large share in the middle east nso group s spyware has been implicated in targeted surveillance chiefly in the middle east and mexico saudi arabia is reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan kazakhstan and pakistan the number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media it is about controlling public narrative resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying in one casehighlighted by the guardian mexican reporter cecilio pineda birto was assassinated in 2017 a few weeks after his cell phone number appeared on the leaked list ap s director of media relations lauren easton said the company is deeply troubled to learn that two ap journalists along with journalists from many news organizations are on the list of the 1 000 potential targets for pegasus infection she said the ap was investigating to try to determine if its two staffers devices were compromised by the spyware the consortium s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers primarily from the university of toronto based watchdog citizen lab nso targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of al jazeera journalists and executives new york times beirut bureau chief ben hubbard moroccan journalist and activistomar radiand prominent mexican anti corruption reporter carmen aristegui her phone number was on the list the post reported the times said hubbard and its former mexico city bureau chief azam ahmed were on the list two hungarian investigative journalists andras szabo and szabolcs panyi were among journalists on the list whose phones were successfully infected with pegasus the guardian reported among more than two dozen previouslydocumented mexican targetsare proponents of a soda tax opposition politicians human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist in the middle east the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents allegedly targeted by the saudi and united arab emirates governments the consortium s pegasus project reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments including india and mexico have used nso group s pegasus spyware for political ends its members who include le monde and sueddeutsche zeitung of germany are promising a series of stories based on the leak pegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone s microphones and cameras in the case of journalists that lets hackers spy on reporters communications with sources the program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity nso group s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction the so called zero click option in 2019 whatsapp and its parent company facebooksued nso group in u s federal court in san francisco accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target with missed calls alone some 1 400 users nso group denies the accusations the israeli company was sued the previous year in israel and cyprus both countries from which it exports products the plaintiffs include al jazeera journalists as well as other qatari mexican and saudi journalists and activists who say the company s spyware was used to hack them several of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to abdullah al athbah editor of the qatari newspaper al arab and one of the alleged victims the material appears to show officials in the united arab emirates discussing whether to hack into the phones of senior figures in saudi arabia and qatar including members of the qatari royal family nso group does not disclose its clients and says it sells its technology to israeli approved governments to help them target terrorists and break up pedophile rings and sex and drug trafficking rings it claims its software has helped save thousands of lives and denies its technology was in any way associated with khashoggi s murder nso group also denies involvement in elaborate undercover operationsuncovered by the ap in 2019 in which shadowy operatives targeted nso critics including a citizen lab researcher to try to discredit them last year an israeli court dismissed an amnesty international lawsuit seeking to strip nso of its export license citing insufficient evidence nso group is far from the only merchant of commercial spyware but its behavior has drawn the most attention and critics say that is with good reason last month it published its first transparency report in which it says it has rejected more than 300 million in sales opportunities as a result of its human rights review processes eva galperin director of cybersecurity at the electronic frontier foundation and a strident critic tweeted if this report was printed it would not be worth the paper it was printed on a new interactive online data platform created by the group forensic architecture with support from citizen lab and amnesty international catalogs nso group s activities by country and target the group partnered with filmmaker laura poitras best known for her 2014 documentary citzenfour about nsa whistleblower edward snowden who offers video narrations stop what you re doing and read this snowden tweeted sunday referencing the consortium s findings this leak is going to be the story of the year since 2019 the u k private equity firmnovalpina capital has controlled a majority stake in nso group earlier this year israeli media reportedthe company was

how cdn providers break the internet after years of it experts telling us that we can t break the internet by pressing the wrong button it turns out we can do it by updating our settings phil coughlin the guardian jun 11 2021 on june 8 an internet blackout was precipitated by one customer updating their settings through a valid configuration change with speed 85 of the network of the tech infrastructure company fastly began returning errors a global outage ensued the downed sites according to brian barrett of wired shared no obvious theme or geography the outages were global and they hit everything from reddit to spotify to the new york times nick rockwell the senior vice president of engineering and infrastructure at the company outlined the incident in a blog post we experienced a global outage due to an undiscovered software bug that surfaced on june 8 when it was triggered by a valid customer configuration change the bug had been introduced in a software deployment on may 12 that could be triggered by a specific customer configuration under specific circumstances advertisement scroll to continue reading fastly s role is important since it along with such entities as akamai and cloudflare constitutes part of the content delivery network cdn essential to the internet s infrastructure and the speed with which information is relayed such cdn entities are physical manifestations in utilising servers to minimise download times they supply a service that enables websites notably those attracting heavy traffic to retain copies of their pages closer to their customers angelique medina director of product marketing at network monitoring firm cisco thousandeyes offers an explanation of that function it basically enables really high performance for content whether that s streaming video or a site or all the little images that pop up when you go to an ecommerce site reuters similarly describes this as offering a better experience for users enabling pages to load quicker and sites to manage high volumes of page requests better for example in a breaking news situation the drawback of having such an intertwined system populated by so few providers is that any modest hiccup in the supply conveyed via the services of the cdn network can result in a global blackout this stands to reason a beast such as akamai has 340 000 servers on its platform deployed across 4 100 locations across 130 countries this problem might be rectified by having websites host their own content exclusively but that as paul haskell dowland points out would slow web browsing and undermine that fetish cyber cognoscenti call the experience such incidents have become recurring features of shock in the tech landscape initially they generate a flash of discussion but are quickly submerged by the banality of technological acceptance cloudflare itself experienced problems in 2019 with an outrage that disrupted soundcloud medium and dropbox the explanation given then was similar to that of fastly the outage had resulted from a bad software deployment that caused a massive spike in cpu utilization on the company s network once the service returned to normal operation and all domains using cloudflare returned to normal traffic levels a certain degree of error on the part of cdn providers tends to be tolerated even readily exonerated in the week of june 12 global internet outages rose by 43 or 481 in total 317 of these took place in the us as this was happening the stock market was busily rewarding the very agents behind such outages fastly s stock price rose through june while akamai s share price rallied after june 18 such a centralised market tends to deliver riches while ignoring as geoff huston of the asia pacific network information centre observes a minor inconvenient truth about the less than solid foundations of the technology and incidents that impact operations that continue to happen and just to cause more ripples of excitement akamai became the second cdn provider to suffer an outage later in june for one of its prolexic ddos mitigation services as the company mentioned in a statement a routing table value used by this particular service was inadvertently exceeded the effect was an unanticipated disruption of service outages were subsequently felt across banking services many located in australia a number of airlines and the hong kong stock exchange the public relations departments across akamai s client base were scrambled to dampen any panic reactions from the cdn high priests to these disruptions are rehearsals of apology followed by businesslike solutions they know they are the titans with few contenders rockwell s response served to mask the more critical issues of cdn concentration even though there were specific conditions that triggered this outage we should have anticipated it but he emphasised the speed of detection and rectification the disruption was detected within one minute then identified and isolated the cause and disabling the configuration within 49 minutes 95 per cent of our network was operating normal the company he promised would figure out why we didn t detect the bug during our software quality assurance and testing processes the irony of such outrages is that they defy the spirit of decentralisation that was meant to underlie the web as david warburton of cybersecurity company f5 labs rightly notes the past decade has borne witness to the unintentional centralisation of many core services through large cloud solution providers like infrastructure vendors and cdns economies of scale have prevailed and competition all but quashed the comparative shopping list is not exactly large remarks the ever valuable huston if you wish to choose a cdn that optimises service delivery yet leaves the customer in control of such critical aspects of the security and integrity of the service such as private keys till that problem is addressed the disruptive outage will become the tolerated manifestation of an unacceptably centralised market dr binoy kampmark was a commonwealth scholar at selwyn college cambridge he lectures at rmit university melbourne

triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox boston an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military grade malware from israel based nso group the world s most infamous hacker for hire outfit is being used to spy on journalists human rights activists and political dissidents from a list of more than 50 000 cellphone numbers obtained by the paris based journalism nonprofit forbidden stories and the human rights group amnesty international and shared with 16 news organizations journalists were able to identify more than 1 000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by nso clients for potential surveillance they include 189 journalists more than 600 politicians and government officials at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists and several heads of state according to the washington post a consortium member the journalists work for organizations including the associated press reuters cnn the wall street journal le monde and the financial times amnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that nso group s flagship pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of post journalist jamal khashoggi s fiancee hatice cengiz just four days after he was killed in the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 the company had previously been implicated in other spying on khashoggi nso group denied in an emailed response to ap questions that it has ever maintained a list of potential past or existing targets and said it has no visibility into its customers data in a separate statement it called the forbidden stories report full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories the company reiterated its claim that it only sells to vetted government agencies for use against terrorists and major criminals critics call those claims dishonest and say repeated abuse of pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry the source of the leak and how it was authenticated was not disclosed while a phone number s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device the consortium said it believed the data indicated potential targets of nso s government clients the post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list the guardian another consortium member reported that amnesty had found traces of pegasus infections on the cellphones of 15 journalist s who let their phones be examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data the most numbers on the list 15 000 were for mexican phones with a large share in the middle east nso group s spyware has been implicated in targeted surveillance chiefly in the middle east and mexico saudi arabia is reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan kazakhstan and pakistan the number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media it is about controlling public narrative resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying ap s director of media relations lauren easton said the company is deeply troubled to learn that two ap journalists along with journalists from many news organizations are on the list of the 1 000 potential targets for pegasus infection she said the ap was investigating to try to determine if its two staffers devices were compromised by the spyware the consortium s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers primarily from the university of toronto based watchdog citizen lab nso targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of al jazeera journalists and executives new york times beirut bureau chief ben hubbard moroccan journalist and activist omar radi and prominent mexican anti corruption reporter carmen aristegui her phone number was on the list the post reported the times said hubbard and its former mexico city bureau chief azam ahmed were on the list two hungarian investigative journalists andras szabo and szabolcs panyi were among journalists on the list whose phones were successfully infected with pegasus the guardian reported among more than two dozen previously documented mexican targets are proponents of a soda tax opposition politicians human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist in the middle east the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents allegedly targeted by the saudi and united arab emirates governments the consortium s pegasus project reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments including india and mexico have used nso group s pegasus spyware for political ends its members who include le monde and sueddeutsche zeitung of germany are promising a series of stories based on the leak pegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone s microphones and cameras in the case of journalists that lets hackers spy on reporters communications with sources the program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity nso group s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction the so called zero click option in 2019 whatsapp and its parent company facebook sued nso group in u s federal court in san francisco accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target with missed calls alone some 1 400 users nso group denies the accusations the israeli company was sued the previous year in israel and cyprus both countries from which it exports products the plaintiffs include al jazeera journalists as well as other qatari mexican and saudi journalists and activists who say the company s spyware was used to hack them several of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to abdullah al athbah editor

while japan is lagging far behind other countries in developing covid 19 vaccines the united states is already supplying its shots to the rest of the world the gap reflects the differences between what the two nations have learned from past bioterrorism attacks and epidemics of emerging and re emerging infectious diseases that occurred not only within the country but also elsewhere and how they prepared for future risks and crises the following comment is not taken from a report rather it is a remark made by a lecturer in 2000 during a class of disaster medicine at harvard university school of public health

ninety day survival outcomes in covid 19 ards trial of remestemcel l presented at isct meeting on advances in cell gene therapies for lung diseases tweet new york july 18 2021 globe newswire mesoblast limited nasdaq meso asx msb global leader in allogeneic cellular medicines for inflammatory diseases presented 90 day survival outcomes from the 222 patient randomized controlled trial of remestemcel l in ventilator dependent covid 19 patients with moderate severe acute respiratory distress syndrome ards at an invited presentation on july 17 to the international society for cell gene therapy isct scientific signatures series on cell and gene therapies in lung diseases and critical illnesses the results showed that two doses of remestemcel l at days 3 5 conferred durable survival benefit through at least 90 days in the pre specified subgroup of patients under age 65 key presentation findings were remestemcel l significantly reduced mortality by 48 at 90 days compared to controls in a pre specified analysis of 123 treated patients under 65 years old 26 vs 44 hazard ratio hr 0 52 95 ci 0 277 0 964 p 0 038 1 2 this compares favourably with the 46 mortality reduction reported at 60 days p 0 048 1 2 and indicates a durable treatment benefit in this patient population this compares favourably with the 46 mortality reduction reported at 60 days p 0 048 and indicates a durable treatment benefit in this patient population remestemcel l was even more effective when evaluated in an exploratory analysis in patients on dexamethasone as part of their standard of care with 90 day mortality being reduced by 77 compared to controls under 65 who received dexamethasone 14 vs 48 hr 0 23 95 ci 0 080 0 681 p 0 0037 1 2 these survival benefits were accompanied by significant improvements relative to controls in pre specified secondary endpoints of ventilator free days respiratory function as assessed by ards severity and overall clinical improvement on a 7 point ordinal scale despite a treatment related improvement in respiratory function at day 7 there was no mortality reduction in the 97 treated patients over age 65 suggesting the need for more prolonged or higher dosing of anti inflammatory therapy in these patients who may have a more exuberant inflammatory response associated with defective immune mediated viral clearance mechanisms recently published guidance to industry by the u s food and drug administration fda 3 has recommended demonstration of mortality benefit for at least 60 days in critically ill patients mesoblast will be meeting shortly with the fda to discuss the durable mortality reduction seen in patients under 65 years old who received remestemcel l in this randomized controlled trial and the regulatory pathway for remestemcel l in this patient population mesoblast entered into a license and collaboration agreement with novartis for the development manufacture and commercialization of remestemcel l with an initial focus on the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome ards including that associated with covid 19 the agreement remains subject to certain closing conditions including time to analyze the results from this covid 19 ards trial about the trial of remestemcel l in acute respiratory distress syndrome ards due to covid 19 the trial enrolled 222 mechanically ventilated covid 19 patients with moderate severe ards across the us of whom 217 were randomized 1 1 and received either standard of care alone or standard of care plus 2 intravenous infusions of remestemcel l at a dose of 2 million cells kg 3 5 days apart this was the same remestemcel l dosing regimen used in the earlier compassionate use program where 11 of 12 patients were younger than 65 and 75 successfully came off ventilatory support the trial was halted in december 2020 after the data safety monitoring board dsmb performed a third interim analysis on the trial s first 180 patients noting that the trial was not likely to meet the 30 day mortality reduction endpoint at the planned 300 patient enrolment the trial was powered to achieve a primary endpoint of 43 reduction in mortality at 30 days for treatment with remestemcel l on top of maximal cae the dsmb recommended that the trial complete with the enrolled 222 patients and that all be followed up as planned at follow up through day 60 remestemcel l showed a positive but non significant trend in overall mortality reduction across the entire population of treated patients n 217 in the pre specified population of patients under age 65 n 123 remestemcel l reduced mortality through day 60 by 46 but not in patients 65 or older n 94 in an exploratory analysis through day 60 remestemcel l reduced mortality by 75 and increased days alive off mechanical ventilation in patients under age 65 when combined with dexamethasone in comparison with controls on dexamethasone about mesoblast mesoblast is a world leader in developing allogeneic off the shelf cellular

merchants marine bancorp releases earnings tweet merchants marine bancorp inc otcqx mnmb the parent company of merchants marine bank reports net income through the first six months of 2021 of 1 44 million or 1 08 per share compared with net income of 3 50 million or 2 63 per share during the same period in 2020 it should be noted that during the same period in 2020 the company monetized a 3 1 million gain pretax by liquidating a portion of its securities portfolio which materially affected per share earnings data during that period the company has been in an investment cycle since the last quarter of 2020 when its subsidiary merchants marine bank acquired a branch in mobile alabama from a regional bank who was exiting the market in the same quarter merchants marine bank also established a loan and deposit production office in hattiesburg mississippi during the first half of 2021 the company entered the secondary market mortgage business through the formation of canvas mortgage a division of merchants marine bank with any large investment into new markets and business lines particularly those of a de novo nature like canvas mortgage and our new hattiesburg office there is a j curve effect on income we hit the bottom of that j curve in april 2021 i m very pleased to report that since then in may and june the company s core income net of non recurring items has returned to net profitability and is accelerating said casey hill the company s chief financial officer the timing of ppp forgiveness and the income associated with it could not have been a better fit with our expansion plans such that this non recurring revenue covered the trough in the return curve nearly perfectly the company s balance sheet grew significantly over the trailing twelve months by 89 43 million or 13 86 percent the company s cash position has increased over 80 percent during the same period to 260 31 million while the bank grew significantly it was almost entirely due to unanticipated federal stimulus this has left the company in an exceptionally liquid position but without the traditional avenues of investment due to the current yield curve and expectations on future changes in interest rates we do not want to make short term investment decisions to garner yield now that will handicap the bank in the future commented hill we currently have a large unrealized gain in our securities portfolio to invest at the bottom of the market would mean a likely evaporation of that gain our strategic plan in place since last year is to deliberately shrink the balance sheet by ridding the bank of higher cost municipal deposits all things held equal the elimination of these accounts should mean six figure increases in net income per month beginning in the 3rd quarter of 2022 the bank s current liquidity position allows us to support this planned outflow of deposits as well as possible additional outflows as federal stimulus bloat begins to wane while also growing the loan portfolio while we could have never planned for the effects of covid 19 we are working diligently to position the bank such that it emerges from the economic effects of the pandemic in as strong a posture as possible continued hill this can also be seen in the marked improvement in asset quality indicators over the past two quarters a significant improvement in non performing assets is a testament to the hard work of our lending staff and risk function selected financial highlights as of june 30 2021 deposits increased year over year by 16 94 percent to 638 million from 545 million demand deposits made up the bulk of the growth increasing 27 03 percent to 466 million from 366 million with 34 million of this increase centered in higher cost contractual public funds deposits that will be exiting over the course of the coming year interest expense decreased during the first half of 2021 when compared with the same period last year by 28 61 percent a decrease to 493 thousand from 1 72 million this is due primarily to the adoption and implementation of a dynamic pricing strategy on time deposits time deposit balances have decreased 22 percent over the past 12 months even with the significant increase in overall deposit balances operating expenses saw a significant increase over the same period last year increasing to 11 52 million from 9 00 million an increase of 28 01 percent this occurred in part due to non recurring expenses associated with a rebranding effort and startup costs associated with the establishment of the new canvas mortgage division also contributing to the increase is heightened operational costs and personnel expenses related to new market expansions undertaken in the last year asset quality indicators improved substantially during the first six months of 2021 with past due but accruing loans decreasing to 0 54 percent of total loans at june 30th of this year from 1 67 percent at the end of 2020 nonaccrual loans also decreased to 2 39 percent of total loans from 2 62 percent at the end of 2020 the improvement in these ratios was achieved despite a more than 11 00 percent reduction in the overall loan portfolio during the first half of 2021 the majority of which is due to paydowns in ppp loans it should be noted that during the same period in 2020 the company monetized a 3 1 million gain pretax by liquidating a portion of its securities portfolio this materially affected per share earnings data during that period as reflected in the opening paragraph of this release i am very pleased with our second quarter results and i am especially proud of what produced them strong continued progress by our team in executing our strategic plans commented clayton legear the company s president chief executive officer the investments we have made and the plans we are executing are designed to put the bank in a position to chart its own course over the long term even in uncertain economic conditions like the ones in which we are operating today as we move into the second half of the year we look forward to continued improvement in core earnings more sustainable organic growth stronger credit quality and significantly enhanced operational capacity through the investments that have been made we consider these key to our future growth plans and scaling in an efficient and controlled manner merchants

an investigation by a global media consortium based on leaked targeting data provides further evidence that military grade malware from israel based nso group the world s most infamous hacker for hire outfit is being used to spy on journalists human rights activists and political dissidents from a list of more than 50 000 cellphone numbers obtained by the paris based journalism nonprofit forbidden stories and the human rights group amnesty international and shared with 16 news organizations journalists were able to identify more than 1 000 individuals in 50 countries who were allegedly selected by nso clients for potential surveillance they include 189 journalists more than 600 politicians and government officials at least 65 business executives 85 human rights activists and several heads of state according to the washington post a consortium member the journalists work for organizations including the associated press reuters cnn the wall street journal le monde and the financial times amnesty also reported that its forensic researchers had determined that nso group s flagship pegasus spyware was successfully installed on the phone of post journalist jamal khashoggi s fiancee hatice cengiz just four days after he was killed in the saudi consulate in istanbul in 2018 the company had previously been implicated in other spying on khashoggi get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters nso group denied in an emailed response to ap questions that it has ever maintained a list of potential past or existing targets in a separate statement it called the forbidden stories report full of wrong assumptions and uncorroborated theories the company reiterated its claims that it only sells to vetted government agencies for use against terrorists and major criminals and that it has no visibility into its customers data critics call those claims dishonest and have provided evidence that nso directly manages the high tech spying they say the repeated abuse of pegasus spyware highlights the nearly complete lack of regulation of the private global surveillance industry the source of the leak and how it was authenticated was not disclosed while a phone number s presence in the data does not mean an attempt was made to hack a device the consortium said it believed the data indicated potential targets of nso s government clients the post said it identified 37 hacked smartphones on the list the guardian another consortium member reported that amnesty had found traces of pegasus infections on the cellphones of 15 journalists who let their phones be examined after discovering their number was in the leaked data the most numbers on the list 15 000 were for mexican phones with a large share in the middle east nso group s spyware has been implicated in targeted surveillance chiefly in the middle east and mexico saudi arabia is reported to be among nso clients also on the lists were phones in countries including france hungary india azerbaijan kazakhstan and pakistan the number of journalists identified as targets vividly illustrates how pegasus is used as a tool to intimidate critical media it is about controlling public narrative resisting scrutiny and suppressing any dissenting voice amnesty quoted its secretary general agnes callamard as saying in one casehighlighted by the guardian mexican reporter cecilio pineda birto was assassinated in 2017 a few weeks after his cell phone number appeared on the leaked list ap s director of media relations lauren easton said the company is deeply troubled to learn that two ap journalists along with journalists from many news organizations are on the list of the 1 000 potential targets for pegasus infection she said the ap was investigating to try to determine if its two staffers devices were compromised by the spyware the consortium s findings build on extensive work by cybersecurity researchers primarily from the university of toronto based watchdog citizen lab nso targets identified by researchers beginning in 2016 include dozens of al jazeera journalists and executives new york times beirut bureau chief ben hubbard moroccan journalist and activistomar radiand prominent mexican anti corruption reporter carmen aristegui her phone number was on the list the post reported the times said hubbard and its former mexico city bureau chief azam ahmed were on the list two hungarian investigative journalists andras szabo and szabolcs panyi were among journalists on the list whose phones were successfully infected with pegasus the guardian reported among more than two dozen previouslydocumented mexican targetsare proponents of a soda tax opposition politicians human rights activists investigating a mass disappearance and the widow of a slain journalist in the middle east the victims have mostly been journalists and dissidents allegedly targeted by the saudi and united arab emirates governments the consortium s pegasus project reporting bolsters accusations that not just autocratic regimes but democratic governments including india and mexico have used nso group s pegasus spyware for political ends its members who include le monde and sueddeutsche zeitung of germany are promising a series of stories based on the leak pegasus infiltrates phones to vacuum up personal and location data and surreptitiously control the smartphone s microphones and cameras in the case of journalists that lets hackers spy on reporters communications with sources the program is designed to bypass detection and mask its activity nso group s methods to infect its victims have grown so sophisticated that researchers say it can now do so without any user interaction the so called zero click option in 2019 whatsapp and its parent company facebooksued nso group in u s federal court in san francisco accusing it of exploiting a flaw in the popular encrypted messaging service to target with missed calls alone some 1 400 users nso group denies the accusations the israeli company was sued the previous year in israel and cyprus both countries from which it exports products the plaintiffs include al jazeera journalists as well as other qatari mexican and saudi journalists and activists who say the company s spyware was used to hack them several of the suits draw heavily on leaked material provided to abdullah al athbah editor of the qatari newspaper al arab and one of the alleged victims the material appears to show officials in the united arab emirates discussing whether to hack into the phones of senior figures in saudi arabia and qatar including members of the qatari royal family nso group does not disclose its clients and says it sells its technology to israeli approved governments to help them target terrorists and break up pedophile rings and sex and drug trafficking rings it claims its software has helped save thousands of lives and denies its technology was in any way associated with khashoggi s murder nso group also denies involvement in elaborate undercover operationsuncovered by the ap in 2019 in which shadowy operatives targeted nso critics including a citizen lab researcher to try to discredit them last year an israeli court dismissed an amnesty international lawsuit seeking to strip nso of its export license citing insufficient evidence nso group is far from the only merchant of commercial spyware but its behavior has drawn the most attention and critics say that is with good reason last month it published its first transparency report in which it says it has rejected more than 300 million in sales opportunities as a result of its human rights review processes eva galperin director of cybersecurity at the electronic frontier foundation and a strident critic tweeted if this report was printed it would not be worth the paper it was printed on a new interactive online data platform created by the group forensic architecture with support from citizen lab and amnesty international catalogs nso group s activities by country and target the group partnered with filmmaker laura poitras best known for her 2014 documentary citzenfour about nsa whistleblower edward snowden who offers video narrations stop what you re doing and read this snowden tweeted sunday referencing the consortium s findings this leak is going to be the story of the year since 2019 the u k private equity firmnovalpina capital has controlled a majority stake in nso group earlier this year israeli media reportedthe company was considering an initial public offering most likely on the tel

the world socialist web site spoke with rob a veteran operating engineer in the kansas city area and regular reader of the wsws on the significance and lessons of the month long strike by volvo trucks workers in dublin virginia the nearly 3 000 workers at the new river valley plant conducted a courageous struggle on two fronts against the highly profitable transnational corporation and the pro corporate united auto workers after the workers had voted down three concessions contracts agreed to by the uaw the company declared an impasse and said it was imposing the last tentative contract the uaw aided and abetted this strikebreaking by ordering the workers to vote again on the deal they had just rejected 60 percent to 40 percent and declaring that whatever the outcome of the revote they would have to return to work on monday july 19 under highly suspicious conditions the uaw announced late wednesday night that the revote had passed by 17 votes the struggle was led by the volvo workers rank and file committee vwrfc formed by militant workers with the assistance of the socialist equality party and the wsws the committee via the wsws challenged the news blackout imposed by the uaw and the corporate media and mobilized support from autoworkers and other workers across the us and internationally volvo car workers in ghent belgium carried out a wildcat strike against company plans to unilaterally extend their work hours two days after wsws campaigners leafleted the plant to inform them of the strike by volvo trucks workers in virginia rob began the interview by referring to the video posted on the wsws last week of two members of the vwrfc discussing their struggle against volvo and the uaw and its critical importance for workers all over the world rob i was struck in the first place by the fact that the gentlemen had to hide their identities because i do believe that there would be retaliation from either the uaw or volvo itself so i thought that was the right thing to do but at the time it was sad that they had to do it that we live in a society where speaking the truth is grounds for retaliation what i mainly remember from the video is them acknowledging the fact that people who had previously voted yes were going to vote no this time around just because of the way the uaw was basically forcing another vote which i thought if it actually happened was a good thing barry grey what do you think about the news blackout on the strike that was imposed by the uaw the afl cio the mainstream media and the pseudo left organizations allied to the unions and the democratic party rob to me it just shows the power of the oligarchy that they can keep everything solid when there is a group of individuals who are trying to get their voices heard the fact that there were 3 000 workers on strike and yet you never heard about it and i m sure if i wasn t speaking with you and following the wsws i would never have heard of it bg you say that it shows the power of the oligarchy which is true but doesn t it also show the tremendous fear of an independent movement of the working class rob yes i mean if they weren t fearful of it they wouldn t be trying to silence it i would like to believe that it is heartening and motivating to others because my understanding is that they got a little bit better than what the first offer was not you know what their demands were but they did get a little better my experience has been that when we ve been kicked down and we ve been lied to everybody kind of gives up so i m hoping that other people will see that they didn t get everything they wanted but they got better so let s keep trying bg what do you think was revealed about the role of the uaw and the unions in general rob they were shown to be treasonous they should have basically been fired and removed from their offices and replaced by others who were actually working for the workers but unfortunately the way our country is run that didn t happen other actions were treasonous to the rank and file members i mean the whole time that they were out on strike the officials were still getting their six figure paychecks bg and they were giving only 275 in strike pay per week and do you know how much money is in the uaw strike fund rob if i remember correctly i think it s around 800 million bg do you see a connection between the pandemic and the growing number of strikes rob i think it s happening with jobs being cut permanently the companies are trying to get more for less get their workers to work harder get more productivity out of them what i ve seen in my industry what used to take 20 guys to run is now down to three or four i think that s what could be happening globally that they re trying to squeeze every little bit out and then with the lack of protections they have as far as medical is concerned people are thinking enough is enough we ve given we ve given we ve given and now it s time to get i think the pandemic has kind of exposed that as a union member you know we re always told the company s hurting this is the best they can do because it s been a bad year yadda yadda yadda but it s never a bad year one of the tenants in the industrial park where i work is t mobile the president of t mobile counting stock options made 137 million this year you can t tell me they re having a bad year if they re paying the president 137 million bg what do you think about the initiative fought for by the world socialist web site and the socialist equality party for the formation of rank and file committees at workplaces independent of the unions rob honestly if there is to be any advancement in workers rights that is the only way to go because like the uaw has demonstrated with the blackout and the nonsupport with the strike pay and stuff like that they ve shown that they re not for the workers but i think with a rank and file committee you could eventually gain the majority for the members the union is corporate owned and does what the corporation says basically i think what the volvo workers have taught us is that you should resist and maybe the next group would do better and that keeps progressing don t take the knee stand up for what you want they were out for four weeks when all they were getting was 275 that s a long time that s brutal on a family it shows a lot bg what do you think needs to be done going forward what do you think is necessary for workers what strategies should workers develop in order to fight back rob i think as we ve discussed before that education on the history is critical not the history that the oligarchs want to push but to actually know what happened and you know how it happened that would be important and would solidify the workers just from the conversations that you and i have had there is so much that was not taught to me and i ve got a bachelor s degree so i ve got four years of college and there s so much i still was not taught bg the volvo strike is to this point unique in that there is a more class conscious leadership among the workers that is independent of the so called union in the form of the vwrfc the workers have immense social power but the question is are they politically conscious do they as you pointed out know their own history do they have a program and strategy for example the question of the democratic party is a huge question the sep gets attacked as sectarians because we refuse to support the so called unions and we refuse to support biden and the democratic party should workers support the democratic party do you think rob i do not i ve voiced many times in conversations that i don t think there is a separation between the democratic and the republican parties i honestly believe it s all one party i mean and they might have different names and their goals might be slightly different but overall they have the same goal which is to exploit the working class so it s a class question so therefore the working class needs its own party i don t believe the democratic party would be that

kuala lumpur july 19 fitch ratings has affirmed malaysia s long term foreign currency issuer default rating idr at bbb with a stable outlook in a note released today fitch said malaysia s economy is gradually recovering from a contraction of 5 6 per cent in 2020 caused by the covid 19 pandemic even though social distancing measures have been tightened over recent months we expect the gross domestic product gdp growth of 4 5 per cent in 2021 and 6 3 per cent in 2022 as the output gap narrows and the vaccine roll out gathers pace which should allow the services sector to benefit from pent up demand it said fitch said the government s social distancing measures have been accompanied by material relief measures including social security payments wage subsidies grants to small and medium enterprises smes allocation for the procurement of vaccines corporate loan guarantees and a repayment moratorium on certain bank loans advertisement as a result of this relief spending and reduced government revenue we expect the fiscal deficit to rise to 6 5 per cent of gdp in 2021 from 6 2 per cent in 2020 it said as the pandemic has caused a significant rise in malaysia s general government debt in line with its rating peers fitch forecast the debt to reach 78 1 per cent of gdp in 2021 from a pre pandemic level of 65 2 per cent in 2019 the debt figures used by fitch include officially reported committed government guarantees on loans which are serviced by the government budget and 1malaysia development bhd s net debt equivalent in december 2020 to 12 7 per cent and 1 4 per cent of gdp respectively it said advertisement on this basis fitch said the debt burden is significantly higher than the median of 57 per cent for sovereigns in the bbb rating category malaysia s gross debt is over 400 per cent of revenue around three times the peer median it said expecting the debt ratio to decline slightly to 77 per cent of gdp in 2022 and for this trend to continue facilitated by the resumption of strong gdp growth on the medium term fiscal outlook the rating firm said it remained subject to heightened political volatility we expect a gradual reduction in the fiscal deficit which is forecast to average 5 2 per cent of gdp over 2021 through 2023 above the government s average target of 4 5 per cent as growth lifts revenues and covid 19 related spending measures lapse it said in terms of general government revenue it was expected to remain low at 18 2 per cent of gdp in 2021 bbb median 26 6 per cent and dependent on crude oil production which the government expects to generate 16 per cent of total revenue this year a reduction from 25 per cent in 2020 when petroliam nasional bhd petronas provided a special dividend according to fitch the low revenue base is exacerbated by the removal of the goods and services tax gst in 2018 which was replaced with a narrower sales and services tax sst and has in recent years led the government to draw on special dividends of government linked companies lingering political uncertainty weighs not only on the policy outlook but also on investment and prospects for an improvement in governance standards in fitch s view it said fitch said this year a de facto minority government has been able to implement pandemic related policies and provide relief measures although two consecutive coalitions had governed the country since may 2018 with either a thin majority or minority support in parliament malaysia has been running consistent annual current account surpluses for more than two decades and fitch expects it to continue to do so in the next few years although the surplus is likely to narrow to 3 6 per cent of gdp in 2022 from 4 1 per cent in 2021 as import compression will likely gradually dissipate it said according to fitch the share of the government s foreign currency denominated debt is also low at around three per cent of total debt in addition it said the government is still relatively dependent on foreign financing although foreign holdings of domestic debt proved remarkably stable during the pandemic at around 25 per cent of the total supported by a deep and developed domestic bond market malaysia s external liquidity as measured by the ratio of the country s liquid external assets to its liquid external liabilities at just below 100 per cent is weaker than the bbb median of 127 3 per cent it noted meanwhile fitch said monetary policy is likely to remain supportive of economic activity after bank negara malaysia bnm reduced its policy rate by a total of 125 basis points bps since the start of the pandemic the window for further policy rate cuts appears to be limited given the approaching united states us federal reserve tapering and an increase in inflation in malaysia albeit from the base effect from low fuel prices last year it said we expect bnm to start its tightening cycle in 2022 with a policy rate hike of 25bps it said in terms of the second six month loan moratorium which malaysia imposed on all retail and sme loans on an opt in basis in july fitch opined that this would further delay recognition of non performing loans 1 6 per cent of total
