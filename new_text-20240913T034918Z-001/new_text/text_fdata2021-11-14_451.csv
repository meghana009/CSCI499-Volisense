the hotter than expected us cpi report rocked the markets wednesday morning gold spiked nearly 50 within 90 minutes of the cpi report and ended the week 100 6 above last week s lows speculators in the gold futures market were net long a modest sized position relative to their position the past few years as of oct 26 i expect there has been a substantial increase since silver spiked 1 10 within 90 minutes and ended the week 2 40 10 above last week s lows short term us interest rates spiked on the news the eurodollar futures contract trades at a discount to par so falling prices on this chart indicate rising interest rates this next chart shows the spread between the dec 2021 and the dec 2022 eurodollar contract as recently as early october the dec 2022 contract was only a 30 point discount to dec 2021 implying that short rates come dec 22 would only be 30 bps higher than dec 21 but the spread has gone out to 70 points in the last six weeks as s t interest rates have been rising sharply on expectations that persistent and rising inflation would inspire the fed to raise rates next year at least 2 x 0 25 bond yields jumped prices fell on the cpi number but the pressure was greater on the short end of the yield curve the us dollar soared against essentially all other currencies on the cpi report with the benchmark us dollar index ending the week at a 16 month high the usdx has rallied nearly 7 from the january 6 2021 nadir a 32 month low which i have previously described as a cathartic inflection point the day the mob stormed the capitol building in washington dc it is unusual to see gold and the usd both rising at the same time a geopolitical scare may cause this to happen as capital seeks safety in both gold and the usd perhaps gold traders were thinking of inflation hedge while fx traders assumed that the cpi report would push the fed to be much more hawkish than other central banks or perhaps the drop in real yields to historic lows inspired gold traders to bid aggressively for gold regardless of the strong dollar this chart shows the relationship of gold black bars and real yields yellow 5 year tenor blue 10 year tenor in late 2018 real yields for both tenors were positive 1 15 but now 5 years are negative 1 83 it is a busy chart but it illustrates that falling real yields are generally positive for gold prices on the tips treasury inflation protected security chart rally as real interest rates fall this chart shows that real rates have fallen sharply in november as inflation metrics rose the cpi report created the spike at the top of the chart as real rates dropped to record negative lows the s p djia and naz dropped to a one week low late wednesday but they had little immediate reaction to the cpi report inflation transitory or not as recently as last week s fed meeting chairman powell maintained that inflationary pressures were a little stronger and lasted a little longer than the fed had expected but their baseline view was that the inflationary surge would prove to be transitory given that the fed was not anticipating higher interest rates during the next 12 months many analysts are expecting the fed to raise rates in 2022 the futures market is pricing in at least two interest rate increases 25 bps next year on friday the university of michigan reported that consumer sentiment fell in early november to its lowest level in a decade due to an escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation president biden has declared that reversing this trend is a top priority for me leading republicans are blaming biden s economic policies for the surge in inflation too much government stimulus will there be a fall guy and will it be jay powell powell s term as fed chair ends in february biden has indicated that he will decide whether to re appoint powell before thanksgiving november 25 if powell is replaced the new chair will probably be either more dovish and or tougher regarding regulations what will that do to the markets you trade there is a school of thought that the dems will try to re shape the federal reserve during biden s term like the republicans re shaped the supreme court during trump s term to make it more in line with the progressive agenda throwing powell under the bus might give biden some negotiating points with the progressive wing of the democratic party those folks haven t been winning much lately the canadian dollar rallied 4 cents from the sept lows 7750 to the october highs 8150 as stock and commodity markets were strong the cad rallied following the more hawkish than expected bank of canada meeting on oct 27 but has dropped 2 cents since then as commodities especially crude oil have weakened and as the usd has rallied against nearly all currencies wti crude oil traded between 80 and 85 this week the market has traded broadly sideways between 78 and 85 for the last four weeks after rallying from 62 in august a 37 rally the broad commodity indices with a heavy crude oil weighting have rallied 100 from the covid crisis lows to a 7 year high but they have been sideways to lower the past few weeks the agricultural weighted indices have rallied 50 from last year s lows to a 4 year high and have been breaking out to new highs the past few weeks higher food prices ahead my short term trading i started this week with two positions i established last friday long the yen and short the s p both trades went nicely in my favour early this week showing decent profits and i moved my stops to reduce p l risk i was stopped on the yen for a tiny loss on wednesday when the usd soared following the cpi report i was stopped on the s p for a small gain on friday as stock indices rallied back from wednesday s lows it is frustrating to see decent unrealized profits turn into small losses or only modest gains there is always that little voice that asks why didn t you exit the trade with a good profit when you had the chance my answer to that question for both the yen and the s p is that my time frame when i established the trades was for a potentially bigger move that even though the positions were showing a nice profit i had to stay with the trade rather than taking a quick profit i had to give the trade a chance to develop into a much bigger gain see quotes from the notebook below i have no open positions at the end of the week my p l for the week was essentially flat on my radar for the past couple of weeks i ve been looking for opportunities to fade irrational exuberance especially in the equity markets i thought the breakdown in tesla this week might trigger a breakdown in the broader indices after its spectacular run higher the past few weeks at wednesday s close i thought there was a good chance prices could develop downside momentum but that didn t happen this week from a longer term perspective if the major indices fall below their late september early october lows downside momentum may develop i will continue to look for opportunities to short equities but i m disappointed that my obsession with irrational exuberance has kept me from looking at opportunities in other markets for instance i ve generally been bullish on the usd but i haven t put on the trade thoughts on trading last week i wrote about why i read so much research listen to podcasts and watch videos i m not looking for specific buy this sell that recommendations i m looking to get an idea to see a market from a different point of view that will cause me to think if that s the case then the trade to make will be x for example i remember hearing martin armstrong say probably in 1984 that the djia was making new all time highs in us dollar terms but not in swiss franc terms it had never occurred to me to think of the djia in terms of swiss francs but i realized that people who thought about investing from an international perspective definitely did and if the djia were making new all time highs in all currencies that would probably draw more money from around the world to the djia and drive it even higher this happened in spades in the late 1990s during the dot com boom the us stock market was soaring and capital flowed to the usa to participate in the boom this accelerated the boom and drove the usd higher a classic virtuous circle i have not wanted to make buy this sell that recommendations on this blog because i believe that deciding to enter a trade is only a tiny part of successful trading that what you do with a trade once you have it on is much more important for instance if i recommended that my readers buy x with a stop at point y and a profit target at point z that might be exactly how i see the market then but as time passes and new information arrives and prices change i will probably change my mind about what to do with the trade i have hoped that readers will get some ideas from this blog to help them with their own trading they might get an idea for a specific trade or for a way to manage risks or they might see an opportunity in a market they have never traded before quotes from the notebook it never was my thinking that made big money for me it always was my sitting got that my sitting tight it is no trick at all to be right on the market you always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets i ve known many men who were right at exactly the right time and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit and their experience invariably matched mine that is they made no real money out of it men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon edwin lefevre reminiscences of a stock operator 1923 my comment this is a classic edwin wrote reminiscences as a roman a clef about jesse livermore the boy wonder from the bucket shops who made and lost fabulous fortunes several times if you want to manage your own money as a trader investor as opposed to turning it over to someone else to manage for you then i think you absolutely must read this book it s 100 years old but the wisdom is timeless it seems to me that there are two ways to make more money trading either trade bigger size or position for bigger moves i ve always been pretty good at taking losses quickly but i ve not been good at sitting with a winning trade i m going to try to get better at that a small request if you like reading the trading desk notes please do me a favour and forward a copy or a link to a friend also i truly welcome your comments would you please let me know if there is something you d like to see included in the td notes thanks victor barney

to the amount of money you are worth and it is calculated by adding the value of your assets home is the most valuable asset assets are considered the items you own and have a value but include house car stocks investments and bank accounts you can also get the net worth by subtracting the value of all the liabilities liabilities are obligations that include debt on your loans mortgage credit cards and car loans if the assets exceed all your liabilities then you are going to have a positive net worth if the liabilities are greater than your assets then it becomes negative net worth it would help if you always kept in mind that net worth always fluctuates over enter adult life and responds according to changes in spending habits and income habits a family is wealthier if all members of the family are living together and owning the home home is the most valuable asset and its value assigned has a great impact on the net worth calculation a professional or qualified real estate provides you an estimation of your home value and you can research by using online real estate aggregators paying off loans cutting debt and doing something else to limit the liabilities is the best way to increase overall net worth due to these changes net worth is an ever changing measure that keeps on changing throughout your life
the response to prime minister scott morrison s announcement of an electric vehicle policy has focused on its inconsistency with his derisive statements in 2019 that the technology would end the weekend what s more important however is whether the policy is consistent with the government s belated commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 examining the modelling behind the commitment allows us to assess this and possibly helps explain the timing of morrison s rhetorical pivot transport is covered only briefly in the modelling which was released late on friday and the government does not set out technological goals however it is assumed by 2050 the proportion of electric vehicles will have risen to 90 compared to around 1 at present 2050 is a long way off but motor vehicles are long lived pieces of capital equipment if we re going to replace 90 of the existing fleet with electric vehicles we must start now dean lewins aap simple arithmetic the average age of australian cars is about ten years implying they last about 20 years on average so the shift to electrics will need to be well under way ten years from now by about 2030 to illustrate the speed of the adjustment needed suppose electrics represent 50 of new car sales by 2030 this was the target proposed by then labor leader bill shorten at the 2019 election morrison rejected it the time but now appears to have tacitly embraced something similar given the 2030 starting point and assuming a 20 year vehicle life how fast would the share of electric vehicles need to grow to reach 90 of australia s fleet by 2050 and how fast would the sale of conventional cars have to fall according to my calculations the sale of traditional vehicles would have to cease completely by 2038 to reach the government s target roughly speaking australians buy 1 million new vehicles a year with a total stock of 20 million if the share of traditional vehicle sales falls from 50 to zero between 2030 and 2038 that leaves about 2 million traditional vehicles or 10 of the total fleet remaining on the road by 2050 with the rest being electric vehicles read more as the world surges ahead on electric vehicle policy the morrison government s new strategy leaves australia idling in the garage aap a challenging task this estimate assumes the number of cars sold every year remains constant but in fact it has been increasing over time which has a couple of effects first it means newer cars are over represented relative to the case of constant sales that implies the expected lifetime of cars is actually longer than 20 years and if the number of cars keeps growing the task of decarbonising is even harder a policy of electrification should be accompanied by measures to encourage the use of public transport cycling and walking as well as remote work and other ways of reducing unnecessary travel in view of the magnitude and urgency of the task the morrison government s commitment to spend a 250 million on electric vehicle charging stations about 10 for each person in australia is nowhere near sufficient to electrify australia s vehicle fleet in time the government must either provide price incentives to consumers or mandate improvements in fuel efficiency across the vehicle fleet such government interventions appear anathema to morrison s new mantra of can do capitalism but something of the the kind will be necessary the simplest approach would be a combination of tax relief and subsidies this would reduce the cost difference between electric and traditional vehicles which one estimate puts at 20 000 30 000 this is partly offset by fuel savings and the lower repair costs of electric vehicles a subsidy or tax exemption of 10 000 declining over time as the cost advantage of traditional vehicles diminished would promote fairly rapid uptake of electric vehicles the likely cost would be around 1 billion a year or 20 billion over the transition mark baker ap getting a handle on the numbers to put these numbers in perspective comparisons are useful the new south wales government has just announced 100 million to cover the cost difference for electric vehicles bought by councils taxi companies and other fleet operators this covering part of the fleet in one state comes on top of 490 million announced in the state s june budget as nsw treasurer matt kean pointed out his liberal nationals government is taking the electric vehicle transition much more seriously than its federal counterpart alternatively we could look at the inland rail scheme a proposed 1 700km freight rail line between melbourne and brisbane the national party demanded the project be accelerated as part payment for their acceptance of a 2050 net zero target this likely white elephant is budgeted to cost 14 5 billion an amount which will almost certainly blow out it will reduce the use of fuel for trucks but at an immense cost for the amount paid to placate one noisy lobby group we could cover most of the cost of electrifying australia s road vehicle fleet joel carrett aap not there yet there is an alternative recommended by bodies including the federal government s own climate change authority it would involve a fuel efficiency requirement for new car sales which would work similarly to the renewable energy target vehicle importers could decide whether to meet the target by shifting to electrics or more fuel efficient traditional vehicles over time the target would fall to zero requiring complete electrification the cost would be spread across importers and car buyers a third approach would be to do nothing now but pay owners of traditional vehicles to scrap them before the end of their working life this would involve something like the cash for clunkers scheme adopted in the united states under the obama administration and briefly floated by the gillard government in 2010 while enabling government to defer action it would cost more in the long run the morrison government s commitment to a 2050 net zero target is a welcome step if long overdue but as far as motor vehicles are concerned the policies to get there are badly lagging the ambition

in march 2020 just days into the covid 19 pandemic a group of virginia tech economic researchers started brainstorming ideas for a study that would gauge how people were emotionally responding to the pandemic as a team of behavioral economists we are interested in how people make decisions and in factors that contribute to changes in behavior the onset of the pandemic seemed like a worldwide natural experiment and we were immediately drawn to investigating its implications on individuals and the process of decision making said abdelaziz alsharawy lead author on the study and a recent ph d graduate in economics he is now a post doctorate researcher at princeton university the team was especially interested in how the fear of covid 19 affected people s behavior and economic choices specifically if those reactions differed between men and women starting in early april 2020 the team issued a survey to 1 500 people randomly selected from across the united states and asked them to answer questions about their demographics attitudes social preferences and how they were following preventative health measures the resulting study recently published in the journal frontiers in psychology revealed that women were more likely to report extreme levels of fear of covid 19 than men in fact when survey responders were asked to rate their fear of the pandemic on a sliding scale nearly 20 percent of women chose the highest possible option compared with 9 3 percent of men however previous studies have shown that men are more likely to experience severe illness or die of covid 19 graduate student ross spoon professor sheryl ball and assistant professor alec smith all from the department of economics pose in front of a group of plants and trees inside pamplin hall photo by steven mackay for virginia tech that s the big surprise in the paper it s a mismatch said sheryl ball a professor in the department of economics part of the virginia tech college of science you would think that if the health risks are bigger for one group than another group you expect the group that is facing the greater risks to be working harder to not get covid and we just don t see that survey respondents also rated how likely they were to adopt centers for disease control and prevention recommended practices such as handwashing physical distancing and wearing a face mask the data revealed that women were more likely to follow these practices than men and that behavior is motivated by a fear of covid 19 it isn t being female that makes you adhere to the preventative measures it s the level of fear said alec smith an assistant professor of economics and it just happens to be true that women have more fear of covid than men the gender differences don t stop there the survey also gauged how people perceived both the health and financial consequences of the pandemic women were more likely to be concerned about the health risks than men but men showed greater worry for the financial consequences this surprised the team as they hypothesized that women would show greater fear for both identifying these gender differences can help improve how information about the pandemic is delivered since men and women may respond to messages differently for example men might resonate more with messages that emphasize how following cdc recommendations will ultimately ease the financial consequences of the pandemic by helping get the u s back on track tailoring these messages to a specific audience make them more effective and in a pandemic such messages save lives we hope that this research contributes to our understanding of how to convince large groups of people to make behavioral changes in response to an urgent situation like a global pandemic said co author ross spoon a graduate student in economics understanding how different groups of people respond to information and emotional appeals will help governments and other institutions craft communication strategies to deal with these situations the world looked and felt drastically different in april 2020 when the data was collected but the applications of this research branch far into the future when thinking about public health messaging i think that understanding the gender difference we document in this paper is going to be an important piece of evidence in thinking about lessons learned from this pandemic ball said there will be other disease outbreaks in the future and we want to make sure that we do better than we did now
please try again later please try again later when developers of a proposed high speed train from los angeles to las vegas talk about their project one point they emphasize is the benefit to the environment representatives of brightline west have said the electric trains running at speeds of up to 200 mph will cut emissions 400 000 tons of carbon dioxide annually by removing from the road more than 3 million vehicles that would normally travel up interstate 15 to sin city every year when launched brightline west will be one of the greenest forms of transportation in america and an eco friendly upgrade to the i 15 said ben porritt the company s senior vice president advertisement advertisement but several groups and officials including two u s senators worry about the impact the train could have on residents that don t drive particularly desert bighorn sheep for local stories that matter subscribe today they say the train will create a barrier and prevent the state protected animal from roaming through its normal habitat which could potentially threaten its long term survival the solution build at least three wildlife over crossings to allow the sheep and other species to move freely over the tracks and freeway whether the bridges will actually be built remains to be seen feinstein padilla want more from project planned to be built mostly in the median of the i 15 the rail project conceived of in 2005 has seen several investors come and go and encountered many hurdles advertisement advertisement last year brightline secured the rights to issue 800 million in private bonds to fund the train the developer let the rights lapse though citing financial market uncertainty caused by the pandemic the daily press reported the company was able to sign off on a lease agreement with caltrans in july 2020 to use the existing right of way along the i 15 for the 8 billion project a rendering of the brightline west high speed train proposed to run from los angeles to las vegas and earlier this year brightline announced that rancho cucamonga along with apple valley would serve as station locations developers estimate the average drive time from that inland empire city to the nevada destination will be cut by nearly half with a two hour trip advertisement advertisement there s more at stake than a shorter commute however say california s senators dianne feinstein and alex padilla in a nov 1 letter to gov gavin newsom they echoed the findings of scientists and said the train s current design which calls for it to be flanked by six foot concrete walls topped by chain link fences would impede protected species like bighorn sheep desert tortoises and mountain lions from crossing the highway both caltrans and the california department of fish and wildlife documented these threats in their june 2021 recommendations to brightline urging the construction of the wildlife overpasses according to the senators despite these recommendations and repeated stakeholder engagement brightline has not committed to build wildlife crossings even though it will seek tax exempt private activity bonds for this 8 billion project with expected revenue of nearly 1 billion feinstein and padilla wrote advertisement advertisement in a statement friday porritt said brightline officials would be working collaboratively with both public and private stakeholders to ensure that as we build and operate the train we do so in a way that considers any highway improvements conservation efforts and other future opportunities that may arise as an example we will maintain or improve the 600 existing small culverts and large scale crossings under the i 15 freeway that exist today and work with caltrans and other stakeholders for any crossings that may be built over the i 15 in the future he added they really count on being able to move but simply keeping up what s already there won t be enough some believe advertisement advertisement desert bighorn sheep are seldom seen in the wild mainly owing to the fact that they live in remote mountain areas inhospitable to man with severe long term drought and climate change bringing rising temperatures everyday living has become even more tenuous for the mammals who have been protected under state law since 1971 bighorn sheep near barstow calif in january 2021 their survival depends on the ability to roam and forage for food and water and also interact and mate with other herds according to jeff villepique a senior wildlife biologist with the california department of fish and wildlife who heads the department s local bighorn sheep program advertisement advertisement they really count on being able to move he said the ability to leave your mountain range and go to a new one is key about 4 500 bighorns live across the state s mojave and sonoran deserts and transverse ranges villepique said a map shows the movements of two gps tracked bighorn sheep which crossed interstate 15 a study by the california department of fish and wildlife and oregon state university reported gps tracked bighorn sheep have crossed the i 15 in areas such as the soda and cady mountains that line the freeway on the way to vegas the scientists also found the animals were unwilling to use culverts villepique said this was likely due to the sheep s wariness of entering darkened areas because they can t spot predators advertisement advertisement the study recommended three wildlife over crossings be built and four main underpasses be improved at the minimum scientists said one overpass should be built at zzyzx road southwest of baker with the underpasses maintained a federal review says additional crossings not necessary how the bridges would be built however is unclear a caltrans spokesperson told the los angeles times in september that the agency did not have the authority to require that brightline west incorporate wildlife crossings as part of the project the train line given that it crosses state borders is being overseen by the federal railroad administration advertisement advertisement villepique said whether caltrans can force construction is a point of contention between the agency and non governmental organizations that support the bridges adding to the mix a federal environmental review for the high speed train appears to dispute any additional improvements are needed the federal railroad administration found last year in a reevaluation of the 2011 final environmental impact statement that habitat fragmentation or isolation as to wildlife movement was not anticipated as a result of the project existing culverts and wildlife crossing locations under the i 15 freeway corridor would remain in place according to the report advertisement advertisement villepique said the california department of fish and wildlife did not agree with the railway administration s interpretation we think there is a dramatic impact of fragmentation on particularly bighorn sheep and other species as well he said it puts the long term survival of desert bighorn sheep in the mojave in jeopardy daily press reporter martin estacio may be reached at 760 955 5358 or mestacio

author john quiggin menafn the conversation the response to prime minister scott morrison s announcement of an electric vehicle policy has focused on its inconsistency with his derisive statements in 2019 that the technology would end the weekend what s more important however is whether the policy is consistent with the government s belated commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 examining the modelling behind the commitment allows us to assess this and possibly helps explain the timing of morrison s rhetorical pivot transport is covered only briefly in the modelling which was released late on friday and the government does not set out technological goals however it is assumed by 2050 the proportion of electric vehicles will have risen to 90 compared to around 1 at present 2050 is a long way off but motor vehicles are long lived pieces of capital equipment if we re going to replace 90 of the existing fleet with electric vehicles we must start now we must start now to electrify australia s vehicle fleet dean lewins aap simple arithmetic the average age of australian cars is about ten years implying they last about 20 years on average so the shift to electrics will need to be well under way ten years from now by about 2030 to illustrate the speed of the adjustment needed suppose electrics represent 50 of new car sales by 2030 this was the target proposed by then labor leader bill shorten at the 2019 election morrison rejected it the time but now appears to have tacitly embraced something similar given the 2030 starting point and assuming a 20 year vehicle life how fast would the share of electric vehicles need to grow to reach 90 of australia s fleet by 2050 and how fast would the sale of conventional cars have to fall according to my calculations the sale of traditional vehicles would have to cease completely by 2038 to reach the government s target roughly speaking australians buy 1 million new vehicles a year with a total stock of 20 million if the share of traditional vehicle sales falls from 50 to zero between 2030 and 2038 that leaves about 2 million traditional vehicles or 10 of the total fleet remaining on the road by 2050 with the rest being electric vehicles read more as the world surges ahead on electric vehicle policy the morrison government s new strategy leaves australia idling in the garage australians buy one million new cars a year aap a challenging task this estimate assumes the number of cars sold every year remains constant but in fact it has been increasing over time which has a couple of effects first it means newer cars are over represented relative to the case of constant sales that implies the expected lifetime of cars is actually longer than 20 years and if the number of cars keeps growing the task of decarbonising is even harder a policy of electrification should be accompanied by measures to encourage the use of public transport cycling and walking as well as remote work and other ways of reducing unnecessary travel in view of the magnitude and urgency of the task the morrison government s commitment to spend a 250 million on electric vehicle charging stations about 10 for each person in australia is nowhere near sufficient to electrify australia s vehicle fleet in time the government must either provide price incentives to consumers or mandate improvements in fuel efficiency across the vehicle fleet such government interventions appear anathema to morrison s new mantra of can do capitalism but something of the the kind will be necessary the simplest approach would be a combination of tax relief and subsidies this would reduce the cost difference between electric and traditional vehicles which one estimate puts at 20 000 30 000 this is partly offset by fuel savings and the lower repair costs of electric vehicles a subsidy or tax exemption of 10 000 declining over time as the cost advantage of traditional vehicles diminished would promote fairly rapid uptake of electric vehicles the likely cost would be around 1 billion a year or 20 billion over the transition a subsidy or tax exemption would promote electric vehicle uptake mark baker ap getting a handle on the numbers to put these numbers in perspective comparisons are useful the new south wales government has just announced 100 million to cover the cost difference for electric vehicles bought by councils taxi companies and other fleet operators this covering part of the fleet in one state comes on top of 490 million announced in the state s june budget as nsw treasurer matt kean pointed out his liberal nationals government is taking the electric vehicle transition much more seriously than its federal counterpart alternatively we could look at the inland rail scheme a proposed 1 700km freight rail line between melbourne and brisbane the national party demanded the project be accelerated as part payment for their acceptance of a 2050 net zero target this likely white elephant is budgeted to cost 14 5 billion an amount which will almost certainly blow out it will reduce the use of fuel for trucks but at an immense cost for the amount paid to placate one noisy lobby group we could cover most of the cost of electrifying australia s road vehicle fleet nsw treasurer matt kean has implied his government is taking electric vehicles far more seriously than the morrison government joel carrett aap not there yet there is an alternative recommended by bodies including the federal government s own climate change authority it would involve a fuel efficiency requirement for new car sales which would work similarly to the renewable energy target vehicle importers could decide whether to meet the target by shifting to electrics or more fuel efficient traditional vehicles over time the target would fall to zero requiring complete electrification the cost would be spread across importers and car buyers a third approach would be to do nothing now but pay owners of traditional vehicles to scrap them before the end of their working life this would involve something like the cash for clunkers scheme adopted in the united states under the obama administration and briefly floated by the gillard government in 2010 while enabling government to defer action it would cost more in the long run the morrison government s commitment to a 2050 net zero target is a welcome step if long overdue but as far as motor vehicles are concerned the policies to get there are badly lagging the ambition read more take heart at what s unfolded at cop26 in

monsanto has been linked to the poison game for a long time all the propaganda in the world can t erase the fact that they first poisoned thousands of vietnamese thai and koreans as well as countless american soldiers with agent orange who only now receive compensation for the effects of monsanto s bio warfare decades later the proof is finally so pervasive that the company can no longer just sweep away evidence of their evil doing from 1962 to 1971 the u s air force sprayed nearly 19 million gallons of herbicides in vietnam of which at least 11 million gallons was agent orange in a military project called operation ranch hand veterans and agent orange health effects of herbicides used in vietnam the legacy of agent orange and monsanto s attempt to defoliate the hiding places of the viet cong is still apparent in modern vietnam but how those chemicals are being used now in the aftermath of war should be even more chilling to the observant individual during the vietnam war agent orange chemicals were sprayed primarily from c 123 twin engine aircraft carriers this was called operation ranch hand the total number of gallons of herbicide sprayed are in the millions one of the primary chemicals used in agent orange named so because the canisters they were transported in were painted with bright orange stripes is 2 4 d but other chemicals were also contained within those canisters aside from hundreds of thousands of birth defects reported by the vietnamese from the spraying of these chemicals war veterans began to notice health problems that they attributed to exposure to agent orange it took nearly 20 years after the vietnam war ended for congress to inquire about the ramifications of using these chemicals in vietnam and the health damage suffered by vietnam vets according to casarett and doull s toxicology 1996 edition tcdd dioxin has been shown to be extremely toxic to a number of animal species mortality does not occur immediately it appears that the animals environment suddenly becomes toxic to them related is monsanto s glyphosate the new agent orange this is likely why many vets did not see symptoms from agent orange exposure until many years after the fact eventually congress asked the institute of medicine iom national academy of sciences nas to perform an in depth study on these chemicals and they did find them highly toxic but at what cost to veterans who showed adverse health symptoms earlier moreover the us military who commissioned monsanto and dow among other chemical companies to create agent orange knew it was highly toxic dr james clary a scientist at the chemical weapons branch eglin air force base who designed the herbicide spray tank and wrote a 1979 report on operation ranch hand told senator daschle in 1988 said when we military scientists initiated the herbicide program in the1960s we were aware of the potential for damage due to dioxin contamination in the herbicide we were even aware that the military formulation had a higher dioxin concentration than the civilian version due to the lower cost and speed of manufacture however because the material was to be used on the enemy none of us were overly concerned we never considered a scenario in which our own personnel would become contaminated with the herbicide quoted by admiral elmo r zumwalt 1990 gmos not used as food but as bioweapons the world population is now the enemy from dicamba to 2 4 d to glyphosate the chemicals being used on our crops are being consumed in mass some claim it s actually part of an over arching plan to control the population on the surface it looks as though these companies are greed motivated which they are but the truth of their great chemical dreams is more subverting case in point many gm companies work with and through agra which is supported by the rockefeller foundation and the bill and melinda gates foundation to feed the starving african children you may have noticed that many gm foods are sent to africa and other poor nations as part of aid packages nevermind that these very same multinational companies have scoured these countries for every natural resource they have and could solve simple diseases with a two cent vitamin not by creating things like genetically modified golden rice to prevent malnourished children who go blind or so they claim instead these companies focus on switching out heirloom viable seed with gm seed for example when asked how agra gets improved seeds that s what they call gm seed to farmers they say there are three ways agra makes grants to farmer organizations public breeding institutes and private start up seed companies farmer organizations and public breeding institutes mainly produce cuttings of vegetatively propagated crops like sweet potato and cassava for these crops once farmers have the improved varieties they can replant it for many years but for seed crops such as maize and sorghum the best method for getting fresh certified seed to farmers is via locally owned and managed seed companies agra fails to mention that companies like monsanto have infiltrated or have fully taken over locally owned and managed seed companies all over the world when asked if resource poor farmers can really afford to purchase new seed every year the agra website offers this missive yes in fact we are finding that seed companies regularly sell out of their stocks every year and still cannot keep up with demand selling seed in small packages and making it available at the village level has greatly increased farmer adoption of improved seed mobile money has likewise boosted sales of seed in remote villages agra also works with farmer organizations that offer group buying opportunities as well as access to credit what we are increasingly seeing is that by adopting improved seed farmers are becoming more prosperous and more able to purchase additional seed as well as other inputs again no mention of farmer suicides all over india due to seed monopolies and herbicide use that forces a farmer ironically the ones who grow food to starve to death because gm seeds aren t as viable as gm companies promised they would be now even us farmers who want to grow organic crops are facing bankruptcy all these gm crops and the chemicals that go with them are warfare clear and simple does the military machine ask for america s permission when they decide to invade a foreign country no add to these unsavory facts the observance that the fda and usda have continually turned a blind eye when it has come to protecting the food supply is glyphosate the new agent orange are we eating america s left over chemical warfare to be used as agricultural poison on our food supply glyphosate residue is now in almost every food we eat from packaged foods sold in the grocery store to eggs and even meat and poultry because the animals that were fed gm bt corn and soy were eating traces of toxic chemicals furthermore 2 4 d resistant crops were just given a rubber stamp even though the public strongly opposed them while it was our own government who did the spraying they colluded with monsanto one of the nine government contractors who made the toxic combination of 2 4 d and 2 4 5 t which came to be called agent orange many people don t know this but after decades of research proving that agent orange is lethal and tens of millions of dollars paid to victims in settlements it is still being used in many asian countries the company has switched to using it s best selling herbicide roundup predominately now yet another innocent product constructed of toxic chemicals roundup kills weeds because glyphosate a salt compound inhibits enzyme pathways preventing plants from synthesizing amino acids necessary for growth it basically stops plants from eating so they die it is probable that monsanto and other companies who use this substance under other names besides roundup are now dumping more than 300 million pounds of this toxic poison into our soil annually it s use has at least tripled since 1990 read stopping resurgence of agent orange in food supply this calls into question some of the arguments posted by anti labeling and pro gmo propagandists who say that the science isn t conclusive that gmo herbicides are dangerous this is why countless people continue to rail against monsanto it s why monsanto and others spend millions of dollars illegally to try to defeat gmo labeling bills the truth is that roundup in the form of glyphosate is just another product of the military industrial complex and an evolution of agent orange as unsuspecting consumers we eat other chemicals as well another clue for this chemical warfare can be found in the products made by food companies like heinz knorr slimfast and best foods just to name a few stanley monteith an expert on world food supply points to the huge amounts of man made chemicals in the food on our local grocery store shelves naming aspartame as an example dr monteith explains aspartame is a chemical made up of aspartic acid and phenylalanine and it breaks down into formaldehyde eventually into wood alcohol it produces all sorts of problems mental problems and it impacts on literally every organ in the body they know this there are extensive animal studies that show this and it never should ve been put into our food chemical additives like sodium fluoride also cause health issues despite official research showing that fluoride is toxic even coming from harvard multinational companies and governments continue to put it in our water supplies at the end of the second world war the united states government sent charles eliot perkins a research worker in chemistry biochemistry physiology and pathology to take charge of the vast farben chemical plants in germany while there he was told by german chemists of a scheme which had been worked out by them during the war and adopted by the german general staff this was to control the population in any given area through mass medication of drinking water in this scheme sodium fluoride occupied a prominent place when you add up the chemicals of monsanto other biotech companies food companies and toxic industrial waste products purposely put in our water along with toxic drugs and medical treatments that kill us instead of cure us what are we left to believe monsanto s legacy was not left in vietnam

banking can seem like a complex business filled with complicated financial instruments and rarefied jargon that make little sense to the average investor andy golding chief executive of osb group takes a different approach a dyed in the wool money man he left school at 16 took a job at natwest and has been in the industry ever since his philosophy is to keep banking simple and the approach has served him well when osb floated on the stock market in 2014 the shares were 1 70 and the business was valued at just over 400million today the savings and specialist lender group is worth more than 2 25billion and the stock is trading at 5 01 growth the group was formed in 2011 when kent reliance building society was rescued by american private equity firm jc flowers the price should continue to increase golding has put together a business with lower costs higher profit margins and stronger customer loyalty than virtually all its peers a third quarter trading update last week provided fresh reassurance with plenty of new business and a confident statement about the future the group was formed in 2011 when kent reliance building society was rescued by american private equity firm jc

experienced owners and service is paramount the group has a wholly owned business in india too which provides most back office services and a call centre many uk companies have fallen foul of outsourcing to india but osb owns its subsidiary in bangalore outright so training is comprehensive staff are educated to graduate or masters level and customer satisfaction levels are extremely high at the same time costs are far lower than they would be in the uk allowing osb to generate robust profits while offering attractive rates to savers and borrowers brokers expect full year profits to increase by more than 60 per cent to around 425million while dividend payments are forecast to rebound from 14 5p to at least 21p with a strong balance sheet and capital position golding may well deliver share buybacks and special dividends next year too midas verdict osb is a low cost high service profitable group that is the envy of its peers with increased dividends on the agenda the shares

since become the best performing charity bonds on the stock market rising from an issue price of 1 to 1 13 today now caf is back in the market seeking to raise up to 50million through another ten year bond priced at 1 but paying 3 5 per cent this time the rate may be lower than five years ago but it is still considerably higher than most savings rates and caf s bonds can be bought and sold freely on the stock market caf intends to use some of the money to repay the 2016 bond offering investors 113 50 for every 100 worth of bonds they own the rest of the cash will be used to help caf improve

to enroll patients in the united states and europe for our phase 3 regal study of galinpepimut s gps in acute myeloid leukemia aml patients we also commenced clinical and regulatory preparations for a potential new phase 2 3 study of gps in aml patients following a bone marrow transplant bmt who harbor minimal residual disease mrd said angelos m stergiou md scd h c president and chief executive officer of sellas we are excited to begin exploring gps as a treatment option for this post bmt population which based on the retrospective outcomes data published earlier in the summer remains an area of unmet need we believe there is significant opportunity for gps to become the key antileukemic vaccine immunotherapy in various aml settings with the potential to treat patients who have undergone a bmt as well as patients who have achieved second remission in aml cr2 the indication of our regal study dr yair levy director of hematologic malignancies at the baylor university medical center stated i look forward to a clinical trial in transplanted patients that would address the high relapse rate among mrd positive mrd aml patients although bmt remains the only truly curative treatment for aml patients with any significant disease risk its benefit is limited by relapses in about 50 of patients who enter transplant with mrd the trial being planned by sellas would explore whether gps could be a treatment option for a much larger population of aml patients i e those patients who have undergone bmt whose chances of remaining in remission could significantly improve as well as the large number of mrd patients who have been shown to have a high relapse rate after bmt or who do not undergo a bmt because they are considered unlikely to benefit from it pipeline update and corporate highlights phase 3 regal study additional sites in the united states and european union were activated during the third quarter with enrollment continuing in addition regulatory approval

analysis after 80 events deaths which the company had anticipated would take place in the first half of 2022 provided that the ongoing covid 19 pandemic did not significantly adversely impact our projected timeline for enrollment over the last 12 to 18 months the company has monitored the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on the projected timeline for the regal study during this period the company took several steps to mitigate possible and actual delays due to the covid 19 pandemic including increasing the number of clinical sites and the number of countries in which sites are located in order to maintain the original timeline despite these mitigation steps the company now anticipates that the interim analysis will take place in the second half of 2022 provided that the ongoing covid 19 pandemic does not continue to adversely impact the projected timeline for enrollment in addition to the planned interim analysis under the sap the final charter for the independent data

on the culture surrounding bullfights el toro bravo the brave bull the spanish fighting bull no animal is mightier stronger more dangerous deadly or majestic el toro bravo is not an ordinary bull that many would associate with being a bull it is a behemoth of creatures and the much of the spanish people believe whole heartedly that it is king of the beasts not the lion in ancient roman coliseums the strength and majesty of el toro bravo was tested by pitting it against lions tigers elephants and bears it won a vast majority of these matches one of the many images the catholic church has for the devil a demon is a giant bull black in color blood red eyes fiery hooves and immense horns because of the catholic church s influence in spain it becomes undoubtable where this image came from el toro bravo has become a culture within a culture a fanfare and spectacle within a fierce debate the bullfight is not a part of mainstream spanish culture the bullfight is nothing but a pathetic translation of what a corrida is a corrida is not a bullfight it is a traditional ritualistic dance of death with man and beast they are not fighting it is not a sport it is not win or lose it is life or death it is a live action art form it is not to be taken in any other context the corrida is only the main event in the culture that surrounds el toro bravo the rest of the culture despite being better defined as a subculture is still a culture religion food media language activities lifestyles and even politics all play an important part in the culture of el toro bravo beginning with the ancient history of the corrida to the rituals and superstitions or the matadors climbing all the way through to international politics el toro bravo may not be celebrated globally but it has a global impact not bad for a semi secluded tradition dating back to prehistory religion food language media indeed there are cave paintings in spain that depict men lancing bulls and bison the rituals of the corrida are pagan in origin el toro bravos slain for sacrifices to the gods the roman empire more than likely adopted their coloseums and gladiator matches from ancient spanish corridas although vice versa is not without probability as well when the roman empire became catholic so did spain and thus ended the pagan practices within the country but the pagan influence was not driven out completely much of the patron saints of cities that have bullrings or plaza de toros have pagan origins the church has simply assimilated the pagan traditions and made it their own most fiestas occur around or on catholic holidays once pagan celebrations and usually these fiestas are crowned with one or several corridas so the religious connection becomes obvious the catholic church is traditional ritualistic and resistant to change the matadors are traditional ritualistic and resistant to change catholic priests attend corridas bless the bulls matadors swords everything and the matadors pray to the patron saints and to god for a good fight in the permanent plazas del toros there are churches located inside the arenas themselves the proletariat of northern spain identifies itself with the corrida in many ways food language and the media american sports and television shows have created a vast wealth of catch phrases that most people understand but not everyone knows the true origin of in much that same process has the corrida shaped and molded the catch phrases of spanish pop culture dozens of movies have been produced about corridas and el toro bravo many translated into english the most famous movie is called blood and sand and because many corridas are televised broadcasted over radio and almost all are reviewed in newspapers any term used to describe el toro bravos corridas or the performances of famous matadors will probably be picked up by the populace the coverage of corridas by popular media compares easily to any professional sport in america but because the corrida and el toro bravo are considered traditional the coverage also includes literature to an extent that is unimaginable in america the national library of spain has some 4 500 different pieces of literature about the rich tradition involved with corridas and el toro bravo one of those traditions is the fiesta the fiesta is many times a celebration of el toro bravo the celebration of an angry pot roast the spanish senorita can only end one logical way pot roast after el toro bravo falls dead in the plaza de toros its body is dragged into a butcher s shop and butchered if el toro bravo is especially prized for its size or performed especially well in the corrida then its meat will also be especially prized and much of it is bought up by premium restaurants the testicles of a great el toro bravo are considered a delicacy and a very potent aphrodisiac the bulk of the meat is given to local vendors for use during the fiesta and consumed by the general populace in some manner the matador the allure of the corrida reaches everyone much like american children dream to be sports athletes and pop singers do spanish children dream of being matadors boys make up an overwhelming majority of those who dream to be matadors a reflection of the disproportionate amount of women matadors two as of 1999 in the past young boys would endanger themselves by climbing the fences of el toro bravo s grazing area and dancing with young bulls only one to three years of age in many cases this led to death but in maybe just as many cases if not more it lead to the young boys becoming apprentice matadors called novillero and because bulls remember human encounters for good or for bad the young boys teasing usually makes the young bulls fiercer in the corridas in this day and age most of the matadors come from a poor country background a true rags to riches story formal bullfighting colleges have been opened the most famous in madrid but these are under attack by some for teaching young matadors methods instead of art this concern is reflected in the stands of the plaza de toros by some there are always those that heckle the matador for being too safe or making a cheap jab at el toro bravo not because they protest corridas or the slaying of el toro bravo but because they enjoy the artistic dance created by man and beast and see anything else as unacceptable another group of people that go to corridas and heckle the matador are those that participate in the running of the bulls these people are the first and foremost people to endanger themselves in the presence of the bulls a typical encierros or running of the bulls has five to six male bulls of various ages usually only one or two el toro bravo being five years of age and then around nine fighting cows because they place themselves in the most danger those that participate in encierros feel a sort of kinship with el toro bravo and do not easily tolerate the abuses by the matador women also feel the allure of the corridas but a disproportionate number only recently have women been allowed to attend corridas that considered it can be called a miracle that women matadors were christened only twenty years after women were first allowed to attend truly the job of a matador appeals to everyone matadors are some of the highest paid performers on earth much less in an semi impoverished nation like spain and get to date wealthy women live in large houses and marry beautiful actresses and singers because of the wealth and status matadors have become the targets of paparazzi they are pursued by the spanish tabloids as fiercely as british tabloids pursue the british royal family but it is not all fun and games for the matadors he can easily die in the plaza de toros if a matador is beloved enough by the people as the good ones always are his death is mourned nationally if the death is caused by gorging it makes his death only more bitter for the spanish peoples politics because of the massive support for the corrida and el toro bravo that a great deal of the population of spain has politics would eventually be unable to ignore the issue for good or ill use during the inquisition and many following years the spanish royalists and the catholic church tried to outlaw and ban the corrida as a savage and paganistic practice the throne executed matadors and the church excommunicated attendees some of whom were priests but the tradition lived on eventually politicians saw the corrida as a potential and powerful political tool for use in gaining the support of the people during the military regime of francisco franco during the 1960 s the number of corridas held increased dramatically in part because franco believed the corrida was part of a catholic spainish tradition but also in part to increase tourism in spain because of the sharp increase in the sheer number of el toro bravo needed for the increased number of corridas and because of a shift from bull to man in the interest of the public breeders began to selectively breed a weaker el toro bravo the original genetic strain pf el toreo bravo comes from an ancient species of bull long since extinct el toro bravo is only naturally domestically found in spain but because of inbreeding and purposeful weakening of the bulls the majesty once held by el toro bravo is not what it once was the bulls are larger yes but not in a good way the bulls are overweight with weakened front legs this combination has the potential to cripple any toro bravo in the plaza de toros because it cannot turn fast enough nor can it sometimes support its own weight on its front legs causing the beast to collapse another illegal trick is horn shaving horn shaving is done to el toro bravos to distort their sense of distance the bulls believe that they are an inch or two closer than they really are in extreme cases that are easily argued as abuse the nerve endings in the horns are exposed not only distorting el toro bravo s sense of distance but making it afraid to ram and gorge matadors and walls because of the pain that just the open air causes to the exposed nerves these two maltreatments are done by breeders for one simple reason to protect the matador many times the matador is a son or even a son in law of the breeder and shaving the horns of a bull to protect the matador seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to do and it is in that argument but it undoubtably puts el toro bravo at a disadvantage so much of a disadvantage that the national government took steps to inspect the horns of the bulls post mortem el toro bravo with shaven horns would result in penalties and punishment for the breeder this law was never put into effect however because the breeders and matadors went on strike just prior to the opening season of corridas and the economic pressures created by the strike forced the government to buckle down and accept the will of the breeder matador union that is the power of el toro bravo but isn t even the full extent of the beast s influence even though not all of spain has a tradition of corridas regional governments loathe unpopularity so much that they ignore the requests of animal rights activists in favor of the tradition of el toro bravo that is they fear unpopular reactions from banning or barring corridas and other related activities even though the area they govern has no tradition of such activities animal rights activists have only gotten one spanish province to ban all related activities the canary islands corridas and the subsequent treatment of el toro bravo also delayed spain s entry into the european economic community but spain was allowed to join after a great deal of fierce debate with out having to alter any of its existing laws regarding el toro bravo el toro bravo the spanish fighting bull a force that will not be ignored both physically and metaphorically the sole fact that there is an entire culture within a culture that surrounds this beast is impressive enough but when one considers that the traditions involved with the culture have survived by moderate adaptation to the era since long before the 1st century bc then the reaction is unimaginable spain would not be the country it is now with out the corrida latin america would not be the same with out the corrida southern france would not be the same without the corrida southern california would not be the same without the corrida the world would not be the same without el toro bravo there is so much more of the culture surrounding this majestic beast that is going to go unsaid because of lack of good resources available to me mostly because i don t speak spanish so much the evolution of the matadors origins from wealthy noble to poor miser the slang created by the corrida female matadors and the changing face of the aficionados those who whole heartedly support corridas southern spain s views on el toro bravo the national pride and use as national animal of el toro bravo so much unsaid simply because i can t read the spanish resources based on majestic el toro bravo so much importance lost because i cannot fully grasp the culture surrounding el toro bravo so much things i can mention here but couldn t work into the original essay after the corrida the matador is awarded el toro bravo s ear if he performs especially well the president of the corrida may award him the second ear or even the tail to keep as trophies the minimum weight a bull can be to be considered as an el toro bravo is 1 000 pounds or about 500 kilos

take a look at the big numbers from the online apparel seller revolve group rvlv 2 34 the influencer driven e commerce apparel company has been a big winner this year and the company s third quarter earnings report shows why revenue soared 62 and it should benefit from the reopening trends as more people feel comfortable going to parties music festivals and other live events for which they want to buy an outfit in this episode of beat and raise recorded on nov 4 fool contributors jeremy bowman and jason hall discuss revovle s third quarter results and what to look for 10 stocks we like better than revolve group inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and revolve group inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 jeremy bowman revolve group for those who don t know is an e commerce apparel company let me hit present they use influencers on instagram and social media as well as live events to promote the brand and the products they are targeting millennials and gen z the company has two brands revolve makes up the vast majority of the sales they tend to sell things that at a high price point think 200 dresses the company is also focused on occasionwear the stuff you d wear to weddings concert festivals parties stuff like that then forward which is luxury brands like versace balenciaga that sort of thing q3 results were pretty great revenue was up 62 percent or 58 percent from third quarter of 2019 to 244 1 million that easily cleared the bar to 14 7 million like i said with the new york times this is another company that scaled back marketing during the pandemic and not a lot of people were buying that going to events and that sort of thing but they scaled it back up in the third quarter by a pretty healthy margin there 150 percent to 47 million was the marketing that was the biggest expense line item as a result of that earnings per share actually fell from 27 cents to 22 cents that s still better than than the 13 cents they had two years ago and also beat analyst estimates at 14 cents so the company had forecast or told the market that that s what they were planning to do guidance they didn t give specific numbers but in the earnings call they said strong top line trends continued into october so think 60 percent revenue growth more of that but the company believes that holiday season you see a lot of promotional activity from competitors so they see top line growth slowing down they also raised their full year gross margin forecast to 54 5 percent from 54 percent and the stock finished up by 1 7 percent today their report was last night or was yesterday looking ahead they ipo d in 2019 so you get first year was rough but they ve really done well since the bottom of the pandemic then this is a stock that i own i like it i think they ve got a lot of tailwinds coming from the reopening of live events celebrations travel international travel is opening to the u s i think next week they just announced that kendall jenner who is the kardashian member current supermodel will be the creative director for forward she has a huge social media following so i think that s a good mix for the company a good fit i like the stock a lot because i think it s rare to find a good mix of growth and profitability but that s what they are doing their gross margins which are in the 55 percent range are really outstanding for a retailer especially a direct seller online i like that a lot too which gives them more money to spend on marketing and growing the brand i like the stock jason hall i think the key s here it s you think about those trends the reopening the big thing is events more events happening and i think also the international travel to the us and yeah that s next week that could be a real positive for these businesses the hard part of course i think it s worth mentioning when you re in fashion you have to lead the trends because if you miss the moment those great margins get smashed when you have to discount your items to sell but it does seem like they re certainly positioning themselves to remain a leader in fashion jeremy bowman yeah that s a good point about fashion you do see sometimes with these companies they re great one year and then they re not so hot the next they miss on style or something but i think revolve has a good model and i like what they re doing as far as the influencer based marketing and especially with the high price points i think that should help keep their margins pretty safe

menafn afp a pizzeria in president joe biden s hometown wilmington recently took sparkling water off the menu because it got so pricey managers figured no one would buy it at the car dealership that biden s presidential motorcade occasionally passes when he comes to town sales people have had trouble keeping new vehicles in stock while prices for their used models have climbed ever higher in recent months each day is a new day we re not really sure what s going to happen in the business or in the economy when we wake up in the morning said jim ursomarso vice president of union park automotive the wave of inflation that s swept the united states this year as covid 19 vaccines have helped businesses reopen and consumers spend has spared no part of the country not even wilmington the city that has provided a backdrop for much of biden s political career voters in the mid atlantic city gave biden seven times more votes than his predecessor donald trump in last year s election but business owners now fret as prices rise and public approval in his administration falls here in delaware he s loved but as time has gone by we have been lacking the reciprocation said serena kelley jefferson co owner of serena s soulfood whose mother cooked for biden and who recently took crab balls off her menu because they became too costly to serve profitably inflation spreads inflation was predicted to increase as the us economy recovered in 2021 but a wednesday report from the labor department showing the consumer price index last month experienced its biggest year on year gain in more than three decades was an unwelcome surprise this year s initial price spikes were most severe for products like used cars and airplane tickets the latest data however showed them extending into groceries and gasoline with ripple effects across the economy after the pandemic this was the worst thing that could happen to small businesses especially restaurants said gianni esposito whose eponymous pizza parlor has received biden repeatedly including on the day he began his latest presidential campaign in 2019 now you cannot find a lot of employees everything you have to buy it s 30 40 50 percent more expensive as of friday poll amalgamator fivethirtyeight put biden s approval rating at 42 8 percent lower than all other presidents at this point in their terms except for two i didn t vote for him but i wasn t against him like i am now said candice gronski 50 an accountant living just over the state line in pennsylvania who typically votes republican but felt like biden nonetheless failed to meet her expectations not to blame the us inflation rate has been muted for years and the latest price increases are driven by a mix of factors that might not have occurred without the pandemic supply chains are snarled worldwide thanks to the disruptions caused by covid 19 while energy costs have risen after global oil prices briefly went negative in 2020 in the united states american consumers are flush with cash and spending it with the help of three rounds of stimulus checks and an expanded government social safety net that both trump and biden approved but businesses haven t been able to keep up since many people who could work have decided not to meanwhile the global semiconductor shortage has slowed down production across a range of industries including the auto sector driving prices higher the increases may well hamper biden s push for an expansion of the country s social services costing 1 85 trillion over 10 years following the latest inflation report joe manchin a centrist senator whose vote is crucial to getting the bill through congress warned the threat posed by record inflation to the american people is not transitory and is instead getting worse as he filled up his car with gasoline that was upwards of a dollar more expensive per gallon then it was a year ago phil johnson said inflation wasn t affecting his life biden inherited a lot of this when he took office in january the 32 year old worker in the financial sector said the stimulus checks won t last forever and inflation can t stay at six percent
the spotsylvania school board s vote on monday to initiate the removal of sexually explicit books from its libraries was unconstitutional according to its attorney we received a legal brief from our school board attorney that basically said what we did was unconstitutional battlefield district representative baron braswell said friday braswell said he intends to put forward a motion to rescind the vote at the special called meeting monday i take our attorney s word on it and i don t want to do unconstitutional things he said the venue for monday s special meeting of the spotsylvania school board has been changed to the chancellor high school auditorium to accommodate the large number of community members who are expected to turn out in response to the board s vote last week in addition to directing staff to begin pulling sexually explicit material the board asked for a report on how many books have been received and on the process by which books are approved for inclusion in library collections the school board s 6 0 vote last week to proceed with the removal of books and the mention by two board members of a desire to see the books burn has made national news headlines in response students and community members have organized petitions and protests against the decision on friday courtland district representative rabih abuismail said his comment that he d like to see books like 33 snowfish a book by playwright and pulitzer prize finalist adam rapp about homeless teens attempting to escape from sexual abuse and drug addiction thrown on a fire was said out of frustration i should not have said it he said i want to be forthcoming with the notion that i misspoke anybody i offended i want them to know it was unintentional abuismail who at 24 is one of the youngest school board members ever elected in virginia said his concerns about books like 33 snowfish and call me by your name the second book that the parent of a riverbend high school mentioned by name in a complaint about books in the library do not come from the fact that they depict lgbtq characters but that their subject matter includes pedophilia we shouldn t remove the books because they have a gay character he said but any books that have pornographic material or pedophilia in them do not belong in the school system abuismail said it should be very clear what books are too sexually explicit to be in school libraries he said there is a place for that material in public libraries he said he is aware that children in spotsylvania schools may have experienced some of the same trauma described in 33 snowfish but that he believes funding counselors and resource officers to help these children is a better way for public schools to respond i feel like counselors in our schools need to have the resources to help have conversations with their parents help the parents to be there abuismail said i don t believe fictional books do it livingston district representative kirk twigg who said last week that he wants to see copies of removed books before we burn them did not respond to a request from the free lance star for further comment as of friday 33 snowfish was listed as temporarily out of stock on amazon com and thriftbooks com riverby books a used bookstore in downtown fredericksburg posted on its facebook page on wednesday that it will continue to stock any and all books banned by local schools now and forever and will loan a copy of a banned book to students for free i think its important that when somebody stands up and says that books should be banned an equal and greater number of people need to say oh no they shouldn t riverby books owner paul cymrot said thursday the folks who are talking about banning books and there have always been people talking about this may have some interesting questions that they re asking but banning books is not the answer to any question at all cymrot said he does struggle as a bookstore owner over decisions about whether or not to stock some books such as those dealing with nazi history but at the end of the day we ve always kind of trusted that it s not access to information that makes people make bad decisions it s lack of access to information local students are also speaking up to say they do not want books to be removed from their school libraries autumn rhea a student at riverbend high school started a change org petition to reverse the school board s decision the spotsylvania county school board has voted to remove any content containing mentioning or about sexually related content and this has now included violence related content as well rhea wrote in the petition narrative this criteria might take half or more of all our books off shelves in our libraries this includes classics like romeo and juliet no exit mythology texts and even the famous author margaret atwood please do not allow our education to be censored and banned as of friday afternoon the petition had 3 096 signatures another riverbend student liam thompson is organizing a protest against the removal of books from the library at the school on nov 17 students outside of spotsylvania are also speaking out about against censorship salome cook a senior at colonial forge high school in stafford circulated a petition in opposition to the spotsylvania board s decision and is organizing students to protest the issue we re talking about young adults here not children she said if parents want to control what their children read they can do that at home but not for entire communities she said she fears that a purge of books deemed sexually explicit could result in thousands of books being removed from the school library cook said she spoke to the stafford county board of supervisors in september to oppose their resolution condemning critical race theory and withholding funding from schools if it is tied to the theory she said she sees the two issues as being on a continuum it s the same sort of mindset control over what students are learning cook said a protest is being planned at chancellor high school prior to the school board meeting monday there is time for public comments during the meeting
menafn jordan times by bevis longstreth and connor chung cambridge this summer the intergovernmental panel on climate change released its latest report and the scariest part is just how unsurprising its contents were avoiding the worst the report made clear is still possible but only if humanity moves to a carbon neutral economy as quickly as possible this report said united nations secretary general antónio guterres must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels before they destroy our planet and yet with the planet on fire institutional finance is fanning the flames many of the world s most powerful financial actors continue to invest in the fossil fuel industry even as its actions predictably lead to massive economic disruption ecological catastrophe and social injustice until now they have gotten away with it but a new trend in the law is forcing institutional investors to decarbonise their portfolios or be held legally accountable harvard university is a case in point for a decade harvard s leaders had ignored calls from students faculty and alumni to divest the university s 53 billion endowment from the fossil fuel industry but recognising scientific and financial reality in september harvard finally pledged to divest from companies whose business models by relying on sustained carbon extraction are incompatible with a livable future given the need to de carbonise the economy and our responsibility as fiduciaries to make long term investment decisions that support our teaching and research mission wrote university president larry bacow we do not believe such investments are prudent emphasis added prudence in the statute governing harvard s endowment and many other institutional funds is a fundamental legal concept that establishes the care skill and caution with which a fund s investments must be administered prudence guides how a fund must be managed in order to serve its beneficiaries interests and there are significant penalties for violating it harvard s statement acknowledges the impossibility of complying with such a duty while investing in fossil fuels there are plenty of reasons why this might be the case for starters fossil fuel companies face existential uncertainty a tide of shifts regulations and litigation poses fundamental risks to the industry s interests while many of the carbon assets from which it derives its value will be rendered unburnable and stranded to meet international climate goals in addition the idea of seeking to profit from businesses whose dependence on carbon dioxide emissions serves to hasten climate change is repugnant to the notions of public purpose and social duty that responsible investors claim to uphold and would seem reason enough to seek broad de carbonisation in other words the fossil fuel industry s business model is now so misaligned with scientific and financial reality that betting on these companies or more broadly on the sort of businesses that materially depend on co2 emissions is not just misguided it is negligently wrong as a matter of law moreover the concept of prudence applies in similar form to any investor subject to the fiduciary standard thus binding essentially every academic endowment charitable fund and public and private pension fund that means trillions of dollars stand to be affected by harvard s recent divestment precedent in fact harvard s decision is already having ripple effects in the weeks since the announcement a number of other influential investors ranging from the endowments of boston university the university of minnesota and the macarthur foundation to the abp public pension fund in the netherlands europe s largest have likewise acted to align their money with the demands of prudence and climate action in doing so they join investors worth over 39 trillion many of whom evidence from markets suggests are already reaping financial gains from shedding fossil fuel stocks by basing harvard s decision on prudence bacow may well have intended to generate the sweeping impact that the university s divestment from fossil fuels predictably will achieve or perhaps it was a timely defensive move when bacow announced the decision the massachusetts attorney general was weighing whether to act on a legal complaint filed by students and other members of the harvard community along with the nonprofit climate asserting that the university s fossil fuel investments represented a breach of its charitable obligations whatever the reason harvard has given voice to a doctrine that befitting the urgency of the climate crisis should spread swiftly around the world and hasten similar decarbonisation decisions by fiduciaries everywhere it took a decade of struggle to get harvard to this point but now that it is finally taking steps toward living up to its global reputation as a leader other institutional investors must take notice in an age of climate crisis these actors mandate is to stand with the future or else risk ending up not just on the wrong side of history but also on the wrong side of the law bevis longstreth a former member of the us securities and exchange commission 1981 84 is a former partner at debevoise plimpton and taught financial law at columbia law school connor chung is a member of the fossil fuel divest harvard campaign copyright project syndicate 2021

wall street closed the week on an upbeat note on friday brushing off data showing consumer sentiment fell to a 10 year low amid rising inflation stocks gained ground for the second day amid a sense that investors may have overreacted to the inflation scare on wednesday analysts said the benchmark dow jones industrial average accelerated its early gain rising 0 5 percent to close at 36 100 31 the broad based s p 500 jumped 0 7 percent to 4 682 85 while the tech rich nasdaq composite index ended 0 8 percent higher at 15 860 96 the big news came when another multinational announced it was breaking up this time pharmaceutical giant johnson johnson a dow member and maker of the single shot covid 19 vaccine the company plans to split its consumer health arm that sells band aid and tylenol from its pharmaceutical division the latest in a growing trend of corporate spin offs that include general electric and japan s toshiba j j shares leaped initially and closed with a modest 1 2 percent gain meanwhile a survey from the university of michigan released on friday said that consumer sentiment fell to a 10 year low amid concerns that growing inflation is undermining purchasing power investors were spooked on wednesday following official data showing annual consumer price inflation hit a 30 year high which could force the federal reserve to hike interest rates but the economists say sentiment should recover once global supply snarls are resolved and consumers are unlikely to pull back on spending

shutterstock com buy your tree real or fake like right now folks so this is christmas retailers are urging shoppers to check their christmas shopping lists twice as early due to supply chain disruptions due in part to a so called worker shortage ahem the fair wage revolution the united states postal service and other shipping services have also been citing delivery delays that are expected to impact the holidays we can t help but wonder did christmas lose the war on christmas well this latest shortage might indicate that yes the most wonderful time of the year is about to get a little less jolly in michigan which is the third highest producer of christmas trees in the u s tree growers are warning of what can only be described as the grinch s wet dream a christmas tree shortage while it was severe weather that impacted growers in the pacific northwest this year that is not the case in michigan where growers are citing the great recession that has been a leading factor as to why michigan s tree numbers are low in 2021 as it takes anywhere from 6 10 years to grow trees to a marketable height and apparently when there s a housing crisis most people aside from predatory mortgage lenders aren t able to think about presents carols or christmas trees many tree farms closed up shop in 2008 and in the following years with no new farms replacing them immediately as a result christmas trees are shockingly spruce er we mean scarce this year and the scarcity might cause you guessed it a possible price surge some tree farms are most concerned about the number of 10 12 foot trees available which they say are going to be among the hardest to find this year not to be a total buzzkill but there are reports that artificial trees may also be hard to come by as a result of the supply and shipping delays in 2021 we re seeing a variety of trends influencing artificial and live christmas tree supply across the country and are encouraging consumers to find their tree early this year to avoid shortage impacts jami warner executive director of the american christmas tree association said on the organization s website if i can give one piece of advice to consumers right now it is to find and buy your christmas tree early last year the demand for live trees was so high doubling from years previous due to you know the fact that we were stuck in our homes that many local tree farms ran out of their stock weeks before the holiday so shop early and be prepared to drop some extra green on evergreens right now about 60 of the trees are already reserved the big trees the ones over 8 feet are the ones that are going to be extremely difficult to find one missouri tree farm told a local tv station i suspect thanksgiving weekend that ll be it another said in the segment the ramped up demand early buying and recession tied scarcity mean texans could find it harder than usual to score a holiday tree anyway let s not get so bummed out that we forget the true reason for the season the pogues
offering college course website indian school of business isb chief digital officer visit iim kozhikode iimk chief product officer programme visit iim lucknow iiml chief executive officer programme visit indian school of business isb chief technology officer visit people like us have to figure out whether the promoter really knows how to build a great franchise and to execute and generate 25 free cash flow growth most promoters in india do not know how to do that and hence one has to be very discerning about the new ipos says founder absolutely there is no reason why the country will run out of asian paints and titans of the world there are plenty of unlisted and newly listed companies which are first formalising what were hitherto fragmented industries they are formalising it and then consolidating right so what titan has done for jewellery over the last 25 years what pidilite has done since over the last 40 years you could argue that nykaa is doing it in cosmetics if you look at the next two to three years of ipos that are heading towards the market many are actually explicit plays on formalising what was hitherto informal and then consolidating for example say licious now the challenge in all this is the execution the theory about all this is very easy but to execute in india is to first formalise a deal with political lobbying from the informal sector than to consolidate so consolidating decade after decade and generating high amounts of cash flow is so tough that out of 5 000 listed companies barely 50 are able to do this that is what will happen to the new spate of ipos as well out of every 10 ipos one or perhaps two will be great franchises the other eight nine will be also runs that is where the discernment has to come in just because a new ipo is coming up does not make it a great investment people like us have to do the work and figure out whether the promoter really knows how to build a great franchise to generate cash flow to execute and generate 25 free cash flow growth most promoters in india do not know how to do that and hence one has to be very discerning about the new ipos i reckon one of 10 will go on to be great compounders master franchises but 9 out of 10 will fall by the wayside our research meeting takes place every friday a lot of those discussions are taking place in our research meeting today what we have already done over the last four five months is to build a sizable position in grindwell norton a leader in abrasives alongside carborundum grindwell norton has a hammerlock on an essential part of industrials which is abrasive material used for cutting it is used in auto industry and high tech engineering it has a great history of stable capital allocation we have already invested in grindwell norton we are looking for more investments in high quality industrials here is the challenge in investing in industrials you want to avoid companies which have heavy interplay with the government tendering sector as these could face working capital challenges the second thing is you want to avoid companies whose capital allocation history is irregular because naturally industrials are a volatile sector if the promoter has a poor track record of capital allocation you as a shareholder could lose your shirt and therefore you have to look for industrials which are largely a play on private sector capex and have a great history of rational stable capital allocation hence grindwell norton the other way we are trying to profit from the capex cycle upturn is by having an investment in a bank like axis bank axis bank is part of the workings of the capital portfolio and we are also seeing the demand for project finance is returning and we are hoping that a high quality private sector lender like axis bank under amitabh chaudhry s leadership can profit from that there is more to be done here but it is a sector where one has to tread carefully because it is populated by poor quality capital allocators and companies which get very dependent on government tendering this is a common misperception in my investing career i must have met dozens of indian investors who will tell you very sombrely that i know you bought infosys in 2000 and 2008 tak woh share price nahi aya the share price did not rise before 2008 and that sort of experience scars investors obviously there will be episodes like that the american stock market in 1967 stood exactly in the same place as it stood in 1983 so if from 1967 to 1983 the us stock market has not risen obviously there will be dozens of stocks which over that 17 year period made very little money for american investors all of these facts are very well known in india however there is another way to understand history which is just to look at data rationally i am going to give some numbers from chapter six of diamonds in the dust suppose over the last 10 years every year i had invested rs 100 in asian paints at the year s low so assume for a minute that i am god and i am buying asian paints at the year s low my 10 year return would be something around 27 because i am buying at the year s low but on the other hand assume that i buy asian paints on january 1 every year and assume for a minute i cannot time the market my 10 year return would be around 24 suppose i am the unluckiest investor in the world i buy asian paints every year at the year s high so 10 years in a row i buy asian paints at a year s high i would still compound at 19 we would get very similar results in pidilite titan divi s labs and other consistent compounders now why do we get that why are we able to make money from these franchises regardless of when you buy them because the underlying compounding in cash flows is around 25 and that is the analysis we have given you in chapter six of diamonds in the dust we have also done this sort of analysis for other indian stocks say l t bharti airtel and so on we have shown you that the ability to render timing irrelevant is only there if the underlying franchise grows the business at 25 year after year after year and that is why with our type of stock timing the pe multiple goes out of the window

st helena island s c ricky wright points to the bank of a creek to show one way his hometown has been affected by climate change many banks have eroded or collapsed and now some favorite fishing spots that were once on solid ground are reachable only by boat wright is part of the gullah geechee a group of black americans who descended from slaves and live off the coasts of north carolina south carolina georgia and florida the community that has endured for centuries is now imperiled by a combination of rising seas devouring their land higher temperatures changing how they farm and fish and destructive storms threatening their way of life i would say it s depressing to lose places like that especially if you grew up there said the 65 year old fisherman who noted other changes like the great white shark migrating to waters off st helena island it s scary the risks to the gullah geechee and other communities have intensified enough to raise a startling question should some populated places simply be abandoned to nature one strategy gaining traction is so called managed retreat which is the planned relocation of vulnerable people this is a huge issue by my reckoning there will be 30 million people who are displaced by midcentury and there will be mass migrations in the united states said stephen f eisenman director of strategy for the anthropocene alliance a climate and environmental justice group the biggest question is whether the retreats are planned and methodical or unplanned and chaotic the issue also raises concerns about economic fairness in this landscape that is home to hilton head island a popular destination for well heeled tourists visiting its many resorts while the gullah geechee are told to think about moving the hotels stay open and industry gets new permits said harriet festing co founder of the alliance so there s a lot of distrust of government intention and the messages that are coming to them forms of managed retreat have existed in the u s since at least 1989 when the federal emergency management agency began buying properties in flood prone areas parts of louisiana wisconsin and illinois have used planned relocation to try to save communities from flooding and rising seas with help from government buyouts some communities simply move to nearby areas that are less prone to disaster others migrate to different parts of the country or different countries altogether but buyouts aren t the only component other strategies include restoring habitats replacing concrete laden areas with green space and using zoning laws to limit development in troubled places parts of florida california and new york could someday need to use the same strategy imagine new york city over the next hundred years shifting its density north it could happen said a r siders an assistant professor at the university of delaware s disaster research center one reason why the idea is met with resistance is because of its name managed retreat is too technical for some and too defeatist for others proponents are starting to adopt other language including planned relocation and climate migration but regardless of what it s called more and more communities have considered some version of the idea especially siders said in the aftermath of major disasters such as hurricane sandy the concept pushes us to do better adaptation she said but it s also a challenge because it scares people they get scared that they re going to be forced out of their home in a study published in science advances in 2019 siders and other researchers found that fema s buyout program was more likely to help wealthier more densely populated counties but even within those communities fema buyouts were concentrated in less affluent less densely populated areas with lower english proficiency and more racial diversity environmental activist hilton kelley has been trying for years to get federal assistance to relocate himself and members of his community from port arthur texas port arthur is closer to the gulf coast than much of houston and both communities have been ravaged by hurricanes over the last 20 years but houston has received more attention and more money for relocation because of its vastly larger population he said this town has been devastated he said but we ve never gotten our fair shake when it comes to giving support to vulnerable populations particularly the low lying communities of color many people in port arthur are ready to relocate if help were available and they could take the lead in planning the move kelley said but that s not the case in other cities tiny desoto missouri has been hit with destructive flash floods four times in the last eight years after a particularly bad flood in 2016 susan sherrow lilley started organizing her neighbors to accept buyouts but they only seemed interested in the immediate aftermath of a flood it hasn t flooded in five years and people are very comfortable now thinking that it s not going to again but it will she said lilley and other concerned residents have organized 22 homes and one business to apply for fema money but that s only about a third of the structures that were recommended for buyouts by the army corps of engineers she said they need buyouts for everyone because even when people move to higher ground their abandoned homes often get bought fixed up and put back on the market and then the people go through a flood and it s just this vicious cycle over and over again she said a recent world bank report predicts that 200 million people around the globe will be forced to move because of climate change by 2050 other countries have already begun planning massive relocations including jakarta and the marshall islands the process is extremely complex and there is a high risk that it leaves communities even worse off than they were before said ezekiel simperingham global migration lead for the international federation of the red cross and red crescent and red crescent societies among the gullah geechee big storms have become familiar at least seven named storms have struck the region of the southeast u s where they live including hurricane matthew in 2016 irma in 2017 and dorian in 2019 thomas mitchell a crabber who lives on st helena island comes from a family that catches fish shrimp and oysters but oysters have been hard to come by because they need cold weather to survive and the warm seasons have become longer the oysters don t come until it s cold and it doesn t get cold anymore he said but the idea of abandoning their historical home is a nonstarter for many of the gullah geechee the only way i m going to relocate is when i meet my demise wright said marquetta goodwine a community leader on the island known as queen quet said the gullah geechee are inextricably linked to the land i m not running i don t come from the stock of people who run she said i come from the stock of people who fight people who hold on people who stand for what they believe in and we are rooted in this soil as he waited for a fish to tug on his bait at the creek wright echoed those sentiments when we were kids our parents taught us if you ever have to run anywhere don t run away from home make sure you run and come home he said and so that s instilled in me and this is home the associated press health and science

take a look at the big numbers from the online apparel seller revolve group rvlv 2 34 the influencer driven e commerce apparel company has been a big winner this year and the company s third quarter earnings report shows why revenue soared 62 and it should benefit from the reopening trends as more people feel comfortable going to parties music festivals and other live events for which they want to buy an outfit in this episode of beat and raise recorded on nov 4 fool contributors jeremy bowman and jason hall discuss revovle s third quarter results and what to look for 10 stocks we like better than revolve group inc when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and revolve group inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of november 10 2021 jeremy bowman revolve group for those who don t know is an e commerce apparel company let me hit present they use influencers on instagram and social media as well as live events to promote the brand and the products they are targeting millennials and gen z the company has two brands revolve makes up the vast majority of the sales they tend to sell things that at a high price point think 200 dresses the company is also focused on occasionwear the stuff you d wear to weddings concert festivals parties stuff like that then forward which is luxury brands like versace balenciaga that sort of thing q3 results were pretty great revenue was up 62 percent or 58 percent from third quarter of 2019 to 244 1 million that easily cleared the bar to 14 7 million like i said with the new york times this is another company that scaled back marketing during the pandemic and not a lot of people were buying that going to events and that sort of thing but they scaled it back up in the third quarter by a pretty healthy margin there 150 percent to 47 million was the marketing that was the biggest expense line item as a result of that earnings per share actually fell from 27 cents to 22 cents that s still better than than the 13 cents they had two years ago and also beat analyst estimates at 14 cents so the company had forecast or told the market that that s what they were planning to do guidance they didn t give specific numbers but in the earnings call they said strong top line trends continued into october so think 60 percent revenue growth more of that but the company believes that holiday season you see a lot of promotional activity from competitors so they see top line growth slowing down they also raised their full year gross margin forecast to 54 5 percent from 54 percent and the stock finished up by 1 7 percent today their report was last night or was yesterday looking ahead they ipo d in 2019 so you get first year was rough but they ve really done well since the bottom of the pandemic then this is a stock that i own i like it i think they ve got a lot of tailwinds coming from the reopening of live events celebrations travel international travel is opening to the u s i think next week they just announced that kendall jenner who is the kardashian member current supermodel will be the creative director for forward she has a huge social media following so i think that s a good mix for the company a good fit i like the stock a lot because i think it s rare to find a good mix of growth and profitability but that s what they are doing their gross margins which are in the 55 percent range are really outstanding for a retailer especially a direct seller online i like that a lot too which gives them more money to spend on marketing and growing the brand i like the stock jason hall i think the key s here it s you think about those trends the reopening the big thing is events more events happening and i think also the international travel to the us and yeah that s next week that could be a real positive for these businesses the hard part of course i think it s worth mentioning when you re in fashion you have to lead the trends because if you miss the moment those great margins get smashed when you have to discount your items to sell but it does seem like they re certainly positioning themselves to remain a leader in fashion jeremy bowman yeah that s a good point about fashion you do see sometimes with these companies they re great one year and then they re not so hot the next they miss on style or something but i think revolve has a good model and i like what they re doing as far as the influencer based marketing and especially with the high price points i think that should help keep their margins pretty safe

a pizzeria in president joe biden s hometown wilmington recently took sparkling water off the menu because it got so pricey managers figured no one would buy it at the car dealership that biden s presidential motorcade occasionally passes when he comes to town sales people have had trouble keeping new vehicles in stock while prices for their used models have climbed ever higher in recent months each day is a new day we re not really sure what s going to happen in the business or in the economy when we wake up in the morning said jim ursomarso vice president of union park automotive the wave of inflation that s swept the united states this year as covid 19 vaccines have helped businesses reopen and consumers spend has spared no part of the country not even wilmington the city that has provided a backdrop for much of biden s political career voters in the mid atlantic city gave biden seven times more votes than his predecessor donald trump in last year s election but business owners now fret as prices rise and public approval in his administration falls here in delaware he s loved but as time has gone by we have been lacking the reciprocation said serena kelley jefferson co owner of serena s soulfood whose mother cooked for biden and who recently took crab balls off her menu because they became too costly to serve profitably inflation spreads inflation was predicted to increase as the us economy recovered in 2021 but a wednesday report from the labor department showing the consumer price index last month experienced its biggest year on year gain in more than three decades was an unwelcome surprise this year s initial price spikes were most severe for products like used cars and airplane tickets the latest data however showed them extending into groceries and gasoline with ripple effects across the economy after the pandemic this was the worst thing that could happen to small businesses especially restaurants said gianni esposito whose eponymous pizza parlor has received biden repeatedly including on the day he began his latest presidential campaign in 2019 now you cannot find a lot of employees everything you have to buy it s 30 40 50 percent more expensive as of friday poll amalgamator fivethirtyeight put biden s approval rating at 42 8 percent lower than all other presidents at this point in their terms except for two i didn t vote for him but i wasn t against him like i am now said candice gronski 50 an accountant living just over the state line in pennsylvania who typically votes republican but felt like biden nonetheless failed to meet her expectations not to blame the us inflation rate has been muted for years and the latest price increases are driven by a mix of factors that might not have occurred without the pandemic supply chains are snarled worldwide thanks to the disruptions caused by covid 19 while energy costs have risen after global oil prices briefly went negative in 2020 in the united states american consumers are flush with cash and spending it with the help of three rounds of stimulus checks and an expanded government social safety net that both trump and biden approved but businesses haven t been able to keep up since many people who could work have decided not to meanwhile the global semiconductor shortage has slowed down production across a range of industries including the auto sector driving prices higher the increases may well hamper biden s push for an expansion of the country s social services costing 1 85 trillion over 10 years following the latest inflation report joe manchin a centrist senator whose vote is crucial to getting the bill through congress warned the threat posed by record inflation to the american people is not transitory and is instead getting worse as he filled up his car with gasoline that was upwards of a dollar more expensive per gallon then it was a year ago phil johnson said inflation wasn t affecting his life biden inherited a lot of this when he took office in january the 32 year old worker in the financial sector said the stimulus checks won t last forever and inflation can t stay at six percent

zealand will meet its new emissions targets without investing heavily into international a highly ambitious pledge to cut emissions could cripple new zealand s agricultural sector and see billions of taxpayer dollars spent overseas it is unclear how new zealand will meet its new emissions targets without investing heavily into international carbon markets on the eve of the 2021 united nations climate change conference cop26 the government pledged to reduce new zealand s greenhouse emissions by 50 by 2030 new zealand has also signed up to the global methane pledge and the international just transition declaration prime minister jacinda ardern says new zealand s enhanced contribution to the global effort to fight climate change now represents our fair share however the 50 target goes beyond new zealand s fair share and will cost the country billions of dollars the national party says it is true that other countries have announced similar target numbers to this but we need to consider that new zealand already has high levels of renewable electricity production and higher levels of agricultural emissions this makes a 50 per cent target much harder for new zealand to achieve says climate change spokesperson stuart smith he says the previous 2030 target of 30 was already ambitious due to new zealand having almost 50 per cent of our emissions from agriculture and having one of the highest levels of renewable energy in the world this target was incredibly challenging for new zealand to achieve to put the reduction of 50 per cent of emissions in just nine years in perspective it requires new zealand to reduce emissions by about 6 per cent per year every year from now until 2030 it is estimated that global fossil fuel use fell about 6 per cent in 2020 due to the covid lockdowns not only would new zealand need to achieve this level of reduction next year we would then have to double that reduction the following year then another 6 per cent the next and on and on it goes new zealand is not off to a very good start either smith points out that despite a climate change nuclear free moment a climate emergency and now this target greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise and record amounts of imported coal are being burned at huntly to keep the power on what advice has the government received on the ability for agriculture to meet such a target without large cuts in stock numbers what advice has the government received any sector of the economy can reduce emissions by 50 per cent in just nine years smith says there are major concerns new zealand is likely to need to lean heavily into international carbon markets there is no sense in setting a target that over reaches and simply signs new zealand up to a huge bill as we buy units from overseas most kiwis won t thank the government for signing them up to a huge carbon markets bill the government says it is following the science but the latest ipcc report states methane need only reduce 0 3 per cent per year this target goes miles beyond that it is disappointing the government hasn t supported our farmers by reflecting this science and taking a split gas target smith says national s energy and resources spokesperson barbara kuriger says the agricultural sector is holding new zealand s economy together trying to pay back the covid debt at a time we cut cattle and sheep numbers is a scary thought act party leader david seymour is also concerned for the agricultural sector following the announcement how are they planning to do this is it herd reductions or is it through new technologies when will the government bring farmers into this conversation it s their livelihoods at stake joining a broad methane target is counterproductive if it ends up harming new zealand livelihoods because we already have the most carbon friendly dairy sector on the planet seymour says we should set a cap on total emissions in line with the actual reductions of our trading partners then allow new zealanders to import high quality foreign carbon credits so we pay the world price not an artificial price the realistic outcome of this mad plan is that people will eat less new zealand dairy beef and lamb instead supporting farmers offshore who are less efficient federated farmers president andrew hoggard says in an effort to reduce emissions without simply cutting production and shipping the emissions overseas new zealand farmers are currently bumping their heads on the ceiling of what is currently technologically and regulatorily possible in relation to agriculture the methane pledge talks about abatement of agricultural emissions through technology innovation as well as incentives and partnerships with farmers new zealand has been doing this for years what we need now is for the government to provide a framework that enables farmers to get on with implementing some of the new smart ghg reducing technology some of which has been developed right here in nz says hoggard new zealand farmers are the most emissions efficient farmers in the world and the growing global population is demanding more of the products we export such as beef lamb and milk we should not simply shrink our way to emissions reductions our farmers and taxpayers are already having to sit back and watch nz developed ge ryegrass being trialed in the united states because of unworkable red tape in new zealand this cutting edge technology has the potential to deliver reductions in methane and nitrous oxide while also being more resistant to extremes in weather the methane inhibitor bovaer also known as 3nop has been given the regulatory green light in brazil and chile but farmers in new zealand are still waiting new zealand produces enough food for 40 million people but its co2 per capita is below average new zealand s gross carbon dioxide emissions in 2018 were 7 5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent co2 e per capita which is below the annex i average of 10 9 tonnes of co2 e per capita new zealand s gross emissions contribute to approximately 0 17 per cent of the world s gross emissions many scientists and climate experts are pleased with the government s announcement however some don t think the 50 target goes far enough the new target is clearly an improvement on new zealand s previous target but the government needs to be absolutely clear that it falls well short of doing our fair share says the university of auckland s dr rhys jones an analysis by oxfam nz published last year a fair 2030 target for aotearoa found that much more substantial reductions would be required for new zealand to play its part in global efforts to limit warming to 1 5 degrees c they found that to achieve this with no or limited overshoot would require at least an 80 reduction from 1990 levels by 2030 or at least a 99 reduction if we account for our historical responsibility however it s unlikely that a government would commit to cuts of that magnitude we therefore need to do everything possible to make up for our shameful inability to do our fair share such as massively increasing climate finance contributions to low income countries despite setting the goal of 50 emissions reduction by 2030 the government has yet to say how this will be achieved its emissions reduction plan is not due until next year consultation on the plan is open until 11 59pm 24 november 2021 a copy of the discussion document is available here a snapshot of the discussion document is available here content sourced from scoop co nz original url

market stalls ahead of options expiration unlike recent weeks this past week saw the market begin to consolidate recent gains ahead of options expiration next friday however as we pullbacks have occurred with regularity interestingly as noted by the vertical lines in the chart below these pullbacks occur near option expirations given the options expire next week is there more volatility coming maybe as noted in the chart above the macd signal is very close to triggering a short term sell signal from an elevated level and the market remains very overbought furthermore as noted last week our money flow sell signal triggered a sell signal the combination of the sell signals very light volume and weak breadth certainly warrants some caution heading into the coming week does this mean the market via chart above will experience a significant contraction a pullback to the short term moving averages would not be surprising and would encompass about a 3 4 drawdown what would cause such a correction i don t know however we are entering the mutual fund distribution season where fund managers need to distribution capital gains dividends and interest given that most funds are carrying very low cash levels they will likely have to sell holdings to make those distributions however the good news is that a pullback would set the market up for the traditional end of year santa claus rally but at the moment a correction is the furthest thing from investors minds so while price inflation may be a problem there is inflation in irrational exuberance as of late inflation in irrational exuberance in our we touched on signs of inflation in irrational exuberance to wit the s p 500 buying stampede continues pushing stock market valuations to extremes as of friday the shiller pe valuation rose above 40 current valuations now dwarf that seen in 1929 and only bettered by the latter months of 1999 of course valuations are a terrible market timing device but they tell you much about investor psychology and future returns however there are other measures also supporting inflation in irrational exuberance for example the chart below from themarketear shows the price of to tesla nasdaq shares in recent weeks the surge in both is a good proxy of the inflation of irrational exuberance and a disregard for risk furthermore as retail investors pile into equity risk sentiment trader also put out two gauges on wednesday showing similar measures of inflation in irrational exuberance reaching problematic levels the panic euphoria model constructed using a methodology described by citigroup in public posts has rebounded and is once again above its euphoria threshold and the bear market probability model described in interviews by goldman sachs has soared to one of the highest levels in 50 years as they conclude and with which we agree choppiness among stocks within indexes pushed the composite model below 50 in late september now enthusiasm is back and the model is above 90 challenging the highest readings in 23 years the chart shows us that the s p 500 s annualized return when the composite model was above 80 was a miserly 9 2 when the model was above 85 accounting for about 2 of all days since 1998 that return was a horrid 15 6 such is why being a bit more defensive near term may be well advised what driving and portfolio management have in common our newer readers require a bit of a chronology in mid august we discussed a similar situation where markets got very elevated and we needed to reduce risk in our portfolios then following a 5 decline in the market that reduced the momentum chase we added exposure to wit with the markets now deeply oversold on a short term basis we deployed some of our cash throughout the week to rebalance the portfolio toward normal allocation levels we don t expect a tremendous amount of upside given the ongoing weakness of market internals but a retest of previous highs is not out of the question importantly notice that we state decrease and increase such does not mean being all in or all out portfolio and risk management is a process of making small moves and adjusting for changes in the market as they come it is much like driving a car therefore when the vehicle is moving you are constantly making minor adjustments to keep the vehicle in the proper lane accelerating or decelerating as needed and paying attention to the constant flow of signals from all around you most of this we do subconsciously but the actions all ensure two things a reduction of risk getting to our destination safely investing is much the same paying attention to the warning signs adjusting the speed of the portfolio and keeping the allocation in the proper lane can ensure safe arrival at your destination not doing so can have very damaging consequences we are driving a little slower having our foot over the brake and adding a bit of liability insurance to our portfolio as warnings rise one of those warnings is the fed s choice to ignore inflation inflation is surging on wednesday the latest print of the consumer price index came in much hotter than expected the chart below shows 3 measures of inflation less food and energy and variable cpi less healthcare and rent the surge in inflationary pressures is evident with core cpi surging to 6 2 on an annualized basis however for most americans their food and energy consumption is something they deal with every week therefore the impact on discretionary incomes is far more insidious when those get included as my colleague doug kass noted my eyeballs tell me inflation is running a fair bit hotter than what is being reported now i think the average person would also think that based on their buying experiences today furthermore most individuals have their rent or mortgage payments under a contractual agreement for a certain period the same goes for healthcare costs as premiums stay stable under a contractual term the variable cpi shows what inflation looks like from a consumer s point of view at 8 5 it is not surprising consumers are getting upset consequently the surge in variable cpi is even more problematic when wages fail to keep up with inflationary pressures therefore despite headlines of rising wage pressures real wages are currently 2 below the annual pace of inflation so again the implications on economic growth and the market are not tremendous the fed has to be sweating as discussed in the choice of ignoring inflation in hopes of getting back to historically low unemployment rates may be problematic ignoring the inflation risk is likely unwise previous spikes in the inflation spread aligned with weaker economic growth stock market contractions or crashes when it comes to full employment ran some analysis suggesting the fed may be overly confident in its abilities to support economic growth the u6 unemployment rate is not as well followed as the u3 shown above u6 includes those unemployed in the u3 number but also those underemployed and discouraged from seeking jobs jerome powell thinks the u6 figure is a more credible indicator given the pandemic related dislocations as shown below the u6 rate is 0 4 below the average of the five years leading to the pandemic as michael concludes the fed has already met its mandate of full employment however they are ignoring inflation to support asset valuations that the fed recently admitted were excessive prices of risky assets keep rising making them more susceptible to perilous crashes if the economy takes a turn for the worse asset prices remain vulnerable to significant declines should investor risk sentiment deteriorate progress on containing the virus disappoint or the economic recovery stalls bloomberg ignoring the surging rates of inflation to support asset prices may result in a policy mistake that leads to the one outcome the fed is trying to avoid a stock market crash of course such would not be the first time the fed s hubris exceeded their grasp and led to unwanted outcomes it is likely to be no different this time however i am sure the fed is starting to sweat portfolio update given the inflation in irrational exuberance in the short term we have been taking profits and rebalancing portfolio risk over the last two weeks as we noted previously we took profits we did not sell the entirety of our position therefore our portfolio allocations are near fully invested however our cash position is growing as the market becomes more aggressively extended significantly not only did we reduce our exposure in some of the more grossly extended holdings such as nvidia nasdaq advanced micro devices nasdaq and ford nyse but also ishares 20 year treasury bond etf nasdaq bonds over recent weeks after increasing the duration of our fixed income allocation tlt also became overbought and triggered a short term money flow sell signal the current inflation print pushed bond prices lower yields higher for now i suspect that we will get an opportunity to increase our tlt holdings at lower prices within the next few weeks with slightly increased cash levels we are watching the current sell signals develop as we head into options expiration next week since march retests of the 20 and 50 day moving averages were triggered by the rollover of options considering there is a record number of call options we could see a volatility spike during expiration as such we did add a small volatility hedge to our portfolio should such an event occur in the meantime we remain a bit more bullishly biased than we like however sometimes being uncomfortable is just part of the investment process

newsletter grace the woman behind frenchic has revealed how she turned her passion for rescuing old furniture from landfill into a booming 16 million business loved by a huge online community of diyers pamela gruhn from huddersfield had a successful career in motorsports marketing before running her husband s chiropractor clinic but it was her hobby where she found most joy aside from her day job which took her to live in spain and the us for more than 10 years before moving to surrey 21 years ago pam would spend her weekends scouring car boots charity shops and vintage markets read more inside catherine tyldesley s stunning home as she auctions off her treasured possessions she would look to transform unwanted corner cabinets and old bureau tables and paint them to give them a new lease of life which she found was a therapeutic pastime by 2014 pam noticed a shift in consumer habits with shoppers being more mindful of recycling and upcycling rather than buying brand new with her home filled with diy transformations she began selling her creations to a facebook business page and was inundated with customers asking her to hunt down specific items to paint them but one thing she couldn t get her hands on was a furniture paint that she thought was good enough my passion was always and still is saving furniture from landfill pam told the manchester evening news image supplied people didn t go to charity shops it wasn t popular back then but i hit the right era when that was being reversed i absolutely love rummaging through car boots and flea markets because of the wonderful things you can find and painting was an easy way to bring a piece up to date and on trend but i couldn t find a chalk paint that ticked all the boxes for me pam wanted a paint that was easy to use kind to the environment and could be used on children s toys and so decided to produce one herself that ticked all her boxes using a 15 000 pension nest egg she found a factory and chemist to develop her own product certified child safe with no odour and with minimal vocs volatile organic compounds she had five pallets delivered to her garage and started work at her dining table phoning and emailing businesses about her new paint the frenchic fan forum on facebook grew and grew with members showing off their upcycling projects giving inspiration and advice to others people might think they can t paint then they watch people on the forum and then once they start they re hooked pam said you get a real sense of pride when you ve completed a piece now with more than one million frenchic fans online pam credits the social media platform for a part in building her successful brand but it s also centred around her dedicated stockists of which seven years later there are now 850 across four continents i got a bit lucky there pam said whose american husband packed in a 20 year long career to join her with frenchic and is now the chief operating officer facebook hadn t been around that long when i started and i hopped on with my page and around that time people were sitting up and taking notice and looking at facebook all the time i then had the grit and determination to see it through facebook gave a big lending hand in building frenchic as a company pam says she s a champion of the independent retailer and every stockist that joins the company receives training on the products and a push on social media to direct customers to their pages what starts off as an addition to a business soon becomes an anchor and a core part of the frenchic family we are really behind them pam explained nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing my stockists do well during the coronavirus lockdowns frenchic hq which now has more than 30 staff between the surrey factory and office removed stock from the main website to ensure stockists had the supplies they needed for click and collect orders and local deliveries they went back into their shops in great shape pam added as the country was told to stay at home families up and down the country turned to diy fixing up their properties and posting before and after photos on social media pam says whilst the company was doing well before lockdown it grew five times over when people discovered frenchic over the summer it was like a revelation she continued they couldn t do much else but paint furniture and they were painting everywhere and anything it sticks to all sorts of surfaces from plaster to metal to glass since those first five pallets we ve grown exponentially both in product and popularity we re a one stop shop frenchic which received the queen s award for enterprise in the innovation category for their lazy range in 2020 also boasts al fresco products which can be used on pvc doors and paint that can also be coated on sinks and fridges there are thousands of frenchic doors around the world that have saved that door from being replaced or going to landfill just from one small pot pam said and it s not just furniture she s managed to save but the growing online community of users who have claimed upcycling with frenchic had been a lifeline for them during the pandemic we received so many messages emails calls thanking us for bringing out a product they could use to help their mental health situation pam said reflecting on how her idea of a dream paint has blossomed she said i remember when we had the first 100 stockists then 200 and it kept growing and i just rolled along with it now i think how did this happen i didn t expect it but how wonderful is it it s great seeing people do well in business because of it and really enjoying using the paint that s fantastic sign up to the men email newsletters to get the latest on sport news what s on and more by following this

as we are all very aware the cop 26 event in glasgow has been going on over the past two weeks highlighting all the issues that mankind has been held responsible for unless we do something then a lot of land is going to be in the sea and temperatures are going to rise to a degree that will see large areas of dried up wasteland with no crops being able to be grown the upshot of it all is that unless we change we will all be in some sort of bother in the future unless these problems are tackled head on read more the gleaner high premiums for next year s malting barley the past seven years have been the hottest on record and the rate at which sea levels are rising is accelerating the average global temperature from 2002 to 2021 was 1 01 c above pre industrial levels while 2021 itself has averaged 1 09 c higher scientists are warning us that the world is on course to warm by a catastrophic 3 c and this why they are trying to find a way to limit the temperature rise to 1 5 c this year is likely to be the fifth to seventh hottest year since records began in 1850 and in 2015 the average temperature was 1 18 c above the average and last year it was the hottest on record at 1 28 c above the average of 1 09 c sea levels have increased from an average of 2 1mm a year between 1993 2000 to 4 4mm between 2013 2021 mostly due to the faster loss of ice from glaciers and ice sheets this has all led to global weather issues canada as well as other countries suffered from extreme drought and very low yields this past year and that has seen some futures prices reaching contract highs over this past week or so november 2021 liffee feed wheat futures have been up to 218 35 and currently stand at 213 25 while may 2022 futures were at 227 10 but now back to 222 per tonne having risen every day from october 21 to november 3 current nearby and november 2022 new crop futures prices are near the highs experienced in 2012 when nearby new crop november 2013 peaked at 225 45 and 199 per tonne respectively on november 29 2012 but from that point prices started to trail off the reasons for high prices at that time were export restrictions from ukraine strong global demand and drought in the us impacting winter wheat crop development these issues are similar today except that the export restrictions are in russia wheat opening stocks in the uk are at their lowest level this century and the outlook continues to be tight throughout 2021 22 however the total availability of wheat next year is forecast up by 18 from last year and increased production will counteract reduced opening stocks and imports will be down on last year two bioethanol plants in the uk are also due to come back on stream early next year and this will see increased wheat usage on top of increased demand for animal feed though total usage by flour millers is currently forecast as similar to last year the current spot high prices of wheat and rapeseed will be helping offset the impacts of inflation and this could have greater implications for the cereal and oilseed enterprises for the 2022 23 marketing year in the last year from september 2020 to september 2021 november 2021 wheat futures have risen by 48 60 per tonne and paris rapeseed futures for november 2021 are up by 216 45 per tonne over the same period estimated farming input costs for a cereal and oilseed rape farm enterprise have increased by 19 34 due mainly to fuel and fertiliser price increases over the same period red diesel increased from 46 8ppl to 67 12ppl and increasing so strong energy and natural gas prices will contribute to inflationary input costs for harvest 2022 but new crop prices are not nearly as high as the current spot highs with november 2022 futures prices for example currently at 196 50 per tonne brent crude oil prices dropped to 81 99 per barrel last week which is the lowest since october 7 and if this continues it could reduce global demand for ethanol and biodiesel however us ethanol production at the end of october was 1106m barrels per day and the weekly total was the second highest on record wheat futures prices have risen higher by 25 since early september due to weather issues in canada us and russia reducing output it is important to see how the harvest in australia progresses as the 2021 22 global wheat stocks are 35 of annual stock to use demand the lowest since 2015 16 australia is looking at a wheat production of 31 5m tonnes or its third highest on record but canada is forecasting its smallest crop since 2007 08 at 21m tonnes which would be 40 down on last year russia has now forecasted a wheat crop of around 72m tonnes previously reported as being around 81m tonnes and again this is due to the impact of dry weather affecting yield potential the prolonged dry period is already having an impact on next year s crop with delays in planting in many regions in russia already reporting that only 70 of their winter crop has been planted due to having only received less than half of the average rainfall that is also the case in the ukraine the eu was expecting to have exported 11m tonnes of wheat by the end of october and ukraine was quoted as having exported 12 4m tonnes over the same period there appears to be no slowing of international wheat demand as saudi arabia confirmed a purchase of 1 3m tonnes double that expected this was the catalyst for a further futures price rally russia s export tax is set to rise again from november 10 to 69 90 per tonne and this is contributing to slower exports from russia further reducing the availably of wheat to the world market last year the southern hemisphere experienced a lot of adverse weather but rain has helped crops this time argentina is looking to produce 19 8m tonnes of wheat up from 17 6m tonnes last year which could release exports of 13 5m tonnes maize planting in argentina is almost 30 complete and will see a crop of 55m tonnes which would be 5m tonnes up on last year and there is some rain forecast which will be welcome the us soyabean harvest is going well with the usda reporting 73 harvested as of october 24 which is ahead of their five year average there have been continual price rises for oilseed rape with new contract highs again and prices are around 50 higher than they were a month ago during the last four weeks eu prices rose by 8 but us soya had not moved meaning that soyabeans are currently worth 180 less than osr and puts the price of rape oil over soya oil at a premium of 255 per tonne canada is still coming to terms with its very low canola osr production and the crop is also affected by low oil content at 41 2 which is 2 1 lower than last year even with the drop in production in canada this year s seven major oilseeds will see a tonnage of 599 7m tonnes or an increase of 24 6m tonnes which would be 6m tonnes more than is consumed resulting in a build up in stocks the uk barley market is currently quiet with lower demand at present even with uk prices competitive for the export trade both sea freight and road transport issues remain difficult to organize due to a lack of available ships and lorries uk malting barley prices have eased this past week but price premium remains in place and we have the cheapest barley in europe but again transport issues are limiting movement the uk barley balance is 11 tighter than last season at 2m tonnes due to a smaller crop even despite a drop in animal feed demand because of the smaller price discount to wheat at the end of october spot ex farm barley prices were just 11 60 below those for feed wheat on average across the uk last season barley averaged 44 per tonne below wheat and at times the gap was as large as 54 30 per tonne as a result barley accounted for 40 of all grain such as wheat barley maize and oats being fed to animals this year the smaller price gap will cut the amount of barley fed to animals and at current oat prices we could see an increase in the amount of oats used in feed rations last season 397 000 tonnes of oats were used which is the highest since 1999 2000 another large oat crop this year amounting to 1 1m tonnes means ex farm feed oats are currently 46 40 per tonne cheaper than feed barley and 58 cheaper than feed wheat so these discounts are likely to incentivise oat use in animal feed if possible on the costs side at the beginning of september ammonium nitrate was trading at around 360 per tonne and now is trading at around 600 700 per tonne nitrogen products continue to rise and urea demand from india has remained strong russia has imposed an export quota on ammonium nitrate liquid uan and urea which is putting further pressure on nitrogen supplies and the current situation was also not helped by two uk fertiliser plants closing in september fertiliser is a large part of the variable costs when growing maize in the us and costs are much higher for maize than soya fertiliser prices have also been rising in the us so there are concerns that us farmers will cut back on the maize area in favour of soya over the past five years the us maize crop has accounted for 17 of global grain production and since june the cost of urea in illinois has risen by 60 which means that variable costs will rise more for maize than soybeans
what is a booster dose a booster dose is given to those already vaccinated to help shore up their immunity levels after a period of time so babies for instance are given their childhood vaccines and booster doses for life long protection against polio measles and so on but the world is presently gripped in a dilemma over booster doses for the covid 19 vaccine as studies show declining antibody protection within about six months of the mrna vaccines for instance and a booster dose could then help restore the vaccine s effectiveness in creating antibodies in an individual who shows declining immunity against the virus is there conclusive research on the need for it research calls for a nuanced approach public health experts say a third dose may be necessary as part of the primary vaccination in vulnerable populations who may not have adequate antibody protection despite the first two doses vaccines are known to be less efficient in the elderly for example in creating an adequate antibody protection against the virus people who are immunocompromised because of their treatment for cancer or those who may have had an organ transplant and so on are defined as vulnerable is it allowed in india there is no decision yet but there is a clamour for the same from several public health voices especially for frontline workers essential workers etc who would got their vaccines in january february this year and may be witnessing waning immunity the declining protection could endanger the lives of the frontline staff as they continue to remain engaged in covid 19 linked duty and india is reported to have stocks that may be running close to its expiry date so this cannot be exported instead of running the risk of it being wasted public health voices are suggesting they be used as boosters for frontline staff and high risk populations have other countries allowed it yes countries like israel have gone right ahead with their boosters campaign and the united states and europe are on the verge of the same this comes as studies show declining immunity protection from vaccines six months on and add to this the highly transmissible delta variants and a large number of unvaccinated population as well europe for instance is seeing a surge of cases in countries like germany that have a reasonably vaccinated population and this is being seen by some as grounds for a booster dose just months ago though the us food and drug administration s advisory panel had advised boosters only for high risk populations should the booster be the same as the original vaccine countries are going with a mix and match approach and companies are studying their vaccines in the role of a universal booster case in point being the russian vaccine s single dose version sputnik light studies are on to evaluate its efficacy as a booster after two shots of the astrazeneca oxforduniversity vaccine all types of combinations are being looked at in different countries and in india too experts say it would follow the same pattern of taking which ever vaccine is available as a booster what is who s view on it the who is not for boosters and has called for a global moratorium till the year end they have said a third dose as part of the primary vaccination can be given to vulnerable at risk populations the who s stance is based on two factors studies that do not show the need for a booster in healthy populations and the lopsided distribution of vaccines across the world that has left several low income countries with no vaccines for their frontline workers this raises a moral question on governments cornering vaccine supplies even as it leaves the world open to the risk for infection spread as the who repeatedly points out no one is safe until everyone is safe share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit

what is a booster dose a booster dose is given to those already vaccinated to help shore up their immunity levels after a period of time so babies for instance are given their childhood vaccines and booster doses for life long protection against polio measles and so on but the world is presently gripped in a dilemma over booster doses for the covid 19 vaccine as studies show declining antibody protection within about six months of the mrna vaccines for instance and a booster dose could then help restore the vaccine s effectiveness in creating antibodies in an individual who shows declining immunity against the virus is there conclusive research on the need for it research calls for a nuanced approach public health experts say a third dose may be necessary as part of the primary vaccination in vulnerable populations who may not have adequate antibody protection despite the first two doses vaccines are known to be less efficient in the elderly for example in creating an adequate antibody protection against the virus people who are immunocompromised because of their treatment for cancer or those who may have had an organ transplant and so on are defined as vulnerable is it allowed in india there is no decision yet but there is a clamour for the same from several public health voices especially for frontline workers essential workers etc who would got their vaccines in january february this year and may be witnessing waning immunity the declining protection could endanger the lives of the frontline staff as they continue to remain engaged in covid 19 linked duty and india is reported to have stocks that may be running close to its expiry date so this cannot be exported instead of running the risk of it being wasted public health voices are suggesting they be used as boosters for frontline staff and high risk populations have other countries allowed it yes countries like israel have gone right ahead with their boosters campaign and the united states and europe are on the verge of the same this comes as studies show declining immunity protection from vaccines six months on and add to this the highly transmissible delta variants and a large number of unvaccinated population as well europe for instance is seeing a surge of cases in countries like germany that have a reasonably vaccinated population and this is being seen by some as grounds for a booster dose just months ago though the us food and drug administration s advisory panel had advised boosters only for high risk populations should the booster be the same as the original vaccine countries are going with a mix and match approach and companies are studying their vaccines in the role of a universal booster case in point being the russian vaccine s single dose version sputnik light studies are on to evaluate its efficacy as a booster after two shots of the astrazeneca oxforduniversity vaccine all types of combinations are being looked at in different countries and in india too experts say it would follow the same pattern of taking which ever vaccine is available as a booster what is who s view on it the who is not for boosters and has called for a global moratorium till the year end they have said a third dose as part of the primary vaccination can be given to vulnerable at risk populations the who s stance is based on two factors studies that do not show the need for a booster in healthy populations and the lopsided distribution of vaccines across the world that has left several low income countries with no vaccines for their frontline workers this raises a moral question on governments cornering vaccine supplies even as it leaves the world open to the risk for infection spread as the who repeatedly points out no one is safe until everyone is safe share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit
famous ancient greek historian herodotus once wrote of the amazons or as he called them oier pata killers of men a tribe of fierce warrior women though in today s world the name amazon is strongly associated with jeff bezos s mighty online delivery empire it still carries a heavy association with these gender role breaking fist fighting sword swinging arrow shooting single breasted warrior woman of antiquity for centuries they were dismissed as mere legend but in the last decades detailed investigations have revealed that the amazons were very real and they were a fearsome force to be reckoned with the amazons are believed to have been the descendants of the nomadic ancient scythians and sarmatian people their territory ranged from the slopes of the caucasus mountains between the eastern end of the black sea and all the way to the vast eurasian steppes in every myth whether they be persian greek or scythian the amazons remained consistent in their descriptions they rode horses shot arrows were uneasy around boats and even wore pants however the question remains who were they really in the greek myths homer first mentioned their existence in the iliad they appeared fighting against achilles on the side of troy in hercules s ninth labor he was tasked by eurystheus to steal the belt or girdle from an amazon queen another story mentioned the ill fated marriage of theseus and hippolyta resulting in one of the earliest perspectives to the traumas that parent separations may bring on their children in ancient rome the mythical stories about amazons was re enacted in the gladiatorial arena women gladiators were be given the names of famous greek amazon queens and fought in hand to hand combat to the first cut marble relief showing amazon gladiators carole raddato cc by sa 2 0 with such fantastic tales retold throughout the ages it is understandable why most people assumed the amazons never existed their legends and history challenged the male dominated establishment and planted seeds of rebellion in the minds of their women however in the twentieth century russian archaeologists began to re examine their existence when excavations of scythian kurgans scythian burial mounds revealed startling finds the motives to the myths about the amazons in the minds of the ancient greeks they never questioned whether the amazons truly existed their tales were used to contrast the natural values 5th century bc athens allegedly carried athenian greek women were be expected to be good family women productive of male heirs and zealous in maintaining the household to be anything less of those traits would be amazonian in nature amazon women according to ancient athenian men were loose brawlers hot tempered and unable to fully mature into adulthood due to their carefree lifestyles of all the accounts mentioned about the amazons there is none which speaks more clearly than the works of herodotus in his accounts he remains as objective as possible most of his research was based on translating other accounts from persia as well as the older writings from prior generation greek scholars his accounts remain the closest to the possible truth than any other writings about the amazons herodotus wrote passages about their possible origins his sentiments were the same they were man killers who could kill ten men with little to no effort in one of his historical accounts he mentioned that a group of amazons was captured during the battle of thermodon as the greeks sailed home the amazons broke free and killed every single man on the ship battle of greeks and amazons on marble colin cc by sa 3 0 however the amazons were oblivious to the workings of ships they were adrift for days until it crashed onto the shores of palus maeotis near cremini translating to the cliffs these lands had been known to be the country of the free scythians the women now freed from the shackles of a would be fate mounted wild horses and rode further inland only to discover they were too far away from home the languages which were spoken by the amazons though linguistically similar to the scythians still differed enough to be a hindrance herodotus noted that the scythians assumed the amazons were never taught to speak correctly though their dress appeared similar they were worlds away from being the same people rumor had it that with no hope of returning home the amazons resorted to a life as raiders plundering every scythian village they could find herodotus went on to discuss how after the amazon raids the vengeful scythian men went after them but after days of conflict efforts were made for a peaceful outcome both groups were able to learn enough about each other s dialect in order to communicate it was then that their desires for blood were soon replaced with the desire for intercourse these two groups eventually intermarried and became the scythian sarmatians they then moved northeast to live a nomadic way of life it was also mentioned that this group created a tradition of training both men and women in the ways of hunting shooting bows and arrows horseback riding and the basics of warfare though it may seem like a technicality in this there can be room to further explore what herodotus was saying the amazons frequently used bows and arrows dvoinik adobe stock herodotus stated that these amazons seemed like scythians yet did not speak scythian fluently he noted that when actual scythian men met with the amazons and fell in love the men were given an ultimatum to either leave or join them in their quest to return home if the women were scythians why would they ask the scythian men to leave their customs and families behind the clues about the amazons as mentioned by herodotus discuss a group of people who had little in common except for technological similarities with these slight clues mentioned how could the women be considered scythian at all merging of myth and fact of the amazons according to the ancient greeks the term scythian acted as a generalization for an entire nomadic cultural group as far as the ancient greeks were concerned anything past thrace and heading to inner asia was essentially the land of the scythians if one were to analyze this massive generalization one would notice that this region accounted for thousands of miles and consisted of hundreds of cultures languages and ethnicities which may have been completely different from each other however if one were to continue reading the passages of herodotus further clues would actually lean to the favor of the amazons being scythians one passage regarding the origins of the scythians by herodotus may have unintentionally explained the rise of the amazon warrior women the world knows today the passage describing the retribution brought forth from the twenty eight year war with the medes they the scythians entered asia in pursuit of the cimmerians and overthrew the empire of the medes on their return to their homes after the long absence of twenty eight years a task awaited them more troublesome than their struggle with the medes they found an army of no small size prepared to oppose their entrance for the scythian women when they saw that time went on and their husbands did not come back had intermarried with their slaves amazon women triumph in battle pharos public domain his passages go on to describe how the returning scythian men dealt with their own people and slaves not recognizing who they were however given this description about the possible formation of the scythians could this tie together to the reason why the captured amazons spoke scythian badly rather than being that they were of an entirely different group could it have been that they were the offspring of slaves and women who ran away from one of the scythian villages in the passage it clearly states that the women and slaves were able to put up a worthy fight against the war hardened men who had been absent for twenty eight years could such a long absence have created a cultural shift making women the dominant warrior over men and could this have led to the traditions of warrior duality between the sexes that was shared by the scythian sarmatians in the years to come archaeological facts about the amazons in 1993 the mummified remains of a scytho siberian woman from the fifth century bc famously named the siberian ice maiden was excavated from a burial mound also known as a kurgan in the republic of altai russia forensic anthropologists eventually determined her age of death between twenty to thirty years of age due to breast cancer and severe trauma sustained from a fall the ice maiden s body along with remains of two horses were oriented toward the east in later excavations of other kurgans this was revealed to be a consistent custom the ice maiden s burial mound held a plethora of items revealing further insight to the mysterious scythian people but of all the incredible artifacts from her kurgan that fascinated the world it was the garments she wore and the tattoos she had still preserved from the arid permafrost of the steppe in her larch wood coffin she was adorned with a yellow silk tussah blouse a striped wool skirt of crimson and white a tassel belt thigh high white felt leggings with a marten fur a polished metal mirror by her side and a three foot tall headdress even though russian archaeologists had assumed her to be a priestess of some kind the ice maiden s funerary dress closely resembled the depictions of greek amazons from the fifth and sixth century bc greek vases amazon wearing trousers and carrying a shield with an attached patterned cloth and a quiver jastrow cc by sa 2 5 in further expeditions russian archaeologists continued excavating over one hundred and fifty additional ancient scythian kurgans in the altai mountain regions pokrovka and kazakhstan to their surprise they discovered that almost one third were women of elite warrior status the kurgans included bows daggers and the women appeared to be of high rank some of the remains had women in battle dress no different than the remains of warrior men there were young women showing characteristics of bow leggedness a trait resulting from a life of constant riding there was bronze tipped arrows iron daggers and some women were even being buried next to horses these women further astonished archaeologists by revealing their height to be five feet six inches a height that was significantly tall especially for that time amazon queen preparing for a battle palbrattberg public domain the assumptions made to why there were so many scythian sarmatian warrior women can be linked to the nomadic way of life they were trained in survival from a very young age using the techniques learned from both their mothers and fathers when scythian men were away in battle or engaged in a hunt their women had to be able to defend themselves against the elements and other nomad raiders the women needed to be as tough as the men in order to survive the harshness of the steppe with the 150 kurgan mounds revealing large amounts of evidence to the existence of warrior women there was a strong possibility that these women were the inspiration for the concept of amazons however these are still assumptions and one must always question what they have found closing thoughts about the amazons in the eyes of the ancient male athenian greeks they were the epitome of feminine rebellion in dire need of being tamed however in the opinions of twentieth century scholars the amazons embodied the association of freedom sexual equality and the undoing of the patriarchal status quo if all were to agree that the scythian sarmatians were indeed the amazons regardless of the massive generalizations made by the greeks historians and even archaeologists then could herodotus s description of the scythian origin potentially be the beginnings of the amazons the amazon scythian hypothesis has convincing evidence to make it a strong possibility however they still may not have been the same people as warrior women known as the amazons as previously mentioned the land of the ancient scythians encompassed thousands of miles within those thousands of miles are also thousands of possibilities leading to many more questions in the twentieth century there was further discussion about whether the amazons were women at all but asiatic groups who contained less facial hair then the greeks a highly unlikely but not unusual theory to consider after all conquistadors once thought that native americans of south america were amazon warrior women simply because they fashioned no facial hair at all they were so convinced of this that they named an entire region after the amazon warrior women see amazon river history whatever their true history may be there is no doubt that these fearsome warrior women were not to be underestimated top image the amazons were a

by jeff floyd certified horticulturist and arborist the science of growing grapes and making wines has marched steadily forward through history from what was certainly an accidental discovery to today when more good wines are produced at lower costs than ever most of us probably associate fine wines with europe and particularly france but there was a time when a texan had to step in to save the french wine industry from disaster in the mid 1800s a small aphid like insect called phylloxera had begun to decimate french vineyards the feeding activity of this pest cuts off the flow of sap and eventually leads to the death of the vine just as was true then there is no effective method to control or eliminate phylloxera today by the time the culprit had been identified nearly one quarter of the wine grapes in france had been lost meanwhile around this time in denison texas a horticulturist named thomas volney munson who had been extensively collecting describing and breeding grapes was talking to the french viticulturists tasked with finding a solution to the problem together they determined that american vines had also been attacked by phylloxera however unlike their european cousins the american vines were not killed by the pest this led munson to suggest grafting french vines onto root stocks collected from central texas locations which had conditions like those in french vineyards in fewer than ten years it was clear the strategy had worked the french vineyards had been saved by munson and his texas grapes today grayson college in denison is home to the munson memorial vineyard which has many of the vines he developed unfortunately more than two thirds of his grapes have either been lost to the ravages of time or have not been located each fall as the munson vines are pruned hundreds of cuttings are collected and shipped to growers and scientists who requested them the next time you enjoy the earthy notes of a full bodied cabernet from the bordeaux region remember that the vines which produced the juice may have been held up by texas rootstocks floyd is a private green industry consultant he can be reached at like this like loading related

an optimistic forecast predicts banks will close out 2021 on a strong note bolstered by more loan activity and fewer liquidity challenges that outlook is supported by a survey of loan officers who are projecting continued easing of loan standards to encourage lending an analysis of third quarter earnings reported by 28 regional banks projects that lending activity will pick up in the current quarter and has promising predictions for loan growth through 2023 the research report from the stephens inc banking team also lists home bancshares inc of conway as a highly regarded stock with a price target of 29 per share the stock has been trading in the 24 26 range this month after opening the year just below 20 stephens said the stock should be a core holding for small and medium sized capital bank investors home will get a boost from its recent announced acquisition of happy bancshares inc of texas the report said integration of happy bancshares deal allows entrance into texas which should support organic loan growth and an m a program the stephens report noted in september home announced it was expanding into texas by buying happy bancshares in an all stock transaction valued at 919 million the deal is scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2022 and company officials have indicated their interest in examining more growth through acquisitions in texas looking ahead stephens estimates that home bancshares will have the largest organic loan growth next year of all southwest region banks the forecast projects organic loan growth of 37 next year driven by the addition of the happy loan book the median organic growth for the region as a whole is projected at 8 in 2022 stephens estimates both bank ozk of little rock and simmons first national corp of pine bluff will fall below the median with ozk at 4 growth and simmons at 3 conversely for the current quarter stephens has an annualized estimate of loan growth of 50 for simmons which benefits by adding the loan portfolios of two recently acquired tennessee banks and a dip of minus 3 for ozk and minus 8 for home bancshares simmons is the leader in the region for fourth quarter estimates the median growth estimate for the entire region is 8 regarding liquidity which has been a drag on bank earnings because of bloated deposits and deflated income related to interest earned on loans and securities stephens says the third quarter represents the peak of liquidity balances and levels should begin to fall off in the current quarter overall liquidity levels are three times higher than they were in the fourth quarter of 2019 the report noted a separate nationwide survey of senior loan officers nationwide released this month by the federal reserve found that banks are easing lending requirements as demand picks up especially in the commercial and industrial sectors where the largest loans often are made bankers also said they are making it easier for commercial real estate businesses to borrow in all categories loan demand by multifamily property developers and non farm residential borrowers is picking up the loan officers said in the survey though reports of interest for consumer loans was mixed the bankers said they were easing standards for two top consumer categories credit cards and autos at the same time the loan officers said demand has weakened for most categories of residential real estate pitch n pint winners a little rock firm that helps place drivers with companies in the trucking industry took top prize in a pitch competition for entrepreneurs last week kissa

anambra governorship election winners and losers wednesday november 10 2021 professor florence banku obi vice chancellor of the university of calabar and the independent national electoral commission inec returning officer for the anambra gubernatorial poll finally announced the results and declared the winner this came several hours after the supplementary election was conducted a day before in the ihiala lga the only one among the 21 local government areas of the state where elections did not hold on saturday november 6 forget the pretentious and hypocritical mantra of no victor no vanquished readily spewed by loquacious victors seeking to showcase their magnanimity in victory truth is that every contest or tug of war among living organisms produces winners and losers and the recently concluded anambra governorship election is no different i can boldly declare without fear or favour that the major winners include ndi anambra the independent national electoral commission inec the all progressives grand alliance apga chukwuma soludo military and security formations and the indigenous peoples organisation of biafra ipob and that major losers include the all progressives congress apc peter obi andy uba chris ngige and uche ekwunife first the major winners given the frightening incidences of killings and destruction of public buildings and infrastructure that were breaking out like rashes in anambra state during the runup to the election many pundits and commentators predicted that rivers of blood would flow through the streets if ipob insisted on the observance of its lockdown order the order was lifted a day or two to the polling day and enough anambrarians showed up at the polling units to keep the flame of democratic mores and practices burning bright a victory for democracy and despite the dispersed reports of voter apathy vote buying late delivery of materials and malfunctioning of few bvas machines the election turned out to be anything but shambolic kudos to the electoral umpire for safely retrieving the bacon from the fire considering the potentially incendiary conditions under which the election was conducted it would seem that apga has yet again proven to be the political cat with nine lives truth is that governor willie obiano lost part of the overflowing goodwill that saw him set a precedence by winning all 21 lgas when he sought reelection four years back not a few pundits predicted that with the supersized stature of his estranged political godfather peter obi looming imperiously over the former s shoulders apga and obiano would be swept into the dustbin of history in the only state that the party currently controls chukwuma soludo won 19 out of the 21 lgas scored at least 25 of the votes cast in all 21 lgas and polled nearly half of the total valid votes cast to consign his closest rivals pdp s valentine ozigbo and apc s andy uba to distant second and third positions respectively soludo was first drafted into the race in 2010 by powers that be in the pdp to contest against apga s peter obi and received a well deserved shellacking by a strange twist of fate soludo has found himself in apga just as obi migrated to pdp so for soludo english poet robert browning s postulation that a minute s success pays the failure of years rings particularly trite and poignant despite the pockets of electoral malfeasances the military and security formations should be lauded for performing the seemingly sisyphean assignment of creating a semblance of assured safety for voters who tremulously walked to their polling units to exercise their franchise not initially certain of the fate that awaited them they are hardly remembered when such events conclude without major hiccups but are pilloried if things turnout contrariwise ipob equally deserves plaudits for lifting the one week lockdown it earlier declared although many prospective voters still dismissed the reversal as fake news and chose not to take the risk of leaving their homes that their picketing enforcers and or associated militant groups opted to allow sleeping dogs to lie largely created a congenial and conducive environment for the poll to be conducted now for the major losers there can be no gainsaying the fact that apc lost big time and that along with the loss bookmakers would be offering very long odds on the possibility of the south east producing the president in 2023 the party has been taking gargantuan steps to make major inroads into the zone it retained a governor through a highly contested electoral process in imo and gained a governor via defection in ebonyi an apc governor in anambra would ve been the clincher and a solid case would arguably have been made for the 2023 presidential ticket to be allotted to the south east but given how the results panned out it is now clearly a case of to your tents o israel why because i remain fully persuaded for cogent reasons outside the context and scope of this essay that as long as the coalition that made muhammadu buhari a winner in 2015 and 2019 remains united it would be near impossible for the pdp to make a real difference with a presidential candidate from any section of nigeria talk less the south east the men and women of political timber and calibre whose stature and stock were significantly diminished and depleted by the victory of apga and soludo include former anambra state governor and pdp vice presidential candidate in the 2019 election peter obi former anambra state governor and current minister of labour and productivity sen chris ngige serial governorship aspirant and apc candidate in the november 2021 poll sen andrew andy uba and the effervescent and irrepressible serial governorship candidate and party ratter lolo sen uche ekwunife the nexus between all the foregoing political colossi so they at least seem on paper and personal recognition is that they not only lost their political strongholds to other party candidates but have been consistently failing to deliver their local government areas to their parties in not less than two past governorship election cycles that they except peter obi actually participated as candidates it goes without saying that a wannabe political godfather or godmother who cannot readily be counted on to deliver his or her electoral constituency is just a paper tiger to be sniggered and snickered at behind the scenes by fellow party members in particular and the electorate at large for the avoidance of any doubt the constituencies of the affected individuals are as follows obi anaocha lga ngige idemili north south lgas uba aguata orumba north south lgas and ekwunife njikoka lga there can be no gainsaying that the election reflects the overwhelming sacred mandate of ndi anambra and a clarion call to exemplary service those thinking of challenging the results should perish the thought and give peace a chance their inalienable right to litigate their defeat notwithstanding but if they persist in their dog in a manger attitude then i must appeal to the supreme court justices to set a landmark precedence by refusing to hear the cases if they finally get to them without offering any reasons just as occasionally happens in the usa while congratulating soludo on his well deserved victory let me also remind him of the wise words of russian born american

a truck in seoul carries a message may 14 urging punishment for coupang that allegedly killed its worker from overworking korea times file by kim jae heun profitability has been a major concern for coupang since its new york listing as wall street investors have been dissatisfied by its snowballing debt caused by a rapid expansion in operations coupang s core business model looks appealing because it is positioned to benefit from the network effect in which the value of a product or platform increases due to the rising number of customers which causes the network itself to grow at the time of its new york listing coupang s stock price surpassed 60 briefly however the shares have been trading below 30 in recent months that shows its focus on maximizing its market share and corporate size rather than net income and operating margins has been ineffective at least in the eyes of investors some industry insiders even advised coupang to rethink its growth focused business strategy and pay more attention to improving profitability they recommended that coupang stop building new warehouses at major logistics spots coupang s rapid expansion even led to forecasts that it could compete with existing retail giants such as lotte and shinsegae after its new york listing in march of this year however what s more of a concern is that coupang has been grappling with labor issues seven coupang employees and two from its subcontractors have died of cardiovascular ailments according to news reports the committee for coupang workers human rights and health alleged that five of the nine workplace fatalities were due to overworking firefighters walk out of coupang s fulfillment center in icheon gyeonggi province where a fire broke out in june yonhap

austria is placing millions of people not fully vaccinated against the coronavirus in lockdown from tomorrow it comes as the country seeks to deal with a surge in infections to record levels and the growing strain on intensive care units the government said europe is the epicentre of the covid 19 pandemic again prompting some governments to consider re imposing unpopular lockdowns austria has one of the continent s highest infection rates with a seven day incidence of 815 per 100 000 people we are not taking this step lightly but it is necessary chancellor alexander schallenberg told a news conference announcing the new measure from tomorrow the unvaccinated can only leave their homes for a limited number of reasons such as going to work or shopping for essentials roughly 65 of austria s population is fully vaccinated against covid 19 one of the lowest rates in western europe many austrians are sceptical about vaccines a view encouraged by the far right freedom party the third biggest in parliament the measures tomorrow will extend those brought in a week ago which banned the unvaccinated from places including restaurants hotels theatres and ski lifts while the netherlands is dealing with its surge in cases by imposing a partial lockdown that applies to all austria s conservative led government wants to avoid imposing further restrictions on those who are fully vaccinated in reality we have told one third of the population you will not leave your apartment anymore apart from for certain reasons that is a massive reduction in contacts between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated chancellor schallenberg said in germany the federal government and leaders of germany s 16 states are due to meet next week to discuss tightening measures germany has already classified austria as a high risk area meaning people arriving from there have to go into quarantine a blow to austria s winter tourism industry targeted measures have recently been introduced in australia where 83 of people aged 16 and above have been fully inoculated some states have mandated vaccinations for some occupations and barred the unvaccinated from activities such as dining out leading to demonstrations singapore where 85 of the population has been fully vaccinated has said those who remained unvaccinated by choice would have to foot their medical bills from next month austria s lockdown which does not apply to the under 12s or people who have recently recovered from covid 19 will initially last 10 days health minister wolfgang mueckstein said many officials including within chancellor schallenberg s conservative party and the police have expressed doubts this lockdown can be properly enforced as it applies to only part of the population interior minister karl nehammer said there will be thorough police checks three dead in fire on coronavirus ward in bulgaria three patients have died in a fire that broke out this morning on a coronavirus ward in a hospital in southwest bulgaria the three male patients were all ill with covid 19 and died on the fourth floor of a hospital in the city of sliven the head of the local rescue services vladimir demirev told bulgarian television six other patients on neighbouring wards had to be evacuated the incident occurred as the eu member headed to the polls for the third time this year on sunday amid the deadliest wave of covid 19 yet in the country the most likely cause of the fire was a lit cigarette of one of the patients the bulgarian health ministry said in a statement bulgaria s hospitals frequently run down are currently overwhelmed by the number of coronavirus infections with only just over 23 of the total population of 6 9 million people fully vaccinated bulgaria has the lowest vaccination rate across the european union after two previous elections in april and july returned fractured parliaments where parties failed to cobble together a coalition the new election is not expected to bring about a stable government the current interim administration has failed to impose stricter measures and prevent new infections and deaths from spiralling last week in neighbouring romania two covid 19 patients also died in a hospital fire spain s bars face alcohol shortage as covid curbs lift bars and nightclubs across spain have struggled to stock their shelves with popular alcoholic drinks since covid 19 restrictions on social life were fully lifted last month this is due to supply chain issues caused by the pandemic this is raising concerns in a country where social life is concentrated outside of the home and big groups often meet up for tapas or dinner followed by rounds of drinks the shortage is not generalised but is concentrated on some brands the problem is that these are brands people are very attached to said roberto ucelay the manager of the los olivos beach resort in tenerife part of spain s canary islands among the popular names affected are beefeater gin absolut vodka and patron tequila the shortages are due to the global shipping crisis sparked by an uptick in demand from china and the united states which affects all international trade spain s association of spirits makers espirituosos espana said in a statement suppliers have struggled with shortages in bottles and cardboard boxes needed to package alcohol as well as a lack of drivers containers and trucks to ship it it is not a problem of the availability of products it is a problem of delivery said a spokesman for france s pernod ricard the world s number two spirits maker other european nations like britain have also been hit by alcohol shortages but in spain the problem is compounded by the country s consumption patterns he said bars and restaurants account for almost half of all alcohol sales in spain compared to just one fifth in france where supermarkets account for the bulk of sales the spokesman said when business picked up in spain after virus restrictions were removed this more complicated supply chain had to get up and running again a process that takes time he said
the ev company s cornerstone investors had indicated an interest in buying up to 5 billion worth of its stock at its ipo price according to rivian s s 1 ipo documents amazon was one of those parties and the american e commerce behemoth looks to have completed the purchase on friday afternoon amazon purchased about 200 million worth of rivian shares at its ipo price of 78 per share according to a recent form 4 filing the total number of shares purchased was 2 564 102 which was just under the goal dollar amount of 200 million at the time of purchase at the company s closing price of 129 95 per share this afternoon amazon now owns 158 363 834 shares of rivian valued at 20 579 380 228 3 because amazon paid only 78 per share for its most recent tranche of rivian shares it has already realized a profit of more than 133 million after converting its numerous pre ipo holdings and warrants to class a shares in the firm now that it is publicly traded amazon s newest purchase of rivian stock at its ipo price works out to barely 1 6 percent of its entire investment in the company taking into account its past ownership amazon currently owns around 22 of rivian rivian s first public offering ipo was a huge success raising a huge amount of money for the electric vehicle firm and rocketing its market cap into the stratosphere rivian for example is valued at more than 127 billion at the end of the week s trading cycle according to yahoo finance rivian is valued about 10 billion every manufactured unit based on the fact that it only constructed 12 automobiles in the third quarter this ratio will decline in the following quarters but it highlights how much of rivian s value is based on future results rather than past performance rivian automotive inc has reached another another milestone in its meteoric rise as a new stock it is now the largest u s corporation by market value without any revenue rivian s stock has risen 67 percent since its initial public offering on wednesday when it was priced at 78 in terms of market value it s only about a quarter of a percent away from passing volkswagen ag one of the world s top automakers meanwhile lucid s stock has increased by 339 percent this year in july it became public after merging with a blank check company
my family s london cleaning lady has just quit she didn t give any notice she just didn t show up when we finally reached her on her cell phone she explained that she was awfully sorry but this wonderful opportunity has turned up you know working as a phlebotomist in hospital she never saw her future in cleaning other people s houses anyhow she enlightened us i had to google her new profession a phlebotomist is a key member of a healthcare team taking blood samples from patients and donors i read it is surprising of course that one can graduate from being a key worker in a household to a medical specialist so swiftly but then this is england starved of immigrants in general and of health workers in particular we were happy for her if somewhat desperate how to handle a house remotely now without our phlebotomist the next thing we hear from london was our gardener who demanded on the phone without ado a 25 per cent pay rise boosting his hourly charges to twice the official minimum wage i still harbour the suspicion that his extortionate demands were only a ruse to put the onus of separation on me what we are experiencing as a family is not inaptitude or bad luck but a reflexion of the overall state of the uk economy and with variations the state of affairs globally the average hourly earnings of all private employees in the united states according to the fed st louis wage tracker have risen from us 28 51 before the pandemic to us 30 85 in september this sounds not overly dramatic considering a time period of almost two years and the fact that also high earners contribute to the average but statements from individual employers indicate a much more critical situation mcdonald s franchises report wage inflation of 10 per cent with salary offers exceeding that yet most open positions cannot be filled many franchisees therefore decided to downsize dining rooms and to cancel night shifts starbucks and amazon joined the lamentation as do many smaller businesses according to ceo jeff bezos wage inflation cost amazon already us two billion per year the jumpstart of the economy has triggered a hiring enthusiasm seemingly not shared by the working age population advertised vacancies exceed job seekers by a wide margin candidates can t even be bothered to show up at interviews they have agreed to economists and conservative politicians in the us have long blamed unemployment benefits for this new idleness the 600 and later 300 granted additionally to people who have lost their job during lockdown this cannot be pivotal as half of us states have stopped making such payments already in spring while the programme officially ended on labour day at the beginning of september more than 10 million redundant workers in the us often parttimers temps or people self employed in the gig economy have never received any benefits at all causing protest movements like unemployed action yet the hiring problem continues businesses already plagued by supply shortages try to cope as well as they can they hire ex convicts weed smokers teenagers they offer extra rest more pay the hope for advanced automatisation to replace the jobs which apparently nobody wants in the meantime they pass on all extra costs to the willing consumer and compensate shareholders for the lost turnover with ever higher profit margins businesses already plagued by supply shortages try to cope as well as they can they hire ex convicts weed smokers teenagers andreas weitzer employment statistics published by the us bureau of labour statistics show a net increase of private sector employment of 300 000 up to august the result of 6 3 million hirings and six million separations which usually mean layoffs in fact very few people were fired many retired early but 4 3 million just quit like the waitress heroine in a movie who long abused by her exploitative boss one day decides enough is enough unties her apron and walks out a growing number of people have come to the conclusion that their life has to yield more than drudgery according to a survey commissioned by personio a hr software company 38 per cent of uk employees want another job citing a worsening life work balance a lack of appreciation and a toxic workplace culture as reasons while employers still believe that pay freezes and benefit reductions during the pandemic have accelerated staff turnover as it looks more pay eagerly offered by employers since the reopening of the economy may not be enough to lure people back to the rat race on reddit a discussion platform the anti work forum has already garnered 900 000 followers demanding unemployment for all not just the rich group members encourage each other to boycott black friday to quit abusive jobs and to feel the lure of freedom others scheme strike action on twitter like striketober it is not only overworked junior bankers and trainee lawyers who are exhausted by long hours those workers we have classified as essential during lockdowns the people driving delivery vans stacking supermarket shelves or working on the health front feel overwhelmed too and do not cope easily with the demands heaped on them since the pandemic redundancies furloughs dismissals quarantines and working from home must have had a massive impact on how we understand our lives we had perhaps more family time or suddenly less we stopped leaving our house or were the only ones to do so we started to think about the things we always wanted to do but never dared to we saw death at close quarters felt fear and paralysis our working life was disrupted consumption switched off but to our big surprise life continued barring revolutions people rarely risk en masse their means of subsistence for the sake of a better but uncertain future they do now lockdown savings and the hectic scramble for hands must have created a sense of safety which before the pandemic only emanated from regular income idling at home has persuaded many to dabble in first time investments aided by free trading apps they wagered on meme stocks and cryptocurrencies some of these young feisty punters have amassed sizable gains their easy wins like the riches of influencers makes jobbing look outdated there is a risk that both employers and employees are misjudging the future businesses are perhaps too confident in their pricing power and may not show enough flexibility to counter the threat of a looming talent exodus employees might overestimate their bargaining power at a certain stage buyers will strike while many jobs will have disappeared beyond retrieval shrinking sales in combination with shrinking profit margins may prove that we retail investors too have misjudged the direction of the stock market the idea of a new normal usually speculates about the way we will do things after the pandemic but what if the pandemic itself like climate change is the new normal causing disruption for years to come

here s what you need to remember nazi germany could have developed nuclear weapons if it had won the war it could not develop them as war winning weapons both because of the demands of the project and the limitations of early atomic devices only the united states could combine the economic resources and the long time horizon necessary to develop the bomb while at the same time developing a fleet of bombers capable of delivering it in the early years of world war ii it looked as if germany might have the luxury to spend its time developing a new generation of super weapons the nazis haphazardly pursued the idea of building an atomic bomb with an eye toward eventual conflict with the united states however the immediate demands of war combined with western allied sabotage undercut the program leaving it at the basic research stage by war s end but what if the germans had devoted more attention to the program or had lucked into more substantial breakthroughs what could the nazis have done with an atomic weapon context for construction the american atomic weapons program cost an enormous amount of money and took human capital away from other important projects but the united states unique among the great powers of world war ii believed that the war would last long enough to justify complex projects germany did not have this luxury especially after it became apparent that the soviet union would not collapse in 1941 for germany to seriously consider taking the atomic plunge it needed favorable war conditions that would allow the development of long term research projects in the event jets submarines and rockets took up a greater portion of the reich s scarce engineering resources the german program faced other obstacles western allied attacks on the german industrial economy took their toll even if they could not push germany out of the war sabotage like the attacks on heavy water processing plants in norway also curtailed german progress the nature of the nazi regime also made scientific progress difficult many of the best nuclear scientists disliked the nazis and took steps to escape europe the germans could not draw on europe s scientific expertise to the same extent as the americans nevertheless the nazi regime did make substantial progress on a number of engineering frontiers and could have developed a weapon in time solving the basic theoretical and engineering problems wouldn t have suddenly turned germany into a major nuclear power however the german program concentrated on enriched uranium a simpler project that eliminated some of the more tricky problems faced by the united states however the need for stocks of uranium some of which had been seized from belgium and the extensive industrial complex needed to enrich would have made it difficult for the germans to produce a large number of devices delivery even if the germans had managed to develop an atomic weapon delivery would have been a problem for tactical use against ground targets the wehrmacht could have engineered a way to deliver the devices but anything at longer range would have been a struggle the luftwaffe lacked an advanced heavy bomber capable of hitting targets in england or russia much less the united states designed to fight in support of the wehrmacht the german air force had toyed with the idea of heavy bombers in the 1930s but concentrated on lighter smaller planes as war approached surely the german could have developed a strategic bomber given enough time junkers heinkel and focke wulf all worked on large bomber projects during the war but such aircraft were enormously complex and expensive with long lead times the b 29 program reputedly cost more than the atomic bomb itself and even b 29s required modification in order to carry atomic weapons the best candidate available to the luftwaffe would have been the he 177 capable of carrying a device considerably smaller than the little boy bomb dropped on hiroshima could submarines have delivered the devices conceivably a nuclear torpedo was probably beyond the means of the kriegsmarine but a submarine sufficiently close to its target could probably deliver the warhead in a small boat but getting into position was no mean task by 1943 allied anti submarine warfare was devastating germany s submarine fleet only the type xxi submarines could have approached useful targets with any degree of certainty and these boats did not appear until late in the war the v 2 ballistic missiles represented the most obvious potential delivery vehicles they could deliver payloads at range with little chance of interception and with enough accuracy for an atomic warhead however v 2s had a startling launch failure rate making them a sketchy option for an atomic payload they also lacked the ability to carry heavy payloads reducing a warhead to sufficiently small size and reinforcing it such that it could handle the rigors of launch flight and separation were tasks likely beyond nazi germany in any useful timeframe use of the weapon how would the germans have used the atomic bomb if they had managed to construct it it depends naturally on germany s tactical situation when it developed the weapon and on the delivery systems it had available obvious strategic targets include london and moscow and the luftwaffe could probably have delivered them successfully with a fair degree of confidence an attack on either would have proved devastating in the case of moscow a surprise strike that decapitated the soviet leadership might have caused very serious problems although the red army would undoubtedly have continued to fight in the west the v 2 campaign had a serious impact on british morale and an atomic device would have had an even more devastating impact it s worth keeping in mind however that the combined bomber offensive was delivering atomic levels of destruction to the reich from 1943 on and that this effort failed to force a german surrender in any case the center of gravity of the western allied war effort had passed to the other side of the atlantic and the united states was likely out of reach if hard pressed by the red army germany could have used its weapons for tactical effect an atomic weapon could have had a devastating impact on armored columns staging areas or command centers although with a small number of warheads the germans would have had to take great care in target selection the red army moved on such a massive scale that even an atomic attack might not have upset its grandest offensives on the naval side the bikini atom bomb tests demonstrated that modern naval units could survive atomic attacks if imperfectly as with the war in the east atomic bombs could have dented the western allied naval advantage but likely not to the extent of severing the trans atlantic lifeline major amphibious operations such as the normandy invasion would have proven far juicier targets although they would have required very judicious decisions on the part of the germans the final salvo nazi germany could have developed nuclear weapons if it had won the war it could not develop them as war winning weapons both because of the demands of the project and the limitations of early atomic devices only the united states could combine the economic resources and the long time horizon necessary to develop the bomb while at the same time developing a fleet of bombers capable of delivering it dr robert farley has taught security and diplomacy courses at the patterson school since 2005 he received his bs from the university of

what is a booster dose a booster dose is given to those already vaccinated to help shore up their immunity levels after a period of time so babies for instance are given their childhood vaccines and booster doses for life long protection against polio measles and so on but the world is presently gripped in a dilemma over booster doses for the covid 19 vaccine as studies show declining antibody protection within about six months of the mrna vaccines for instance and a booster dose could then help restore the vaccine s effectiveness in creating antibodies in an individual who shows declining immunity against the virus is there conclusive research on the need for it research calls for a nuanced approach public health experts say a third dose may be necessary as part of the primary vaccination in vulnerable populations who may not have adequate antibody protection despite the first two doses vaccines are known to be less efficient in the elderly for example in creating an adequate antibody protection against the virus people who are immunocompromised because of their treatment for cancer or those who may have had an organ transplant and so on are defined as vulnerable is it allowed in india there is no decision yet but there is a clamour for the same from several public health voices especially for frontline workers essential workers etc who would got their vaccines in january february this year and may be witnessing waning immunity the declining protection could endanger the lives of the frontline staff as they continue to remain engaged in covid 19 linked duty and india is reported to have stocks that may be running close to its expiry date so this cannot be exported instead of running the risk of it being wasted public health voices are suggesting they be used as boosters for frontline staff and high risk populations have other countries allowed it yes countries like israel have gone right ahead with their boosters campaign and the united states and europe are on the verge of the same this comes as studies show declining immunity protection from vaccines six months on and add to this the highly transmissible delta variants and a large number of unvaccinated population as well europe for instance is seeing a surge of cases in countries like germany that have a reasonably vaccinated population and this is being seen by some as grounds for a booster dose just months ago though the us food and drug administration s advisory panel had advised boosters only for high risk populations should the booster be the same as the original vaccine countries are going with a mix and match approach and companies are studying their vaccines in the role of a universal booster case in point being the russian vaccine s single dose version sputnik light studies are on to evaluate its efficacy as a booster after two shots of the astrazeneca oxforduniversity vaccine all types of combinations are being looked at in different countries and in india too experts say it would follow the same pattern of taking which ever vaccine is available as a booster what is who s view on it the who is not for boosters and has called for a global moratorium till the year end they have said a third dose as part of the primary vaccination can be given to vulnerable at risk populations the who s stance is based on two factors studies that do not show the need for a booster in healthy populations and the lopsided distribution of vaccines across the world that has left several low income countries with no vaccines for their frontline workers this raises a moral question on governments cornering vaccine supplies even as it leaves the world open to the risk for infection spread as the who repeatedly points out no one is safe until everyone is safe share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit
best known for treasure island kidnapped and the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde his scope was wider his style a work in progress when he died at the age of 44 on the polynesian island of samoa ill health chronic bronchial disease dogged him all his life leaving him painfully thin but all the more striking a figure for that an only child his father thomas was of the famous stevenson lighthouse family his mother margaret balfour came from gentry stock with lands in fife his calvinist nurse alison cunningham cummy told him folk tales that gave him nightmares and for light relief read from the bible and john bunyan he later dedicated his a child s garden of verses to her read more robert mcneil joanna lumley s idea to ration whisky is enough to drive a man to drink his education was a mixture of private tutors edinburgh academy and a term at boarding school in middlesex none of which damaged his urge to write despite his father urging him to give up such nonsense later thomas funded his son s first book the pentland rising about the covenanters their rebellion was 200 years old rls was 16 he entered the university of edinburgh to study engineering but enjoyed more the debates of the speculative society in vacation time he travelled with his father inspecting the family s engineering works the towers we founded and the lamps we lit on journeys like those that inspired walter scott to write the pirate when he said he wanted to dedicate himself to writing his father accepted with good grace and an agreement to study law as a plan b later his father was more devastated by louis s conversion to atheism by now louis as he was more intimately known was dressing in a right bohemian manner velveteen jacket and growing his hair long today he d be wearing skinny trousers that pinch at the knee louis frequented low pubs and brothels and worse still literary london and french artistic communities the latter partly for his health as the warm sunshine proved mysteriously more invigorating than edinburgh s grey drizzle in 1876 at grez he met vivacious fanny van de grift osbourne an american short story writer they became lovers and settled in san francisco with louis trying to support himself through writing while still hampered by ill health when they married in 1880 he described himself as a mere complication of cough and bones in 1884 they returned to britain settling down for three years in wait for it bournemouth where he did some of his finest writing treasure island was already out having first been serialised in the children s

dishy rishi promises jam tomorrow that s always been the preserve of the conservatives kidnapped set around the post 45 appin murder and featuring some lowland scots dialogue also started life in young folks in 1886 but like treasure island over the piece is probably treasured more by adults the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde published in 1886 was arguably less suitable for young folks the novella dealing with the good and evil that co exists within us all and passing into the language with a jekyll and hyde character ascribed to dubious dudes with a dual personality though i think we can safely say the strange case has a dark side it s still fair to observe particularly but not exclusively of the earlier works that in rls as in scott there s a tone that i don t want to describe as jejune even in the best sense of innocent unpretentious decent not jaunty not superficial whatever the word how embarrassing to give up trying to find it we re highlighting the fact that even with jolly rotten baddies rls eschewed sordid and seedy detail which he deplored in for example zola and other french writers in treasure island he saw no need of psychology believing novels should be neat not confusing like frequently monstrous reality perhaps it was for that reason that having been a literary celebrity in his own day admired by great contemporary writers for part of the grim 20th century he was relegated to the status of second rate children s storyteller today rehabilitated he s compared to joseph conrad henry james and jack london back on his lifelong search for health louis and family spent three years sailing in the south seas and hawaiian islands which restored him greatly there s yir cure if you re feeling wabbit in 1880 the family settled in vailima samoa his own treasure island taking the name tusitala he threw himself into local life including its politics fearing the naive islanders ripe for exploitation by mercenary europeans politically he was a socialist youth and a conservative maturity the normal cycle as he described it whatever the handle he became active in defending the islanders rights these real matters were reflected in a new writing tone perhaps less agreeable almost the word sought earlier as in the beach of falesá and the ebb tide with their duplicitous and greedy imperialists back on more familiar fictional territory he also wrote catriona and began weir of hermiston believing the latter about a sensitive young man in a morally ambivalent world so good that it frightens me rls died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 3 december 1894

china s leadership handover comes at a critical moment for society and the economy and changes are in order the 18th national congress of the communist party this month comes at a critical time described by economist wu jinglian as a tipping point for china s economic and social conflicts whether the new government makes the right decisions and restarts the reform process will determine whether china enjoys another decade of stable growth a goal for this new reform phase is to promote transformation of the economic development model mainly in two steps through a transition from manufacturing to innovation and by transitioning from an investment driven economy to one that is consumer driven over the past ten years china has benefited as a member of the world trade organization the world s share of manufactured goods made in china has jumped from 7 percent to 15 percent but we have found it difficult to break away from low price low cost low quality production we must look at what s wrong with the system companies are entitled to maximize profits and corporate behavior depends on paths set by a regulatory framework the existing framework does not provide strong enough incentives to promote innovation i can list at least five reasons why intellectual property protection is weak state owned enterprises have expanded rapidly based on their market monopolies making it much harder to protect fair play in a market economy prices for land capital labor the environment and other factors of production are severely distorted some companies can simply profit by taking advantage of these distorted factor prices the government has controlled a large number of economic resources and approval rights rent seeking has become the most efficient business model for companies with strong government connections the rule of law is weak entrepreneurs see rent seeking as the norm and lack a sense of security chongqing s notorious campaign against organized crime demonstrated that entrepreneurs are vulnerable to abuse of power that s why rich chinese have been immigrating now let s take a look at consumption it s a basic human need and it should not have to be stimulated the key is whether consumers have the right ammunition china s savings rate has risen to an all time high of fifty percent there have also been substantial increases in corporate and government savings behind the reluctance to consume is a sense of insecurity although people s incomes have increased their share of economic growth continues to decrease between 1992 and 2008 the amount that individual disposable incomes represented as part of gross national income fell twelve percentage points in addition because of long term interest rate controls chinese can hardly preserve the value of their wealth against rapid inflation between 2004 and 2011 china s average real one year bank deposit rate was negative 0 3 percent multiplied by the current size household savings of more than 30 trillion yuan annual losses are in the hundreds of billions of yuan coupled with the fact that the messy stock market is not oriented towards value creation people cannot share the fruits of economic growth through equity investment another reason for low consumption is that housing prices are high this will lead to a serious drain of personal income over the next twenty years the middle class is deeply in debt and china s development pace in the fields of medical insurance education and pension lag behind what s needed and is troubled by historical burdens the public s sense of security for the good of the economic transformation here is a wish list for reforms that should be implemented after the 18th congress 1 interest rate marketization the essence of a market economy is to use pricing to achieve optimal allocation of resources interest rates are the price of capital under the current interest rate control lending rates are artificially low which encourages excessive investment on the other hand because interest rates do not reflect supply and demand a large number of small and medium sized enterprises smes can t get access to capital which has led to growth in loan sharking which now poses a serious threat to financial stability apart from this interest rate controls are not conducive to increasing household wealth essentially the people depositors are subsidizing the corporate sector borrowers the time to promote market oriented interest rates is now 2 tax cuts according to a study published by forbes china ranks second in the world on the tax misery index where does the money go fiscal revenues as a percentage of gdp fell from 31 percent in 1978 to 10 percent in the mid 1990s but in recent years it has risen to 20 percent expanding government spending and the usual year end rush to spend money on government projects have led to a public backlash it s not just about the money spent local governments are involved in micro economic activities supported by all kinds of government projects which undermines fair competition in the market the government needs to cut taxes immediately and significantly it should and can do it according to the laffer curve theory when tax burdens are high tax cuts can stimulate economic activity broaden the tax base and prompt growth in tax revenues resulting in a win win situation 3 introduce inheritance and gift taxes competition in the market economy will eventually increase the gap between the rich and poor for sustainable development two conditions must be met first wealth is obtained legally instead of through rent seeking otherwise poor people will resent the rich out of hatred for corruption second there should be a mechanism to narrow the gap between the rich and poor especially via the inheritance tax the gap between china s rich and poor is already too big and more entrepreneurs are leaving their wealth to their children by imposing an inheritance tax the gap between the rich and poor will narrow this is an essential step for building a harmonious society 4 break up soe monopolies monopolies are the natural enemy of the market economy although china implemented the anti monopoly law in 2008 the country has since failed to make any headway in breaking the monopoly grip of state owned enterprises in 2011 the national development and reform commission conducted an anti trust investigation into china unicom and china telecom regarding broadband access but there were no further developments in the case in fact the essence of soe monopolies is the administrative control of market entrance although the state council has issued several decrees designed to break up monopolies a glass door still bars private enterprises breaking up monopolies and eliminating the discrimination of private ownership is at the core of building a market economy 5 reform soes in the last round of soe reform in the 1990s joint stock holding structures were set up and many were listed on the stock market soes experienced a fundamental change and their finances shifted from big losses to big profits however studies show that soes profits mainly come from favorable policies they enjoy in obtaining land loans government subsidies and other advantages if one were to exclude these factors then many soes books would be in the red the next round of soe reform should involve several problem solving efforts they must withdraw from real estate and other competitive fields and they must be separated from the government in particular the party s organizational departments should give up their right to appoint soe managers and their boards of directors eliminate soe leaders official party rankings and hire professional managers steps should be taken to curb corruption and cut benefits for soe leaders at state oil giant sinopec former chairman chen tonghai could spend 40 000 yuan a day on business activities the company has seen numerous scandals involving purchases of expensive chandeliers and liquor in 2008 soe employees in monopolized industries such as energy electricity telecoms and tobacco accounted for only 8 percent of the nation s total employment but their wages accounted for 50 percent of all worker income soes must stop functioning as an administrator and enjoying market monopolies instead they need true corporate governance 6 close the pension gap according to recent research published by ma jun deutsche bank s chief economist for greater china by 2013 china s pension shortfall will reach 18 3 trillion yuan as today s elderly population increases figuring out how to fill the pension hole has become a real challenge fortunately china s soe profits and high stock valuation can provide an important source of funding their profits should be used to fill empty pension accounts the government should cash out stakes in soes and put the money into the pension fund killing two birds with one stone not only would this step provide capital for the national pension fund but it would also let the state exit soes 7 abolish the ipo review system the government s ipo approval system is supposed to protect the interests of investors but over the past twenty years the system has not only failed to protect investors but it s also distorted relations between supply and demand and has given rise to many problems including rampant rent seeking it is indeed the source of chaos in the securities market being listed on the market should be a company s normal business activity instead it has become a privilege connected with regulatory power limiting the role of securities regulators to keeping order not selecting stocks for ipos would revive the stock market 8 allow private capital in banking indirect financing dominates china s capital market accounting for 78 percent of the market but banks are largely state owned and it s incredibly hard for new banks to win regulatory approval this has led to a quasi monopoly in the banking industry with embarrassingly high profits according to hong qi the president of minsheng bank to a certain degree the banking system has become a burden for the real economy the good performances of minsheng bank zhejiang tailong bank and other private banks show the argument that private banks tend to have poor risk controls simply doesn t hold water china should let private capital open banks this would not only promote competition in the banking sector and add depth to the financial market but also provide better services for small and medium sized enterprises 9 encourage overseas investment bubbles are obvious in china s housing sector and stock market the major reasons are excessive money supply and capital account control large quantities of capital need investment places but they are limited to domestic vehicles this makes things difficult for anyone who wants wealth preservation and appreciation meanwhile more than 3 trillion in foreign exchange reserves have been used to buy u s treasury bonds and other low yielding assets the opportunity cost is enormous if the country would relax restrictions on citizens overseas investments it would kill three birds with one stone by reducing the domestic property bubble and financial risks bringing about diversification of wealth allocation and preservation and reducing forex reserves while promoting global economic balance 10 protect intellectual property in the early stages of china s economic development enterprises generally copied and comparatively weak ip protection allowed them to grow quickly but today innovation and transformation have become a bottleneck for chinese enterprises a lack of ip rights protection has seriously weakened the incentive for r d and innovation protecting ip rights is not only beneficial to transnational corporations but it also spurs innovation 11 restrain local government inc local economies are all about gdp growth which has turned local governments into mega companies they are obsessed with investment promotion building infrastructure and venturing into domains such as private equity investment excessive involvement by local governments in economic activity destroys fairness in marketplace competition and creates corruption in addition it encourages local government to consider their own interests instead of justly enforcing laws and lets them turn a blind eye toward environmental pollution food safety and other issues resulting from reckless development the forced demolition of homes and reallocation of land is already a fountainhead for mass incidents and public protests the central government urgently needs to define borders of local authority and rein in the local government inc 12 financial democratization local governments sit atop an astonishing amount of financial resources over the past few years while tax revenues have rapidly increased financing from land transfer fees have risen as well in 2010 governments took in 2 9 trillion yuan in land transfer fees the checks and balances are weak and government budgets are opaque contributing to corruption the central government s 4 trillion yuan stimulus plan of 2008 further exacerbated risks to local government financing vehicles only with public exposure of financial spending and taxpayer supervision can we ensure efficient and good use of financial resources 13 environmental protection in a drive for gdp growth environmental protection and law enforcement are increasingly marginalized with the rapid rise of manufacturing environmental pollution has become widespread the cost of water and air pollution according to a world bank report in 2007 accounts for 5 8 percent of gdp in china over time the problems caused by environmental pollution have become increasingly apparent and if we do not improve environmental protection more social conflicts will erupt 14 corruption and housing in recent years a surge in housing prices has triggered a public outcry because the price salary ratio in so called first tier cities can be more than twenty times against this backdrop many local officials are found to be hoarding houses cai bin of the panyu urban management bureau in guangzhou has twenty one pieces of real estate luo yaping the former director of land resources in fushun liaoning province owned twenty seven houses hao pengjun director of the coal bureau in puxian county shanxi province had thirty six most in beijing kang huijun deputy director of pudong district in shanghai had twenty nine pieces of real estate tao jianguo the deputy head of the pudong free trade zone had fourteen corrupt officials are the real reason for high housing prices there are a large number of vacant houses but resources concentrated in the hands of a small number of people means real estate is in short supply for ordinary citizens to realize a reasonable price flattening corruption must be controlled one method can be the open auction of houses confiscated from corrupt officials 15 urbanization china s economy needs a new growth engine exports are weak during the third quarter of 2012 net exports contributed minus 5 5 percent to gdp and the recovery of european and american demand still needs time investment is already high the investment rate is up to 50 percent in china indicating the end of the government led investment era consumption is difficult to boost the reform of income distribution patterns is hard to push forward in this context the hope is that urbanization is the engine of growth for the next decade there is great potential since the current urbanization rate is slightly higher than 50 percent however for urbanization to make substantive progress we must start housing education and health care reforms 16 kill the national development and reform commission ndrc the essence of a market economy is the pursuit of maximum profits and effective competition and innovation follow suit the role of government is mainly as guardian of the economy maintaining rules for fair competition the government cannot be both referee and player and it shouldn t interfere in micro economic activity currently the national development and reform commission s main responsibilities have been reduced to examinations and approvals like its predecessor the state planning commission this is incompatible with the concept of building a socialist market economy for reform breakthroughs over the next ten years it would be feasible to dismiss the ndrc and set up an institution dedicated to the design and review of structural reform 17 judicial independence wu jinglian the economist says there are good market economies and bad market economies but a good market economy can only function under the rule of law without the rule of law sooner or later the economy will fall into a quagmire of crony capitalism due to current excessive government involvement in the economy coupled with a judicial system that is not independent law enforcement is selective and flexible as a result people don t trust the legal system and repeatedly resort to petitioning officials or mass incidents to strengthen the legal system we need to establish constitutional review as a starting point at the same time we must make the court system independent in financial and personnel matters which is the foundation of judicial independence 18 downsize and decentralize currently the government is too big it has too much power and control of resources an arrangement that will eventually strangle the vitality of the market economy reform essentially comes down to the government downsizing decentralizing and giving up profits recently the state council announced cancellations and adjustments for projects requiring administrative approval the new policy said the government would withdraw its involvement in matters that a citizen or organization can handle independently or for matters that can be regulated by market mechanisms and from matters do not require pre approval when they can be managed afterward or indirectly if these principles can be followed the next decade will mark another golden era
by casey barber cnn thinking about ditching the turkey this thanksgiving you re not the only one whether you re hosting a smaller group concerned about the rising cost of groceries or just looking for an excuse not to roast a bird this year there are a number or reasons to skip putting a big turkey on the table for those who have been choosing to eat more plant based meals holidays like thanksgiving have always been a balancing act between nostalgia and commitment however as food technology continues to develop meat and dairy free alternatives that are better and better at mimicking the usual ingredients it s becoming easier than ever to enjoy the traditional feast without the meat if you feel like flocking to a turkey free feast this year try these suggestions for a flavor packed thanksgiving meal with all the trimmings there s no nemed to put a whole bird on the table when you ve got this much goodness to share load up the table with lots of sides turkey might hog the spotlight when it comes to prep time but for many people thanksgiving sides are the true stars of the meal if you re trying more plant based cooking side dishes are also fairly easy to adjust for guests who are vegetarian dairy free gluten free or bringing other food allergies to the party apart from the turkey pretty much everything else you make on thanksgiving is indistinguishable if you make it with vegan butter and no chicken stock said joy manning a plant based recipe developer and food writer in philadelphia the two most beloved sides stuffing and mashed potatoes which vie with the turkey as the most satisfying ways of delivering gravy as well in my mind stuffing is really the thanksgiving centerpiece manning said with a nearly endless buffet of bread choices and add ins stuffing can be as simple or as well stuffed as you desire sourdough bread adds an earthy taste and chewy texture to traditional herb stuffing it s also the main element in the cult favorite artichoke parmesan stuffing recipe a vegetarian cornbread stuffing gets pops of texture from chopped nuts and apples mashed potatoes can also take on a variety of flavors to make them stand out as a starring dish garlic is a particularly friendly pairing to potatoes especially when it s roasted make roasted garlic rosemary mashed potatoes or garlic olive oil mashed potatoes or add in another vegetable like cauliflower the key to an all sides thanksgiving is to serve a diverse lineup of flavors and textures so you re not leaning too heavily on one element for a mix and match strategy pick one or two dishes from the following categories stuffing and bready carbs like dinner rolls soft and creamy mashed potatoes potato gratin corn pudding or macaroni and cheese roasted or sauteed vegetables brussels sprouts sweet potatoes carrots cauliflower or green beans tangy snappy and sweet typically cranberry relish or salads with ingredients such as cranberries and apples or pomegranate seeds and pears you can still have great gravy find a gentle way to break it to your aunts who have been fussing over the turkey drippings all these years they re not essential to the gravy after all make ahead gravy has been manning s and this writer s thanksgiving standard for years with no last minute drippings necessary this technique gets its rich flavor from a roux base of flour browned in fat such as olive oil butter or a vegan butter substitute along with quality stock the gravy can be made days in advance and reheated just before the meal is ready mushroom gravy is another tried and true plant based gravy option which can be made with cream or with vegetable stock for vegan guests using dried mushrooms is a two for one bonus their soaking liquid becomes part of the gravy to double up on the umami flavor as a gluten free option white bean gravy is thick and creamy with an added boost of protein other main courses while an all sides thanksgiving might sound like a dream dinner for some it might not feel complete to others luckily you don t have to forego a main dish entirely when planning a plant based thanksgiving thanksgiving is not my favorite holiday admitted montana horowitz a lawyer and mother of two in new jersey though she grew up in a big italian family where thanksgiving is out of control my dad makes two turkeys and then there s ham and pasta and rice balls she feels free to switch up the menu now that she and her husband follow a plant based diet i feel like i need some sort of main dish horowitz said so she pivots to mushroom wellington vegetable pot pie or vegan turk y cutlets that can be served as a main course with the same amount of fanfare as a turkey or roast on holidays when i make something like the wellington or even the cutlets i don t at all feel deprived manning also turns to pre made seitan cutlets for a small scale thanksgiving they re great for putting gravy on i can make as little or as much as i want and they re crammed with those thanksgiving spices like sage thyme and rosemary she said however if plant based meat substitutes aren t your ideal meal there are a host of equally impressive vegetable focused main dishes stir up a seasonally appropriate pumpkin risotto or bake a savory galette filled with wild mushrooms or caramelized leeks remember it s a holiday for sharing deciding to do thanksgiving without a turkey might ruffle the feathers of some family members so if someone else wants to cook a smaller cut of meat or even fish now s not the time to start a family feud i m doing thanksgiving collaboratively with my brother in law and he s going to do turkey breast manning said she is bringing her vegan cutlets to the six person celebration where family members who are curious can try them if they choose offering a plant based option gives people a chance to expand their palate and if it s one choice of many dishes on the table it s more likely to increase the odds of sampling and decrease resistance to a new

funds doubled in six months committing to invest in companies signed up to net zero but capitalism growth greenwashing and self seeking lobbying were denounced by activists and ngos as the root of the problem prince charles and carney were dismissed as little better than collaborators in our collective downfall in truth a complex but ultimately hopeful dance is being performed before our eyes the growing conviction of voters and consumers further intensified by environmental campaigners at cop26 that the climate crisis is real is forcing change last week rivalling in importance to what was unfolding at cop26 came the news from new york that electric pick up truck manufacture rivian hardly in production had floated for more than 100bn valuing it at more than ford and general motors it s the kind of mind boggling welcome wall street gave to young companies making petrol propelled cars a century ago money is flowing in epic volumes to those companies riding the new consumer tide driving gas guzzling pick ups while forests burn and hurricanes rip through the country with unprecedented force wins disapproving nods even in the darkest recesses of conservative america the same phenomenon is behind tesla s stunning 1tn valuation europeans the british in particular living in countries where the capitalism is more ossified don t get to see first hand how rapid economic transformation can be once entrepreneurs recognise where the new markets are developing they can do good and make billions view image in fullscreen climate activists and delegates stage a walkout in protest of the ongoing negotiation on day 13 of the cop26 climate talks in glasgow scotland photograph ewan bootman nurphoto rex shutterstock what we as individuals can do and how we think is too easily diminished by the despairing analysis that humanity is doomed by the refusal of governments and big companies to act yet confronted by mounting green convictions they are acting and with increasing urgency 130 countries including the us china and australia are making commitments to net zero carbon emissions sixty ftse 100 companies have signed up to the un s race to zero campaign our changing views count for proof look at how societies have progressed i remember when libertarians fulminated against requirements to wear seat belts councils now differentiate between recyclable and general household waste unthinkable 40 years ago the controversies over smoking in public places today no one wants to inhale secondary tobacco smoke and smoking is seen as antisocial it s the same story with gay marriage in all these areas the cultural change preceded and laid the basis for progressive legislation cementing what we wanted into law and could not be resisted however hard the right attempted obstruction the environmental genie is out of the bottle in europe greens are in government or coalition government in austria belgium finland ireland sweden and scotland and about to be in germany politicians are in the market for votes boris johnson who is closely tuned to voters preferences even if many in his party are not has been quick to mount a volte face over the climate crisis the consequences of the final cop26 outcome are not clear but more important is that it has happened at all the momentum to keep 1 5 alive is obvious and that is as vital as the detail what matters is how national governments and international agencies find ways of directing a capitalism that knows given what its markets want that it has to move in this direction here some models are better than others germany s social market economy is built on a dense interaction between state and business and a whole skein of public private institutions that ensure that its capitalism is responsive to societal and stakeholder wishes the transformation of the old iron and steel ruhr region into one of europe s greenest industrial structures could not be achieved without the german business bank the kfw or the way german companies embed social purpose in their corporate strategies the negotiations in berlin between potential coalition partners over the phasing out of coal and internal combustion engine production key green demands are protracted because once set they will be met in the us the extent to which politicians can muster the will to shape where wall street obviously wants to go or whether capitalism might find the capacity to do it on its own is an open question biden s ambitions to phase out coal have been thwarted for now by democratic senator joe manchin from coal state west virginia but the us asset management industry might achieve what politicians cannot coal mining may be investment starved out of business the us asset management industry might achieve what politicians cannot coal may be investment starved out of business the uk is the outlier suffering from the most ossified capitalism and a chronically underdeveloped framework between business and public institutions not for nothing even predating brexit has the uk stock market been the world s poorest performer for the past 20 years the concern about our lack of innovation to harness the opportunities now opening up even prompted sir patrick vallance and lord browne co chairs of the council of technology and science to write to the prime minister in september urging an overhaul of the financial system so it backs more risk even extraordinarily advocating the creation of a uk sovereign wealth fund amen to that capitalism as even marx conceded will ceaselessly seek out the new but it has to be shaped by democratic governments just as it built railways and steamships in the 19th century so it will build cars planes and ships propelled by ammonia hydrogen and electricity in the 21st it will build space based solar power stations supplying electricity to earth companies such as bp and shell if they want to exist at all will have to get out of the fossil fuel business by 2050 responding to shareholder pressure is what both have committed to do what is vital is not so much cop26 but rather the process movement and social change it represents humanity has to save itself it will be messy and imperfect but we ll get there
taylor sheridan makes movies and tv shows about rugged men doing rugged things in rugged locales on the heels of the return of his cable tv hit yellowstone he delivers more of the same with mayor of kingstown a 10 episode paramount drama nov 14 co created by and co starring yellowstone vet hugh dillon about mike mclusky the unofficial ruler of the fictional michigan city of kingstown home to seven prisons in a 10 mile radius a hardscrabble working class enclave where tensions run high between inmates and guards cops and drug dealers and criminals and civilians kingstown is a quagmire where everyone is literally and figuratively trapped by circumstance and position consequently it s mike s job to establish and maintain peace in a place that s known precious little of it as embodied by jeremy renner mike is an ex con who s at once grimly resigned to his fate as a kingstown lifer and a dreamer who longs to bolt for a wyoming school where they teach students to cook in dutch ovens and over open campfires it s a reverie of back to nature escape and coupled with mayor of kingstown s depiction of its urban setting a collection of gray stone and concrete jails run down projects and ramshackle offices it marks these proceedings as the flip side to sheridan s usual portrait of the rural west as the epicenter of american contentment mike is a lost soul caught between corrupting civilization and the liberating wild and it s in the former that he chooses to stay plying his trade alongside his older brother mitch kyle chandler and his younger cop sibling kyle taylor handley yellowstone your dad s favorite tv show returns with a bang and a whimper advertisement advertisement given that renner is the show s headliner it s reasonable to assume during the premiere that he s kingstown s de facto mayor however that title actually belongs to mitch a gregarious wheeler dealer who s followed in his dad s footsteps by serving as a borderline crooked facilitator for the many factions inhabiting this fraught environment sheridan doesn t come right out and explicate what mitch and sidekick mike s job entails and that vagueness carries over to an initial bit of conflict involving a young prison guard an incriminating letter that he wrote and is now in the possession of the crips gang and a blackmail scheme being orchestrated by the crips leader bunny tobi bamtefa who runs his drug dealing operation from a lawn chair outside his apartment building viewers are dropped into that plot thread in medias res and its particulars never make much sense nonetheless they also don t really matter since their purpose is merely to illustrate that mitch and mike spend their days and nights trying to keep things from exploding that quickly proves impossible thanks to an assignment mitch is stuck with courtesy of vera elizaveta neretin the stripper wife of criminal bigwig milo aidan gillen who wants mitch to retrieve a buried satchel containing 200 000 this is the sort of not quite legal toil that earns mitch and mike a living albeit apparently not a very lucrative one according to their mom miriam dianne wiest a hardcase who teaches history classes at the women s prison and is fiercely devoted to and protective of her boys in the first two episodes of mayor of kingstown which were all that was provided to process miriam serves little purpose but wiest s participation suggests she ll soon have a far bigger role to play in this saga at outset the focus is on mitch and mike whose situation becomes perilous when a hood named alberto michael reventar takes a liking to vera visits her at the club and then follows her back home to sexually assault her leading to a confrontation that ends in violence and tips alberto off to milo s loot there s a bombshell twist near the end of mayor of kingstown s first episode that canny viewers will see coming and it compels mike to reckon with his untenable state of affairs should he continue the family business despite hating it or should he take off while he s still breathing a mournful trip to his remote cabin results in an encounter with the very sort of imposing bear that he fears and as an individual committed to aiding various ferocious animals be they killers or federal agents who want to pay him to work as an informant mike naturally opts to feed the creature just as he soon decides that he belongs in kingstown his subsequent decision to accompany a woman and her mother to the lethal injection execution of their son quietly explaining each step of the process to them further illustrates his role as this area s chief mediator equal parts bagman gangster therapist pseudo cop and boatman on the river styx advertisement advertisement renner affects a haunted expression throughout mayor of kingstown s early going his world weariness only interrupted by flashes of fury when he or his comrades are threatened his mike believes that he s bending the law for the greater good upholding some semblance of order in a community that s constantly on the verge of chaos and renner s lived in performance is a solid axis around which sheridan builds his show s scenario unfortunately its initial two installments are largely setup only hinting at the messiness to follow much of which will apparently have to do with milo s decision to use working girl iris emma laird to control mike and by extension all of kingstown at present those plans are murky yet if sheridan s prior output is any indication including yellowstone which has delivered consistent intrigue via stories about powerful men who are besieged on all sides they should beget considerable suspense the real promise of mayor of kingstown comes from its chosen milieu which is comprised of stock elements cops killers prison guards grieving families exotic dancers etc but boasts uniquely tangled up power dynamics ripe for exploration rife with intersecting forces that both need and seek dominion over each other kingstown is a landscape unlike those usually traversed by sheridan or featured in the myriad prestige tv offerings that have preceded it whether sheridan and dillon can make it as compelling a venue to visit as montana remains to be seen but between their star and their setting they certainly have the pieces in place for a potential binge worthy affair read more at the
