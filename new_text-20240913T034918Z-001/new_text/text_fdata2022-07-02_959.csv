by ross kerber boston reuters activist investment leaders who have urged u s companies to cut carbon emissions said on friday they expect more such efforts following a milestone u s supreme court ruling on thursday that diminished the power of federal environmental regulators by constraining the u s environmental protection agency s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas fired power plants the court put responsibility on investors looking to slow climate change said andrew behar chief executive of the nonprofit group as you sow a which often files shareholder resolutions investors will likely launch more engagements with companies ahead of the 2023 annual meeting season behar said adding that executives lately have been more receptive to suggested changes all the models say climate change will be bad for business behar said in an interview the court s ruling he said means that corporations have even more responsibility to their stakeholders to limit emissions climate issues have gained new attention from top asset managers and executives as investors pour new cash into funds that use environmental social and governance esg metrics to pick stocks for instance among top u s utilities this year duke energy vowed to cut more emissions and southern co agreed to disclose more emissions details as part of deals with investors as you sow said via e mail a duke representative said we and many of our stakeholders share the view that we can take a leadership role in tackling greenhouse gas emissions associated with our business southern did not immediately comment mindy lubber president of ceres a boston climate advocacy group that works with asset managers and others said having invested heavily in clean power technologies like solar panels and battery storage utilities won t likely change course whatever regulations are limited by the court s decision everything is not going to stop and go backwards just because of the supreme court ruling lubber said rather utilities could face tougher requests from shareholders next year such as calls for more specific emission cut schedules or reviews of their lobbying activities she said thursday s ruling reduced the power of officials to use the landmark clean air act anti pollution law it is likely to have implications beyond the epa as it raises new legal questions about any big decisions made by federal agencies for instance the ruling could also spell trouble for an effort by a u s securities and exchange commission to force companies to disclose their emissions legal experts said investors have looked to standardized disclosures as a way to pressure heavy emitters reporting by ross kerber editing by david gregorio
photo credit alamy stock photo photo credit jessica kirsh shutterstock after a two year frenzy during the covid 19 pandemic the residential real estate market has begun to show signs of slowing down this spring and summer mortgage rates are on the rise and applications for home loans are down year over year housing inventory for sale is increasing and sellers are showing more willingness to lower their asking prices while there are recent signs that the market is balancing out the last two years brought unprecedented growth in home values to the benefit of current owners and homebuilders with low interest rates homebuyers were able to borrow more money and pay more for homes this sent prices to record levels and with values rising quickly builders have rushed to build housing the number of units currently under construction is at its highest level since the 1970s advertisement article continues below this ad the value of new residential units had already been on a steady upward trajectory since the collapse of the housing bubble and ensuing great recession in the mid 2000s after bottoming out at around 95 billion in 2009 the annual value of new housing units nearly tripled over the next decade to 280 billion in 2019 but this growth accelerated even further during the covid 19 pandemic with new units valued at 307 billion in 2020 and leaping to 380 billion last year the spike in new home values came amid a period of historically low interest rates as the u s federal reserve attempted to stimulate the economy during the covid 19 pandemic as the central bank of the u s the fed s monetary policy moves affect how much it costs other banks and in turn their customers to borrow the fed sent its effective federal funds rate to near zero early in 2020 and kept rates low for the next two years but now with persistent inflation widely affecting every corner of the economy the fed has begun to raise interest rates to tamp down borrowing and cool the economy and more increases are on the horizon this year as costs to borrow increase fewer homebuyers will seek mortgages and financing for new construction projects will become more expensive advertisement article

introduction on 15 june 2022 the securities and exchange commission sec issued a request for comment on certain information providers acting as investment advisers request 1 the request addresses three categories of what the sec refers to as information providers or providers index providers model portfolio providers and pricing services 2 the sec is seeking comment with respect to information providers whose activities in whole or in part may cause them to meet the definition of investment adviser under the investment advisers act of 1940 advisers act 3 and whether these information providers meet the definition of being an investment adviser to an investment company under the investment company act of 1940 1940 act 4 historically information providers have not been subject to regulation under the advisers act due to the nature of their services and products the request suggests that the sec is reconsidering information provider status under the advisers act comments are due on the later of 1 16 august 2022 or 2 30 days after the request is published in the federal register as discussed further in this alert advisers act regulation of information providers would potentially bring a range of new requirements and considerations to the provider industry from uniform application for investment adviser registration form adv filings and new disclosure obligations to the adoption of compliance programs and the hiring of chief compliance officers ccos to heightened responsibilities that come along with being considered a fiduciary the sec in its request is giving the information provider industry and other interested parties the opportunity to voice views on the appropriateness of such a change we expected that the industry will take up this invitation changing times the request notes the role of information providers has grown in size and scope in the asset management industry in recent years and states that the information providers operations raise potential concerns about investor protection and market risk citing front running trades and conflicts of interest concerns 5 when discussing each type of provider the sec focuses on the amount of discretion each provider has in rendering their products and services index providers index providers generally create maintain operate calculate and publish financial and securities indices and license them to third parties for use in managing investment products the sec observes that index providers have significant discretion in creating and maintaining financial indices in some cases without publicly disclosing their index methodologies or rules 6 the sec sees this discretion being exercised at index design reconstitution rebalancing and in response to index component corporate events i e mergers reorganizations etc the request further remarks on the specialization of indices index customization and the bespoke nature of certain indices 7 the sec asserts that index providers are making active decisions with respect to their indices created for the purpose of licensing to sponsors of investment products and concludes that the inclusion or exclusion of index components drives advisers decision to buy or sell those securities for their clients 8 model portfolio providers model portfolio providers include broker dealers asset managers third party strategists asset allocators and advisers 9 the request observes that these providers design rebalance over time and can customize their models which can be used on a discretionary or non discretionary basis the request includes direct indexing in the model portfolio category 10 pricing services pricing services provide prices valuations and additional data about a particular investment pricing services are also called valuation agents or providers of fairness opinions 11 pricing services provide pricing services when market quotations are not available or over the counter markets render incomplete information necessary for the pricing of a security the sec asserts pricing services may exercise significant discretion as to valuation methodology inputs further value adjustments and meeting user raised challenges 12 the sec also notes that different pricing services may produce different values for the same securities and that the same service may also offer different pricing levels for the same security depending on methods and needs 13 the request reflects a belief by the sec that the discretionary aspects of provider products and services alone warrant the application of the advisers act regulatory regime to providers notably the release does not discuss any past or present complaints abuses frauds investor losses investor confusion market manipulations market disruptions or other bad or malicious effects attributable to these information providers the process initiated by the request is designed to facilitate the sec s consideration of whether given the national presence that certain information providers are able to have regulatory action by the sec is necessary or appropriate any advisers act information provider regulatory regime ultimately adopted should be expected to impose new and significant costs and burdens on providers which may ultimately be passed on to customers and investors that rely on provider products and services among other things a new sec information provider regulatory regime may subject information providers to the same requirements and responsibilities as registered investment advisors including new fiduciary or fiduciary like obligations to customers or investors or other end users sec registration on and annual renewal filings of form adv and mandated document deliveries to customers or investors or other end users mandated contractual provisions governing customer relationships cco designations and the development and implementation of written compliance manuals and codes of ethics increased costs of compliance and sec routine and for cause inspections in addition the wider investment management and financial services industries may experience costs from sec regulation of information providers these costs may be among other things the passing through of new compliance expenses to investors reduced competition in the industry and declining innovation to meet investor needs information providers and fiduciary duty the sec makes clear in the request that it is considering whether providers have fiduciary obligations to those who use their services question 8 asks whether providers view themselves as having fiduciary obligations their view of the scope of such obligations whether they have a narrower view of such obligations than a traditional client facing adviser and how providers address conflicts of interest in their business relationships 14 presently providers have a commercial relationship with their customers defined by contract the federal imposition of fiduciary obligation on a provider may create obligations owed directly to customers licensees and buyers or indirectly to end users or third party beneficiaries such as fund shareholders or advisory clients in this respect adviser act regulation of providers would represent a fundamental change in nature of the business relationships of providers with their customers provider relationships would no longer be governed solely by their contracts but also by federal regulation which among other things would establish a fiduciary duty including duties of loyalty and care in all aspects of their operations even if the sec ultimately does not impose full investment adviser fiduciary duties on providers it may still attempt to impose regulatory obligations relating to among other things suitability standards conflicts of interest mandates or prohibitions regulatory anti fraud liability recordkeeping standards and required disclosure or document delivery i e a form adv brochure to end users of their products and services the sec s potential fundamental reframing of a provider s relationship with its customer licensee or buyer to be a fiduciary or fiduciary like one is expected to generate a significant amount of comments on question 8 alone publisher s exclusion targeted the sec states that historically many information providers have relied on the publisher s exclusion from registration as an investment adviser under section 2 a 11 of the advisers act 15 and discusses the fact that information providers frequently rely on the publishers exclusion from registration provided in advisers act section 2 a 11 d the request describes the elements of the publisher s exclusion from registration under the advisers act section 2 a 11 d which excludes from being an investment adviser the publisher of any bona fide newspaper news magazine or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation 16 the request describes the interpretation of the publisher s exclusion by the 1985 supreme court in the lowe decision but states that given the passage of time and the development of new business models since 1985 the staff of the sec is considering the extent to which information provider activities raise investment adviser status questions and whether the applicability of the publishers exclusion to information provider activities should be reevaluated 17 this part of the request is expected to generate many comments the requests for comment a total evaluation of investment adviser status the specific questions of the request demonstrate that the sec is considering whether and to what extent that the information providers should register as investment advisors and be subject to all aspects of the advisers act the request has two general questions concerning defining information providers their risks and conflicts of interest and their numbers in the united states request questions 3 to 16 generally seek information about information providers under the advisers act including whether the sec should create an exemption for providers question 15 and the economic benefits and costs of regulating providers as investment advisers question 16 questions 17 to 21 target index providers question 22 model portfolio providers and questions 23 and 24 pricing services questions 25 to 29 deal with advisers act registration issues questions 30 to 32 address the applicability of the entirety of the advisers act to providers who register under the act the impact on providers and investors and whether any sec regulatory regime for information providers ought to be aligned with the regime of the european securities and market authority and its eu benchmarks regulation questions 33 and 34 solicit responses concerning adviser act reporting and disclosure obligations for providers finally the request discusses 1940 act issues presented by information providers including the 1940 act s separate definition of an investment adviser to a fund under questions 35 to 40 potential significant increase in adviser regulation information providers as well as advisers funds and investors relying on information provider products and services all should be aware of the potential consequences costs and compliance repercussions of any rulemaking that may ultimately result from the request in addition to the consequences highlighted above such regulation may also be expected to reduce investment product and advisory service offerings to investors if costs cannot be shifted to investors result in the closure of some funds or other investment products if the existing and any replacement provider refuses or is unable to satisfy the regulatory requirements impose barriers to entry to new potential information providers or cause existing information providers to consolidate with other providers or shut down entirely reduce the sophistication and future innovation in investment strategies available to retail investors if financial index or model construction is required to be simplified in order to avoid regulation by the sec as an investment adviser or otherwise and impose additional burdens on registered fund boards and product sponsors for the oversight of index providers model providers or pricing services who become subject to sec regulation including in the context of registered funds subjecting information providers that are deemed to be investment advisers to the shareholder and board approval requirements of section 15 of the 1940 act conclusion the request is far reaching in scope concerning information providers while the request seeks comment on the costs and burdens associated with advisers act regulation of providers it does not articulate any specific problems in the industry other than some vague sec concerns and observation of discretionary activity by providers the scope of the request leads us to expect that the request will generate a significant amount of public comment footnotes 1 sec release nos ia 6050 ic 34618 file no s7 18 22 which can be found at this link 2 as an indication that the sec may be considering widening the scope of its regulatory jurisdiction the request seeks comment on whether any other types of information provider should be regulated by the sec other than the three types considered in the request see request at 15 question 2 are there any other types of information providers whose activities in whole or in part may raise investment adviser status issues if so which providers and why 3 id at 1 summary 4 id at 28 31 5 id at 3 and 5 6 id at 4 5 and n 6 7 id at 4 and 6 8 id at 6 9 id at 7 see id at n 13 this discussion focuses on third party model portfolio providers that sell models to wealth managers that apply them to client portfolios versus internal firm models this discussion includes as third party model portfolio providers those persons who make available their own portfolios so that others can copy or license those portfolios in exchange for compensation portfolios may be made available through the provider s online platform 10 id at 8 and n 15 11 id at 9 and n 19 12 id at 10 13 the request discusses 1940 act rule 2a 5 s adoption which recognized the role pricing services play in fair valuation determinations by fund boards while noting the risks and conflicts of pricing services in particular the request states staff have also observed compliance issues in connection with registrants interactions with third party pricing services including the risks of misleading disclosure regarding whether those services provide independent values and the possibility of stale or otherwise inaccurate valuations this statement is solely based on an sec compliance alert from july 2008 on deficiencies and weaknesses related to reliance on third party pricing services for valuing high yield municipal bonds id at 11 and n 23 see compliance alert sec division of examinations july 2008 available at 14 id at 17 15 under section 2 a 11 an investment adviser is defined to mean means any person who for compensation engages in the business of advising others either directly or through publications or writings as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities or who for compensation and as part of a regular business issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities 16 id at 14 the request also addresses the supreme court s interpretation of the publisher s exclusion where a qualifying publication i provides only impersonal advice ii is bona fide meaning that it provides genuine and disinterested commentary and iii is of general and regular circulation rather than issued from time to time in response to

question answer good morning is there an issue with eibd and the big picture i can t log in and see it thanks it s working normally for me give customer service a call and see if they can figure it out 1 800 831 2525 any shorting opportunity do you stil think we will have another leg down seems a little late for aggressive shorting to me though some setups are out there i wouldn t be surprised to see some back and forth that can make it difficult to play on either side what were the tickers of dan again jks dq enph what camera is dan using he looks crisp we look muddy i ll have to ask him after the show for panel discussion i know canslim doesnt support this question but i m curious what stocks would you buy and forget i have 2 kids under 7 and want to buy a great companies in the pullback and then forget it until college tuition time apple amazon alphabet thoughts we would go with broadly diversified funds for buy and forget justin fantastic podcast this week would you give thought to doing a podcast devoted to bill s biggest winners and how he handled the positions this would provide the initial buy points and allow us to see what bill was looking at when he entered the trades appreciate the history you provide thanks bill i may be going through some of those on ibd live actually like i did with biib not losing big is the single most important factor for winning big as a speculator losing is not a choice but how much you lose is minervini mark think trade like a champion the secrets rules blunt truths of a stock market wizard p 64 couldn t agree more this guy dan is pretty sharp always an outstanding guest great guy we ve heard a lot about selling into strength and selling in increments what about on the other side where you have a stop loss in place do you sell the entire position or use the same incremental approach i like to have an absolute line in the sand to get out but i m usually out before that line gets hit or at the very least i ve already started my selling fyi your title name bubbles on zoom look great but they cover 20 of your panelist thumb nails it s helpful for people to know our guest s name and title so we are displaying ours as well chips haven t bottomed out not yet still heading lower as our economy crashes i wonder if price of oil will also go down unemployed folks don t use much oil it ll have an impact it s just that demand has been so much higher than supply i know i can be blunt but boy are we so negative is there anything postitive out there yep each day that goes by is one day closer to an improving market what does ms growth rate refer to eps and over what period yes it s an annualized eps growth rate over 3 5 years based on the data tsco is it a short here failure at the 50dma perhaps general mkt conditions are more a marekt to sit on the sidelines i d agree first test of resistance of the falling 10 week ma after its late stage base breakout at 236 73 failed and tsco fell 8 that breakout failure was the ibd style first short sale opportunity the risks here imho would be 1 rs line rising pretty well so a little better than other retailers 2 we re still technically in uptrend under pressure 3 please check out 6 17 down session heavy volume but it finished near the middle of day s range that suggests support hatman bought back into enph as it entered the buy zone again nice bounce off that 10 week ma hat man ii dq fund ownership actually down over last report yep it s a concern something to pay attention to it is not insignificant but it does not negate a good technical picture what it might indicate is that a breakout just might not have a lot of momentum if it s not under fund accumulation then any breakout might be short lived quick trade gessel rally go go go there we go love the steve miller trade nice analogy dan in the us solar stocks interested in sedg vs enph i think enph has a better technical picture and the growth is stronger right now but it s kind of a close call compare the rs rating enph is doing much better than sedg hope that helps dq only rydex electronics quality owner chinese stock dan does the lack of quality owners concern you yep no of funds owning the stock has actually declined slightly over the past year 515 to 499 so yeah that s something to pay attention to hope that makes sense frank great stuff dan thanks scott swav like the tight closing prices for tuesday through thursday today its tightening with volume drying up 50 day trying to turn up 200 day flat totally agree w the analysis here peter so does eagle eye can we short sbux in hindsight we now know that the march move up to the 50 day 10 week was a supreme short sale opp this arose after the stock failed to break out of a consolidation in dec and then broke down through its moving averages now it s showing bigger volume on up days vs down days perhaps another move back below the 50 day line in volume would be a good trigger watch for q2 results hatman dan how do you gauge your risk reward ratios i e technical levels previous moves etc thank you each stock is different but my approach is technical levels support and resistance but re probable reward definitely i look at previous moves and i pay attention to the prior channel as i discussed in enph i look for tightening patterns along the 50 day moving average if it s tight it s right that s a setup that typically leads to an explosion make sense shane dan s musical references remind me of mike webster same here cost thoughts please having a little trouble at 50 day but solid gain w volume thursday still looks vulnerable to me ali a little later at the right time can we get dan to sing a short tune for us i like that idea rprx great setup just not that keen on recent earnings sales could work though as flows to biotech vrtx and lly acting well live answered waiting for volume to come into pwr before i nibble good idea also ken and i just looked at the chart and think it s getting a little more wide and loose lately than we d prefer hatman any news on imxi looks like a potential breakout one of the best stocks on the nasdaq jay what about shorting emerging markets eev seems to be under accumulation and in a good technical setup the ultimate goal is to short weak performers justin what was the day of the ibd live biib review i will go back and watch the show we cut out that section of the show it s on the ibd youtube channel and in the ibd live highlights playlist at investors com videos chris defense stocks sales eps are showing negative that doesn t bother you great point sara amid all of the nato and taiwan related news we should keep an eye on quarterly results and the potential for upward revisions to estimates lmt has blue dot holding up better than most stocks indeed rprx bottom base of 17 and getting handle of 5 someone just pointed out that fcntx has been increasing its position aggressively in rprx usa ism manufacturing for jun 53 000 vs 54 900 est prior 56 100 thanks michael def more evidence of slowing economic growth tbt is this trade over as it broke it s 50d inflation is still in play and the fed is going to continue what it s doing or is everything just going to roll over it looks like major support is around 24 5 from a purely technical perspective it seems like a big break below 24 42 the low of the recent flat base pattern would be significant really dan a bad joke about daco daca please keep your political opinions out of this forum thank you all good we all speak somethimes without thinking just not here please give me a break it was an offhand remark take a breath i like the new zoom webinar background and panelist captions it would look even better if everyone used same background idealy a solid color perhaps blue with the ibd logo in the lower right corner i heard that zoom added or is soon adding this support for webinars just a thought thanks for sharing that john our marketing team has changed the blue color for email content it s much brighter but some of the panelists are using backgrounds with the original blue i am down 25 on zim should have sold it a long time ago but didn t think its likely to come back has a decent dividend now but think shippers will come back i don t know there s a reason why the pes were so low earnings surge and then crash with demand down shipping rates are falling sharply may not impact business in the latest quarter but going forward yesterday was end oh 1st half of the year how important is that cutoff for market volume etc people used to say end of quarters and end of half years etc made funds inclined to window dress a bit and try and make the market look better than it realy is by buying into the close i didnt see much of that yesterday actually we saw it in the defense stocks and some others i was surprised to see the volume spike in noc it was running well below average when we discussed it for swingtrader daqo better than daca really jim that was your opening jest you ought to apologize to our audience some of whom may actually be daca before this program ends how insensitive that was ibd moderators coming on the heels of jim roeppel s unless the golden goose of capitalism gets suffocated by socialism red baiting last friday we re starting to wonder if you d sanction the recent murdoch takeover doing to ibd what it did to fox as broadcasters you ve done such a splendid job until now keeping the atmosphere of our discussions clean of political distortion so please during your pre opening meetings with guests remind them to park their poisonous prejudices at the door they re hardly innocent remarks appreciate your comment here and it s my impression dan was not referring at all to daca and this significant and important issue for the country the company s name daqo energy does not at all look similar to the acronym for deferred action for childhood arrivals policy nor should it be pronounced dah kah we totally understand the need to be sensitive to such issues and are trying our best to keep the content show free of all political or politicized content thank you very much for supporting ibd live hatman mark is a master totally agree fernando ken i did notice on the rprx tha the contra fund has been active within the recnt base that s very interesting can you tell me again how you get the minervini screens it went by so fast i didn t get it to get to all the minervini lists go to the bottom panel and scroll down to reports stocks and then techincal that are in that folder chris zroz is doing the same thing as tlt going up in big volumn seems like most of these bond etfs are retaking the 50 day hrmy moved out today showing strength in this weak market dan would lng be an example of a tightening range it s getting there but you d want to wait for the stock to set up better i think it ll take several weeks fora ny kind of setup 50 day ma is drifting lower making lower highs and lows might ultimately turn out to be a meeting of the 50 and 200 day ma and that could present an opportunity technically that s not likely to happen for another month or 2 but the wild card is earnings on 8 4 for an example of a tightening pattern look at the stock in mid april 2021 early august and the late dec early jan setups all close to the 50 day ma all trending sideways and not sloppy hope this helps i know gold and silver is still very far away from breaking out however i was just wondering what levels to watch for gld slv and also if there are any aggressive ways to play a potential gold or silver breakout i ve got downtrend alerts on both gld looks like it would be more likely to trigger what caused the huge uptick in may for uthr fda approved a lung disease therapy they re involved with vrtx looking at an inside week live answered sitm just triggered my short entry alert yes its down considerably from 342 77 but i don t see any support levels i will take a very small position note all my short position are minimal pilot tests nice to see some volume on the downside today that s been missing on so many setups both long and short in regards to dan s 50 day tightness for low risk buys i would love to get his take on the recent pull backs in the energy sector too steep shane lots of supply overhead the selloff was steep and left a lot of unhappy bulls behind this will take a while to resolve i think that trade is over unh live answered is there a way to determine what a company s fiscal year quarterly cycle is in other words when is its first qtr on marketsmith look on the left side with the years eps just below the year headline you ll see a month like dec that marks when the fiscal year ends thank you dan nice to have dan back dan s thoughts on rcmt live answered great acronym rhrn right here right now gm dave thanks have a great 4th of july phil que jesus jones right here right now great song there we go shane have you looked at alks watching looks like it s starting to form a handle i spoke with a broker yesterday and for the 1st time since 2017 2018 he discussed cd s treasuries and money market rates offered a 3 callable 1 yr cd which to some investors may be attractive for risk aversion point being institutions may be pivoting to fixed income and pushing it to the retailer investor which could explain the rise in tlt etc certainly supports what we re seeing would you please take a look at ottr it is a blue dot nearing the pivot and has good fundamentals hi jonathan otter tail has def held up better than most stocks and to me it truly earns its 99 composite on the weekly chart it shows five up weeks in heavy volume over the past two months impressive 1 8 up down vol 2 5 yield i d like to know more about its various business divisions as a diversified operations firm and why the 2022 eps estimate is so solid up 29 to 5 46 a breakout past 69 02 in heavy volume would spur a buy but general market risk remains high more reasons to short live answered can we ask dan about hhs much too extended to buy odds are high that this one will pause pull in after such a big move this is great was hpoing that dan would confirm the prior history as being what he would consider something to watch thanks nice rcmt is a hotel california stock you can check in any time you want but you can never leave illiquid ha ha good one eric indeed all individuals should be mindful of the average daily volume here just 288 000 shares a day and 5 6 mil per day as some of our panelists including dryan have said you don t want to be more than 5 to 10 of the average volume it seems like dan was describing a ponzi scheme in a stock like rcmt do you believe that exists in thin stocks dan thank you absolutely it can be one of those pump dump stocks that s one of the reasons i just stay away from the illiquid stuff it s gambling nothing more could dan do a screen share and set up a tc2000 bb scan avgc20 2 sqr 20 c c c1 c1 c2 c2 c3 c3 c4 c4 c5 c5

san francisco mark zuckerberg has a message for meta employees buckle up for tough times ahead at an internal meeting on thursday mr zuckerberg the chief executive of meta said the silicon valley company was facing one of the worst downturns that we ve seen in recent history according to copies of his comments that were shared with the new york times he told meta s 77 800 workers that they should prepare to do more work with fewer resources and that their performances would be graded more intensely than previously mr zuckerberg added that the company which owns facebook instagram and other apps was lowering its hiring targets meta now plans to bring on 6 000 to 7 000 new engineers this year down from a previous goal of around 10 000 he said in some areas hiring will pause entirely especially of junior engineers though the head count will increase in other parts of the business he said i think some of you might decide that this place isn t for you and that self selection is ok with me mr zuckerberg said on the call realistically there are probably a bunch of people at the company who shouldn t be here the c e o s comments which were some of the most sharply worded ones he has made to employees reflect the degree of difficulty that meta is facing with its business the company which for years went from strength to strength financially has been in an unfamiliar position this year as it has struggled while it enjoyed strong growth in the early parts of the pandemic it has more recently grappled with upheaval in the global economy as inflation and interest rates rise

outperforming the tsx dollarama offers its shoppers great values which becomes all the more desirable in an inflationary environment like today s as a result the discount retailer enjoys stable revenue and earnings growth in almost all economic cycles thus investors perceive it as a safe haven and take shelter in dol when the broader markets turn rough if the economy indeed slips into a

oil prices wti crude dipped last month but taking a long term view oil looks set for a solid year one of the big factors contributing to the recent dip in oil prices was the u s strategic petroleum reserve release that added some supply to the market but it won t last forever there is only so much oil in the reserve in the meantime opec is out of spare capacity and the eu still plans to cease 90 of russian oil imports by the end of the year so oil will likely end the year strong cenovus energy benefits from high oil prices because it extracts and sells oil its business is based on selling oil as well as selling gasoline at gas stations business is booming this year in its most recent quarter cve s cash from operations increased 499 and net income increased 639 it was a strong showing yet

despite having a well diversified business line brookfield asset management has managed to outperform the canadian stock market s returns on a consistent basis in recent years the short term

is substantiated in all three instances the claim about tucker carlson s 1 willed inheritance appeared without any context or substantiating links we initially located a passing mention of the claim in a 2019 washington post article which would be inaccessible behind a paywall to many readers hoping to verify or debunk it does not drink or smoke and carlson announced in a surprise on air celebration of his 50th birthday in may that he had recently stopped a 36 year habit of chewing nicorette gum which he did when he wasn t chewing tobacco born in san francisco carlson attended elite

action underlying the court s opinion it indicated carlson s mother was initially believed to have died intestate before a valid will was later discovered this litigation arises out of the kern county

the remaining two thirds split equally between her estranged sons from a prior marriage respondents tucker carlson and buckley carlson the carlsons after the order implementing that distribution was entered in 2013 lisa s will leaving everything to michael was discovered this appeal though not pursued directly by michael is part of his attempt to obtain ownership of all the oil and gas royalties once paid to lisa the carlsons oppose michael s efforts they are respondents in this appeal later under facts the sum of 1 left to carlson and his brother appeared with respect to the content of his

this is the 14th package of military weapons and equipment transferred to ukraine from defense department stocks since august 2021 washington the u s announced on friday that it will provide ukraine with 820 million in new military aid including new surface to air missile systems and counter artillery radars to respond to russia s heavy reliance on long range strikes in the war russia in recent days has launched dozens of missiles across ukraine and pinned down ukrainian forces with continuous fire for sometimes hours at a time ukraine s leaders have publicly called on western allies to quickly send more ammunition and advanced systems that will help them narrow the gap in equipment and manpower all told the u s has committed more than 8 8 billion in weapons and military training to ukraine whose leaders have sought more help from western allies to repel larger and heavily equipped russian forces about 7 billion of that aid has been announced since russia s february invasion we are going to support ukraine as long as it takes president joe biden said this week at a press conference during the nato summit in madrid he argued that russia had already suffered a blow to its international standing and major damage to its economy from western sanctions imposed over the invasion the u s is giving ukrainians the capacity so that they can continue to resist the russian aggression biden said and so i don t know how it s going to end but it will not end with a russian defeat of ukraine in ukraine much of the aid formally announced friday will take weeks or months to reach ukraine as part of the new package the u s will purchase two systems known as nasams a norwegian developed anti aircraft system that is used to protect the airspace around the white house and capitol in washington a senior defense official told reporters the nasams are intended to help ukraine transition away from using soviet era air defense systems that besides being well known to the russians have to be repaired with spare parts that are hard to procure the official briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss military assessments the pentagon will also provide the ukrainians with up to 150 000 rounds of 155 millimeter artillery ammunition given the high usage of artillery on both sides it s unclear how long those new rounds would last the official declined to say how many estimated rounds ukraine and russia are firing daily and the pentagon will also buy four counter artillery radars for ukraine those new purchases funded by the pentagon s ukraine security assistance initiative require weeks at a minimum for defense companies to build ukrainians are also being trained to use the newly provided systems the pentagon will also provide additional ammunition for medium range rocket systems it provided ukraine in june known as the high mobility artillery rocket systems or himars the ammunition will come from the defense department s own inventory under what s known as drawdown authority and will be made available to ukraine more quickly this is the 14th package of military weapons and equipment transferred to ukraine from defense department stocks since august 2021 the war has evolved into a grinding stalemate in which both sides are heavily reliant on artillery according to western officials and analysts while russia has not achieved its initial goals of toppling ukraine s government it is believed to be making slow progress in consolidating control over the eastern ukrainian region known as the donbas
as trading kicks off for the month of july and the second half of the year investors are hoping for a third quarter rebound it s been a brutal year so far in financial markets the s p 500 is down over 20 bitcoin has crashed by 60 bonds have provided no safe haven amid hot inflation and spiking mortgage rates point to a potential calamity in the housing market as for gold the monetary metal is essentially flat for the year it may not be cause for celebration but gold holders have at least obtained some shelter from broader market volatility metals markets are caught between the forces of inflation and the threat of recession signs point to an economic downturn already being underway it could be accelerated by another outsized federal reserve rate hike later this month the fed continues to feel pressure to do something about inflation the central bank s preferred core personal consumption expenditures index came in this week at 4 7 that represents a decrease for the third consecutive month although the annual rate remains well above the fed s 2 target the core rate also excludes food and energy costs factoring those critical costs of living back in puts the pce at 6 3 alternative measures show inflation is running even hotter but the recent plunge in commodity prices is likely to provide at least some temporary respite from inflation running at multi decade highs whether inflation is truly contained remains to be seen fed policymakers may be forced to scale back their tightening campaign if financial markets continue to plunge and the economy inches closer to recession political pressures will also be bearing down on the federal reserve board as the mid term elections approach president joe biden claims he supports the fed s independence and isn t trying to sway monetary policy decisions but at the same time he has been moving to try remake the fed into a more partisan institution and force it to pursue a radical new mandate for woke social engineering biden recently cheered the house of representatives for narrowly passing the so called financial services racial equity inclusion and economic justice act the act requires the fed to exercise all duties and functions in a manner that fosters the elimination of disparities across racial and ethnic groups with respect to employment income wealth and access to affordable credit that means the central bank will have to veer from its dual mandate of full employment and price stability to prioritize race in monetary policy decisions and regulatory actions the same central planners who failed to anticipate the high rates of inflation their policies have caused will now be tasked with using their tools to engineer equal outcomes among groups earlier this year biden appointed radical activist lisa cook to the fed s board of governors cook has called for a racial reckoning that might among other things include reparations for slavery last year the federal reserve bank of boston put out a paper calling for restorative housing reparations if there s any silver lining for the sound money movement it s that the overt politicization of the fed will hasten the fall of public trust in it from falsely proclaiming that inflation would be transitory to more recently denying that a recession is coming the fed has already lost a great deal of credibility with the public it will lose even more if it goes full marxist on redistributing wealth other countries that have tried empowering central banks to radically reshape society have gone down the road to hyperinflation and economic ruin such an outcome can potentially be avoided if voters force the political trajectory in washington to shift but it is still prudent to prepare for a worst case scenario just in case collapsing confidence in central bankers is an opportunity for sound money advocates and precious metals investors the more apparent it becomes that the fed is wielding its tools for ends other than a stable currency the more people will realize the need for a sound alternative the soundest currencies historically have been gold and silver they remain irreplaceable today as the ultimate stores of real wealth

by ross kerber boston reuters activist investment leaders who have urged u s companies to cut carbon emissions said on friday they expect more such efforts following a milestone u s supreme court ruling on thursday that diminished the power of federal environmental regulators by constraining the u s environmental protection agency s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas fired power plants the court put responsibility on investors looking to slow climate change said andrew behar chief executive of the nonprofit group as you sow a which often files shareholder resolutions investors will likely launch more engagements with companies ahead of the 2023 annual meeting season behar said adding that executives lately have been more receptive to suggested changes all the models say climate change will be bad for business behar said in an interview the court s ruling he said means that corporations have even more responsibility to their stakeholders to limit emissions climate issues have gained new attention from top asset managers and executives as investors pour new cash into funds that use environmental social and governance esg metrics to pick stocks for instance among top u s utilities this year duke energy vowed to cut more emissions and southern co agreed to disclose more emissions details as part of deals with investors as you sow said via e mail a duke representative said we and many of our stakeholders share the view that we can take a leadership role in tackling greenhouse gas emissions associated with our business duke had previously said the supreme court ruling will not immediately impact its coal plant retirement dates including a full exit from coal by 2035 a southern representative said the company has a long term constructive relationship with as you sow and many other investors and environmental stakeholders and appreciates that stakeholders are interested in understanding the company s path to net zero the company is still reviewing the supreme court decision the representative said mindy lubber president of ceres a boston climate advocacy group that works with asset managers and others said having invested heavily in clean power technologies like solar panels and battery storage utilities won t likely change course whatever regulations are limited by the court s decision everything is not going to stop and go backwards just because of the supreme court ruling lubber said rather utilities could face tougher requests from shareholders next year such as calls for more specific emission cut schedules or reviews of their lobbying activities she said thursday s ruling reduced the power of officials to use the landmark clean air act anti pollution law it is likely to have implications beyond the epa as it raises new legal questions about any big decisions made by federal agencies for instance the ruling could also spell trouble for an effort by a u s securities and exchange commission to force companies to disclose their emissions legal experts said investors have looked to standardized disclosures as a way to pressure heavy emitters reporting by ross kerber editing by david gregorio
democrat organizations are pouring money into republican primary races backing the most radical of right wing candidates so far democrats have spent more than 20 million in advertising for republican candidates particularly those farthest to the right democrats are hoping they can win more easily if their candidates are running against a more trump supporting far right candidate rather than a moderate one the strategy is a risky one and so far has yielded mixed results after a series of primary elections in june only one of the three far right candidates democrats threw money behind won their primary republican illinois state sen darren bailey won his primary becoming the republican nominee for the illinois governor election the democrat governor s association spent over 15 million running ads portraying bailey as extremely conservative during the primary race the ads highlighted bailey s anti gun control stance pro life views and former president donald trump s endorsement the purpose of the ads was to increase bailey s support in the primary but dga funded ads against bailey s opponent richard irvin accused him of getting rich while putting violent criminals back on our streets while he was a defense attorney bailey s opponent in the general election democratic gov jb pritzker also threw money behind bailey s opponent between the two of them pritzker and the dga spent more than 30 million on ads attacking irvin but two other dga funded candidates didn t fare as well in the june primaries colorado congressional primary candidates state rep ron hanks and weld county commissioner lori saine lost their primaries despite ample funding from democratic organizations colorado gop house candidate lori saine who was supported by pelosi pac loses primary pic twitter com r98rsl7ff3 new york post nypost june 29 2022 the group democratic colorado reportedly spent as much as 2 million promoting hanks candidacy hanks opponent joe o dea a self described republican joe manchin was much less beatable than hanks or so the democrats were betting hanks has said he believes the 2020 election was stolen even marching to the capitol on jan 6 2020 saine another candidate supported by the democrats lost her primary despite democrats throwing money behind her house majority pac associated with house speaker nancy pelosi spent 46 000 on advertisements in her district the ads harped on saine s opposition to gun control and abortion and her support for trump s political priorities by the numbers democratic groups have spent well over 42m so far to meddle in gop primaries on behalf of right wing maga candidates josh kraushaar joshkraushaar june 28 2022 the same pelosi backed group supported a far right candidate in the california republican primary pelosi s group paid for an ad that supported a more conservative candidate chris mathys against his moderate opponent mathys still lost the primary despite democratic support but is the democratic party s risky midterm strategy really working the tactic doesn t appear to be moving republican primaries their way in the first place many of the far right candidates democrat groups threw money behind ended up losing anyway besides that the democrat party may be ignoring the possibility that a candidate further to the right could actually be more popular in times of economic and geopolitical unrest americans are unhappy with a status quo that has brought them high gas prices a war in europe and record inflation a recent associated press norc center for public affairs research poll found that 85 of americans think the country is headed in the wrong direction among republicans that number is at 92 the economy is an issue that affects all americans and voters are pessimistic about it ninety percent of republicans say the economy is in poor condition 67 of democrats and 79 of respondents overall according to the poll financial markets just reported their worst opening in 50 years consumer expectations for the economy are at a 10 year low we are living in an age of menace an age when people feel unsafe on a variety of fronts these are ages when voters tend to flock to conservative parties which they associate with law and order new york times columnist david brooks wrote at the end of the day democrats may be pouring money into candidates that eventually beat their own party s nominees whether or not the plan backfires will largely depend on how satisfied voters are with the state of the country come november but if recent economic and geopolitical trends are any indication american voters are only going to become more unhappy not less with the political party in power

a stuart man ployed with two men at a cryptocurrency investment platform to mislead investors and conspire to commit fraud according to the u s attorney s office a south florida federal grand jury indicted joshua david nicholas emerson pires and flavio goncalves each with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud in connection with a global cryptocurrency based fraud that generated around 100 million in revenues from investors the attorney s office announced thursday sentenced for teen solicitation jensen beach man sentenced to 10 years in prison for attempted online enticement of teenager arrest in child solicitation case sewall s point officer facing federal charge after arrest in connection to child solicitation nicholas 28 of stuart was the so called head trader of empiresx the crypto platform founded by pires and goncalves according to court documents the trio founded empiresx in early 2020 with an official office based in miami via zoom youtube telegram and facebook the men marketed empiresx to potential investors the men boasted the ex bot a proprietary trading bot that could generate guaranteed returns according to the federal court indictment nicholas performed demonstrations of the bot in action executing trades on the u s stock market according to the indictment these demonstrations however were fictitious prosecutors said and the representation of the bot was false and fradulent according to the indictment goncalves and pires presented nicholas as a genius trader according to the indictment but the company s head trader fabricated his personal and professional background prosecutors said nicholas posed as another person unaffiliated with the company and had concealed a prior 8 year ban by the national futures association for investment related misconduct to share profits made from the bot investors had to open an account with empiresx and purchase a license to use the ex bot for 200 or 400 investors funded a separate account of credits and additional capital to be pooled and invested for the bot pires said the separate credits would be gasoline for the ex bot and investors needed to fund it to keep it running according to the indictment but pires goncalves and nicholas never employed a bot to execute trades and gain profit for investors according to the paperwork instead in a ponzi style scheme the men laundered investors funds through a foreign based cryptocurrency exchange and paid out early empiresx investors with money from later investors the indictment said the trio also used the money for personal expenditures including exotic vehicles clothing from high end retailers and attorneys fees according to the indictment pires goncalves and nicholas never registered nor attempted to register the ex bot as an offering and sale of securities with the sec they also had no valid exemption from the registration requirement the men misled investors on withdrawing money from their accounts according to the indictment initially investors could withdraw money but as the trio s ponzi scheme started to collapse they made it harder for people to take out their money adding fees to withdrawals and caps on how many withdrawals could be made on oct 21 2021 the crypto platform held a meeting to claim they paid out 112 million to investors and within the week prior to that date they had made 7 000 payments totaling to 12 million which was all false prosecutors said it began routinely preventing investors from withdrawing funds from their accounts the indictment said since november 2021 investors have been largely unable to withdraw funds from empiresx according to the indictment empiresx gained nearly 100 million in revenue from the misled investors prosecutors said prosecutors said they will hold crypto scammers accountable and cautioned those seeking to invest in new crypto platforms the technology has changed but the crime remains the same said special agent george l piro the head of fbi miami unscrupulous fraudsters are nothing new to the investment world what s changing is they are now pushing their criminal activity into the cryptocurrency realm investors beware conduct your due diligence before investing mauricio la plante is a breaking news reporter for tcpalm focusing on martin county follow him on twitter mslaplantenews or email him at mauricio laplante tcpalm com
many americans have wrestled with this dilemma at some point during the pandemic yet it still seems to come up again and again when can you stop isolating after a covid 19 infection the question is especially vexing if you re feeling better but still testing positive on a rapid test even with the arrival of new subvariants the basic ground rules haven t changed since omicron first came onto the scene the centers for disease control and prevention says someone can stop isolating after five days if they re fever free for 24 hours and are starting to get better as long as they keep wearing a mask around others for another five days some researchers have criticized these rules pointing to research that shows some people may remain infectious after day five and many experts advise waiting until you test negative on an at home test before venturing out but if you feel fine it can be frustrating to wait especially if you re in the subset of those who test positive past 10 days james hay who studies infectious disease dynamics remembers earlier this year when his sister continued testing positive for two weeks their family had plans to get together over the holiday a gathering that included an older relative who was vulnerable to covid to us that was just not worth the risk says hay who s a research fellow at the harvard t h chan school of public health going to the shops with a mask on that s a different kind of risk consideration testing to get out of isolation is tempting because it promises a straightforward answer unfortunately and perhaps unsurprisingly the science is not entirely settled we don t have anything that says definitely you are contagious or definitely you re not says dr emily landon an infectious disease specialist at uchicago medicine the best thing we have are these rapid antigen tests unlike pcr tests which search for genetic material from the virus rapid antigen tests work by looking for the proteins that are packed inside the virus a positive test generally correlates with the presence of infectious virus scientists can determine that by taking samples from someone who s been infected and trying to grow the virus in a lab what s known as a viral culture generally most people who get infected are not still testing positive on an antigen test 10 days after symptom onset if you have enough virus in your system to be turning one of these tests positive that means your body probably hasn t yet fully cleared the infection says hay but there is no perfect study that shows how likely it is that a positive test on a rapid test translates into shedding enough virus that you could actually infect another person says dr geoffrey baird chair of the department of laboratory medicine and pathology at the university of washington school of medicine the answer to that is clear as mud he says indeed infectious disease experts tend to differ about how much stock to put in a rapid test result when someone knows they re infected and deciding whether it s safe to rejoin the outside world after all baird points out that these tests were never designed to function as get out of isolation cards relying on the result to tell whether you re truly still infectious is dicey he says there s actually a lot more discrepancy than anyone would be happy with he says a positive antigen test could essentially be picking up leftover viral garbage which can include dead viruses mangled viruses viruses that are 90 packed together but not really going to work says baird and the amount can vary depending on each person s immune system the variants the stage of the infection and so on this is partly why baird did not bother to take a rapid test when he had covid recently and had to decide when it was ok to return to work after a week when he was feeling better he came back to the office where everyone s required to wear an n95 mask even if it is an imperfect tool not everyone is down on using a rapid antigen test landon says it s extra information that can give you a sense of how to proceed especially if people are banking on the cdc guidance to determine whether to end isolation that s because some people will still be infectious after five days she says in fact a studyco authored by landon followed health care workers at the university of chicago who had been infected but were feeling mostly better and went to get tested after five days they found that more than half of them still tested positive on antigen tests after six days this tracks with other research for example one studyanalyzing data from a testing site in san francisco during the january omicron surge suggests that many people were still testing positive after five days and research done by the cdc shows about half of people were still testing positive on the antigen test between five and nine days after symptom onset or diagnosis you d be erring on the side of caution if you followed the test and said i m not going to leave my isolation until after my test is negative she says preliminary datafrom scientists at harvard and mit shows that about 25 of symptomatic people with covid 19 had virus that could be cultured after eight days after symptom onset or their first test but hay cautions there is considerable variation in the studies because of small sample sizes differing populations how the rapid tests are done the vaccination status of who s being tested and how healthy they are among other factors that explains a lot of the variation across studies but i think it s still pretty consistent as an overall finding that if you re antigen positive then you re quite likely to be infectious he says some research has aligned more closely with the cdc isolation guidance which assumes most people will no longer be infectious after five days a preprint study of close to 100 vaccinated college students at boston university suggests that a majority were no longer infectious after five days only about 17 of those who we looked at still had what looks like viable covid out past five days says dr karen jacobson an infectious disease specialist at the boston university school of medicine and one of the study s authors a very small number did have virus that could be cultured eight days after symptom onset her study found that a negative rapid antigen test on day five is a perfect indicator of whether the virus could be cultured in a lab in other words anyone who had a negative test on day five or later after their initial diagnosis had no more detectable virus the flip side was that if you had a positive rapid about half of the people still had culturable virus and half did not says jacobsen the way that we ve started to frame it and i think many others have is that if you re positive you particularly need to take this very seriously at the end the day if you re still testing positive but you feel fine and are symptom free the decision to go out in the world comes down to context if you re going to spend time with people who are high risk think twice says landon if you are thinking about going to the nursing home to visit your grandmother this is not the time to do it she says but if there s something essential you need to do don t feel trapped in your house go do it but keep your mask on she adds copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

analyst comments and potentially slowing chip demand pushed the tech stock lower what happened shares of nvidia nvda 2 48 plunged this week after the company s stock received a price target cut some analysts had a few negative comments about the chip market and investors worried that comments made from another chip company about slowing demand might mean bad news for nvidia as well investors panicked a bit on all this news and sent the semiconductor stock falling 15 3 over the past week so what nvidia started off the week with morgan stanley warning that there could be a potential slowdown in demand for graphics processors as ethereum a leading blockchain and cryptocurrency switches to a proof of stake model and away from its current proof of work setup the result could be less demand for graphics processors and as a result potentially less demand in the short term for nvidia s chips investors then drove nvidia s stock even lower on wednesday when bank of america analyst vivek arya cut its price target from 270 down to 220 but kept a buy rating on the stock arya reminded investors that the chip industry is cyclical and that another downturn in semiconductor demand could be happening soon and finally nvidia continued its slide on friday after another chip company micron technology reported its third quarter results while the company beat expectations it also said that the industry demand environment has weakened micron s revenue and earnings guidance for the upcoming quarter fell below wall street s consensus estimates and nvidia investors appear to be worried that micron s warning about weakening chip demand will affect nvidia as well now what nvidia investors have been on a roller coaster ride lately with the tech stock plummeting 50 year to date and as investors worry that the u s economy could slow down due to the federal reserve hiking the federal funds rate to battle soaring inflation there could be more pain ahead for shareholders over the short term nvidia investors will get a clearer picture of how the company is doing when it reports its latest quarterly financial results likely in mid august

materials a bbb ratings many great customer reviews high client satisfaction gold ira transfer vs gold ira rollover a gold ira can be funded in one of two ways a transfer or a rollover is an option to put it simply transferring assets is a more secure technique of moving them around than rolling over a rollover has a number of restrictions and rules that you should be aware of before making the decision the account holder may be penalized by the irs if any of these requirements are violated with the exception of rollovers transfers don t have nearly as many regulations or requirements gold ira transfers and rollovers differ in many ways but there are other similarities between the two methods gold ira transfer rules early withdrawal is not subject to any fees there is no 60 day transfer rule there are no yearly restrictions it is not taxable no taxes will be withheld gold ira rollover rules there is a 10 early withdrawal penalty if the account holder is under the age of 59 5 because of the 60 day window for investing gold in a new gold ira the old gold ira must be converted into a new gold ira there may only be one rollover each year for ira owners the cash given if the 60 day guideline is broken will be taxed as ordinary income when money is transferred from one individual retirement account ira to another no taxes are withheld ira gold transfers as they are often known allow you to move your assets from one custodian to another because of this the account holder will not get a penny of the money that was withdrawn from their account as a result the account holder does not need to be involved in any way in the transfer the custodians are solely responsible for this simple frictionless procedure there is a major distinction between transfers and rollovers with transfers the money does not enter the account of the ira holder there is less chance of a human mistake when doing an ira gold transfer than when doing a rollover for example if you don t transfer the funds into your new account in time you ll be hit with a large tax bill from the irs to avoid this the account custodian manages the transaction automatically when you transfer money into another account rollover of 401k to gold backed ira if you currently have a self directed or employer sponsored 401 k and want to move assets to a gold backed ira you can do so but there are several requirements that must be cleared before you can proceed it should not be a difficulty to transfer monies from a previous employer s 401 k to a new gold ira pick a custodian for your gold ira and let them handle the 401 k rollover a 401 k rollover is more complicated if you re thinking about it with your present employer so make sure you study the conditions of your plan carefully before proceeding when you re employed by a company some don t allow you to invest any of your 401 k in precious metals when in doubt contact your employer about current 401 k restrictions and whether or not you re authorized to transfer or rollover any funds to a gold backed individual retirement account depending on the company you may be able to do this but you ll need to inquire choosing your gold ira rollover strategy transferring or rolling over the money into a gold ira can be done in a variety of ways and your financial goals will determine which option you use there is no one size fits all solution to the question of how much of a person s portfolio should be invested in precious metals it all depends on how close you are to retirement and how much risk you re willing to take with your money in precious metals an allocation of around 20 of your portfolio can be appropriate if you re less than 10 years away from retirement and don t want to take on much risk just 5 or 10 of your assets may be enough to invest in precious metals if your retirement date is a long time away regardless of how much money you have to invest diversifying your portfolio with precious metals such as gold or silver is a good way to protect yourself against market volatility the stock market has been tumultuous recently with precious metals and some cryptocurrencies like ethereum and bitcoin seeing particularly high prices a growing number of investors are turning to precious metals as a safety net in light of the current state of traditional financial markets determining how much of your funds to convert into gold other elite investors on the other hand are less risk averse and provide a higher estimate consider the following questions while deciding what s best for you when will i be able to stop working in the last five years how has your portfolio performed what are your predictions for the future of the economy investing in precious metals is a way to achieve what the most intriguing question is why you re investing in gold some of the most prevalent motivations and attitudes for moving money into a gold ira will be discussed below diversification of your investments in this case investors are looking to acquire gold to safeguard their existing portfolios from the risk of overexposure to traditional assets like bonds equities and more in the event of a stock market collapse or recession many investors choose to diversify their portfolios with precious metals in order to minimize their losses if this describes you investing 5 to 10 percent of your portfolio in gold may be a good idea to put it another way you should consider putting this amount of your overall portfolio into gold and silver inflation and the dollar losing value if you are worried about inflation or the devaluation of your currency you may want to increase your precious metals holdings if you re worried about inflation and the decline in the value of the us dollar a gold ira may be a good option for you since april 2021 when the consumer price index cpi rose by 4 2 percent the united states has faced a serious risk of inflation gold s value surged more than 600 percent in the 1970s due of the volatility of the dollar which caused inflation consider making a significant investment in precious metals possibly between 10 and 20 percent of your overall assets if you re looking for a safe haven from inflation if the dollar continues to decline precious metals investors will likely fare better than those who do not possible economic collapse the value of gold and other precious metals increases when there is widespread volatility in the global or geopolitical environment therefore investors who are concerned about the status of the economy may want to allocate more of their assets to gold and other precious metals when the stock market is in a state of panic gold tends to fare well a 7 year high in gold was achieved during the opec oil crisis in march 2020 in january 2020 the us iran airstrike killed a key iranian general and gold prices rose by 1 4 percent overnight amid the stock market selloff in 2022 things get even more complicated in the russia ukraine conflict gold should account for 20 to 30 percent of the portfolios of investors looking for security and safety against war or economic catastrophe invest in irs approved bullion the irs has rigorous guidelines on the sorts of gold assets that may be held in a retirement plan and still qualify for tax benefits the following and more are examples of irs approved gold assets johnson matthey gold bars american eagle gold coins canadian gold maple leaf coins valcambi gold combibar credit suisse gold bars irs restrictions for 401 k s and iras prohibit the use of collectibles which includes precious metals and rare coins in your precious metals ira as well in terms of collectibles gold bullion bars don t fit the bill it is possible to invest in a gold ira rollover with the exception of the following three types of coins minted and issued under any sovereign state s authority coins mentioned in section 5112 of the united states code coins and gold bullion owned by a trustee whether it s a bank or not gold bullion is preferable to rare coins since you may be fined or penalized if you buy in prohibited assets you should however make sure you re only investing in permitted coins if you do so physical gold vs paper gold ira rollover vaults containing hard metal bars of gold are what are referred to as physical vaults in this context the term paper gold refers to any form of gold based investment such as an etf or gold mining stock aside from the fact that it s handier than genuine gold bullion paper gold doesn t provide many advantages because gold stocks have more liquidity it is simpler to purchase and sell them as a result paper gold is more susceptible to price fluctuations than gold bullion a genuine gold ira rollover is the best way to take advantage of the many benefits of gold investment but if the economy collapses or inflation takes hold your gold stocks might lose value real physical gold bullion rather than securities based or paper gold has many advantages counterparty risk because gold bars are not publicly traded equities you don t have to worry about their failing to meet their commitments or declaring bankruptcy as is the case with paper gold because gold bars are not publicly traded equities you don t have to worry about their failing to meet their commitments or declaring bankruptcy as is the case with paper gold ease of transfer or moving it is possible to withdraw gold bars from an individual retirement account ira into your own hands or another vault since they are easily moveable it is possible to withdraw gold bars from an

by ross kerber boston reuters activist investment leaders who have urged u s companies to cut carbon emissions said on friday they expect more such efforts following a milestone u s supreme court ruling on thursday that diminished the power of federal environmental regulators by constraining the u s environmental protection agency s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from coal and gas fired power plants the court put responsibility on investors looking to slow climate change said andrew behar chief executive of the nonprofit group as you sow a which often files shareholder resolutions investors will likely launch more engagements with companies ahead of the 2023 annual meeting season behar said adding that executives lately have been more receptive to suggested changes all the models say climate change will be bad for business behar said in an interview the court s ruling he said means that corporations have even more responsibility to their stakeholders to limit emissions climate issues have gained new attention from top asset managers and executives as investors pour new cash into funds that use environmental social and governance esg metrics to pick stocks for instance among top u s utilities this year duke energy vowed to cut more emissions and southern co agreed to disclose more emissions details as part of deals with investors as you sow said via e mail a duke representative said we and many of our stakeholders share the view that we can take a leadership role in tackling greenhouse gas emissions associated with our business duke had previously said the supreme court ruling will not immediately impact its coal plant retirement dates including a full exit from coal by 2035 a southern representative said the company has a long term constructive relationship with as you sow and many other investors and environmental stakeholders and appreciates that stakeholders are interested in understanding the company s path to net zero the company is still reviewing the supreme court decision the representative said mindy lubber president of ceres a boston climate advocacy group that works with asset managers and others said having invested heavily in clean power technologies like solar panels and battery storage utilities won t likely change course whatever regulations are limited by the court s decision everything is not going to stop and go backwards just because of the supreme court ruling lubber said rather utilities could face tougher requests from shareholders next year such as calls for more specific emission cut schedules or reviews of their lobbying activities she said thursday s ruling reduced the power of officials to use the landmark clean air act anti pollution law it is likely to have implications beyond the epa as it raises new legal questions about any big decisions made by federal agencies for instance the ruling could also spell trouble for an effort by a u s securities and exchange commission to force companies to disclose their emissions legal experts said investors have looked to standardized disclosures as a way to pressure heavy emitters reporting by ross kerber editing by david gregorio

despite several controversies during bob chapek s tenure the walt disney company s board of directors unanimously voted to extend his contract on june 28 the executive will head the company for another three years chapek s contract is renewed disney fans complain i ve been predicting recently kim masters quips there s a certain amount of chip on the shoulder of people who are not only in the community of hollywood but in the fan world who complain about the higher prices and say that the rides aren t maintained and all the grievances you find on the fan sites this is not a rubber stamp deal he ll absolutely be watched closely affirms matt belloni founding partner of puck news and the perfect example of what could happen is the peter rice situation was upped nine months before he was unceremoniously fired so just because you get a renewal in this kind of a position doesn t mean that you are safe for another three years though the board did put out a positive statement about him belloni states it also cited his leadership during these turbulent times and getting us through the pandemic and all of these things that did not exactly ascribe to him a wondrous vision for the future of the walt disney company did not renew him beyond when his contract was supposed to be up which is in february they renewed him from now this is a new deal so it s essentially a 2 5 year rather than a three year renewal which they probably would have done if this was someone like someone that is solidified belloni says so yes he does have some runway here but this is not a wholesale you know rubber stamp go do what you do they re watching closely the litany with what chapek is doing is nowhere near over stock is down but is down more than others states kim masters and there s all the challenges streaming he s going to have to pivot because they didn t get the india cricket rights and he s going to have to reset those subscriber goals that he had just clung to a few minutes ago so the litany with what bob chapek is doing how is it going is nowhere near over in other news the merger of caa and icm just closed now we have three mega agencies i thought there was a chance that the justice department might take a look at it for that reason remarks masters who s now represented by caa clearly they had some concerns because this thing took eight months to close and if you think about in the grand scheme of things icm was so weakened from its heyday as one of the big power agencies it was sort of chugging along as mostly a showrunner agency with some big names there and a few stars belloni adds so this was not a merger this is an acquisition a takeover of one giant agency of a largely weakened one belloni adds that from a macro perspective it is four big agencies merged to three and that s where we are right now consolidation has gripped the industry everything has been consolidated including the talent agencies he concludes uneasy times in hollywood as caa plans to lay off almost a quarter of icm s staff masters says some people already bailed on some agents because they might not be able to keep their clients if they stuck around too long the icm assets were really the publishing division and the sports division some media rights people they re keeping some talent agents as well mostly to help service the existing caa clients belloni mentions i think caa is going to use this merger as a chance to evaluate its own existing employees and part of that is client base but perhaps there s some redundancies and some of the fatter contracts that will get a second look here and i think everything is on the table at caa right now
if democrats were hoping for a game changing bump following the overturning of roe v wade they ve been disappointed by the last several polls as redstate reported republicans continue to enjoy a modest lead in the generic ballot and joe biden s numbers show zero sign of rebounding given the historical connection between a president s approval and the first mid term that s nothing but bad news if you are on the left advertisement biden s unpopularity has descended so far into the depths that 71 percent now don t want him to run for re election i can t be certain but i d strongly suspect that s the lowest number ever for a first term president in just his second year 71 percent don t want biden to run for reelection harvard caps harris poll among the respondents who believe the president should not run 45 say because he is a bad president 30 say he is too old 25 say it s time for a change interactivepolls iapolls2022 july 1 2022 shocking numbers but hardly surprising right we are talking about a guy who has driven the country off a cliff in ways that not even most conservatives thought imaginable a year and a half ago perhaps i was naive but with the economy opening back up post covid i figured not even biden could screw things up to this extent yet here we are with gas prices at 5 a gallon a supply chain crisis inflation exploding the stock market crashing and a likely recession heck not even cryptocurrency has survived the president s path of destruction with bitcoin in a state of collapse for the first time in decades there s nowhere to put your money without taking it on the chin advertisement and while you d expect republicans to want biden gone no matter what democrat voters can only lie to themselves for so long many see the writing on the wall as biden fumbles around making mistake after mistake heck sometimes even when he s doing what they ostensibly want such as green energy nonsense the political realities just become too toxic to abide obviously the fact that biden would be in his mid 80s at the end of the second term plays a large role as well but as bad as those numbers are for biden and democrats i actually think the latest numbers out of nevada are worse biden job approval rating sinks to 28 in the battleground state of nevada approve 28 disapprove 61 nv independents approve 15 disapprove 75 nv hispanics approve 31 disapprove 57 civiqs 06 30 pic twitter com gji7cuamaj interactivepolls iapolls2022 july 1 2022 nevada may be the most important state in the 2022 election not only are there competitive house seats but its us senate seat very well could decide who controls the chamber republican gains with hispanics have already put democrats on the defensive and if they can t hold nevada it portends doom across the rest of the nation never mind the implications for 2024 given the silver state has been solidly blue several cycles in a row advertisement the overturning of roe was the last gasp and it simply isn t providing the juice needed to overcome these horrific fundamentals further the january 6th committee is falling flat and no matter what happens to donald trump there s no reason to think that will affect republicans at large that stuff is already baked into the cake and if the former president were the drag democrats want him to be glenn youngkin wouldn t be governor of virginia right now it s always good to be cautious while making political projections but it feels like we ve passed the point of no return what exactly is going to save democrats at this point perhaps someone smarter than i am can come up with an idea because i m coming up blank

lisbon portugal tuvalu foreign minister simon kofe walked out of the opening cermonies of this week s united nations ocean conference in portugal according to radio new zealand the move came after china blocked the participation of three taiwanese members sitting with the tuvalu delegation taiwan which china claims as its own territory is not a member of the united nations and its citizens are unable to attend un events as official taiwanese representatives the pacific island nation with a population of 12 000 people has had diplomatic relations with taiwan since 1979 and is one of 14 countries that continues to have diplomatic relations with taipei rather than beijing taiwan is largely excluded from international organizations that have china as a member taiwan s foreign ministry thanked tuvalu and condemned china stating china s arbitrary pressure on un member states has only once again revealed its nasty nature meanwhile zhao lijian chinese foreign ministry spokesman reiterated beijing s stance that taiwan is part of china in a daily media briefing in beijing he said the taiwan authorities attempts to squeeze into the united nations conference on the oceans and the law of the sea by engaging in petty maneuvers in the international arena or acting as followers of other countries will only demean themselves last year kofe captured the world s attention after he addressed a global climate conference standing ankle deep in the sea to illustrate that tuvalu was sinking some 7 000 people from heads of state to environmental activists are expected to attend the conference

the phase 3 sapphire trial sapphire is an ongoing phase 3 randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of apitegromab in non ambulatory patients with types 2 or 3 sma who are receiving smn therapy either nusinersen or risdiplam approximately 156 patients aged 2 12 years old are anticipated to be enrolled in the main efficacy population these patients will be randomized 1 1 1 to receive either apitegromab 10 mg kg apitegromab 20 mg kg or placebo by intravenous iv infusion every 4 weeks for 12 months an exploratory population of approximately 48 patients aged 13 21 years old will also separately be evaluated these patients will be randomized 2 1 to receive either apitegromab 20 mg kg or placebo in this subpopulation of older individuals with sma the safety and tolerability of apitegromab will be characterized and efficacy will also be evaluated in an exploratory nonpowered manner sapphire is expected to enroll 55 sites in the u s and europe for more information about sapphire visit www clinicaltrials gov about apitegromab apitegromab is a selective inhibitor of the activation of myostatin and is an investigational product candidate for the treatment of patients with spinal muscular atrophy sma myostatin a member of the tgfβ superfamily of growth factors is expressed primarily by skeletal muscle cells and the absence of its gene is associated with an increase in muscle mass and strength in multiple animal species including humans scholar rock believes that inhibiting myostatin activation with apitegromab may result in a clinically meaningful improvement in motor function in patients with sma the u s food and drug administration fda has granted fast track orphan drug and rare pediatric disease designations and the european medicines agency ema has granted priority medicines prime and orphan medicinal product designations to apitegromab for the treatment of sma the efficacy and safety of apitegromab have not been established and apitegromab has not been approved for any use by the fda or any other regulatory agency about sma spinal muscular atrophy sma is a rare and often fatal genetic disorder that typically manifests in young children an estimated 30 000 to 35 000 patients are afflicted with sma in the united states and europe it is characterized by the loss of motor neurons atrophy of the voluntary muscles of the limbs and trunk and progressive muscle weakness the underlying pathology of sma is caused by insufficient production of the smn survival of motor neuron protein essential for the survival of motor neurons and is encoded by two genes smn1 and smn2 while there has been progress in the development of therapeutics that address the underlying sma genetic defect via smn dependent pathways there continues to be a high unmet need for therapeutics that directly address muscle function about scholar rock scholar rock is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical

the desirable mechanism for price increases is as follows higher wages lead to increased consumption which leads to firms being able to raise prices which leads to increased profits which leads to firms being able to raise wages again the question is where the starting point for this virtuous cycle should be it seems natural that the starting point should be a wage increase however because of the low mobility in the japanese labor market and the emphasis on long term stable employment workers do not necessarily have strong bargaining power to raise wages therefore the boj was watching carefully to see if the cost push inflation that occurred this time would be the starting point for a breakdown of the strong norm once the norm was broken there was a possibility that the virtuous cycle mechanism would begin to turn it may have seemed like a ray of sunshine the boj was too focused on this mechanism while lacking awareness of the public s sensitivity to prices and thus overlooked the troubling statement the growing criticism of kuroda s statement reminds us of another matter that is whether the public perceives a 2 inflation rate as price stability the boj has a legal mandate to achieve price stability when the boj ended its quantitative easing policy in march 2006 it announced its view that a 0 to 2 year on year change in the consumer price index was its understanding of price stability with most board members median figures falling on either side of 1 in february 2012 it clarified its outlook setting its inflation goal at 1 however this monetary policy was criticized for causing the yen to appreciate and for being the reason why deflation could not be completely overcome therefore kuroda was appointed and introduced new monetary policy with a 2 inflation target even though the consumer price index in japan is rising now it has only reached a growth rate of about 2 this represents a huge gap with the west where inflation is over 8 nevertheless as in europe and the united states complaints about high prices have erupted in japan highlighting the japanese people s strong wariness toward inflation in particular the rising prices of food and energy partly caused by the weaker yen have put the country in a difficult situation that said i think it would be difficult to change the 2 inflation target if the inflation target is changed to 1 the risk of a reversal to a stronger yen and weaker dollar would increase and the risk of deflation could also increase again this price controversy provides a new opportunity to consider how to achieve price stability and economic growth in a way acceptable to the public it is important to have a concrete image of how the 2 inflation target will be achieved what form of price hikes would be acceptable to consumers and what path will be taken to achieve this goal i would like to emphasize again the importance of delving into the japanese people s view of price stability before the covid 19 pandemic the term japanification was often heard among policymakers in advanced western countries who used it as shorthand for the economic problems that undermined japan this was based on the fear that the united states and european countries could also be heading into a state of japanification where they cannot escape a period of stagnation defined by weak growth ultra loose monetary policy and deflationary pressures which had been thought to be unique to japan however with the supply shock from the covid 19 pandemic the policy theme in western countries returned from fear of japanification to fear of traditional inflation meanwhile in japan prices are high but the cpi increase has been limited to about 2 much lower than in the west for this reason while western central banks are moving to tighten monetary policy the boj has been left behind and continues its ultra loose monetary policy once again the uniqueness of the japanese economy stands out in fact greenspan s exhortation against irrational exuberance mentioned at the beginning of this column actually invoked japan but how do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in japan over the past decade greenspan was trying to draw lessons from the mysteries of the japanese bubble economy a quarter of a century later the challenge of japan s secular stagnation remains unsolved from the perspective of other countries it will continue to be a conundrum japan was and still is a unique

american flags and other graveside items are discarded during a recent cleanup of tonaquint cemetery st george utah june 20 2022 photo courtesy of brittany leblanc st george news st george following an email from a concerned citizen that included photos regarding proper handling of the american flags in the st george city cemetery after memorial day the breach in protocol was addressed by the city of st george a reader submitted email describing a large pile of american flags flowers and other items that were simply thrown on the ground in a trash pile after being removed from the gravesites caught the attention of st george news prompting a call to the city of st george the reader stated they were at tonaquint cemetery to feed the ducks as they do every sunday and as they made their way to the pond they noticed a large pile of items on the ground near the cemetery maintenance shed the items included artificial flowers plaques mother s day gifts and so on as well as numerous small american flags affixed to a stick the reader also stated the items shouldn t have been there as if they were discarded in a large trash pile adding the images were both disturbing and heartbreaking st george news reached out to david cordero spokesperson for the city of st george who said the artificial flowers posters and other items placed near the headstones are removed during scheduled cleanups conducted at each of the city s cemeteries cordero explained these cleanups occur three times per year which is when any temporary memorials flags and other items are removed from the grounds according to the city s website these periodic cleanups typically occur on the second monday in january the third monday after memorial day and the first monday of october each is announced in the city s utility bills and disclosed by on site signage or may be advertised in the local newspaper to alert patrons to the upcoming event these maintenance operations focus on improving navigation through aisles and enhancing the overall appearance of the sites similarly temporary memorials may be removed without notice should they become unsightly or pose a safety hazard as determined by the sexton as to the handling of the flags and those that ended up in a pile on the ground cordero said that is another matter entirely a breach in our flag etiquette was brought to our attention he said we have addressed it with staff and will do better in the future according to the federal flag code the american flag should not touch anything beneath it including the ground to protect the flag from becoming damaged or soiled the statute also applies to flags affixed to a stick such as those placed on the headstones at arlington national cemetery where every year the 3rd u s infantry regiment or old guard places a flag at each of the 228 000 headstones by inserting the stick exactly one boot length from the base of the headstone in honor of those fallen heroes the tradition is known as flags in and following memorial day the flags are removed and stored before the cemetery reopens to the public treatment of old glory goes federal the flag of the united states of america was born on june 14 1777 about a year after the declaration of independence was signed but it would be another 160 years or so before congress enacted the national flag code in 1942 when the use display and disposal of an american flag was codified into federal law under title 4 of the united states code according to legion org under federal law it is custom to display the flag only from sunrise to sunset on buildings or on flag staffs that are out in the open however the flag may be displayed twenty four hours a day if it is properly illuminated during the hours of darkness the code also states the flag should be hoisted briskly and lowered ceremoniously and should not be displayed in inclement weather unless the flag is designed for that purpose once a flag has served its purpose the flag code suggests it should be destroyed preferably by burning which for individual citizens means it can be done discreetly to prevent it from being perceived as a protest or desecration one misconception is if the flag does touch the ground it does not have to be destroyed as long as it is still suitable for display even if it has to be washed beforehand the flag also should be displayed daily on or near the main administration building of every public institution every polling location during an election and every schoolhouse when students are attending the statute also says that no other flag or pennant should be placed above or if on the same level to the right of the flag many american legion posts conduct disposal of unserviceable flag ceremonies on flag day which falls on june 14 and these ceremonies are particularly dignified and solemn occasions for the retirement of unserviceable flags to find an american legion post click here humanity s long history of decorating gravesites during the stone age the dead would be buried and a great stone or boulder rolled atop the grave these stones were called gravestones and their purpose was to prevent the deceased from rising after death according to funerals360 later the ancient tradition of placing grave goods near burial sites began in greece roughly 3 000 years ago and the ancient romans believed that spirits continued to dwell around their grave sites according to worldhistory org so to mollify their ancestors they placed flowers and ornaments around grave sites and in years to come flowers were used flowers to pay respect to fallen soldiers some even believe the flowers were used to kill the odor associated with death in the united states the tradition gained recognition after the death of abraham lincoln when his remains were carried across the country by train and as it continued from city to city it made many stops to allow citizens to pay their respects many brought giant bouquets trinkets and odd decorations to lay near the casket to express their profound grief over lincoln s death and soon the graves of the thousands of fatally wounded soldiers were adorned with flowers following the civil war then in 1868 gen john alexander logan the leader of the grand army of the republic designated may 30 as decoration day the day designated for decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country and is now known as memorial day this report is based on statements from residents and city officials and may not contain the full scope of findings photo

back when jesse james prowled the land the savings of the citizenry was constantly under threat by bandits looking to heist their money these days the money itself is stealing the savings of people in the form of high inflation and crashing financial markets yesterday we pointed out that the first half of the year was the worst for stocks since 1970 the s p 500 dropped by around 20 percent just shy of the 1970 bear market record of 21 percent the nasdaq composite was down by 29 5 percent the worst decline ever the dow jones industrial average fell 15 3 percent the worst since 1962 we must confess however that things were even worse than we thought those declines are in nominal terms meaning they do not take into account the massive inflation we ve experienced in the first half of this year stocks were falling in dollars terms but those dollars themselves were declining in value as we ve pointed out again and again inflation introduces chaos into financial calculations that can often conceal deep points of economic stress michael hartnett the chief investment strategist at bank of america securities ran the inflation adjusted numbers in a note for clients this morning he found that this has been the worst start of the year for the s p since 1872 the year jesse james and cole younger led their gang to rob a bank in columbia kentucky and ended up shooting a teller who refused to open the vault at the time the country was led by president ulysses s grant a military hero who was not exactly an ace at economic policy the following year the country fell into what was then known as the great depression this severe downturn lasted from 1873 to 1879 at 65 months it is still to this day the longest lasting contraction identified by the national bureau of economic research outlasting the 43 month contraction of the great depression of the 1930s ten states scores of railroads hundreds of banks and thousands of businesses went bankrupt during the 1870s great depression as bad as that sounds hartnett points out that 2022 is looking like the worst year for government bonds since 1865 government bonds fell 15 4 percent in the first half of the year even before adjusting for inflation year over year they were down by around twice that and that is before adjusting for inflation which is hard to do when measuring bonds issued in a variety of currencies from all around the globe this does not mean that there was no money to be made in the first half of the year as everyone knows oil and gas prices have exploded higher commodities overall had their best inflation adjusted first half of the year since 1946 according to hartnett oil rose 46 percent natural gas 74 percent and iron ore 28 2 percent certainly recent economic data will do little to reassure investors about the economy construction spending unexpectedly declined in may the first drop in eight months strikingly single home construction spending was flat for the month before adjusting for inflation in inflation adjusted terms then construction has rolled over and is declining rapidly the institute for supply management s assessment of manufacturing showed growth continued albeit at the slowest pace since may 2020 in june but both employment and new orders fell into contraction territory the federal reserve bank of atlanta s gdpnow economy tracker had fallen into negative territory on thursday on friday it plunged even deeper to minus 2 1 bank of america slashed its forecast for second quarter gdp to zero before it got a look at construction and the ism report next week s focus will be on the nonfarm employment report all signs point to ongoing strength in the labor market with the consensus for job growth at 250 000 and the unemployment rate at 3 6 percent a big question mark is how long it will take for negative gdp growth sharply rising interest rates and high inflation to throw sand into the gears of the labor market

article mustard you either love it or hate it however there might be a missing link at your next cookout this summer thanks to a shortage of the seed used to produce the yellow condiment if the

21 countries canada nepal and the russian federation account for nearly 70 of the world s total mustard seed production according to montana state university extension service mustard seed is an annual cool season crop that can be cultivated in short growing seasons and has the advantage of being fairly tolerant to drought heat and frost this makes it well suited to the growing conditions of the canadian prairies agriculture and agri food canada told fox weather that the prairies where mustard seed is primarily grown experienced extremely dry conditions last year which led to a significant reduction in yields almost 55 below 2020 levels this resulted in low levels of carry out stocks i e the amount of supply left as estimated at the end of the formal crop year at aug 31 2022 the government agency said in a written statement more than half of us sees drought it s not just common yellow mustard that is affected however it s also dijon as far as the brown mustard seeds are concerned the seeds used to produce dijon mustard the missing quantity is around 50 said luc vandermaesen general manager of reine de dijon in fleurey sur ouche france in burgundy france the harvest was also bad about 50 as well this time due to a rainy winter in 2021 followed by three days of frost in april of that year the stock levels in canada were too low and consequently couldn t compensate

the world health organisation s europe chief has warned that monkeypox cases in the region have tripled in the last two weeks and urged countries to do more to ensure the previously rare disease does not become entrenched on the continent and african health authorities said they are treating the expanding monkeypox outbreak as an emergency calling on rich countries to share limited supplies of vaccines to avoid equity problems seen during the covid 19 pandemic who europe chief dr hans kluge said in a statement that increased efforts were needed despite the united nation health agency s decision last week that the escalating outbreak did not yet warrant being declared a global health emergency this electron microscopic em image depicted a monkeypox virion obtained from a clinical sample associated with the 2003 prairie dog outbreak it was a thin section image from of a human skin sample on the left were mature oval shaped virus particles and on the right were the crescents and spherical particles of immature virions high resolution click here for hi resolution image 5 21 mb content providers s cdc cynthia s goldsmith creation date 2003 photo credit cynthia s goldsmi ap urgent and coordinated action is imperative if we are to turn a corner in the race to reverse the ongoing spread of this disease kluge said to date more than 5000 monkeypox cases have been reported from 51 countries worldwide that don t normally report the disease according to the us centres for disease control and prevention kluge said the number of infections in europe represents about 90 per cent of the global total with 31 countries in the who s european region having identified cases kluge said data reported to the who show that 99 per cent of cases have been in men the majority in men that have sex with men but he said there were now small numbers of cases among household contacts including children most people reported symptoms including a rash fever fatigue muscle pain vomiting and chills monkeypox is traditionally found only in africa or in people who have recently returned from the continent ap scientists warn anyone who is in close physical contact with someone who has monkeypox or their clothing or bedsheets is at risk of infection vulnerable populations like children and pregnant women are thought more likely to suffer severe disease about 10 per cent of patients were hospitalised for treatment or to be isolated and one person was admitted to an intensive care unit no deaths have been reported kluge said the problem of stigmatisation in some countries might make some people wary of seeking health care and said the who was working with partners including organisers of gay pride events in the uk which has the biggest monkeypox outbreak beyond africa officials have noted the disease is spreading in defined sexual networks of gay bisexual or men who have sex with men british health authorities said there were no signs suggesting sustained transmission beyond those populations a patient whose skin displayed a number of lesions due to what had been an active case of monkeypox ap a leading who adviser said in may that the spike in cases in europe was likely tied to sexual activity by men at two rave parties in spain and belgium ahead of gay pride events in the uk this weekend london s top public health doctor asked people with symptoms of monkeypox like swollen glands or blisters to stay home nevertheless in africa the who says that according to detailed data from ghana monkeypox cases were almost evenly split between men and women and no spread has been detected among men who have sex with men who europe director kluge also said the procurement of vaccines must apply the principles of equity the main vaccine being used against monkeypox was originally developed for smallpox and the european medicines agency said this week it was beginning to evaluate whether it should be authorised for monkeypox a electron microscope image shows a monkeypox virion obtained from a sample associated with the 2003 prairie dog outbreak ap the who has said supplies of the vaccine made by bavarian nordic are extremely limited countries including the uk and germany have already begun vaccinating people at high risk of monkeypox the uk recently widened its immunisation program to mostly gay and bisexual men who have multiple sexual partners and are thought to be most vulnerable until may monkeypox had never been known to cause large outbreaks beyond parts of central and west africa where it s been sickening people for decades is endemic in several countries and mostly causes limited outbreaks when it jumps to people from infected wild animals to date there have been about 1 800 suspected monkeypox cases in africa including more than 70 deaths but only 109 have been lab confirmed the lack of laboratory diagnosis and weak surveillance means many cases are going undetected this particular outbreak for us means an emergency ahmed ogwell the acting director of the africa centers for disease control said the most triple vaccinated countries on earth view gallery the who says monkeypox has spread to african countries where it hasn t previously been seen including south africa ghana and morocco but more than 90 per cent of the continent s infections are in congo and nigeria according to who africa director dr moeti matshidiso vaccines have never been used to stop monkeypox outbreaks in africa officials have relied mostly on contact tracing and isolation the who noted that similar to the scramble last year for covid 19 vaccines countries with supplies of vaccines for monkeypox are not yet sharing them with africa we do not have any donations that have been offered to poorer countries said fiona braka who heads the who emergency response team in africa we know that those countries that have some stocks they are mainly reserving them for their own populations matshidiso said the who was in talks with manufacturers and countries with stockpiles to see if they might be shared
moscow while losing the war it launched against ukraine seeks to artificially create a global food crisis and blame it on the european union the kremlin regime is seeking not just to set off a global famine in africa and asia but blame the potential crisis on the west because as it claims eu sanctions have made russia cut off from international food supply chains thus dooming millions to starvation this could be considered the beginning of the initial phase of russia s undeclared war on europe aimed to divert attention from the war in ukraine and give a boost to pro russian activities in the eu insidious double bottomed plot it makes no bones that it is russia who is responsible for the worsening food crisis that is currently growing and expanding across the globe in early april deputy chairman of russia s security council dmitry medvedev did not hesitate to call grain exports a quiet but powerful weapon as food security in a number of countries depends on russian supplies this maniacal will to make human food needs into a weapon is helpful in russia s ambition to expand its presence in new markets russia is currently exporting its grain to more than 90 countries beyond that the aggressor country while waging its war in ukraine is deliberately and systematically destroying not only critical infrastructures but agricultural lands and grain terminals it is blocking wheat export from ukraine and in may attacked and destroyed even the seed bank in kharkiv according to estimates by the un world food program in ukrainian ports alone almost 4 5 million tons of export destined grain remain blocked due to the war part of the grain russia seized in berdyansk mariupol and kherson was taken to mainland russia and occupied sevastopol crimea the russians then send the stolen ukrainian grain using forged documents for export specifically to syria thus russia in its attempt to muscle ukraine out of global markets for food most especially wheat seeks not just to damage ukraine economically and set off a chaos in africa and the middle east the aggressor country aims to monopolize trade in wheat as the a global food crisis is looming over the world in this situation a global food shortage is almost inevitable and russia will try to shift the blame onto europe witold repetowicz a highly reputed polish analyst believes this to be an attempt by the kremlin to exert an influence on the governments of wheat importing countries facing famine and on food related social unrest events the consequences of dependence on wheat exports from russia including the wheat stolen from ukraine will be similar to those already seen in gas and energy supplies one such being that moscow will exert pressure on the importers of this highly valued commodity russia wants a global support from wheat import dependent governments in order to pressurize the west into lifting the sanctions crippling the russian economy another intent is to introduce into the global agenda the narrative that focus should be on the lifting of sanctions enforced on russia rather than on the reasons that caused them that is russia s war of aggression on ukraine and moscow s neo imperialist policies this narrative it should be noted is already working as the media in africa and the middle east are often more critical of the west and nato than they are critical of russia and its war in ukraine hunger riots and refugees are allies for moscow setting off social unrest in countries at risk of famine is the first move in this russian plot the global narrative that it is the responsibility of the west to resolve the crisis and provide humanitarian assistance will be shared not only by the governments of the grain importing countries friendly to moscow but by local societies and the media this all will fit well into russia s plans to exploit the demographic or migratory weapons in countering the west by instigating instability and a new influx of refugees into the eu for your information according to the un some 60 percent the world s malnourished population reside in conflict affected areas last year 140 million people suffered from acute hunger worldwide primarily in countries such as afghanistan the democratic republic of the congo ethiopia haiti nigeria pakistan south sudan sudan syria and yemen according to un secretary general antonio guterres the war in ukraine threatens hunger and poverty for 1 7 billion people worldwide which is 20 of the world s population and according to eurasiagroup about 1 9 billion people would have faced food insecurity by november 2022 that is russia can easily gain support from grain import dependent countries to stimulate migration to europe turn a blind eye to or even encourage the export of jihadism terrorism and illegal goods including weapons and narcotic drugs a new wave of migration bound for europe from the south from africa through the mediterranean to southern europe the southeast through turkey to greece and the balkans the east through belarus and russia to poland and the baltic states and northeast through russia to scandinavia can send many european countries to political crises this scenario is fully in line with the kremlin s plans experts judge that the russian paradigm of demographic attack will encompass a powerful information and psychological operation that would be targeted primarily at the extreme right and left liberal circles and aimed to incite fear and foster intolerance towards migrants this is supposed to send europe into a political crisis in which anti immigration groups who are often more inclined to cooperating with russia will create alternatives to the governments unable to cope with illegal migration the resulting crisis will be exacerbated futher by terrorist attacks racist incidents and information chaos at the same time pro russian media will provide a distorted version of events with emphasis on growing expenditures rising prices and deteriorating financial status for europeans as a result societies most prone to the negative effects of migration will be increasingly less interested in the situation in ukraine nor will they link the migration crisis to the aggressor russia but will even see its capabilities as a solution experts share the view that this scenario is aimed to help russia win both military and strategic victories in ukraine and thus pave the ground for further expansion and this is the last resort measure moscow is likely to employ to achieve a u turn in the current trend russia is currently losing the war strategically its ability to achieve military victory remains in question the west s turning away from ukraine as it is hoped by the kremlin would allow russia to buy time it needs to revive its capabilities and reverse the situation to win according to german foreign minister annalena baerbock putin aims to divide the world with a grain war thus the need to counter the russian campaign of spreading misinformation and distrust in the governments of democratic countries is once again coming to the fore not only does russia threaten the democratic world with weapons but remains a major security challenge a key to preventing this kremlin s scenario from coming into reality is the understanding that it will no longer be enough to just circumvent the russian blockade on ukrainian grain or reduce illegal migration simply by way of reinforcing europe s borders after all a russian attack using migration as a weapon according to the classics of this genre will begin in the countries of the migrants origin as a result of their governments being won over to russia s side a pressing need therefore arises to adopt at the level of a multinational anti russian coalition consisting of a majority of nato and eu countries as well as some other countries in the free world a comprehensive strategy to disable this russian plan against this backdrop ukraine has warned that there should be no easing of pressure on russia and the civilized world s unity to counter the aggressor country should never be compromised thesis od ua ukrainian potential one of the key measures that would help foil russia s plan to destabilize the eu should be to unblock ukrainian black sea ports as soon as possible and resume grain exports and the more so because ukraine has enough stocks for export and its grain terminals must be emptied for storing fresh harvest of 2022 the executive director of the un s world food program wfp david beasley said that top united nations officials are leading negotiations on a package deal to ensure that ukraine can export stalled shipments of grain through the black sea the wfp feeds some 125 million people across the globe and buys 50 of its grain from ukraine ukraine grows enough food to feed 400 million people around the planet beasley appealed on behalf of the united nations to russian president vladimir putin to open the ukrainian ports but to no avail the kremlin has said that moscow is ready to look for ways to ship grain stuck in ukrainian ports but has demanded the west lift sanctions according to a un report for 2021 ukraine was the world s sixth largest food supplier with a market share of 10 for wheat and 16 for corn having exported 20 million tons of wheat and rye 24 million tons of corn more than 15 20 of barley and more than 55 of sunflower seed oil 5 1 million tons among the regions of the world that depend most on ukrainian food supplies are africa and the middle east ukrainian wheat exports account for more than 10 of annual wheat consumption in 15 countries us secretary of state antony blinken has said russia must be compelled to create corridors so that food and other vital supplies can safely leave ukraine by land or sea there are an estimated 22 million tons of grain sitting in silos in ukraine right now food that could immediately go toward helping those in need if it can simply get out of the country blinken said as the all out war goes on ukraine continues to export its agricultural produce through railway highways and rivers without supplies from ukraine the amount of grain available for sale in the world market is decreasing causing prices to rise depending on the type of grain discontinued grain exports from ukraine could cause global food prices to increase by 25 as many countries rely on its exports that must not happen ukrainian ports must be re opened all the countries bordering ukraine have responded to the problem of grain exports from ukraine and have either significantly simplified the procedures for registration of freight or are actively working on it in particular liberal conditions for ukrainian carriers have been introduced by romania slovakia hungary lithuania latvia estonia as well as italy turkey bulgaria georgia denmark greece and more recently austria a new intermodal route connecting ukrainian transport hubs to the romanian black sea port of constanta has become one of the main transit hubs for ukrainian grain exports this route however has been currently suspended due to russian missile attacks thus despite the use of all available alternative ways enabling food grain exports from ukraine they are not sufficient to ensure a speedy transit of large amounts of grain it is therefore an urgent need to unblock ukrainian ports and let grain exports out as soon as possible and especially so because transportation by sea will help bring food prices down a good solution would be to join hands across the un eu and nato to raise pressure on russia to end its war in ukraine allow grain shipments by sea and river transport and de mine transportation routes among other things given the strategic importance of unblocking ukrainian grain exports ukraine is working with international partners to create a united nations backed mission to restore black sea shipping routes and export ukrainian farm produce the mission would be conducted with naval support from a number of the world s leading countries and involve security measures such as providing air defenses over ukrainian ports and sea areas de mining fairways and port waters and warships escorting freight ships in transit another way to compel the aggressor to retreat from its plans to destabilize europe is to defeat it militarily the destruction of targets by ukrainian missile strikes on snake zmiiny island and on militarized gas production platforms in the black sea which have been modified by the aggressor for reconnaissance and surveillance roles can be considered the first decisive and successful step towards unblocking ukrainian ports the recipe for doing this is well known ukraine needs more support in its fair fight against the russian aggressor and the soonest possible transfer of heavy weapons especially medium and long range air defense systems as well as strike systems that will enable a speedy liberation of ukrainian areas currently

whether it is climate change pollution of water resources not adhering to good management practices in water resource management there is one culprit the human race degradation of the environment is done by humans polluting water resources is done by humans mismanagement of the resource that sustains them is done by humans problems are created by humans and they can only be solved by humans not by any unseen divine entity the one place where humans live and can live the earth is being destroyed by these very humans by raj gonsalkorale janendra de costa vijith gunawardena and mohanlal peiris a discussion on water resources and the anticipated scarcity of fresh water is timely in the backdrop of the economic crisis being experienced by the country now a man made crisis primarily by the political leaders but also by the general community as well it is not the intention of this article to discuss the economic crisis suffice to say however that if the country had adequate financial resources this crisis would not have been a crisis however the difference with a crisis relating to water resources again mostly man made is that it will not get solved with financial resources money will not be able to buy the country out of a water resource crisis besides this a water resource crisis will impact on virtually all other resources that sustains life the belief that water is a renewable source is somewhat misplaced water is not replenished like most renewable resources and instead reused if we were constantly losing water then the speed at which water forms would not be very sustainable and it would become a nonrenewable resource as water continuously evaporates from the earth s surface it collects in the atmosphere to later come back to the earth as rain on the earth itself surface water replenishes groundwater and groundwater may eventually seep into streams lakes and oceans water may be considered a renewable resource if due care and attention is paid to the careful management and responsible usage of water with strict limitations on maintaining the water balance uncontrolled extraction of water from fresh ground water aquifers shallow as well as deep will lead to the gradual depletion of the aquifer lowering the water tables and intrusion of contaminants the freshwater aquifers along the coastal belt in the dry zone is at imminent risk without measures to limit extraction and ensuring replenishment and recharge of these aquifers during wet periods to minimize lowering of the freshwater tables and be contaminated through saltwater intrusion even wet countries like uk adopt these measures to protect their fresh ground water resources in certain parts of the country perhaps the biggest challenge for the people of sri lanka and its opinion makers importantly the media is to raise awareness amongst the people about the limit of water resources the predicted scarcity of fresh water the unsustainable use of available water and the need to conserve water and issues like the pollution of rivers waterways lakes wells and reservoirs that hold fresh water and also the pollution of oceans especially with plastic and other forms of waste and its impact on marine life and consequently on other forms of lives including humans the typical sri lankan attitude of nava gilunath band chune a belief that better days will come again irrespective of any disaster faced the origin of the phrase possibly a misplaced reference to the sinking of the titanic where the ship s band continued to play while the ship was sinking and were the last to jump off the ship will not work with a water resource crisis as it is one that is years in the making before it becomes a crisis and which cannot be bailed out with money but only through an ongoing process of prevention from the outset once it becomes a crisis it may be impossible to repair the damage and revert to a semblance of normalcy and even if this were possible it would take a very long time perhaps many decades for this to happen it is hoped that this article and many others that have been written and the huge amounts of sri lankan and worldwide research done and data available relating to these issues will prompt these opinion makers and the media to raise awareness amongst the people about the likely crisis unless corrective action is taken now water resources are often discussed researched and harnessing policies developed with a focus on irrigation and agriculture this no doubt is a centrality in any discussion on water however the use of water resources for drinking industries hydropower fisheries as a medium for transportation even leisure are areas that needs to be considered from the broader context of treating water as an essential resource with multiple uses a futuristic sustainable water management policy for sri lanka in the introductory article titled a futuristic sustainable land management policy for sri lanka published in several newspapers and journals the authors drew readers attention to the even broader context of water as a composite of what is termed land land was described as having a relationship to agriculture fisheries hydropower energy in general including renewable energy forestry wildlife protected areas biodiversity and very importantly climate change the objective of presenting this broader context was to highlight the inter dependence of each of these to sustainability of the whole which was termed land for the present generation but more importantly for future generations the maximisation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the use of water resources its sustainability its quality and its access which is the theme of this article therefore has to be viewed from the broader prism of what was termed land similarly water and all composites of water and the whole which has been termed land has to be considered from the point of view anticipation of threats and what needs to be done to address such threats and not reactions to threats when they occur in this context what is needed is a futuristic sustainable water management policy for the country the world bank in a feature titled sri lanka s water resources preserving identity transforming lives states succinctly what water means to sri lanka quote from the ancient times this vital natural resource has been intertwined with the lives of each and every sri lankan the historical and cultural links between water and the sri lankan populace can be seen from the country s agricultural economy ancient kings built tanks and reservoirs to cultivate acres of paddy fields as a result crop yields improved along with the lives of farmers and their families these practices have continued to this day with water being increasingly used in other industrial sectors like power generation and construction as well the water intensive garment and textile industry is one of the main drivers of industrial growth and the country s leading export sector accounting for more than 40 percent of total exports and employing 15 percent of the labour force which is over half a million people the tourism sector which relies heavily on water to run hotels and provide services is the third largest source of foreign exchange earnings in the country and is estimated to contribute about 4 5 percent to the gdp it employs over 350 000 sri lankans this statement underpins the expression what use is land without water and water of doubtful quality and encapsulates the background to this article with clarity and precision the theme of the article however is more about threats to this essential resource and measures that need to be taken to preserve this vital resource for posterity water particularly fresh water or good quality water is not a resource that is in abundance as it is generally perceived water scarcity is a clear and imminent risk even for countries like sri lanka which has been blessed with adequate water resources in the past climate change is inextricably linked to water and it is critical to focus on mitigation measures to minimise the impact mitigations would crucially need to include water conservation and reuse recycling for multi purposes most urban centres and small towns and even some rural areas in sri lanka now benefit from pipe borne water supply systems most systems extract water from surface water bodies while others from fresh ground water aquifers extraction of water from both these sources are largely uncontrolled and both sources are subjected to extreme pressures with over extraction and unprecedented contamination from external sources through the discharge of untreated or partially treated wastewater infiltration of chemicals or saltwater intrusion treatment of wastewaters to appropriate standards for recycling or reuse for industrial or agricultural purposes if not for potable use will alleviate water stress to some extent at a fundamental level urbanisation and in opening of land for domestic dwelling units the extraction of surface water from wells without adequate safeguards relating to pollution even from toilet waste from the adjoining block has been largely ignored such pollution could then extend to large tracts of surface water and eventually to ground water aquifers general global information consideration of the following information on water is necessary when discussing how threats may be addressed before they occur water covers around 70 percent of the earth s surface comes in the forms of freshwater and saltwater and water is integral to the survival of all living things oceans contain more than 90 percent of the earth s natural water reserves the pacific atlantic and indian oceans provide a home to an array of life on the earth freshwater makes up only 3 percent of the water on earth and of this 30 percent is found as groundwater the balance 70 is found in lakes rivers and streams fresh water supply as against sea or salt water available for irrigation agriculture as potable water for hydro power etc is therefore very limited polluting this supply and degrading its quality therefore has serious consequences while one may imagine mistakenly that the vastness of the oceans makes them better able to withstand pollution the impact on the food chain in the oceans is seriously underestimated water scarcity occurs when water resources are consumed more rapidly than they are replenished when safe water resources are contaminated or when conflict prevents a person from accessing safe water water scarcity is worsening as the demand for water grows due to population growth and development and as climate change affects the quantity and quality of water supplies water scarcity can exacerbate inequities migration conflict and economic crises predicted freshwater scarcity unicef states that quote today 1 42 billion people including 450 million children live in areas of high or extremely high water vulnerability decades of misuse poor management over extraction of groundwater and contamination of freshwater supplies have exacerbated water stress at the same time demand for water is rising due to rapid population growth urbanization and increasing water needs from a range of sectors climate change and extreme weather events are compounding water stress the resulting impact on children s health development and safety threatens the significant progress made in child survival and sustainable development over the past several decades it is putting children s lives at risk today and threatens future generations by 2040 1 in 4 children worldwide and 155 million in south asia alone will be living in areas experiencing water scarcity unquote unicef goes onto say that to address water scarcity it is imperative to assesses the availability of water resources support the water sector to improve the management of water resources and infrastructure and promote technical and behavioral solutions for sustainable and efficient water use these among others include government to prioritize water security in adaptation plans national commitments and increase funding allocations management of water sanitation and hygiene wash services as a business opportunity with higher value proposition e g energy water and income generation companies innovate and scale wash solutions as core business operations young people are activated as agents of change for sustainable use management of water and protection of the environment the asian development bank in a document titled asian water development outlook awdo 2020 advancing water security across asia and the pacific states that despite considerable achievements in the region since the awdo 2013 edition 1 5 billion people in rural areas and 0 6 billion in urban areas still lack adequate water supply and sanitation sound water management and access to reliable service delivery remain vital to inclusive economic growth and social well being especially after the coronavirus disease covid 19 pandemic awdo 2020 includes two new sections highlighting the importance of finance and governance to water security as well as case studies demonstrating how the awdo has influenced policy development in four countries pollution and death modern waste services provides some shocking information related to deaths occurring dues to pollution it cites the following quote the image shown here is a graph provided by statista it illustrates the effects of pollution all around the world air water and etc the top three nations with the greatest number of pollution related deaths per year are india china and nigeria with india being responsible for 2 33 million deaths and nigeria being responsible for 279 318 deaths per year this is in 2019 alone and some forms of pollution keep increasing every year a 2016 preliminary assessment of the water quality situation in rivers in latin america africa and asia estimates that severe pathogenic pollution affects around one third of all rivers severe organic pollution around one seventh of all rivers and severe and moderate salinity pollution around one tenth of all rivers in these regions this analysis reported by the united nations environment programme illustrates what water pollution looks like all over the world when you look into some of the countries located said mentioned continents you can kind of get an idea of what they re talking about china is one of the biggest producers in the world so you would expect the country to be troubled with air pollution as well as water pollution due to the waste created by industrial factories as well as the incorrect and improper disposal of said waste though some countries in africa such as libya and ghana not only have contaminated water but also lack of resources and money to remedy their problem that is why so many people in these impoverished countries contract various and dangerous ailments and they often end up dying especially young children or older adults with weakened immune systems unquote marine pollution one of the most telling futuristic predications as far as marine pollution is concerned is made by conservation international saying that quote by 2050 ocean plastic will outweigh all of the ocean s fish the ocean is the origin and the engine of all life on this planet and it is under threat a big part of the problem pollution so how does trash get into the ocean it s dumped pumped spilled leaked and even washed out with our laundry each year we expose the world s waterways to an increasing variety of pollutants plastic debris chemical runoff crude oil and more eight million metric tons that s how much plastic we dump into the oceans each year that s about 17 6 billion pounds or the equivalent of nearly 57 000 blue whales every single year unquote there is an abundance of futuristic information based on research studies pertaining to fresh water and sea water and all these have a common thread in that they are in unison by predicting a major catastrophe when it comes to fresh water and marine life in sea water the information given above and much more that is available in the international domain no doubt confirms the widely known but hardly noticed degree of degradation by human beings of the single most critical resource that sustains all forms of life on earth what is not clear is what and how much is being done to arrest this degradation before it is too late the sri lankan situation lack of a water management policy sri lanka s freshwater resources derive from 103 rivers which have a total length of 4 560 km some 14 000 ancient human made reservoirs springs more than 20 significant wetlands and groundwater resources and the annual renewable groundwater resources estimated at 7 8 km the annual rainfall in different regions of sri lanka varies between 800 mm to more than 5 000 mm these sustain human and other fauna and flora provides for hydro power generation and biodiversity in tropical climates such as that of sri lanka rainfall is the primary feature that defines climate and climate change many research work on the sri lankan water situation however seems to cover an approach that is vital on the one hand as it covers the all important aspect of agriculture and potability but not depicting the broader context of water from the point of view of its interconnectedness to several other areas these being fisheries both maritime and fresh water hydropower energy in general including renewable energy forestry wildlife protected areas bio diversity and very importantly climate change there does not seem to be an overall policy framework that covers this broader context of water in an in depth research work titled a review on water governance in sri lanka the lessons learnt for future water policy formulation published in the journal of the world water council in january 2021 researchers highlight critical challenges for future water policy formulation in sri lanka and states that the policy formulation for water resources management in sri lanka had been done on several occasions however sri lanka still owns neither an approved water policy nor a follow up procedure for a policy this paper brings to light a vacuum that exists and which needs to be addressed a water policy for sri lanka which must extend to the broader context of water and which has to be enforceable with wide ranging powers granted by law to an independent agency despite the seeming adequacy of fresh water the fragility of this availability from the point of view of global climate change and issues like pollution need to be considered when formulating a water policy excessive rain falls and flash floods prolonged periods of drought and flash droughts are experienced today and a further deterioration of this situation would be potentially catastrophic to the country two issues that are of critical interest for the sustainability of life is water quality arising from pollution and other factors and the question of optimum utilisation of water as a resource that sustains life water contamination in regard to pollution both sea water and fresh water the sri lanka national water development report 2006 pointed out a variety of quality concerns in sri lanka including contamination by nitrate and bacteria in underground and surface waters mainly due to poor sanitation and untreated wastewater or insufficient wastewater treatment toxic chemicals from industrial and agricultural activities and eutrophication in lakes reservoirs the report covers deterioration of water quality in rivers lakes and reservoirs coastal water and ground water in all or most instances the excessive use of inorganic fertilisers weedicides and pesticides in some areas and industrial effluents polluting water sources have been reported treatment of wastewater to prevent contamination of fresh water sources is critical to the suitability of the limited freshwater resources varying levels of treatment will facilitate its re use for appropriate purposes industries should be required to treat their wastewater to standards that they are able to recycle and reuse much of it dilrukshi handunetti in a report done in june 2019 for mongabay says that microplastics and overfishing are the leading causes of extensive marine pollution in sri lanka as per a new survey and for the first of its kind carried out in 40 years showing that the island s fish stock had dropped drastically by about 80 percent in part due to high levels of microplastic contamination researchers believed the island s northwestern seas had recorded the highest levels of marine pollution while seas to the east remain rich with marine life and should be made a conservation priority it is noteworthy that unops has just signed an agreement with the south asia co operative environment programme sacep an intergovernmental organization headquartered in sri lanka to support them in the implementation of the world bank funded plastic free rivers and seas for south asia project please this agreement will benefit sri lanka as well to be continued the authors raj gonsalkorale mba international management consultant janendra de costa bsc agric phd senior professor and chair of crop science faculty of

progressives have long wanted to tax unrealized gains from billionaires stocks bonds land holdings homes artwork cars yachts and other property as appealing as this sounds the scheme would be vastly complicated and unworkable in the absence of sales who would evaluate current values and how advertisement but the frustrations we commoners have with the ultra rich are understandable especially when they lecture us about eating less climate altering beef avoiding 5 00 gasoline by buying 60 000 electric vehicles and bankrolling experts who say we should live in 650 square foot apartments so it s entertaining when some of those billionaires start arguing about who is more saintly and sanctimonious when it comes to preventing the alleged climate crisis elon musk and bill gates have been quibbling about which of them cares more about climate change musk recently refused a philanthropic opportunity with gates because the microsoft co founder still has a half billion dollar short position against tesla which musk says is the company doing the most to solve climate change gates says he gives more to climate causes than anyone else including musk however as happens too often with elites who promote climate activist agendas when it comes to ensuring human and planetary health they both ignore evidence the big picture and their own lifestyles including private jets and multiple mansions they re not alone after spending eight years attacking fossil fuels former president obama installed a 2 500 gallon propane system at his 6 900 square foot martha s vineyard home which is apparently safe from rising seas that endanger other coastal properties resulting from propane oil and natural gas emissions advertisement recommended amazon founder jeff bezos led an entourage of 400 luminaries dignitaries and green ceos flying private jets to the 2021 cop 26 climate confab in glasgow two years earlier currency manipulator george soros and 1 500 other global leaders hopped their private jets to the world economic forum in davos once again to focus attention on sustainability and dangerous global warming as climate czar john kerry explained private jets are the only choice for someone as important as he is not to be outdone leonardo dicaprio flew a private jet to new york city in 2016 to accept an environmental award then flew it back to france a day later climate change is real he intoned of course it s real it s been real throughout earth s history and there is no real world evidence to support assertions that manmade greenhouse gases have replaced the powerful natural forces that drove past climate fluctuations or that fossil fuel emissions are now causing dangerous warming and weather computer models are not evidence and their predictions generally conflict with actual world events why should we disrupt our energy economy and living standards because models claim there s a crisis yet models are always the last refuge for the false prophets of climate armageddon in reality far more people die in cold weather than in hot spells and a slightly warmer planet would be quite beneficial for both humanity and the plant and animal kingdoms advertisement there is simply no credible evidence that today s climate fluctuations and weather events are due to fossil fuels instead of the same natural forces that have operated throughout earth history tornado records show fewer violent twisters 1950 1985 than during the 36 years since not a single category 3 5 hurricane made u s landfall for a record 12 years 2005 2012 three especially brutal droughts during a 200 year dry spell caused the mayan civilization to collapse by 930 ad multiple droughts struck the chaco canyon four corners region 1130 1450 helping to end the anasazi civilization extreme dry conditions contributed to the decline of the ancient south arabian kingdom of himyar causing political unrest and war and fostering the spread of islam the pleistocene glacial epochs and little ice age brought frozen droughts to europe asia and north america even worse than the fake science and endless fear mongering their proposed remedies to the climate crisis would be far more harmful to people and planet than the warming and weather they worry about replacing fossil fuel and nuclear electricity generation would mean blanketing the planet with millions of wind turbines billions of solar panels billions of backup battery modules thousands of mines to produce the raw materials for these technologies mostly chinese operated and hundreds of landfills for worn out 300 foot long wind turbine blades and other dilapidated green energy equipment thankfully the united states has a huge thus far unused landfill arizona s grand canyon advertisement the ease with which billionaire climate club members do business with china also conflicts with gnerally accepted standards of environmental and human rights ethics musk is quite cozy with the chinese communist regime from taking billions in regime funded loans to speaking at their embassy to building a factory in xinjiang amid the uyghur genocide he is surprisingly comfortable working with a state founded on ideologies of totalitarian hatred and abuse gates stretched the limits of u s security laws to help china build nuclear reactors suitable for powering naval vessels even as china continues making strategic long term moves to control ever larger swaths of the pacific and surpass u s naval power in this critical region incredibly but understandably these billionaires rarely if ever criticize xi jinping s regime in fact musk has met with communist officials on multiple occasions and frequently says china rocks even though it is by far the world s biggest emitter of carbon dioxide co2 and toxic pollutants in fact in 2019 china s greenhouse gas emissions were nearly 2 5 times those of the united states and more than all the world s developed nations combined in co2 equivalent china emitted 14 1 billion metric tons that year more than a quarter of the entire world s emissions musk even stopped serving on president trump s advisory panels to protest mr trump s decision to withdraw from the meaningless paris climate agreement that s actually a treaty advertisement so why are musk and gates so quick to criticize america but never reprimand the people s republic they clearly don t live by the environmental principles they preach and won t even criticize the world s worst greenhouse gas emitter toxic chemicals polluter and child and slave labor practitioner still worse the policies they promote would harm global public health as congressman john curtis r utah founder of the conservative climate caucus recently noted killing american fossil fuels just causes them to be replaced by dirtier foreign sources in particular chinese and russian perhaps mr curtis suggested we should instead start attacking carbon emissions not energy sources through carbon capture american innovation natural solutions and other paths that boost the american economy while reducing global emissions over the last decade the u s has reduced co2 emissions more than any other country in the world yet musk gates and fellow jet setters continue to support policies like the paris accord which would impose major restrictions on the u s while allowing china to continue increasing emissions through 2030 perhaps instead we should just stop trying to reduce co2 emissions since that monumental and costly global effort is driven by demands that we prevent a manmade climate crisis that doesn t actually exist if these climate activists wish to make a difference in human and environmental health around the world they need to change their perspective and their relationship with communist china they need to begin looking at real world climate and weather evidence and practicing what they preach advertisement unfortunately they re unwilling to do so they d rather make noise and more billions than safeguard us commoners economy and living standards or support true productive change in america and abroad paul driessen is senior policy analyst for the committee for a constructive tomorrow www cfact org and author of eco imperialism green power black death and articles on energy climate and other issues
albany new york a new york state judge has struck down a recent law giving 800 000 non citizen new york city residents the right to vote in municipal elections including for mayor the ruling noted that the law violated the state constitution which states that every citizen is entitled to vote the voting law was passed by the democrat controlled new york city council in december and came into force in january after both mayor bill de blasio and his successor eric adams declined to either sign or veto it the law stipulates that a person must have been a nyc resident for at least 30 days prior to the election which is described as too short a time period by critics including republicans who opposed the law since a majority of immigrants are more likely to vote for democrats the law s supporters said it empowered the city s considerable population of non citizens who pay taxes and contribute to the life and culture of the city opponents including the republican party and new york lawmakers who sued the city said the law unfairly and unconstitutionally diluted the power of citizens votes the city council and law department which could appeal the ruling in a higher state court said the city was assessing its options in a joint statement council speaker adrienne adams and shahana hanif chair of the council s immigration committee said by providing city residents with a voice in their local government representation we provide them with an equal stake in the long term success of our city republican michael tannousis who represents parts of staten island and brooklyn in the new york state assembly and was one of the plaintiffs in the suit said as the son of immigrants that came to this country legally and worked tirelessly to become citizens i consider voting to be a sacred right bestowed on american citizens
menafn valuewalk the upcoming stagflation might be less severe than in the 1970s so is the fed s reaction which could mean good news for gold there are many terrifying statements you can hear from

against legacy data centers that face growing competition from the trio of technology giants which have previously been their biggest customers the fund manager who is best known for his winning bet against read more i ve explained it many times but let me remind you that stagflation is a combination of economic stagnation and high inflation this is why it s a nightmare for central bankers as they should ease monetary policy to stimulate the economy and simultaneously tighten it to curb inflation although we haven t fallen into recession yet the pace of gdp growth has slowed down recently according to the world bank s report global economic prospects from june 2022 the global economy is in the midst of a sharp growth slowdown and growth over the next decade is expected to be considerably weaker than over the past two decades the u s growth is expected to slow to 2 5 percent in 2022 1 2 percentage points lower than previously projected and 3 2 percentage points below growth in 2021 this is why more and more experts raise concerns about stagflation similar to what happened in the 1970s so far employment remains strong but the misery index which is the sum of the unemployment rate and inflation rate is already relatively high see the chart below and could continue to rise if economic activity deteriorates further so it seems that the consensus view is that stagflation is likely but the key question is how bad it will be or how similar it will be to the stagflation of the 1970s as the chart below shows that period was pretty bad the inflation rate stayed above 5 for a decade reaching almost 15 in early 1980 meanwhile there was a long and deep recession in 1973 1975 and the subsequent two in the 1980s triggered by volcker s monetary tightening that was

can help you achieve your financial goals get started now similarities are quite obvious first the economic slowdown came after the previous recession and rebound second supply shocks supply disruptions caused by the pandemic and by russia s invasion of ukraine resemble the oil shocks of the 1970s third the burst of inflation comes after prolonged period of easy monetary policy and negative real interest rates according to the world bank global real interest rates averaged 0 5 percent over both the 1970 1980 and the 2010 2021 periods fourth consumer inflation expectations are rising significantly which increases the risk of their de anchoring as in the 1970s as the chart below shows consumers now expect inflation to run at 5 4 over the next twelve months according to the university of michigan survey the highest level since 1981 however the world bank also points out important differences first the magnitude of commodity price jumps has been smaller than in the 1970s oil prices are still below the peaks from those years especially in real terms while the economy is much more energy dependent second the fiscal stance is tighter now in the 1970s fiscal policy was very easy while now it s expected to tighten which could help to curb inflation according to the cbo the federal budget deficit will shrink to 1 0 trillion in 2022 from 2 8 trillion last year third the m2 money stock m2 ballooned after the pandemic by 40 in just two years so the increase in the money supply was much more abrupt although it was rather a one time outburst than a constant fast pace of money supply growth as it was in the 1970s see the chart below thus the pattern of inflation could be similar fourth contemporary economies are much more flexible with the weaker position of trade unions and income and price policies like interest or price controls are not popular today it allows a faster response of supply to rising prices and reduces the likelihood of price wage spirals the fifth difference mentioned by the world bank is more credible monetary policy frameworks and better anchored inflation expectations although true i would be cautious here as the fed remains behind the curve and people could quickly lose confidence in the central bank while inflation expectations could easily de anchor for me the two crucial differences are the much higher levels of both private and public debt today compared to the 1970s see the chart below and less political willingness to combat inflation yes powell could have a laser focus on addressing inflation right now but i seriously doubt whether he will stick with significantly raising interest rates especially when the economy starts to falter so what are the conclusions and implications for the gold market well stagflation is indeed likely as i expect a further economic slowdown next year which will be accompanied by stubbornly elevated inflation although rather lower than this year thanks to normalization in the pace of money supply growth and tightening of both monetary and fiscal policies hence the upcoming stagflation could be less severe than in the 1970s the fed s response will also be less aggressive luckily for the yellow metal powell is not volcker so he won t raise the federal funds rate so decisively hence the current fed s tightening cycle could continue to exert downward pressure on gold however when the fed chickens out and deviates from its hawkish plan when faced with recessionary winds gold should rally again thank you for reading today s free analysis we hope you enjoyed it if so we
