andy bell has a message for investors paralysed by the russia ukraine conflict don t panic the co founder of aj bell one of britain s biggest investment websites has seen a few meltdowns in his time and even though markets are on a rollercoaster ride after russia s invasion of ukraine his advice is that investors should not lose their nerve and make rash decisions it s understandable that uk investors might be concerned about what impact the conflict might have he says but specific exposure to russia is likely to be a tiny proportion of a well diversified portfolio investors should check they are comfortable with their investments but in most cases there will be no need to do anything pioneer andy bell is now looking to launch dodl an app aimed at novice armchair investors his comments will reassure those who watched in trepidation as the ftse100 plunged 4 per cent before rebounding within days then falling again last week bell a multi millionaire whose company has 75 6billion of assets under management keeps an eagle eye on the market after building the website that he started with his friend nicholas littlefair beginning in 1995 with a 10 000 loan it is now one of the uk s most popular brokers for individuals looking to invest in shares and funds aj bell is itself listed on the ftse250 index and has more than 398 000 customers but bell is not content with standing still he has already seen a new wave of so called armchair investors dip their toe in the water during the pandemic he now wants to recruit a new generation who want to put their cash to work in the next few months he will launch dodl an app aimed at novice investors we re hoping that ll help us move further into the younger less experienced investor group he says adding that the annual charge will be a very low 0 15 per cent a year investments are back as an acceptable topic of conversation now when people saw there was going to be a lockdown and easyjet shares were affected it made sense to people they can then start taking a view i think we re coming out of lockdown now so i think those ryanair or easyjet shares are going to start coming back i liken it to dinner party chat not that i ever go to dinner parties he laughs he s more of a family man he says but the 55 year old admits he has similar conversations with his wife and four grown up children around the dinner table lockdown has ended and people are returning to the office but bell whose main rival is hargreaves lansdown which has 1 6million clients is optimistic he can attract those who want to invest over the long term not just wannabe day traders making a quick turn he says the state did a great job stepping in to help people but the amount of money that cost has probably been a wake up call for a lot of people who think actually i need to look after my own financial future bell himself needn t be too anxious his net worth was an estimated 360million in 2019 and he still owns about 22 per cent of the investment site aj bell dished out nearly 40million in dividends in december after profits rose and 87 000 new customers jumped on board in the year to the end of september its own shares are now trading at 2 91 versus 1 60 a share when it floated on the london stock exchange in 2018 unlike most other stock market listings bell ensured that small retail investors could buy shares in its initial public offering ipo alongside big pensions funds and city institutions we made a conscious decision to make the shares available to our customers i think we d have been shot had we not done that he quips i think then the flip side is we ve got to make sure that retail investors don t just get exposed to the weak ipos where the only reason for bringing them in is because they have not received sufficient demand from the institutions the whole system is gamed to exclude retail investors for them to be included there s got to be a really insistent chief executive who says i don t care what you say mr bank adviser we are opening our ipo to retail investors experts argue the exclusion of individual investors from the london stock market is one reason why some fast growing companies are choosing to list overseas to have a bigger and broader pool of shareholders last month the london stock market was dealt a blow when the owner of 30billion british chipmaker arm said it would float the cambridge based company on the nasdaq in new york it s a shame that any british company would want to float in the us as opposed to london he laments if these companies all start listing over there then they start basing the headquarters over there then they start building the skill sets over there but he points to the battering some tech stocks have had in the uk saying i can see why they might be persuaded to go to the us is investing in arm a topic of conversation around the bell dinner table he laughs no i ve been trying to drag my children back from the precipice called crypto but he adds the uk is quite conservative it s dominated by pension funds who naturally are conservative investors we should be encouraging those firms by taking away any barriers for listing in the uk and then try to get a range of institutional investors that really do appreciate high growth tech stocks

middle class snyder said if you asked 10 different economists you d get 10 different answers when growing up my way of thinking was that somebody would be middle class if they were working to make payments on a home had one or two vehicles and could afford the basic things of life snyder added being middle class meant pursuing the american dream that arose after wwii from the 1950s to 1970s during that era people didn t live in poverty but they weren t tremendously wealthy either most importantly people were independent and not reliant on the government however as snyder wrote in a dec 30 2011 article once upon a time the united states had the largest and most vibrant middle class that the world had ever seen unfortunately that is rapidly changing before our eyes snyder told afp it s different today to live the american dream a lot of people have to work two jobs plus globalization has forced those in the u s to compete with workers all over the world especially ones earning slave labor wages outsourcing has proven to be a major factor in eroding the american middle class as snyder so adroitly conveyed big corporations setting up operations in the u s pay 15 20 an hour plus benefits he said on the other side of the world there are fewer regulations and benefits in addition to no minimum wage or environmental concerns if you only pay workers 1 an hour all the rest is profit many huge corporations only care about the bottom line and don t hold any personal feelings for employees so they increasingly view workers as a liability we need to face facts big business doesn t have to hire u s workers anymore the power structure has changed and labor has been devalued therefore incomes aren t rising for middle class families and they re being forced to move toward lower wage jobs if that weren t bad enough technology is making humans expendable if not obsolete nothing can alter that reality snyder stressed in the olden days factories were labor intensive but with robotics computers and automation the labor market is decreasing it doesn t stop there snyder continued if an american company moves their factory or office overseas wall street rewards them because stock prices shoot up it s a bad deal for american workers particularly when u s politicians keep piling on more regulations red tape paperwork and taxes u s workers are at a tremendous disadvantage unless we fundamentally change our policies it will never again work out for the u s middle class this symbiotic relationship between big government and big business has created a situation where both forces benefit creating what is known today as the one percenters in addition a strange phenomenon has occurred today wherein propagandists working for big business utilize a divide and conquer strategy among the left and the right that perpetually fuels partisan animosity stated differently whereas liberal democrats mostly blame greedy wall street bankers for america s problems conservative republicans point to bloated government and unions as the source of our woes so while republicans and democrats tear each other apart the elite one percent in washington and new york city continue to get wealthier what the mainstream media refuses to illustrate is that both of these seemingly disparate factions work together they re on the same team they belong to the same club it s like the joke says a corporate executive a tea party member and a union worker are all sitting at a table when a plate with a dozen cookies arrives before anyone else can make a move the ceo reaches out to rake in 11 of the cookies when the other two look at him in surprise the ceo locks eyes with the tea party member you better watch him the executive says with a nod toward the union worker he wants a piece of your cookie throw in politicians who are funded by wall street and big business and it makes for even more trouble for main street america snyder agrees government and wall street feed off each other businesses make donations to politicians who in turn write laws that benefit corporations it s a symbiotic relationship snyder said that our country at its inception frowned upon such government enablers our founding fathers were suspicious of anyone trying to concentrate power he said not only did they place limits on central government there were also strict limits on corporations the biggest danger to the middle class today is any form of concentrated power i don t think it s surprising that the three counties surrounding washington d c are the three wealthiest counties in america whereas barack obama symbolizes massive government and mitt romney symbolizes big business neither one of them has any incentive to alter the status quo why should they it benefits their supporters who epitomize the one percent in this regard obama socialists and romney capitalists are more than content to let the middle class founder as long as they remain in the upper tier or as snyder said there s more wealth and power in the hands of a few the only way to alleviate this situation and allow small businesses to thrive once again is to break up the size of both government and corporations middle class in a state of dependency by victor thorn when viewing our country s decline the repercussions are already being felt in an april 16 article michael snyder summed it up millions upon millions of middle class americans have been systematically turned into government dependents as it stands now 47m americans collect food stamps a rise of 15m since 2009 with one in seven u s citizens now accepting food stamps the number is even higher for children an alarming one in four moreover 49 of all americans live in a household that receives some form of government benefit in 1983 that figure was less than one third with more people filing for disability under social security not to mention unemployment benefits that sometimes extend three years snyder worries we re training an entire generation to think that the government will take care of all their needs yet when asked what america would look like without its extensive safety net snyder answered much worse than the great depression we d see unbelievable despair and despondency during the clinton and bush administrations a cabal of bankers and politicians temporarily hid this pain by giving home loans and credit cards to anyone that could sign their name on the dotted line the housing bubble was a big part of what happened to the middle class said snyder anyone breathing could get a home loan in those days and as house prices kept increasing people used their residences like atm machines but many of these individuals couldn t afford the payments and once the houses were foreclosed on those people lost their 1 financial asset further weakening the middle class is what some have called a man cession the continuing economic downturn has affected men more severely than women especially in the manufacturing sector blue collar layoffs hit males the hardest snyder said now we have millions of men sitting at home watching tv wondering why they can t find a job it s soul crushing especially if their wives are working these men can t feed the kids or pay their mortgage so it eats away at their self worth snyder added in the 1950s a man could get a job anytime he wanted today only 65 of all working age males are employed this brings in another level of instability and it is further causing the american family to crumble young americans see daunting future seniors look to keep what they have by victor thorn although it hasn t been a pronounced aspect of the occupy wall street movement there exist definite hostilities between today s youth and america s aging population this conflict hits right to the core of who will be america s middle class in the future as the american dream continues to slip away from the younger generation will ageism become the rift that tears the nation apart at the seams according to a nov 28 2011 article by economics writer annalyn censky the average net worth of households led by someone 65 or older is 47 times larger than the median net worth of households led by someone 35 or younger the young feel the system is failing them said michael snyder who runs the widely read website the economic collapse and it creates a great deal of resentment when viewing higher unemployment figures among their ranks housing and education debt are two critical issues facing younger people today but these are not the only pitfalls snyder told afp credit card debt for the young is a very real problem plus couples starting out are strapped with underwater homes or even foreclosures that have completely wiped them out this age group has been hit disproportionately worse the matter of social security must also be addressed snyder speaks for many in their 40s and younger i m convinced i ll never see a single penny of social security i don t believe it ll be around in the future or it ll be so devalued as to be almost worthless we re paying tremendous amounts of money into this fund with more and more of a burden placed on younger workers but we may never get anything out of it in the end snyder cites our government s irresponsibility passing a 15t debt on to future generations is a horrible legacy and then there is the estimated 200t worth of unfunded future mandates that include medicare government pensions and other social safety nets with a 105 national debt to gdp ratio i see an economic collapse before we ever get to the point of paying out these unfunded mandates he said i m talking about a global collapse that will require tremendous restructuring when things blow up it s difficult to envision what will happen we re at a point of crisis will these factors compel youth who have nothing to lose to turn on the elderly especially those who reaped the benefits of more successful times in u s history if the world loses faith in the u s dollar as a reserve currency we ll collapse under the weight of our debt snyder said to compensate the government continues its policies of overspending and printing more money with the result being massive inflation and a debt that swamps us if americans feel the middle class slipping away from them now try to imagine how younger generations feel in terms of their inability to pursue the american dream victor thorn is a hard hitting researcher journalist and the author of over 30 books

andy bell interview the aj bell boss sees a pandemic silver lining for investing as chatting about shares at dinner parties is trendy again andy bell has a message for investors paralysed by the russia ukraine conflict don t panic the co founder of aj bell one of britain s biggest investment websites has seen a few meltdowns in his time and even though markets are on a rollercoaster ride after russia s invasion of ukraine his advice is that investors should not lose their nerve and make rash decisions it s understandable that uk investors might be concerned about what impact the conflict might have he says but specific exposure to russia is likely to be a tiny proportion of a well diversified portfolio investors should check they are comfortable with their investments but in most cases there will be no need to do anything his comments will reassure those who watched in trepidation as the ftse100 plunged 4 per cent before rebounding within days then falling again last week bell a multi millionaire whose company has 75 6billion of assets under management keeps an eagle eye on the market after building the website that he started with his friend nicholas littlefair beginning in 1995 with a 10 000 loan it is now one of the uk s most popular brokers for individuals looking to invest in shares and funds aj bell is itself listed on the ftse250 index and has more than 398 000 customers but bell is not content with standing still he has already seen a new wave of so called armchair investors dip their toe in the water during the pandemic he now wants to recruit a new generation who want to put their cash to work in the next few months he will launch dodl an app aimed at novice investors we re hoping that ll help us move further into the younger less experienced investor group he says adding that the annual charge will be a very low 0 15 per cent a year investments are back as an acceptable topic of conversation now when people saw there was going to be a lockdown and easyjet shares were affected it made sense to people they can then start taking a view i think we re coming out of lockdown now so i think those ryanair or easyjet shares are going to start coming back i liken it to dinner party chat not that i ever go to dinner parties he laughs he s more of a family man he says but the 55 year old admits he has similar conversations with his wife and four grown up children around the dinner table lockdown has ended and people are returning to the office but bell whose main rival is hargreaves lansdown which has 1 6million clients is optimistic he can attract those who want to invest over the long term not just wannabe day traders making a quick turn he says the state did a great job stepping in to help people but the amount of money that cost has probably been a wake up call for a lot of people who think actually i need to look after my own financial future bell himself needn t be too anxious his net worth was an estimated 360million in 2019 and he still owns about 22 per cent of the investment site aj bell dished out nearly 40million in dividends in december after profits rose and 87 000 new customers jumped on board in the year to the end of september its own shares are now trading at 2 91 versus 1 60 a share when it floated on the london stock exchange in 2018 unlike most other stock market listings bell ensured that small retail investors could buy shares in its initial public offering ipo alongside big pensions funds and city institutions we made a conscious decision to make the shares available to our customers i think we d have been shot had we not done that he quips i think then the flip side is we ve got to make sure that retail investors don t just get exposed to the weak ipos where the only reason for bringing them in is because they have not received sufficient demand from the institutions the whole system is gamed to exclude retail investors for them to be included there s got to be a really insistent chief executive who says i don t care what you say mr bank adviser we are opening our ipo to retail investors experts argue the exclusion of individual investors from the london stock market is one reason why some fast growing companies are choosing to list overseas to have a bigger and broader pool of shareholders last month the london stock market was dealt a blow when the owner of 30billion british chipmaker arm said it would float the cambridge based company on the nasdaq in new york it s a shame that any british company would want to float in the us as opposed to london he laments if these companies all start listing over there then they start basing the headquarters over there then they start building the skill sets over there but he points to the battering some tech stocks have had in the uk saying i can see why they might be persuaded to go to the us is investing in arm a topic of conversation around the bell dinner table he laughs no i ve been trying to drag my children back from the precipice called crypto but he adds the uk is quite conservative it s dominated by pension funds who naturally are conservative investors we should be encouraging those firms by taking away any barriers for listing in the uk and then try to get a range of institutional investors that really do appreciate high growth tech stocks

the u s supply chain continues to face unprecedented challenges with u s consumers feeling the brunt of it as products are delayed and associated costs rise as last year came to a close prices for consumer goods rose 7 from the previous year a 40 year high the russian invasion of ukraine impacting staples from grain to energy promises to only make matters worse the fighting has shut down car factories in germany that rely on made in ukraine components and hit supplies for the steel industry as far as japan reports the wall street journal the conflict is also bottling up ukraine and russia s vast commodity exports sending the price of oil natural gas wheat and sunflower oil rocketing such a moment requires not just leadership but restraint by lawmakers to not impose new costs including through regulation of those industries connected closely to the supply chain this includes u s freight railroads which will face the scrutiny of policymakers in hearings in both congress and the surface transportation board stb this month specifically policymakers are considering and some will advocate for new market interventions in the rail sector arguing such regulation is needed to lower costs the facts and history tell a drastically different story though when president jimmy carter was in office he signed a law that largely deregulated freight railroads notably that bill arose from a democrat controlled congress and has been reaffirmed on bipartisan grounds in the years since markets work and they work in railroading too thanks to these regulatory reforms which essentially removed the government from routing trains and pricing their services economists estimate that american consumers enjoy 10 to 20 billion in annual benefits yet in an executive order signed last year president biden urged the stb to strengthen regulations pertaining to reciprocal switching agreements the innocuous and bureaucratic language if enacted into a regulation threatens to take us back 40 years to a time when railroads were going bankrupt productivity was low and consumer prices high under this recent proposal a railroad with physical access to a specific shipping facility is forced to accept rail traffic to the facility for another railroad that lacks physical access while that may sound reasonable at first these regulations could lead to reduced rail traffic for the carrier and increased traffic congestion much like the inefficiencies already hampering today s supply chain while adding significant costs to rail operations the case for re regulating freight railroads however doesn t stand up to scrutiny freight rail operators face intense intermodal competition from trucks and water transport as gas prices continue to climb railroad prices have increased less than trucking in addition while trucking is advantaged by publicly financed roads railroads invest about 19 billion annually to maintain their own infrastructure comparing the environmental impact rail adds significantly less greenhouse gas emissions per shipped ton compared to their trucking counterparts an in depth independent report commissioned by the very agency now considering new regulation concluded that railroad operators earnings do not appear to be excessive from a financial market perspective and warned against exactly the type of regulation that the administration is pursuing this view was affirmed in analysis from economist robert shapiro a former advisor to president obama and a prominent ally of the biden white house the proposed regulation would force railroads to engage in switching activities that make no economic sense for them and have no general economic basis impairing the revenues investment and ongoing operations of u s railroads he wrote government is not here to pick winners and losers or even worse transfer resources away from one sector to another open access railroading is akin to public utility regulation and experts agree this is not the right nor fair approach for an industry competing with unregulated trucking given the supply chain shortages and mounting inflation dragging down the economy this proposed regulation could not have come at the worse time yet the stb has yet to provide any quantitative analysis showing that these regulations would benefit consumers it is time for the white house and stb to abandon this haphazard proposal steve pociask is president and ceo of the american consumer institute a nonprofit education and research organization for more information about the institute visit www theamericanconsumer org or follow us consumerpal

yoon suk yeol the presidential candidate of the main opposition people power party delivers a speech during a campaign rally in the southeastern city of ulsan on feb 19 2022 yonhap yoon suk yeol has undergone a dramatic transformation from a prosecutor general serving president moon jae in to an opposition presidential contender vowing to investigate the administration s deep rooted evils if elected on march 9 yoon 61 rose to prominence as a prosecutor investigating high profile cases under the previous conservative administration of president park geun hye including the massive corruption scandal that led to her impeachment and imprisonment his status earned him the position of prosecutor general under moon but he soon fell out of favor with the liberal administration for targeting his investigations at the president s inner circle as public discontent with the moon administration grew yoon faced calls to run for president as the candidate of the main opposition people power party ppp and with only a year left until the election yoon left the prosecution last march and launched his presidential campaign on the conservative party s ticket yoon s role in the investigation into former president park was a source of consternation for some conservatives as she held a special place in their hearts as a daughter of the assassinated former president park chung hee but yoon s boldness in the face of power and his steadfast adherence to principles gave rise to hope that a yoon presidency could meet their demands for justice and the rule of law born to parents who taught at universities yoon studied law at seoul national university after following the advice of his father who encouraged him to study law even though he had a strong interest in economics shortly before chun doo hwan the country s de facto leader at the time ordered a bloody crackdown on a democracy uprising in gwangju in may 1980 yoon took part in a mock trial at his university and sentenced chun to life imprisonment to escape retribution yoon fled to the eastern coastal town of gangneung where his mother s side of the family lived and stayed there for three months in 1991 yoon passed the bar on his ninth try this administration is probably very afraid and sick to the bone about my victory in the primary yoon said in his acceptance speech after winning the ppp s nomination in november that s because i am the symbol of fairness who toppled cho kuk s hypocrisy and choo mi ae s arrogance as well as the fatal pain that destroys the legitimacy of the moon jae in administration he said cho served briefly as justice minister under moon before an academic fraud scandal involving his family forced him to resign choo was appointed to succeed cho and clashed repeatedly with yoon while aggressively pushing the president s agenda for prosecution reform the animosity between yoon and moon resurfaced in february when the candidate told a local newspaper he would launch an investigation into the administration s deep rooted evils if elected and the president slammed him for making groundless allegations during the course of his campaign yoon made a series of controversial pledges that appeared to target conservatives and young male voters in their 20s and 30s on north korea he suggested the need to launch a preemptive strike in the event of an imminent threat from the regime and pledged to deploy additional units of the us thaad antimissile system in south korea to deter north korean aggression on relations with the united states yoon called for deepening the bilateral alliance as the central axis of seoul s foreign policy while on china he vowed to further upgrade the two countries relationship despite noting that most south koreans do not like the neighboring country with japan yoon vowed to repair the deeply fractured relationship by recognizing the suffering of south koreans under tokyo s 1910 45 colonial rule but also looking to a future of co existence yoon prompted criticism after pledging to abolish the ministry of gender equality and family which his opponents viewed as a move to woo young male voters resentful of the rise of feminism the covid 19 pandemic was a recurring theme during the race to help small businesses hit by the government s tough virus restrictions yoon promised to provide 50 trillion won 41 billion in loans and another 43 trillion won in cash handouts in the real estate sector he pledged to supply 2 5 million new homes and help stabilize home prices by easing regulations and lowering capital gains and property ownership taxes yoon frequently came under attack for his careless remarks such as when he praised the political leadership of chun with the exception of his staging of a military coup and his crackdown on the 1980 uprising the candidate was accused of relying on superstition and shamans after he displayed the chinese character for king on his palm and was reported to have ties to an anal acupuncture specialist the biggest liability for yoon was his wife kim keon hee who was accused of taking bribes and manipulating stocks before he launched his campaign and later faced allegations of lying on her resume when applying for jobs the couple married in 2012 and live with four dogs and three cats they have no children yonhap

tri county rail team works alongside transportation company to improve local rail service by kris leonhardt central wisconsin after a year of negotiations watco a transportation service company based in pittsburg ks has finalized the sale of the shortline line of railway between spencer and medford watco announced in march of 2021 that it had signed an agreement with the canadian national cn railway subsidiaries of wisconsin central ltd and algoma central railway inc to purchase certain assets from both railways which included the 28 miles of track connecting spencer and medford watco s relationship continues to grow and flourish with canadian national as we work together to provide the best value added services to rail shippers in north america said watco chief executive officer dan smith said in a release adding that it was an extremely important and exciting next step in this relationship and we look forward to serving these crucial customers and expanding our footprint in the upper midwest and canada this acquisition from canadian national will lead to significant growth and expansion opportunities said watco chief commercial officer stefan loeb we look forward to providing watco s customizable and localized service to customers along the line and creating a positive impact on all of the communities we will operate in on dec 20 after a long delay the surface transportation board stb approved watco s purchase from the cn owned wisconsin central of approximately 652 miles of branch lines in wisconsin and michigan on april 5 2021 watco filed for a series of exemptions to acquire the rail lines the board received numerous comments supporting the transactions and numerous comments opposing it after careful consideration of all comments received the board finds that the issues raised do not demonstrate regulation is necessary to carry out the rail transportation policy and that it is appropriate to allow watco to proceed with the exemption process the stb said in a release watco took over the spencer medford shortline on jan 29 the tri county railroad team working alongside the transportation company was a representation from three central wisconsin counties including officials from seven cities and villages along with other community leaders with the goal of advocating for the preservation and enhancement of freight railroad between spencer and medford clark county economic development corporation tourism bureau executive director sheila nyberg said the effort was started in 2019 at that time cn was the owner of the spencer to medford line the short line rail between spencer and medford had several companies that were using or desired to use that rail for services our clark county edc office took the lead to unite all of the three counties affected by this shortline and bring them together for a mutual purpose this team became known as the tri county rail team because it involved not only clark communities businesses but also marathon and taylor said sheila nyberg clark county economic development corporation tourism bureau executive director sheila nyberg the team s mission is to bring the railroad and the communities and business owners together to ramp up rail services we knew that working together was necessary for our future success along that line therefore we introduced everyone so we could grow rail services and partnerships on this short line team members are from all 3 counties and all towns cities and villages along that rail line it also includes all the businesses that have interest in rail we also brought the railroad company leaders into the meetings so they could have face to face contact with customers and communities also an important team member was the wi dot freight railroad program manager it was crucial that everyone was in the room to have clear discussions on needs opportunities and how to plan and fund growth after much communication to work on growing services over the past two plus years it was announced in 2021 that cn had put this shortline along with many other parts of their lines in the northern part of wisconsin up for sale as a group package deal we stayed involved through the process and kept constant communication between all the partners wisconsin department of transportation freight railroad program manager rich kedzior was part of that team he provided technical support to the communities on freight railroad service issues wisdot has a goal to preserve freight railroad service in the state wherever possible wisdot supported watco s acquisition of the cn lines in northern wisconsin because we believe that watco s business model is more attuned to the needs of small businesses and communities he said the conditions along the spencer medford line seem to be a better fit to watco s business model than cn s there is a lot of potential in the line s communities that cn was unable to develop i have a lot of optimism that watco s outreach to businesses in the corridor will result in more rail shipments on the line and improved service and this could lead to business investment in the line s communities the rail system s history in 1871 the wisconsin central was awarded an 880 000 acre land grant to build a line from menasha to ashland the line of track from spencer to medford was constructed in 1872 73 with rail service starting shortly after its completion in the area the entire line was completed until 1886 in 1890 93 the railroad was leased to northern pacific control returned to the wisconsin central wc for about 16 years before the minneapolis st paul and sault ste marie mstp ssm railroad or soo line began a nearly century long lease during this lease the wc operated as a separate entity with its own board of directors and profits and losses were posted to the wc not the soo line locomotives and rolling stock of the wc bore the soo line logo but had a small wc identifier said central wisconsin railroad historian george winkler in his piece wisconsin central railroad in 1961 a major reorganization occurred the wisconsin central the mstp ssm and the duluth south shore atlantic were merged to the new soo the old soo line dollar sign logo was replaced with soo when the soo line acquired the milwaukee road in 1987 the old wc main was operated for a time as lake states division it was later sold to a new firm wisconsin central ltd which operated the railway until it was sold to canadian national in 2001 canadian national maintained a small amount of rail freight service from spencer to medford but the shortline was never a crucial part of operations however nyberg said that the service remains significant to the area having this very important transportation service available to this area is crucial we will continue to work with all our partners to make certain we are united in our work so that everyone can grow and prosper nyberg added

while in mexico around 2 million jobs have been lost since the arrival of the pandemic in the united states 4 million citizens voluntarily left their jobs during the health crisis according to the u s bureau of labor statistics this u s phenomenon is remarkable it seems ironic that people would choose to leave their jobs in the middle of a pandemic where is this wave of resignations in the u s coming from to a large extent it is a response to the ambitious financial assistance package signed by president joe biden for 1 9 trillion the same package that has sustained the pockets of the majority of u s citizens biden signed a monthly check for 1 400 directly to all those who fulfilled two requirements they had filed their tax returns and they had an annual income of less than 75 000 it sounds good doesn t it although most people do not want to work in places where the risk of infection is higher such as restaurants hotels shops or bars one thing is certain upon receiving a monthly check of 1 400 it makes sense that many people would have no desire to go to work another factor that justifies the huge tidal wave of resignations is the change in people s mentality leading many to make the decision to leave a job that causes stress or simply does not bring them joy i know people in the u s who after receiving financial assistance not only gave themselves the luxury of leaving their jobs but also took advantage of the situation to invest in the stock market which has increased in recent months on the other side of the coin the lack of personnel in the labor market has caused difficulties for companies that are currently looking for ways to attract more workers with that they must accept the general increase in the cost of work one in seven companies in the u s increased their salaries they also offered temporary pay raises or paid workers who encouraged others to apply for work thus big companies like target and best buy continue to rethink their hiring strategies we are talking about a highly relevant factor that could lead to an increase in inflation in turn it has transformed the vision of those searching for jobs given that today they demand higher salaries more benefits and more respect a situation that has changed the way in which companies relate to their employees while some specialists state that it might be a temporary phenomenon others are sure that it is the start of a crucial transformation in the american labor market we will have to wait for the effect of this huge financial aid to pass and observe whether companies maintain the current focus given that although only four states are still receiving support checks new financial incentives for 2022 have been announced in the u s furthermore the future of employment in many sectors seems to lie with a hybrid model in person and virtual that allows people to achieve a balance between work and their personal life editor s note the 1 400 stimulus checks were issued once not monthly parents of small children are eligible for additional payments

entrenched in a conflict in ukraine even without sending in u s troops that could have a more far reaching effect on a larger cross section of americans than afghanistan or iraq ever did fighting in afghanistan and iraq cost the lives of more than 6 900 u s troops and more than 7 500 u s contractors and american spending topped 2 3 trillion but those wars had little impact on how the vast majority of americans lived their daily lives it was a 20 year period where people experienced both the great recession and the longest u s economic expansion touchstones that were little influenced by the two grinding conflicts now five months after the end of the war in afghanistan the longest in u s history americans are entering complicated terrain with the russian invasion in ukraine while biden promises there will be no american forces on the ground there he acknowledged the war waged by russian president vladimir putin could have real impact on americans pocketbooks a russian dictator invading a foreign country has costs around the world biden told americans in his state of the union address on tuesday night the financial tumult of the most significant military campaign in europe since world war ii is already being felt this past week saw u s crude oil prices surge about 13 to roughly 113 per barrel and the cost of natural gas reached a record in europe as the war stoked market fears about a supply shock key stock market indices volatile for weeks saw further losses as french president emmanuel macron warned the worst is yet to come after a lengthy phone call on thursday with putin yet in washington as well as in european capitals there are signs of growing resolve to confront putin and of a willingness to take on some economic pain in the process it s a markedly different tone than in the aftermath of the 9 11 attacks that spurred the afghanistan war then president george w bush implored americans then to stand against terror by going back to work and suggested americans get down to disney world as his administration tried to restore faith in the u s airline industry over the next 20 years u s service members including more than 52 000 wounded in action and their families would largely carry the burden a taliban fighter stands guard in front of protesters condemning president joe biden s decision on frozen afghan assets in kabul afghanistan feb 15 after winding down 20 years of endless war in which the vast majority of americans felt little impact on their daily lives biden now finds the u s mired in a conflict in ukraine photo hussein malla associated press in washington house speaker nancy pelosi d calif got ahead of the white house in recent days in pushing for sanctions directly targeting russia s energy sector the lifeblood of putin s economy the administration has been hesitant to target russian oil out of concern such a move would also imperil the economies of the u s and western allies ban it pelosi said of russian oil imports sens joe manchin d w va and lisa murkowski r alaska introduced a bipartisan bill to do just that the legislation would halt russian oil imports to the u s by declaring a national emergency something biden could also do on his own if there was a poll being taken and they say joe would you support 10 cents more a gallon for the people of ukraine i would gladly manchin said whether that view is widely held in the united states could go a long way to determine if biden s popularity will rebound after sinking to dismal levels sen mitt romney r utah said the sanctions on russia could raise interest rates slow the economy and drive up inflation and gas prices he suggested americans were prepared to sacrifice this comes at cost romney said nowhere near the cost of blood that would be involved if we let putin run amok but it is not without sacrifice public polling suggests americans increasingly believe that the u s may have to do more to help ukraine forty five percent of americans said in the days after russia invaded that the u s was doing too little to help ukraine another 37 said the u s was doing the right amount just 7 said efforts were too much according to a quinnipiac poll this past week american politicians have shown greater resolve about what lies ahead as ukrainians have demonstrated in biden s words pure courage in intense fighting against russian forces there s also been a substantial change in european attitudes as the russian military has pummeled ukraine s biggest cities in germany chancellor olaf scholz was quick to put nord stream 2 a recently completed 11 billion russia to germany gas pipeline on indefinite hold once russia invaded a reversal of germany s previous position the german government also reversed its long held policy of not sending weaponry to a conflict zone and announced it would send anti tank and stinger weapons to ukraine the german government one of several european nations that have been laggard in meeting nato countries pledge to spend 2 of gdp on defense by 2024 said it would about triple its defense budget in 2022 german economy minister robert habeck even called on his country to take on putin in another way if you want to hurt putin a bit then save energy he said even hungary whose pro russian strongman president viktor orban resisted speaking out against russia in the leadup to the war has condemned russian military action expressed support for sanctions and agreed to give temporary protection to ukrainian refugees entering hungary at the white house officials say the stiffening of european allies resolve came after many had showed some wariness about confronting the russians u s national security officials released a steady drip of intelligence for more than two months before the war that suggested putin was intent on a full scale invasion but even so in talks with biden s national security team some european allies seemed convinced until right before putin acted that he would do something less than a full invasion talk of reacting with half measures quickly melted away even among some of the most reluctant european allies once it became clear putin had put his sights went far beyond disputed territories in eastern ukraine we are taking steps to stand up for democracy stand up for democracy versus autocracy stand up to the actions of a brutal dictator jen psaki white house press secretary now as the costs to western economies mount biden and allied leaders pain threshold will be tested further asked about the administration s confidence in unity as the costs of the war rise white house press secretary sought to turn the focus back on putin we are taking steps to stand up for democracy stand up for democracy versus autocracy stand up to the actions of a brutal dictator psaki said it is because of his actions that we are in this circumstance edward frantz a historian at the university of indianapolis said biden appeared to be headed toward a foreign policy sweet spot after the chaotic ending of the u s war in afghanistan in the final days of that war 13 u s service members were killed in a suicide bomb attack as they assisted evacuation efforts at the kabul airport as tangled and heart wrenching as the withdrawal was biden had completed a campaign promise of ending the war something his three predecessors failed to do it also allowed him to more fully turn washington s attention to what biden sees as america s central foreign policy challenge confronting the rise of economic and military adversary china now instead we re back to the cold war frantz said if this is a long project and it certainly seems it will be the president now faces the challenge of selling to americans why enduring some impact to our economy for ukraine matters that is not going to be easy

in june 2018 dunbarton tobacco trust released a new line named sin compromiso which translates to without compromise from spanish while the line had been teased for the first time seven years ago during the 2015 ipcpr convention trade show at the time brand owner steve saka stated that the cigars were not close to being ready indicating he has just started buying tobaccos for it sin compromiso debuted in mid 2019 with five different soft pressed violas but six months later dunbarton tobacco trust shipped florida retailer corona cigar co a 6 x 60 exclusive version of the line named selección no 6 that was followed by another 6 x 60 incarnation in september 2019 named el amsterdammer which was made exclusively for cigaragua a retailer located in amsterdam last july dunbarton announced the newest release in the sin compromiso paladin de saka a 7 x 50 box pressed churchill that uses the same basic varietals as sin compromiso however for this incarnation saka has indicated that the blend is made from the best leaves that were separated from the tobaccos the company selects for the rest of the sin compromiso line like the regular sin compromise it uses a mexican san andrés negro cultivo tonto wrapper covering an ecuadorian hybrid habano binder and filler tobaccos sourced from nicaragua however there are three other main differences between the newest release and the rest of the sin compromiso vitolas first the paladin de saka features the addition of pennsylvania ligero in the filler which according to saka makes the blend a touch more robust compared to the other releases in the line second the new cigar also features a regular box press instead of the softer press found on other sin compromiso vitolas finally it uses a slightly different color scheme for the band like the rest of the sin compromiso line other than the aforementioned el amsterdammer which is the brand s only limited edition paladin de saka is a regular production release packaged in boxes of 13 with each cigar carrying an msrp of 29 75 meaning every box is priced at 386 75 the cigars are rolled at fábrica de tabacos joya de nicaragua s a and started shipping to retailers in late december there are currently eight different releases in the sin compromiso line sin compromiso selección intrépido 5 2 3 x 46 sin compromiso selección no 2 torpedo 6 x 52 sin compromiso selección no

production regular production number of cigars smoked for review 3 physically the sin compromiso paladin de saka is a large cigar both before you pick it up and once you actually have it in your hand where it fells like it weighs quite a bit more than it should the combination of cedar wrap and main band take at least 80 percent of the total real estate of the stick but once i remove the massive cedar wrap i can easily see a gorgeous espresso bean colored wrapper that is sandpaper rough to the touch and looks as though it was dipped in oil before being packaged in addition the cigar features a soft box press and a small pigtail on the cap and two samples have a small discolored spot one just under the main band and one right above the edge of the foot the aroma from the wrapper includes not only very strong earth and hay notes but also leather coca nibs barnyard and a light campfire note that campfire aroma is quite a bit more aggressive from the foot of the cigar where it combines with additional notes of cloves manure gritty earth mesquite espresso beans leather tack and generic sweetness finally after a straight cut the cold draw is inundated with strong mesquite roasted espresso beans tea leaves earth cinnamon cloves and slight berry sweetness peat and cracked black pepper are the first things to greet my palate just after lighting the foot of the paladin de saka but while the latter becomes part of the general profile the former begins to fade before being replaced by a combination of mesquite and charred meat that have become the top flavors additional notes of gritty earth aged leather cinnamon hay cocoa nibs and brewed coffee flit in and out while the retrohale includes both that aforementioned cracked black pepper and a distinct albeit not overly strong berry sweetness construction wise the draw and smoke production are top notch on all three samples and while the burn is a bit wavy none of the cigars need any sort of correction so far flavor and body both end the first third at a solid medium but rising while the strength finishes just under the medium mark while the profile of the cigar mellows a bit beginning just after the start of the second third including noticeably less cracked black pepper on the retrohale although there is still a bit present just not near as evident as it was in the first third the flavors are still coming hard and heavy with the same charred meat and mesquite combination leading the way secondary flavors include hay creamy almonds gritty earth leather tack bitter dark chocolate and cloves along with a touch of a floral note that is there and gone almost before i can register it as previously mentioned there is now less cracked black pepper on the retrohale which in turn allows the berry sweetness to have a larger impact on the profile in terms of construction two samples run into enough trouble to need corrections with my lighter while both the draw and smoke production continue along their excellent path flavor has increased to medium full body has reached a point just over medium and the strength is at a solid medium by the end of the second third the final third of the sin compromiso is virtual carbon copy of the second third a fact that disappoints me not at all mesquite and charred meat continue to lead the way in the profile a wonderful combination that is only enhanced by the light cracked black pepper and slightly stronger berry sweetness that continue to dominate the retrohale in addition flavors of cloves earth leather cinnamon powdery cocoa nibs roasted coffee beans and almonds make themselves known at various points but sadly there is no return of the floral note from the previous third thankfully the burn has evened up nicely and gives me no more issues on any of the samples while the draw and smoke production remain a high point of construction until the end of the cigar flavor ends just under the full mark but the body barely moves from its point at medium plus and the strength hits medium plus just as i put the nub down with slightly less than an inch remaining final notes the combination of mesquite and charred meat that leads the profile of this cigar has not been noticeable in in any of the other sin compromiso vitolas i have smoked leading me to theorize that it is present due to the pennsylvania ligero tobacco that was added to the filler according to saka all of the paladin de saka cigars are aged for a year after they are rolled there is something a bit odd about having a line of cigars literally named without compromise adding a more premium version of the blend that includes tobacco that is supposedly even better than what was used before as my colleague patrick lagreid explained in his review of the sin compromiso selección no 2 torpedo the wrapper on these cigars is grown in a manner inspired by japanese fruit farmers as the tobacco plant grows the bottom leaves are removed from the plant forcing more nutrients to the top thus producing a bolder leaf interestingly if you look at the collection photograph above you may notice that the main band for the sin compromiso has changed slightly for at least the last two releases it started out white and green then switched to cream and green for the no 6 and then changed again to silver and green for the paladin de saka i have not seen the el amsterdammer in person so i can t comment on that band the sin compromiso no 2 took the 9th spot on halfwheel s 2018 top 25 list while the sin compromiso selección no 6 took the 9th place on our top 25 list in 2019 peat is not a flavor that i have i picked up in the profile of cigars very often through the years interestingly i can t stand the flavor in alcohol but there was not enough of it in the actual profile nor did it stick around long enough to negatively affect the profile for me construction overall was excellent i had no issues with either the draw or the smoke production and two samples needed very minor corrections both in the second third the cigars were just joys to smoke in that regard dunbarton tobacco trust is an advertiser on halfwheel the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel at one hour and 48 minutes the average final smoking time was surprisingly short for a cigar of this weight and size if you would like to purchase any of the sin compromiso paladin de saka cigars site sponsors atlantic cigar co cigar hustler corona cigar co and famous smoke shop all have them in stock 91 overall score bold but balanced the sin compromiso paladin de saka is a flavor bomb from the first puff never letting up until you put the nub down the profile starts out peaty before shifting to mesquite and charred meat while the berry sweetness on the retrohale combines with some black pepper to keep things interesting in addition while there is a noticeable campfire component in the profile it is never overwhelming in fact it adds quite a bit of complexity to the blend that is missing in the other vitolas in the line making it one of the best cigars i have smoked this year so far

senate president craig blair was a special guest star in the house finance committee on saturday testifying about an insurance program to cover mine reclamation and an avalanche of potential liability blair has felt strongly about senate bill 1 and has publicly endorsed it on previous occasions on saturday he took another opportunity to speak before house finance blair a former member of the house of delegates said he felt back at home here s the headline exposed blair told delegates showing an article about mine reclamation liability west virginia and other states are relying on a house of cards to pay for coal mining cleanup the house finance committee advanced the bill on saturday afternoon after discussing it for about an hour and a half the full house of delegates will now consider the bill it s clear that we have some serious exposure in our markets and that we are taking clear measures to protect our coal industry and the state said delegate john hardy r berkeley i think this is a proactive way to protect our exposure the bill would establish a mining mutual insurance company on the strength of 50 million in seed money from the state blair assured delegates that the 50 million a loan would be secure i believe with all my being that we re not going to lose the 50 million that s not going to be the case he said the insurer would be a bulwark against the possibility that the financial troubles of coal companies could render them unable to meet their obligations to reclaim the land they have mined delegates on the finance committee asked a variety of questions including what financial risk the state faces how the mutual would work and whether this approach would truly be the best solution as you ve created this what is it that leads you to believe the insurance the bonding market will not fill the need like the market typically does when there s a cost problem or an availability problem asked delegate marty geartheart r mercer essentially asking why the state would put up money for an insurance mutual when private companies could do so instead blair s answer was that economic markets are choosing against coal right now injecting uncertainty about long term debt and the kind of capital necessary to clean up mine sites the industry has been taking a beating blair said delegate larry rowe d kanawha asked whether other solutions might be more appropriate my concern is i don t see how it insulates us from the ultimate responsibility on reclamation rowe said later voting no and if we use a private bond market what we re really doing is we re stepping into a private bond market that has been teetering but we re stepping in with a new company that may help in the market and it may not because 50 million won t cover the liability as you ve described it in the billions blair s response to that was this kind of mutual needs to be created now instead of later when it s a true crisis right now the state s special reclamation fund is set up to cover any shortfall but the worry is that could become overwhelmed by obligations the bill establishing the insurance mutual specifies that it would not be considered a department or agency of the state but instead would be a company governed by five directors the chairman though would be appointed by the governor and the remaining members would also be named by state officials a sense of urgency began last summer after lawmakers heard the summary of a 52 page report laying out the likelihood of mine reclamation as a budget bomb in short west virginia is subject to federal requirements to have enough money available to complete reclamation for any areas where permit holders default west virginia allows mining companies to post bonds of 1 000 to 5 000 an acre amounts that the department of environmental protection estimates would cover only about 10 percent of reclamation costs west virginia fills the gap with special reclamation funds which are are funded primarily by a 27 9 cent tax levied on every short ton of coal produced increased reclamation costs combined with economic strain on the coal industry has highlighted the possibility of a financial crisis there is exposure there s economic exposure there s exposure to the general revenue fund of the state of west virginia said delegate daniel linville r cabell

rome world food prices hit a record high in february led by a surge in vegetable oils and dairy products to post a 20 7 per cent increase year on year the un food agency said on friday the food and agriculture organisation s fao food price index which tracks the most globally traded food commodities averaged 140 7 points last month against a downwardly revised 135 4 in january that figure was previously given as 135 7 higher food prices have contributed to a broader surge in inflation as economies recover from the coronavirus crisis and the fao has warned that the higher costs are putting poorer populations at risk in countries reliant on imports fao economist upali galketi aratchilage said concerns over crop conditions and export availabilities provided only a partial explanation to the increase in global food prices a much bigger push for food price inflation comes from outside food production particularly the energy fertiliser and feed sectors he said all these factors tend to squeeze profit margins of food producers discouraging them from investing and expanding production data for the february report was mostly compiled before the russian invasion of ukraine concerns over tensions in the black sea area were already weighing on agricultural markets even before the violence flared but analysts warn a prolonged conflict could have a major impact on grain exports fao said its vegetable oils index rose 8 5pc month on month in february to chalk up another record high propelled by rising palm soy and sunflower oil prices ukraine and russia account for about 80pc of global exports of sunflower oil the cereal price index rose 3pc on the month with maize prices up 5 1pc and wheat prices increasing 2 1pc largely reflecting uncertainty about global supply flows from black sea ports fao s dairy price index increased 6 4pc its sixth consecutive monthly rise underpinned by tight global supplies while meat prices rose 1 1pc in february by contrast sugar was the sole index to post a decrease shedding 1 9pc from the previous month due partly to favourable production prospects in major exporters india and thailand fao also issued its first projections for cereal output in 2022 seeing global wheat production rising to 790 million tonnes from 775 4 million in 2021 thanks in part to hopes of high yields and extensive planting in canada the united states and asia the un agency cautioned however that its projections did not take into account the possible impact of the conflict between russia and ukraine fao said maize outputs in argentina and brazil in 2022 were forecast at well above average levels notably in brazil where the maize crop was seen reaching a record high 112 million tonnes world cereal utilisation in 2021 22 was forecast to rise 1 5pc above the 2020 21 level hitting 2 802 billion tonnes fao s forecast for world cereal stocks by the close of seasons in 2022 stood at 836 million tonnes published in dawn march 6th 2022

brazil is searching for new fertilizer suppliers as the war in ukraine threatens to cut off shipments to one of the world s breadbaskets with potential ripple effects on already high global food inflation the latin american country is the largest producer of coffee soybeans and sugar and the most dependent of the world s agricultural superpowers on imported fertilizer brazil imports some 85 of its fertilizers and about a fifth of those imports come from russia the russian trade ministry has called for a broad suspension of fertilizer exports state news agency tass reported friday brazil depends on fertilizers it s a sacred question for us president jair bolsonaro told reporters earlier this week defending his decision to maintain cordial relations with moscow as russia attacks ukraine mr bolsanaro was one of the last world leaders to visit russian president vladimir putin before the invasion of ukraine began on feb 24 meeting with him at the kremlin on feb 16 if brazil s farmers have to pay significantly more for fertilizer or are unable to produce as many crops the cost of its agricultural products is likely to climb driving up world food prices brazil is also an important supplier of corn and beef higher grain prices increase animal feed costs which are passed on to consumers who have to pay more for meat and other animal products ukraine war doj launches task force to target russian oligarchs seize assets before the ukraine conflict farmers across the world were struggling to buy enough fertilizers some of which more than doubled in price last year higher natural gas prices hampered production of the ammonia needed for nitrogen fertilizers while power outages at chinese fertilizer plants and hurricane ida in the u s curtailed global production war in ukraine and sanctions on russia have made the situation worse industry analysts said raising the prospect of a prolonged global supply crunch that would further stoke inflation and hunger among the world s poor russia which accounts for about two thirds of the world s ammonium nitrate production according to commodity analysts at s p global has halted exports until april to guarantee supplies for farmers at home higher natural gas prices as a result of the conflict have also pushed up prices for the product which is used to increase the yields of crops such as corn and wheat no one knows what s going to happen said ricardo arioli a soybean farmer from brazil s center west state of mato grosso war means a total lack of certainty the cost of production becomes a big unknown he said brazilian agriculture minister tereza cristina dias said she was planning to travel to canada this month to secure more supplies canada is the world s largest producer of potash fertilizers followed by russia and belarus ms dias said brazil has enough stocks to last farmers until october not everyone agrees the brazilian national fertilizer association which represents fertilizer companies in this country has warned that local fertilizer stocks will only last for another three months sanctions and travel restrictions have hampered shipments to brazil the group said we are now experiencing firsthand what it means to depend on imported fertilizer said jeferson souza a fertilizer analyst at agrinvest commodities a brokerage in brazil sluggish productivity has kept brazil from developing a bigger domestic fertilizer industry he said brazil s government said it would launch a national fertilizer plan to stimulate investment in potash and phosphorus mines it would take years for farmers to reap any benefits analysts said as russia sanctions intensify several oligarchs speak out against ukraine war global food prices were already at around a 10 year high before the russian invasion of ukraine as the coronavirus pandemic hampered shipments and heavy rains in some growing regions curtailed production that is translating to higher rates of hunger among the world s poorest

university park pa with the goal of creating an international framework to make buildings more sustainable more efficient and healthier penn state and the united nations economic commission for europe unece renewed the global building network gbn coordinated through the college of engineering for another three years the strategic initiative renewal announcement comes on the heels of the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc latest report underlining the urgency for action with a focus on equity and justice to bolster climate resilient development in the face of already challenging warming aligning the performance of our building stock with the u n sustainable development goals targets and the paris agreement objectives such as reducing greenhouse emissions and improving the air quality of the indoor environment requires a transdisciplinary approach connecting knowledge from the built environment domain with insights from all the other disciplines said esther obonyo gbn director and associate professor of engineering design and architectural engineering at penn state a multidisciplinary approach is required to address the economic social and environmental dimensions of sustainability in a more comprehensive and holistic manner that is what the gbn aims to accomplish created by the university and the unece in february 2018 gbn fosters an internationally connected community of built environment researchers and educators and facilitates training of the next generation of built environment professionals to not only independently innovate but also collaborate to scale and translate local solutions globally the gbn serves as one of the pillars in the unece s high performance buildings initiative the other pillars include international centers of excellence a high level strategy group and an industry leadership group supporting case studies that demonstrate unece s framework guidelines for energy efficiency standards in buildings the high performance buildings initiative aims to transform the built environment in terms of how buildings are conceived built operated maintained and eventually dismantled and how the built environment delivers quality of life said scott foster director of the sustainable energy division for the unece the division is responsible for developing and deploying the framework guidelines for energy efficiency standards in buildings to meet the goals of the paris climate agreement and the 2030 agenda for sustainable development the quality of life and energy performance of buildings as well as their embodied energy and carbon must be addressed urgently our partners at penn state are strongly committed to such issues and prioritize diverse collaboration to address global issues that require local solutions under obonyo s leadership since 2019 gbn has established partnerships with eight industry and nonprofit organizations and 30 higher education institutions in north america europe africa and australia to collaboratively advance research and education methods since the 1970s a lot of effort has been invested in making buildings more environmentally friendly and energy efficient while also reducing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the built environment obonyo said this notwithstanding we are still not on track to achieve the carbon emission reduction targets associated with the building sector through the more inclusive and innovative approaches the gbn enables we are making greater strides to achieve sustainable development over the next three years gbn will continue seeding and catalyzing research projects focused on climate health and the built environment in collaboration with the penn state college of medicine and the penn state institutes of energy and the environment obonyo explained that additional research concepts that connect the built environment with human values are being explored through a new partnership with the penn state rock ethics institute we are dedicating people time and facilities to advance the deeply important work of creating a sustainable world as we connect globally to implement locally said justin schwartz harold and inge marcus dean in the college of engineering in collaboration with unece we are creating adaptable educational opportunities to prepare our workforce for the shifting realities of built environments shaped by climate change to equitably improve the ecosystems of our interconnected and often interdependent communities our projects vary as greatly as our partners do because no single solution for all exists we are depending on the varied experiences and skills of our faculty and students across penn state and partners beyond the university to develop the best answers to benefit the most people according to schwartz and obonyo gbn draws from building and energy expertise and research from units across the university including but not limited to the department of architectural engineering the department of architecture the institutes of energy and the environment the sustainability institute and the materials research institute gbn also works closely with the penn state global the university office that oversees study abroad experiences and more to establish international relationships and highlight the importance of collaborative work

the russia ukraine war poses additional challenges for european economies which are now facing higher inflation risks and more growth headwinds russia ukraine war consequences russia continued its military offensive in ukraine despite chatter about another round of talks between the two sides the russian currency and depositary receipts are doing poorly this morning ukraine s sovereign debt was also under pressure the fact that ukraine made a scheduled payment on its 2022 sovereign bond yesterday was noted but made no market impact due to fat negative tail risks concerns about the global fallout are multiplying however the u s federal reserve chair jerome powell said in his yesterday s testimony to the house that the march rate hike is still on the table as of this morning the fed funds futures price in 26 27bps in march and a total of 5 rate hikes in 2022 europe growth inflation risks as regards other major central banks higher inflation pressures via food and commodity prices and more growth headwinds pose additional policy challenges especially in europe central europe sell side economists have already started to cut their 2022 growth forecasts for the region right now the revisions are modest about 1 or so but if military operations last longer and affect more territory we should expect sharper growth downgrades a prospect of wider budget deficits and worsening debt metrics against the backdrop of large scale refugee inflows further complicates the picture the chart below shows that central european currencies underperformed emerging markets em peers by a wide margin so far this year as did local currency debt persisting currency weakness can increase pressure on regional central banks to hike more this scenario is now reflected in the market rate expectations for 6 months an alternative is to step up interventions on the fx market this option was used today by poland s central bank low income countries debt relief the final point we would like

by lance roberts market review stocks struggle as russia advances friday morning stocks sank back to previous support on news russia had taken ukraine s nuclear power facility it is not surprising with the ongoing russia conflict no one wants to hold equities over the weekend if something happens while the market continues to grind out a downtrend so far it remains a very steady decline without much sign of visible panic such was a point made by sentiment trader this past week the problem with a declining market with no real fear is that signals become less reliable trading signals work best when they trade at extremes but give false signals when in the middle does that mean we should abandon our analysis and go with our gut of course not however it does mean we should be more cautious in making portfolio changes give postions a little more wiggle room maintain stops at critical support levels reduce position sizes temporarily until certainty returns add hedges to reduce risk with those guidelines we can review the current market setup as discussed last week the market has given us a decent roadmap to follow near term with a short term buy signal still intact and not overbought yet there are three rally targets and a critical support level for the market currently rally targets are the 200 dma red line the current downtrend line and the 50 dma black line critical support level january and october lows unfortunately most of the fuel for a stronger rally got squandered therefore we will re hedge risk on any rally next week particularly as the markets struggle with geopolitical risk the surge in commodities is a more concerning bearish indicator a history of commodity cycles since 1980 the start of my data feed for the crb index there have been 4 distinct cycles in commodities commodity prices fell from 1980 to 2000 as the economy shifted from manufacturing to financialization beginning in 2001 as the dot com era ended investment flows shifted to commodities and emerging markets in anticipation of a global resurgence housing demand boomed as mortgage rates fell and energy demand rose on fears of peak oil production however as quickly as it came the demand for commodities faded as the financial crisis crippled the entire global economy that deflationary trend continued until march 2020 the current commodity spike is a natural byproduct of too much money chasing too few goods as the covid pandemic shut down production governments injected billions of dollars to stimulate demand that imbalance of demand versus supply created the current inflation surge however since the demand side of the equation was a function of artificial liquidity the question is the sustainability of higher prices we must understand that commodities and hard assets generally do not live in a vacuum to answer that question instead they are subject to the supply demand equation ultimately setting their price therefore and not surprisingly economic growth interest rates the dollar and the money supply weigh heavily on that equation a hard landing several indicators point to the ongoing demand for those assets if commodities and hard assets are driven by demand particularly in manufacturing as discussed previously the current spread between the producer price index ppi and the consumer price index cpi suggests that companies cannot pass along the entirety of higher input costs as such there is a high correlation to earnings growth eventually companies will react to protect profits through layoffs automation and cost reductions such actions typically precede the onset of a recession interest rates are equally crucial as rates reflect the strength of economic growth inflation wages and overall demand there is a decent correlation between the annual change in interest rates reflecting economic strength or weakness and commodity prices the recent surge in commodity prices from the 2020 lows corresponds with the jump in rates such fits with the flood of fiscal policy allowing demand to outpace the economic production capacity however with the liquidity now reversed rates will reverse to levels consistent with weaker economic growth rates a consequence of that reversal in liquidity as measured through m2 is the reversal of inflation over the next 9 months again since commodities are highly correlated to inflation it suggests the peak in the hard asset trade as the economy normalizes not surprisingly commodities track nominal gdp growth the surge in economic growth following the pandemic driven shutdown was as stated an artificial sugar rush of liquidity flooding the system such caused a massive rise in money supply leading to inflation given the lack of productive capacity however as is already the case economic activity is reverting to more normal levels commodity surge markets with that background it is not surprising that peaks in commodity prices tend to align with peaks in the financial markets such is because earnings ultimately get derived from economic activity if economic activity slows due to high commodity prices the market will reprice valuations accordingly we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us following the financial crisis the markets became more insulated from commodity declines due to the massive monetary support from the federal reserve nonetheless declines in commodity prices which as noted above are tied to the economic cycle resulted in market corrections the current commodity surge will once again trigger an economic slowdown commodity surges are equivalent to monetary tightening by reducing the consumptive power of americans however when that commodity surge coincides with the fed s more aggressive monetary policy the results will likely be disappointing in other words as the fed hikes rates a hard landing is almost assured the main point of this week s discussion is that many retail traders are now chasing the commodity bull market under the assumption that we are returning to the inflation of the 1970s there is a considerable difference between the two periods the 1970s inflation surge was a function of a strongly growing economy rising wages and high savings rates versus today s artificial demand surge from a massive liquidity program however as is always the case surges in commodities particularly oil prices have an almost immediate negative impact on economic growth as high prices quell demand supply builds driving down prices from that view our expectation is the fed will likely hike rates more quickly than needed in an already slowing economy leading to a deflationary drag such keeps our portfolios aligned to a defensive posture currently however we did reduce our hedges early this week due to the short term oversold condition of the market we are looking for a bounce to current resistance levels as discussed above to rebuild those hedges and reduce risk further while we are not currently expecting a substantial bear market the risk of a more profound decline is undoubtedly present that risk becomes more elevated as the federal reserve begins its rate hiking campaign as shown below the markets tend to weather rate hikes until the fed eventually breaks something we suspect this time will be no different and we are hedging our risks accordingly market sector analysis s p 500 tear

it smells like cake says the arnold arboretum s keeper of the living collections michael dosmann standing beneath a nearly 150 year old japanese katsura tree its dark curvy limbs are surrounded by a halo of delicate red leaves worthy of a pointillist painting on one side of the tree are a marsh and a busy parkway and on the other the arnold arboretum 281 acres of curated forest and fields home to about 16 000 woody plant specimens in its permanent collections dosmann sporting a blue blazer button down and converse sneakers exudes the kind of bouncing on his heels energy that only a person who loves his job could no really it does he says patting a branch the katsura s leaves smell like cake or like a burnt brown sugar cotton candy kind of smell the seeds that gave rise to this delightfully scented katsura cercidiphyllum japonicum arrived at the newly established arnold arboretum in 1878 in an envelope postmarked from japan peat brown no bigger than a nickel and shaped like edamame the pods had been plucked from trees in sapporo by scientist william s clark and delivered to his friend the arboretum s founding director charles sprague sargent the seeds were placed under the care of the arboretum s only full time employee plant propagator jackson thornton dawson a plantsman s plantsman who resembled santa claus with a handlebar mustache he brought one fledgling katsura to life and planted it on the arboretum s grounds this year as the arnold arboretum celebrates its 150th anniversary and its status as the oldest public arboretum in the united states that all grown up katsura stands as a piece of living history the arnold arboretum was established at a moment when americans were hungry for nature as the nation industrialized and urbanized people looked for ways to escape the shadows of buildings and the smoke of factories cities like new york and boston built public parks in response and citizens brought the outdoors in too they rooted around in tidepools for fish to add to their new at home aquariums and kept cabinets of unusual natural relics in their homes there were even entire social groups dedicated to building cabinets one boston organization boasted one containing among other oddities 33 bird skins and a handful of fish scales from calcutta photographs courtesy of the arnold arboretum archives president and fellows of harvard college despite growing public interest horticulture and botany were a rich man s hobby in the later nineteenth century the world s first arboretum established in derby england was intended to change that it was open to people of all classes and designed to be more than just pleasant public green space instead the arboretum was a living museum curating a collection of woody plants intended for both academic study and public enjoyment housing trees from around the world in one place made it possible for botanists horticulturalists and members of the public to see and research plants they would never encounter otherwise an arboretum was the point of intersection between science and beauty the concept crossed the atlantic in 1872 when harvard used a 100 000 bequest from whaling merchant james arnold to establish the arnold arboretum on land from the jamaica plain estate of benjamin bussey a wheeler and dealer who d made a fortune in everything from silversmithing to importing merino sheep the university appointed sargent a scion of old boston brahmin stock who d found his life s work in botany after serving as a major in the union army as director although he was reserved to the point of coldness sargent college class of 1862 was a passionate conservationist who worked closely with john muir to further the american national parks movement coupling sargent s energy and connections with design expertise harvard appointed frederick law olmsted a m 1864 ll d 93 the landscape architect for central park to design the arboretum the university saw the arboretum as an ideal research ground one where scientists could study trees and introduce hybridized varieties into wider cultivation but olmsted knew it was also a necessity for the urban public he wrote in one letter we want a ground to which people may easily go after their day s work is done and where they may stroll for an hour seeing hearing and feeling nothing of the bustle and jar of the streets where they shall in effect find the city put far away from them photograph courtesy of the arnold arboretum archives president and fellows of harvard college even though the trees and shrubs were arranged taxonomically to facilitate scientific study olmsted created the illusion of wilderness an arboretum is in a sense a piece of artwork and a museum says current director william ned friedman arnold professor of organismic and evolutionary biology you can t just put the trees in rows like a christmas tree farm instead you plant in such a way that the landscape and the trees create and actually shape your experience olmsted s naturalistic design concept caught on other arboreta slowly cropped up around the united states throughout the twentieth century all modeled after the arnold its staff even consulted on several including the morton arboretum in chicago named after the morton salt magnates it took a team of irish german and italian immigrants to build the arnold all of the work was done by hand says lisa pearson the arboretum s head of library and archives there were horses and carts but for the most part it was men with pickaxes the horses and carts belonged to a man known in sargent s record books only as mr daley who brought his rigs to move dirt and trees around the arboretum as needed pearson says today you could just rent a front end loader photograph courtesy of the arnold arboretum archives president and fellows of harvard college all this construction required funds and sargent and olmsted realized they d need more of them they approached the city of boston in 1882 with a proposal the land of the harvard owned arboretum would become part of the boston city parks system the arboretum would keep the grounds free and open to the public from dawn to dusk 365 days per year if in exchange the city maintained the roads and gates and provided surveillance as director friedman put it it s boston s dirt but it s harvard s trees and we manage the property when boston signed the agreement in the late 1800s it wasn t just for that century the lease states that harvard and boston will operate the arboretum for 1 000 years renewable once for a total of two millennia if boston is still a city and harvard is still a university in 3882 there will still be an arnold arboretum thanks to the support of this public private partnership the arnold is also boston s only free major cultural institution public access pearson says has been part of our dna from the beginning for an organization to last through centuries as the arboretum is intended to maybe it needs something like institutional dna some tangible threads running through every aspect of its operations and guiding its evolution photographs courtesy of the arnold arboretum archives president and fellows of harvard college one of those threads is finding and preserving previously unknown species ever since the arboretum opened its gates to boston it s also kept an eye toward the rest of the world beginning in the early twentieth century the arboretum sent plant explorers to east asia a region celebrated for its biodiversity to collect woody plant species unknown to western science as those new species found a home at the arboretum bostonians who perhaps had never seen anything besides red maples and elms learned about japanese lilacs katsuras and the paperbark maple acer griseum whose bark peels off like pencil shavings and thanks to the arboretum they could even grow them at home too in keeping with its horticultural mission the arnold gave cuttings and seeds of successful new species to nurseries increasing north america s biodiversity and beautifying its suburbs gardens the relationship between the arboretum and asia even brought a living fossil to boston in 1948 after the tree was discovered in central china virtually unchanged from its fossil record headlines about the dawn redwood tree metasequoia glyptostroboides were peppered and salted all over the newspapers says dosmann he adds it d be like if somebody discovered a woolly mammoth alive right now unlike the woolly mammoth though the dawn redwood is now grown all over the united states due in large part to the arboretum geopolitics sometimes put a damper on the arnold s ability to collaborate with other countries those world wars did cut into things a bit says pearson but almost always botanical exchange prevailed in 1980 for instance the arboretum took part in the sino american plant expedition the first time that western botanists had been invited into china since the chinese communist revolution in 1949 photographs courtesy of the arnold arboretum archives president and fellows of harvard college now in an era of accelerating habitat loss and climate change arboretum directed plant exploration aims less at discovering new species and more toward conservation there are things we re collecting now and they re secure in nature dosmann says in 25 or 50 years even 10 years they might not be the arboretum is already home to a species extinct in the wild the franklin tree franklinia alatamaha named after benjamin franklin and once native to the american south senior research scientist emeritus peter del tredici says if it weren t for gardens they wouldn t exist other species in the arboretum s collection are endangered in the wild like the cedar of lebanon cedrus libani a whimsical tree that resembles a giant green umbrella now its native lebanon is getting too hot for it says dosmann i mean think about that the cedar of lebanon it s on their national flag and that species is threatened with extinction some specimens in the arboretum are even more threatened with only a handful of plants still growing in the wild in a nod to both its history of plant collection and the reality of endangered species the arboretum has launched a campaign to acquire roughly 400 different types of plants many endangered from around the world during the next 10 years see the plant prospectors july august 2016 page 37 and botanizing in the mother of gardens january february 2018 page 32 if we bring seed back and grow it safely at the arboretum called ex situ conservation we can keep the genetics alive says friedman we can make sure that people who want to study these plants can study them and they can share those seeds with other arboreta so other parts of the world can enjoy them too with other museums there s only one mona lisa but for us as a living museum we can propagate it we can cut it says curator dosmann perhaps unlike an art museum the arboretum has a vested interest in sharing its material if you don t give it away to somebody if you were hoarding that mona lisa and something happened to it you d never get it back and something can and does happen to these trees unlike boston s museum of fine arts the arboretum can t adjust its temperature or humidity controls to preserve the artwork events like the 1938 hurricane can swoop in overnight and take out 1 500 trees or the 1997 april fool s day storm can obliterate spring blossoms with snow as heavy as concrete photograph courtesy of the arnold arboretum archives president and fellows of harvard college weather patterns are even more unpredictable now friedman says one study at the arboretum found that its trees are flowering about eight days earlier than they were a century ago a sign of warming temperatures our climate controls are the planet and they re broken right he says so we ve got to figure out how to grow our plants for the next century for your descendants in an ever more challenging set of climate extremes preserving this living museum for the next generation is perhaps the most important part of its mission friedman believes that by walking among the arboretum s trees many of which were planted before their great grandparents were alive visitors can cultivate respect for something other than themselves stewarding the arboretum is an act of selflessness he says unlike a botanical garden where lots of stuff grows fast in an arboretum you re always paying it forward because some trees can take 50 or 75 years to reach maturity friedman dosmann and the rest of the current arnold staff will never see the full result of their work with about 1 850 years left on the arboretum s lease the 150 year old collection is only in its infancy when friedman envisions the next 150 years at the arnold and the millennia beyond he thinks of the arboretum staff planting that katsura tree in 1878 olmsted designed everything but he never saw it he saw young trees but he never saw what we re seeing he designed what you re seeing now for you in the 1880s he says time moves slowly in the arboretum but it s closely connected one hundred years from now one of your grandchildren will be standing under a magnolia tree we collected as seed in 2019 friedman says or it could be a red maple a japanese lilac or a cedar of lebanon or maybe it will be a katsura tree and the grandchild will say it smells like cake

via birch gold group this week your news to know rounds up the latest top stories involving gold and the overall economy stories include how gold blooms in rate hike cycles gold s unusual behavior and the short term gold price outlook more evidence that gold can outperform if a hiking cycle happens why does gold face a supposed headwind when interest rate hiking cycles happen is it fundamentals reason as adam hamilton notes it is little more than panic by over leveraged investors one good thing that can be said about this is that rate hikes get priced in far ahead and in succession as far as the markets are concerned three rate hikes have already happened but that s where speculators stop doing gold any favors hamilton asserts that traders of gold contracts should not be allowed to engage in the kind of market manipulation they do on a regular basis the stock market s maximum leverage has been 2x since 1974 for gold it s 31 3x a contract with a 6 000 backing can and does control 100 ounces of gold that s 187 500 in gold with today s average price of 1 875 it s this oversight that causes speculators to exert an absurd amount of influence on the gold market and it s that much worse considering their forecasts and panic are unfounded analyzing the 12 rate hiking cycles since 1971 hamilton points out that gold only experienced mild losses during four of those the remaining eight saw gold post massive gains throughout the cycle the last time gold didn t post major gains during a rate hiking cycle was 1989 showing just how disconnected from reality market participants are the latest hiking cycle the one between 2015 2018 kickstarted today s gold bull market gold started at 1 051 and was up by 17 within three years time perhaps of far more interest is the rate hiking cycle that ended in 1979 because economic conditions then were similar to today rampant inflation and massive money printing during this hiking cycle gold gained a stupendous 178 3 that s because for all the speculation traders still know enough to flock into gold when inflation and currency debasement are peaking let s also take into account that stock market valuations are more than double their fair value a correction will mean anything between a recession and a depression hike away says the gold pinning down gold s correlations a washington post article wonders why the inverse correlation between treasury yields and gold seem to have dissipated just last month the yield on the 10 year treasury hit a 2 year high yet on friday gold hit 1 900 during the trading session climbing ever so slowly to the 2011 high thought unreclaimable by many not too long ago maybe the gold price is benefiting from asian jewelry demand in china retail sales last year grew at their fastest pace since 2013 showing a recovery towards levels seen in 2019 and earlier in india jewelry sales have been even more rampant we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us we know that india more than doubled its gold imports last year as paused weddings and celebrations would wait no longer and jewelers rushed to meet demand the physical gold market in india used to follow a sort of tradition where a decline in demand would come about whenever 10 grams of gold exceeded 30 000 rupees or 400 so indians would buy up gold at what they viewed as a bargain price under 1 200 but pulled back whenever the metal climbed past that figure it s nearly double that now yet last year s gold demand in india was at its highest since 2017 there are many easy explanations for this with one being that india is seeing the same gross currency devaluation like any other country in the world and the explanation for why gold is posting highs alongside treasury bonds is perhaps just as easy and straightforward on paper treasuries are doing well but in essence they represent u s debt and require faith in the dollar it s well known that the global bond market has all but collapsed with the treasury the last sovereign bond offering any above zero yield it s equally known that the u s has printed trillions of dollars over the past two years is it that big of a stretch to say that investors simply trust gold over treasury bonds as a safe haven investment a look into gold s short term price drivers recently kitco spoke to a few analysts about how the markets are feeling and why gold has been soaring the prevalent theme is uncertainty with as much economic weakness on all sides gold hardly needed massive geopolitical tensions to flourish but they have been added to the mix and the metal responded oanda s senior market analyst edward moya believes these will go on for some time providing a considerable boost for gold and then we get to the real drivers that have been slowly pushing the metal towards a new all time high right now we re hearing the infamously optimistic wall street use the word recession investors are worried about where the economy will be in the next 12 24 months and with good reason before the stimulus global economic growth was either stagnating or plummeting depending on the country then came the stimulus which might have convinced some that the economy is doing well but many weren t and now that central banks are looking to tighten very few will as both money printing and balance sheet purchases ease we re likely to see just how strong the economy s foundations are and it s a sight many might want to look away from then there is of course inflation kevin grady president of phoenix futures and options llc said that inflation is making gold very appealing to those looking to shed risk from stocks and crypto in reality however it s making gold look appealing to everyone grady specified a lot of the gold s price moves are coming from the inflation story we see inflation hitting 7 5 which is a 40 year high but if we use the same metric to measure the consumer price index cpi as in 1980 our inflation would be closer to 15 people are realizing this which is why gold is finally rallying the fed has no handle on inflation and the energy market is facing a lot of pressures from high demand everyone is waiting for this federal reserve meeting in march to see how the central bank will approach inflation and as the first story reminded us the last rate hike cycle pushed gold up by 17 in three years we wouldn t be surprised to see the same thing happen again
from birch gold group remember a few weeks ago when canada invoked the emergencies act to freeze the bank accounts of annoying political protestors what if that happened to an entire country it would look like this swift provides secure financial messaging services for various transactions in the international community in fact it s a critical piece of financial infrastructure swift s messaging services are trusted and used by more than 11 000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries and territories around the world providing reliable secure and efficient messaging services to our community of users swift is the backbone of global financial communication this messaging system basically sets legal terms for both sides of a financial transaction independent of whether or not that transaction can be completed according to jim rickards it s also important to note swift is not a financial institution and it s not a payment channel as rickards mentioned recently in the daily reckoning but without swift financial transactions aren t trusted through mainstream channels which brings us to the economic showdown surrounding the military conflict between russia and ukraine this is what economic warfare looks like in a coordinated move the u s and the eu froze russia s access to both their own central bank reserves and the russian sovereign wealth fund that was a step further than expected this swift news release details how biden and other world leaders crossed a financial rubicon stifling russia s ability to process international financial transactions diplomatic decisions taken by the european union in consultation with the united kingdom canada and the united states bring swift into efforts to end this crisis by requiring us to disconnect select russian banks from our financial messaging services in compliance with the legal instruction in eu council regulation eu 2022 345 of 1 march 2022 we will disconnect seven designated russian entities and their designated russia based subsidiaries from the swift network in short the west have not only banned most russian financial transactions they ve also prevented russia from accessing its own money wherever possible shades of ottawa rickards summarized the initial consequences for russia should this financial cancellation continue for any length of time here s what biden s team of amateurs don t understand every payment every trade has two sides when you blow up one side russia you also blow up the other side world banking system linkages are dense and immensely scaled put simply not only could russia be financially strangled but every institution on the other side of each russian transaction has to deal with the fallout in fact rickards continued by providing an example of how this move could affect europe for example french finance minister bruno le maire warns that the ban would hinder europeans ability to recover payments on nearly 30 billion in debt owed them by various russian entities this will spill over into a global liquidity crisis within days count on it it could be the worst liquidity crisis ever the bottom line removing a single link in the financial world can have catastrophic consequences and we don t mean catastrophic consequences for the russian economy and the average russian citizen though that s certainly true the ruble is now worth less than a single penny cheaper than robux the in game currency for kid gaming site roblox recent reports predict a 12 gdp contraction in the months ahead that will absolutely feel like a catastrophe to the majority of the russian people rickards is a lot more concerned about the global consequences of this action without getting bogged down in every possible outcome and their second order consequences here are the two biggest warning signs to look out for cascading currency confusion defaults and bank failures cutting russia off from swift will have a disastrous impact on russia s banking without a doubt that s more or less the point the problem is that some of those banks are connected in the eu and are already failing due to liquidity issues like rickards pointed out above for example the european central bank ecb has assessed that sberbank europe ag and its two subsidiaries in the banking union sberbank d d in croatia and sberbank banka d d in slovenia are failing or likely to fail owing to a deterioration of their liquidity situation note sberbank europe is majority owned by the russian federation it s easy to understand who s on the other side of some of the bank s liabilities their depositors what other complex business dealings were these banks involved in we won t know until the dominoes start to fall here s another example of the collateral damage from the financial sanctions the biden administration and the eu may have shot some bond holders in the foot reuters tells us to expect an imminent default on russia s hard currency bonds ofzs with much of moscow s 640 billion reserves under lock and key in the west and sanctions crippling cross border capital flows foreign investors are effectively stuck with their russia issued bond holdings the central bank of russia temporarily halted coupon payments and the financial settlement system stopped accepting russian assets here s what s really surprising about this situation moscow reneged on ofzs during its 1998 financial crisis but even then it kept up dollar bond payments before the latest devastating western sanctions which froze central bank assets such a russian default was on no one s radar you might call this an involuntary default no matter what you call it though it represents a significant escalation in the economic war the west is waging we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us let s be clear though none of the consequences we ve discussed so far approach the truly catastrophic at this time there are no non russian banks in serious trouble that we know of so far the world s tightly integrated financial system has more or less shrugged and moved on the world s central banks though they re busy dusting off their plan b documents here s why shocked world banks rethinking their reserves the wall street journal is less concerned about russian bank failures than a permanent shift in global finance reporter jon sindreu says these economic sanctions have the world s central bankers once again asking what is money why well if russian currency reserves can be frozen at the flick of a switch by politicians couldn t any other nation s yes it would seem sanctions have shown that currency reserves accumulated by central banks can be taken away with china taking note this may reshape geopolitics economic management and even the international role of the u s dollar a reuters column put a spotlight on how the geo economic ripple effects could be even worse starting with the potential for reserve managers asking where to put their currency reserves in the first place including u s dollars while a huge blow for russia s economy the move quickly prompted questions about whether targeting reserve holdings as an act of economic warfare may prompt a rethink by reserve managers across the globe not least in countries that may be at loggerheads or face a potential conflict with u s or eu governments over where to bank their national stash it s a potentially huge issue for world markets given that central bank foreign currency reserves totaled a record 12 83 trillion late last year a rise of 11 trillion over the past 20 years this money is held mostly in u s and european government bills and bonds with the u s dollar still accounting for almost 60 of that and the euro about 20 it seems like the world s central banks are having their own lightbulb moment for citizens it goes like this if my government can freeze my bank account for any reason is it really my money if it s not really my money what should i do to regain my financial independence and freedom for central banks the discussion goes something like this if governments can freeze our currency assets for any reason why do we have them sell currencies buy alternative stores of value in other words central banks are suddenly looking at their paper assets as liabilities rather than assets you probably know what a central bank s alternative store of value is central banks worldwide hold this geopolitical hedge of last resort smart central banks were swapping their paper assets for gold before the russia ukraine conflict the central bank of hungary tripled its gold reserves to more than 90 tons last spring because the metal is free from credit and counterparty risks large purchases of gold were limited in the past to the central banks of russia and some other countries trying to free themselves from reliance on the dollar because of political confrontations with the u s note hungary shares a border with ukraine and was a one party socialist state under the thumb of the ussr from 1949 1989 the nikkei article continues although the federal reserve is starting to tighten its grip on credit other central banks continue their shift to gold reflecting global concerns about the dollar based monetary regime so there are several concerns international central bankers have the value of the dollar against gold has dropped sharply over the last decade extreme u s inflation rates thanks to the fed s astonishingly incompetent monetary management which no one can pretend are transitory anymore s bonds don t pay very much interest these days annoy the wrong person and you could get frozen out of your own bank account perhaps it s no surprise that world central bank gold holdings are currently at a 31 year high adam glapinski president of the national bank of poland explained gold is not directly linked to any nation s economy and can withstand global unrest in financial markets fortunately central bankers have much larger worries than everyday folks like us they have to look out for an entire nation s economy we only have to look out for ourselves and our families even so it seems like a good time to consider whether to follow their lead take a look at your retirement savings and ask whether you re comfortable with your risk profile if you aren t swapping some paper assets for physical gold and silver might be the right move for you worried about inflation we ve done an extensive survey of inflation resistant investments that can help shelter your savings when all is said and done central banks mostly choose physical gold as their alternate store of value as ray dalio said gold is the only financial asset that isn t someone else s liability that s probably why central banks trust gold after all someone else can always choose or be forced to default on that liability that s one thing gold can t do

leonid slutsky as saying the third round really could take place in the coming days it s possible it will be on monday russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on saturday that ukraine president volodymyr zelenskiy s attempt to secure direct nato help in the conflict between their countries was not helping talks between the two sides but that moscow was ready for a third round last thursday russian president vladimir putin announced a special military operation aimed at demilitarization of the donetsk and lugansk regions in eastern ukraine in 2014 the two regions declared themselves new republics refusing to recognize ukraine s western backed government announcing the operation putin said the mission was aimed at defending people who for eight years are suffering persecution and genocide by the kiev regime on thursday the two sides agreed to open humanitarian corridors to allow civilians out of some combat zones ukraine s president zelensky has been trying to secure help from the western military alliance of nato earlier he called on nato to set up a no fly zone over ukraine the alliance declined the request for apparent fears of being dragged into war with russia conflict escalation would cause devastating economic damage imf meanwhile the international monetary fund warned separately that the already serious global economic impacts of the conflict would be all the more devastating should it escalate the economic consequences of the conflict are already very serious the imf said in a statement the situation in ukraine has been ensued by a surge in energy and commodity prices with a barrel of oil now close to 120 price shocks will have an impact worldwide especially on poor households for whom food and fuel are a higher proportion of expenses the international body said adding should the conflict escalate the economic damage would be all the more devastating the imf also reflected on the sanctions that the west has been piling on russia the sanctions on russia will also have a substantial impact on the global economy and financial markets with significant spillovers to other countries the imf said russia demands that baltic countries

as they say there is a time and a place for everything to everything turn turn turn there is a season turn turn turn and a time to every purpose under heaven the byrds turn turn turn via songfacts well maybe not everything but for most things fish included the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries has issued a notice of intent announcing its intention to further regulate the taking of southern flounder from louisiana waters now while that statement sounds negative at the surface level for those who oppose more government regulation i would assume it makes lots of sense if you think about it this closed season is necessary to attempt to recover the stock of southern flounder which is overfished based on results from the most recent flounder stock assessment louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries as it stands recreational fisherpeople are allowed to take 10 southern flounder from louisiana waters per day townsquare media photo by john falcon townsquare media photo by john falcon loading commercial fisherpeople are allowed the same daily limit 10 the newly proposed change to the regulations on harvesting southern flounder would prohibit any harvesting of the species in louisiana waters between the dates of october 15 and november 30 of each year it s during this time that southern flounder move out of inland waters toward deeper water lower the shades throw on some barry white and shall we say find a suitor the lwfc chose to move forward with an annual closed season in the fall to allow mature female flounder to escape inshore waters and move offshore to spawn the closed season is projected to help the stock recover to a healthy biomass target by 2028 louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries a few months ago i had a conversation with an agent from the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries while i was fishing at rockefeller wildlife refuge during that conversation the topic of the southern flounder came up townsquare media photo by john falcon townsquare media photo loading of course neither of us used the official name of the fish we both as most people do called them simply flounder he told me that there was a biologist who had been working in the area to specifically study the flounder she would fish in different areas of the refuge to try to catch flounders if she caught any she would take note of the specifics of each fish caught and then she would carefully release the fish back into the water the louisiana wildlife and fisheries commission lwfc adopted a notice of intent noi to set an annual closed season for the recreational and commercial harvest of southern flounder from october 15 through november 30 of each year modifications in this rule create one statewide closed season for southern flounder for both the recreational and commercial sectors louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries what was noticed about her studies is that she didn t catch many flounders like not many at all i don t recall the exact numbers but it was way lower than the studies from years past fishing in a lake mikael damkier loading and i understand that studies like hers were taking place in different places across the coastal area of louisiana and obviously the numbers were low enough to prompt the louisiana department of wildlife and fisheries to implement a season for the southern flounder what does all of this mean for the average fisherperson it means that if you catch a flounder in louisiana waters during the proposed time period in which the harvesting of the fish is prohibited you must release that fish back into the water from where it was caught do you have an opinion about the proposed flounder season if you d like to express that opinion the ldwf has set up an avenue for you to submit your comments interested persons may submit comments relative to the proposed rule to jason adriance department of wildlife and fisheries box 98000 baton rouge la 70898

the unity of the free world in standing up to the vladimir putin regime s invasion of ukraine and the overwhelming solidarity of malta with the ukrainian people is inspirational as we have for over 200 years once again the united states and malta stand resolutely united as partners in confronting this global challenge and leading humanitarian efforts to help the ukrainian people this is a dangerous moment for europe and for freedom loving people around the world by launching his brutal assault on the people of ukraine putin has also committed an assault on the principles that uphold global peace and democracy when the history of this era is written it will show that putin s choice to launch an unprovoked unjust and premeditated attack unified democracies around the world in support of peace and security and left russia isolated and weaker this will not end well for putin together the united states and our allies and partners are taking action to hold the kremlin accountable after putin began his invasion the ruble hit its weakest point in history and the russian stock market plunged as a result of unprecedented global coordination the united states the united kingdom the european union japan australia and canada have announced sweeping financial sanctions and stringent export controls that will restrict putin s regime from accessing critical foreign markets key financial systems and cutting edge technology malta is playing a critical role in this global effort through its leadership and advocacy in the european union and through its unequivocal condemnation of the russian invasion in addition to economic penalties president joe biden authorised an additional 350 million of security assistance to immediately help ukraine defend itself bringing america s total security assistance to ukraine over the past year to more than 1 billion the united states has coordinated with allied governments to position thousands of additional forces in eastern europe we are working with energy companies to surge their capacity to supply energy to the market particularly as prices increase we join our partners in malta and beyond in generating and supplying humanitarian assistance to the ukrainian people vladimir putin will fail to erase the proud nation of ukraine this was an attack that putin has planned for a long time he methodically moved more than 150 000 troops and military equipment to ukraine s border he moved blood supplies into position and built field hospitals demonstrating his intentions all along he rejected every good faith effort by the united states and our allies and partners to address his fabricated security concerns and to avoid needless conflict and human suffering by engaging in diplomacy and dialogue putin executed his playbook exactly as we had warned he would we saw russia s proxies increase their shelling in the donbas we saw the russian government launch cyber operations against ukraine we saw staged political theatre in moscow and heard outlandish and baseless claims made about ukraine in an attempt to justify russia s aggression we saw russia use these tactics before they invaded ukraine in 2014 and georgia in 2008 and then at almost the very same moment the united nations security council was meeting to stand up for ukraine s sovereignty and forestall disaster putin launched his invasion in violation of international law we have been transparent with the world we declassified our intelligence about russia s plans so there could be no confusion and no cover up putin is the aggressor putin chose this war and now his supporters will bear the consequences of his egregious decision to choose war and destruction over peace and diplomacy putin s goal of dividing the west has failed in the face of one of the most significant challenges to european security and democratic ideals since world war ii the united states and our allies and partners have joined together in solidarity we have united coordinating intensively to support ukraine s sovereignty and reaffirm our commitment to the transatlantic partnership putin has failed to divide us putin has failed to undermine our shared belief in the fundamental right of sovereign nations to choose their destiny and their allies and putin will fail to erase the proud nation of ukraine the next few days weeks and months will be incredibly difficult for the people of ukraine putin has unleashed great suffering on them but the ukrainian people have known 30 years of independence and they have repeatedly shown they will not tolerate anyone who tries to take their country backwards the world is watching this conflict closely and if russian forces commit atrocities we will explore all international mechanisms that could be used to bring those responsible whether members of the military or their civilian leadership to account liberty democracy and human dignity are forces far more powerful than fear and oppression in the contest between democracy and autocracy between sovereignty and subjugation make no mistake freedom will prevail gwendolyn green is chargé d affaires at the us embassy

energy the nigerian national petroleum company limited in a bid to safeguard the country s oil and gas assets as well as guaranteeing energy security for the country has intensified efforts at exercising its preemptive rights on some of the assets with its joint venture partners ifeanyi onuba writes by definition a preemptive right gives an existing shareholder the opportunity to buy a proportional interest of any future issuance of common stock to help maintain their initial percentage ownership position in the company it is often provided to existing shareholders of a corporation to protect them from involuntary and undesired dilution of their ownership stake it is a contractual clause that gives the right to majority owners who want to protect their stake in the company when and if additional shares are issued preemptive rights also protect a shareholder from losing voting power as more shares are issued and the company s ownership becomes diluted since the shareholder is getting an insider s price for shares in the new issue there can also be a strong profit incentive there are certain benefits that accrue as a result of the inclusion of this right the main benefit is that it allows the partners to a joint venture maintain control of the venture which is achieved by being able to control participation by new venture partners parties to a joint venture should have the ability to prevent a new comer to the venture from participating if it does not meet certain requirements factors such as the requisite financial and technical capacity and sometimes non tangible considerations like business philosophy goodwill and past relationship may amount to considerations that existing parties deem necessary in order to be effective following from the above the inclusion of a preemptive clause in oil and gas operating agreements is from the perspective of the indigenous oil companies in nigeria favourable to the extent that it retains the operations and control of oil blocks in the hands of indigenous oil companies increasing their prominence in the oil and gas sector existing licensees also have the advantage of being able to monitor wealth transfer in the venture and it prevents a split transfer of interest which may affect the voting pattern and make it more difficult to make decisions after labouring on an oil field it is believed that parties to a joint venture view this right as an opportunity to increase their stake in the joint venture and also to increase their benefit this is only fair the nigerian national petroleum company limited in a bid to safeguard the country s oil and gas assets as well as guaranteeing energy security for the country has intensified efforts at exercising its preemptive rights on some of the assets with its joint venture partners this is to ensure that the nnpc sustains a prosperous business environment for nigeria and enable the national oil company pay more attention to abandonment and relinquishment costs severance of operator staff and third party contract liabilities among others onshore decommissioning involves capping oil wells clean up and taking out all production and pipeline risers that are sustained by the platform removing the platform and getting rid of it in a junk storage area or manufacturing yard within the last decade the nigerian upstream sector had witnessed significant transactions involving the sale of interests in oil licenses some of these transactions were concluded in the time of high oil prices and in some instances involved asset transfers from international oil companies with long years of carrying on exploration and production activities in nigeria to smaller indigenous companies with limited experience in the upstream sector in august last year shell divested about 30 per cent of its stake in shell petroleum development company of nigeria limited subsidiary just few days ago seplat energy plc announced an agreement to acquire the entire share capital of mobil producing nigeria unlimited from exxon mobil corporation delaware for 1 28bn the transaction entails the acquisition of exxonmobil nigeria s entire offshore shallow water business according to the deal exxonmobil nigeria s shallow water business is an established high quality operation with a highly skilled local operating team and a track record of safe operations shell petroleum development company of nigeria and exxonmobil are presently faced with huge remediation costs over their failure to properly decommission and cap oil and gas assets across the niger delta especially the ones sold to nigerians in recent divesture programmes the situation has created severe environmental risks and pollution to host communities in the oil rich niger delta the recent case of aiteo s nembe wellhead blowout has also brought to the fore the need to enforce the relevant laws and to ensure that the multinationals that sold the assets to the nigerian companies pay remediation charges curiously many of the oil and gas assets sold to nigerians mostly by the international oil companies are rarely decommissioned or properly abandoned a development that clearly breaches existing laws regulating the industry this is a clear violation of some of the international conventions guiding decommissioning operations which include the geneva convention on the continental shelf 1958 united nations convention on law of the sea unclos 1982 and convention on the prevention of marine pollution by dumping of wastes and other matters 1972 but despite extant regulations and the provisions of the petroleum industry act pia there was rarely any adherence to full decommissioning for the infrastructure that had been sold by multinational oil companies it is also evident that there might be no such arrangements for those for which buyers were being sought according to section 232 1 of the new petroleum industry act the decommissioning and abandonment of petroleum wells installations structures utilities plants and pipelines for petroleum operations on land and offshore shall be conducted in accordance with good international petroleum industry practice in section 233 1 the new law stated each lessee and licensee shall set up maintain and manage a decommissioning fund held by a financial institution that is not an affiliate of the lessee or licensee in the form of an escrow account accessible by the commission the decommissioning and abandonment fund shall exclusively be used to pay for decommissioning and abandonment costs where a lessee or a licensee fails to comply with the decommissioning and abandonment plan the decommissioning and abandonment fund shall be accessed by the commission to pay for the performance by a third party on the wave of divestment of international oil companies from nigeria s upstream sector the group managing director of the nnpc mele kyari last monday told participants at the fifth edition of the nigerian international energy summit that while the country understands the right of companies to freely divest it is however critical to ensure that the right thing is done so as to avoid disruption he further said that issues and obligations related to abandonment and decommissioning must be fully addressed and discharged in line with global best practices regulations convention and law he said companies that are divesting they are leaving our country literarily and that s the way to put it but they are not leaving because opportunities are not here these companies are shifting their portfolios where they can add value and not just that but where they can add to the journey of net carbon zero emission we understand this very perfectly but also we cannot afford to realize that this country must benefit from the realities of today we will work with our partners we understand the necessity for their investments we do know that there are issues we understand that this must take place but also it must be done in such a way that we are able to deal with issues around abandonment and decommissioning we will also make sure that whatever arrangement that is put in place will show that we are also alive to the energy transition journey that we have embarked on currently the nnpc is adopting various strategies towards the attainment of a carbon neutral economy while ensuring that the industry remains viable and competitive to achieve this the pia remains a key enabler in the nigerian energy sector that clearly delineates various stakeholders roles to enhance value realization in the sector under the strategic agenda of the nnpc ltd three criteria will drive the reshaping of the asset portfolio of the national oil company the three criteria are high performance for the asset gas potential of such an asset and the acquisition of an asset with minimal vulnerability in the new energy transition world and post pia the nnpc needs to reshape and optimise it s portfolio to ensure it can deliver value to shareholders and stakeholders in order to reshape its portfolio the nnpc must acquire assets that have high performance low vulnerability and huge gas potential this is because high performance assets with robust reserves with potential for growth and high performance operators will be a key priority that nnpc must consider in reshaping it s portfolio gas is the new oil and it is expected to drive the strategy in reshaping and optimising the nnpc portfolio at a time when the nnpc is targeting to become the fifth largest gas producing company in the world the national oil company must prioritize acquisition of assets rich in gas especially assets ready for blowdown the nnpc is currently deepening natural gas utilisation to reduce energy poverty through the national gas expansion programme and intensifying the use of petrochemicals the national company is also making concerted efforts in the gas sector through various projects such as nlng train 7 akk ob3 elps and others it is also involved in the expansion and integration of domestic regional power grids and growing the domestic gas markets through auto gas compressed natural gas liquified petroleum gas to power vehicles in addition the nnpc is working with all its partners to monetize gas in different forms and this will result in the creation of a platform that will enable the national oil company create a hub where it can have gas based industries in location where it can deliver gas easily the implication of this is that the nnpc will assist the country to create power through the gas based industries which would be put back into the national grid these gases can also be compressed and sold to the nigerian liquefied natural gas with nigeria being the ninth highest gas reserves in the world and currently number 12 in gas production assets which have minimal vulnerability must be prioritized over assets which have higher vulnerability to security or production loss issues in order to reshape it s portfolio nnpc must also carefully select assets which have low vulnerability with regards to security and production losses over other assets this is why divested assets under mobil producing nigeria joint venture must be given priority to be acquired by nnpc over assets in shell petroleum development company jv which has high vulnerability to security and production losses since nnpc places strategic interest on assets like mpn jv which have been unable to monetize it s huge gas resources it must therefore not risk another partner on the asset that may not prioritize the monetisation of gas onuba writes from abuja

menafn swissinfo the swiss foreign ministry considers russian actions in ukraine to be an invasion and a gross violation of international law according to a statement issued thursday external content on thursday afternoon swiss president ignazio cassis announced that switzerland would support eu sanctions in the areas of travel and finance but would still not impose sanctions of its own a concrete example is that while the eu will freeze assets of people on its sanctions list switzerland will only ensure that its banks do not accept further funds from these individuals this is to prevent sanctioned russians from using switzerland to get around eu measures state secretary livia leu justified the move by citing switzerland s good offices role and alluded in particular to the protecting power mandate it undertakes between russia and georgia on twitter the ukrainian president volodimir selensky and jailed russian opposition figure alexei navalny had both called for tough sanctions against russia the european union which has already applied sanctions is considering additional punitive measures meanwhile the united states is urging the west to coordinate sanctions previously the swiss government had indicated it wanted to avoid the country being used to circumvent sanctions imposed by the eu that s why it was closely studying the measures other states were imposing the government had followed the same approach when russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 what switzerland needs to consider various factors play a role in the balance of considerations for the swiss neutrality under this principle switzerland must maintain a comparably wide distance from two parties in a conflict however international law experts agree that this does not apply if as in the case of russia there has been a clear unilateral attack in violation of international law a potential role as mediator in the conflict switzerland organised a summit between russian president vladimir putin and his american counterpart joe biden in geneva last june and has repeatedly offered its good offices to both countries sanctions could jeopardise the swiss role in diplomacy ukraine reform conference this year switzerland is organising the annual ukraine reform conference which focuses on the economic development of the country it is scheduled to take place in locarno in july for swiss president ignazio cassis it s a prestige project and an important platform for the swiss economy ukraine is seen as an emerging market if switzerland does not show solidarity now it could upset ukraine relations with the eu the relationship between brussels and bern has reached an all time low with the end of negotiations last year on a framework agreement switzerland is trying not to cause any more upset with europe if the eu goes ahead with tough sanctions switzerland will find itself under pressure location for business switzerland is home to the headquarters of many commodity firms with strong financial involvement with russia or that are active in the trade of russian raw materials such as oil and gas about 80 of russia s commodity trading goes through switzerland according to the russian embassy in bern vitol and trafigura have stakes in a project of russian oil giant rosneft and trade in russian oil as does commodity trading gunvor all three conduct much of their trading activity out of geneva the headquarters of russia s controversial nord stream 2 pipeline project is also in switzerland the project was cleared for sanctions by the u s on wednesday this gives switzerland considerable leverage should it decide to use it more more the changing face of international geneva international geneva is an important hub for multilateralism but it is facing some unprecedented challenges banking centre russian banks are also present in switzerland sberbank and gazprombank each have a branch here according to the russian embassy in bern switzerland is also by far the largest recipient of russian private capital between 5 billion and 10 billion chf4 6 9 2 billion of russian private money flows into switzerland every year these are other potential pressure points that the international community could ask switzerland to move on the swiss abroad there are about 700 swiss citizens living in russia they would have to deal with the fall out should switzerland adopt tough sanctions against russia over its aggression on neighboring ukraine the expat population is smaller in ukraine only 210 they are now in a war zone first protest actions the

hello 411 guys gals enbies and everyone else welcome to 411 s aew revolution preview i m jeremy thomas as always and aew is ready for another big ppv and by big i mean bigass card we have no less than twelve matches between the main ppv and the pre show which literally makes this the company s biggest show to date we have a ton of titles on the line and some big feuds set to culminate so without any further wasted words let s get into it the buy in match hook vs qt marshall image credit aew first up in our preview is perhaps the easiest pick of the lot aew knows that they have a star in the making in hook who has managed to become quite popular in the past few months his feud with the nightmare factory has given him something to do and something to get the fans further behind him while marshall has done a solid job playing the heel opposite him this match is a chance to get hook a match on ppv albeit in a comfortable setting against one of the men who helped trained him it s a solid approach as the company continues to build the rookie up and of course there s no doubt who s going to win marshall may provide a bit more challenge than his first five opponents but the end result will be the same an easy win for taz s son winner hook the buy in match penta obscura pac erick redbeard vs the house of black image credit aew this last minute match was added to the buy in on friday night s episode of rampage playing into the rivalry that malakai black brody king and buddy matthews have developed with death triangle this little story has had a few twists and turns mostly those involving the debuts of new talent first king and then matthews who joined black and then the arrival of erick redbeard on rampage as an ally to penta and pac for all the mystique surrounding the house of black malakai s run hasn t led to ppv success he s won quite the vast majority of his matches on dynamite and rampage but still needs a big ppv win meanwhile death triangle has had the transformation of penta into penta obscura and the arrival of redbeard but have been a bit less victorious since rey fenix went on the injury list all that said this seems like a match that black king and matthews probably need to win to solidify themselves as a trio whereas the other team is a bit more thrown together due to the lack of fenix it should be a fun match with an intriguing mix of styles in play but i expect the house of black to be victorious in the end winner the house of black the buy in match kris statlander vs leyla hirsch image credit aew this match is the trickiest of the buy in matches to predict because both sides could do well with a win but also wouldn t be drastically hurt by a loss statlander and hisch have been feuding on and off for the last several months and in the meantime hirsch has developed a new edge to her character that s serving her well while statlander has left behind some of the sillier aspects of her gimmick to become a character who can be taken more seriously they re both good competitors who know each other well so the match should be serviceable at the absolute worst as for the win statlander would position herself as a potential title contender with a victory here perhaps to jade cargill while hirsch doesn t seem quite ready for that yet in terms of stature within the division my guess and this is barely more than a coin flip is that statlander picks up the win for a rivalry with cargill just because i think she matches up better with the tbs champion than hirsch winner kris statlander tbs championship match jade cargill vs tay conti image credit aew speaking of cargill the tbs champion has been running roughshod over and is still as of now undefeated we re not counting the casino battle royale in that because who would cargill has been picking up quite nicely and gets her first one on one match on ppv here as she faces one of my personal favorites in the aew women s division in tay conti conti is a competitor who absolutely deserves a title reign at some point but she can also match up well against cargill and give her some experience on a bigger level that s her role here as there s no way this match is going to be the one that results in cargill s undefeated streak being broken i have every expectation for an enjoyable effort here but the win is clearly going to the current champion winner jade cargill still tbs champion tornado trios match a h f o vs darby allin sammy guevara and sting image credit aew poor andrade seems unable to find a good groove for himself and this storyline with the a h f o hasn t been the fix he needs el idolo has done fine work with what he has to work with here but right now it should be clear to everyone that this storyline is just building toward march 9th that s when jeff hardy s contract comes up and when he ll almost certainly be signing with aew when that happens the hardy boyz reunion will be a foregone conclusion and the way to facilitate that is to get matt thrown out of his own organization with that date coming up quickly we really need to have matt lose here in a way to further fracture the a h f o and that s fine because there s no shame at all in losing to a team with two of aew s pillars and sting the match will be fun but it will end with a loss to the heels and perhaps even considering jeff s contract expires on wednesday matt getting turned on at the ppv winner darby allin sammy guevara and sting aew world tag team championship match jurassic express vs redragon vs the young bucks image credit aew normally i am not a fan of champions being the third wheel in a three way match but in this case the bout should be so fun that i m not going to quibble for whatever faults you may find in them jurassic express redragon and the young bucks are able to deliver really enjoyable matches and when you put the three of them together i expect some high octane action like i said i m not thrilled about the fact that this looks to be done just to further the feud between the bucks and the team of kyle o reilly and bobby fish because i think it diminishes the champions importance but it s at least been a solid story redragon and the bucks tension slowly building with adam cole caught in the middle has been fun and in this case i think it s going to work out okay because it seems like a situation where their issues cause them to both lose that gives jungle boy and luchasaurus a title retention which lets them come out of the match strong even if they re not part of the main story and gives them the chance to move onto other interesting contenders while the super elite implode winner jurassic express still aew world tag team champions jon moxley vs bryan danielson image credit aew well this should be a blast it should almost go without saying that jon moxley and bryan danielson have every opportunity to deliver a match of the year contender and they have a pretty solid story behind it as well danielson has been doing his usual great job as a heel and his suggestion with moxley of a team that takes young talent under their wing has opened up some delightful storyline opportunities between them moxley and danielson are both explosive personalities and they ve been playing off each other quite well in the build up to this match as danielson has sought to recruit moxley and moxley has been warily considering it which led to this bout it s going to result in a chest aching match that has sky high expectations from most as it should but there s no reason to think they won t deliver honestly the result of this match seems almost superfluous as aew can go in similar storyline directions no matter who wins but my guess is that danielson picks up the win and we get their alliance for a certain amount of time before they split and go at it once more winner bryan danielson chris jericho vs eddie kingston image credit aew while there s been no small amount of criticism directed at chris jericho from some corners one thing you have to appreciate is his willingness to get talent up to that next level in terms of card positioning the inner circle leader has done good work with mjf and orange cassidy in particular during their feuds and while he beat mjf it s hard to deny that their feud elevated mjf s stock from a positioning perspective now he has the opportunity to do that with eddie kingston and i would expect nothing less kingston is a can t boo babyface who has yet to win that big match that finally puts him over the top that s what this rivalry with jericho has been building to and while aew loves drawing out feuds especially jericho s this doesn t seem like a time that should necessarily happen or if it does kingston still needs to go over here while jericho loses very little with a loss the inner circle issues will probably lead to shenanigans of some sort but hopefully those are kept to a minimum because an upset win by kingston would make him the made man he deserves to be winner eddie kingston face of the revolution ladder match keith lee vs orange cassidy vs powerhouse hobbs vs ricky starks vs wardlow vs christian cage image credit aew as common as multi man ladder matches are in pro wrestling i m still always a sucker for them last year s face of the revolution ladder match was a lot of fun and this year may have an entirely different makeup in terms of style but it has just as much potential you have quite the mix in here though if we re being honest this probably quickly winnows down to a couple of people in terms of potential winners orange cassidy is always entertaining but winning a match like this doesn t seem to be in the cards for him at all while ricky starks and powerhouse hobbs probably need a little more time before they re ready for something like this and christian cage much as i enjoy him is a bit veteran y to be the face of the revolution that brings us down to the remaining two contenders in wardlow and keith lee both of whom have very valid reasons why they could take home the win lee is a guy that aew clearly wants to put some importance on and a win here would do that he s also a guy who could match up very well against someone like sammy guevara when they meet for the tnt championship meanwhile wardlow seems like someone who is right there to step out on his own in the quest for singles gold depending on how his storyline with mjf goes in on sunday honestly i would be happy with either of them winning here but i feel like wardlow will pick up the win and that will somehow play into his story with mjf and that s fine because lee can get a big spot and isn t hurt by losing a multi man ladder match where he won t take a pin winner wardlow aew world women s championship match dr britt baker dmd vs thunder rosa image credit aew like i said earlier aew loves their slow burn feuds that s been the case with britt baker and thunder rosa who have been at odds for over a year now aew has been good about keeping them apart though now that they ve come together i will confess that i feel like the feud since it escalated has been the slightest bit underwhelming not bad but it hasn t quite had the heat these two are capable of bringing in the right situations that said it s not like they aren t going to deliver in the rematch of their infamous lights out match that took place just barely under a year ago they certainly don t need to top that match to give us a great match and considering how bloody that turned out they probably shouldn t baker has been aew women s champion for just over nine months at this point and during that time she s been a dominant champion rosa is the one person who baker s been able to keep away from and that seems to be a pretty good sign that we re getting a title change here which i m all for it will freshen things up at the top not that baker s been losing too much steam and they can get at least a little more mileage out of an eventual rematch and after all if not rosa at this point then who winner thunder rosa nwa aew world women s champions dog collar match mjf vs cm punk image credit aew an mjf vs cm punk feud has been written in the stars since the day punk appeared on aew television you have two of the absolute best talkers and two of the most over men in professional wrestling in one company and on different sides of the babyface vs heel line how could you not pit these two against each other and it s been predictably a compelling feud mjf has done some fantastic work in aew but he s hit a new level in terms of his performance by playing opposite punk and punk got a feud that he s really been able to sink his teeth into that as enjoyable as his work with eddie kingston and darby allin were he didn t get to with them mjf has particularly had punk s number up until now screwing him out of a win in his hometown of chicago and then got set up and brutalized in that incredible promo mjf did last week that if nothing else makes it pretty clear that mjf comes up short here mjf s issues with wardlow have been close to simmering over for a while now even with wardlow helping mjf defeat punk in chicago this match seems tailor made to have these two beat the hell out of each other and when mjf calls for his diamond ring wardlow to have a reason to say no that would give punk the moment he needs to put mjf away give the latter man an excuse for the loss and really kickstart the mjf vs wardlow feud into high gear all while leaving punk and mjf at a win apiece against each other for when this feud continues or gets revisited there s no downsides to punk getting the win winner cm punk aew world championship match hangman page vs adam cole image credit aew adam cole has been doing great work since his arrival in aew and he s been rightly positioned as a top name as well as a future world champion there s no question of that in my mind and the prospect of seeing cole and hangman page deliver a barn burnder of a match has me very excited for this world championship match cole and page match up well against each other and both have the capacity to really go i expect nothing less from these two that said if this were taking place three months from now i might have a little doubt about who s going to win it s not and i don t aew has shown they like lengthy world title reigns and page is only on his second title feud third if you count lance archer but that wasn t really a feud per se additionally cole is embroiled in the tension surrounding the super elite which looks ready to explode and that s not something that aew should be bringing the world championship into all this is to say that this is a predictable result but that doesn t mean it won t be a great match at the end of the day hangman will still be holding the title and i m a okay with that winner hangman page still aew world champion and that s all we have for aew revolution i say all as if we don t have a huge number of matches here and while many of them are a bit easy to predict can t wait for that statement o blow up when i somehow have predicted wrong it should still be another hell of a ppv effort by aew thanks once again for reading and remember that we will have live coverage of the show courtesy our own steve cook right here on 411mania com now i have to go tony khan s getting a crazy look in his eyes and i better stop before he starts tweeting

menafn swissinfo the swiss foreign ministry considers russian actions in ukraine to be an invasion and a gross violation of international law according to a statement issued thursday external content on thursday afternoon swiss president ignazio cassis announced that switzerland would support eu sanctions in the areas of travel and finance but would still not impose sanctions of its own a concrete example is that while the eu will freeze assets of people on its sanctions list switzerland will only ensure that its banks do not accept further funds from these individuals this is to prevent sanctioned russians from using switzerland to get around eu measures state secretary livia leu justified the move by citing switzerland s good offices role and alluded in particular to the protecting power mandate it undertakes between russia and georgia on twitter the ukrainian president volodimir selensky and jailed russian opposition figure alexei navalny had both called for tough sanctions against russia the european union which has already applied sanctions is considering additional punitive measures meanwhile the united states is urging the west to coordinate sanctions previously the swiss government had indicated it wanted to avoid the country being used to circumvent sanctions imposed by the eu that s why it was closely studying the measures other states were imposing the government had followed the same approach when russia annexed crimea from ukraine in 2014 what switzerland needs to consider various factors play a role in the balance of considerations for the swiss neutrality under this principle switzerland must maintain a comparably wide distance from two parties in a conflict however international law experts agree that this does not apply if as in the case of russia there has been a clear unilateral attack in violation of international law a potential role as mediator in the conflict switzerland organised a summit between russian president vladimir putin and his american counterpart joe biden in geneva last june and has repeatedly offered its good offices to both countries sanctions could jeopardise the swiss role in diplomacy ukraine reform conference this year switzerland is organising the annual ukraine reform conference which focuses on the economic development of the country it is scheduled to take place in locarno in july for swiss president ignazio cassis it s a prestige project and an important platform for the swiss economy ukraine is seen as an emerging market if switzerland does not show solidarity now it could upset ukraine relations with the eu the relationship between brussels and bern has reached an all time low with the end of negotiations last year on a framework agreement switzerland is trying not to cause any more upset with europe if the eu goes ahead with tough sanctions switzerland will find itself under pressure location for business switzerland is home to the headquarters of many commodity firms with strong financial involvement with russia or that are active in the trade of russian raw materials such as oil and gas about 80 of russia s commodity trading goes through switzerland according to the russian embassy in bern vitol and trafigura have stakes in a project of russian oil giant rosneft and trade in russian oil as does commodity trading gunvor all three conduct much of their trading activity out of geneva the headquarters of russia s controversial nord stream 2 pipeline project is also in switzerland the project was cleared for sanctions by the u s on wednesday this gives switzerland considerable leverage should it decide to use it more more the changing face of international geneva international geneva is an important hub for multilateralism but it is facing some unprecedented challenges banking centre russian banks are also present in switzerland sberbank and gazprombank each have a branch here according to the russian embassy in bern switzerland is also by far the largest recipient of russian private capital between 5 billion and 10 billion chf4 6 9 2 billion of russian private money flows into switzerland every year these are other potential pressure points that the international community could ask switzerland to move on the swiss abroad there are about 700 swiss citizens living in russia they would have to deal with the fall out should switzerland adopt tough sanctions against russia over its aggression on neighboring ukraine the expat population is smaller in ukraine only 210 they are now in a war zone first protest actions the response from the swiss public has been rather muted while in the past more than 10 000 people took to the streets in switzerland to protest the gulf war in 1991 and the war in iraq in 2003 there have been no such rallies in recent weeks even though the crisis in ukraine was clearly in escalation mode on wednesday evening only about 100 people gathered in front of the russian embassy in bern in an act of protest they demanded the withdrawal of russian troops from eastern ukraine where moscow recognised two breakaway regions held by pro russian separatists activists from the society for switzerland without an army and young socialists called for the withdrawal of russian troops from ukraine during a protest action in front of the russian embassy on wednesday keystone marcel bieri more rallies are expected an alliance of movements and organisations including the social democratic party sp is calling for a peace demonstration on saturday reactions in politics and media under the hashtag standwithukraine many people in switzerland are expressing their outrage russia has launched a war of aggression against ukraine social democrat parliamentarian fabian molina tweeted this brutal violation of international law is destroying peace in europe switzerland must stand in full solidarity at the side of our european partners jon pult also a social democrat parliamentarian tweeted putin is waging war on ukraine and violating the un charter there is no neutrality in the face of such breaches of international law switzerland must support the sanctions he said adding that the government s hesitation is unacceptable the oligarchic putin system should be dried up financially the swiss press has reacted with alarm calling the russian invasion of ukraine a blatant

skip to comments did putin bite off more than he can chew red state 03 05 2022 jeff charles posted on by seekandfind it has been about 10 days since russia invaded ukraine while russia s military is advancing further into the country it is clear that all is not going according to president vladimir putin s plan while moscow has made progress in its efforts against ukraine it has also experienced a series of significant setbacks the washington examiner recently published a report detailing some of russia s mistakes in its endeavor to overthrow ukraine s government air force secretary frank kendall during a speech at the air force association s annual conference on thursday stated that putin has made a very very serious miscalculation he said the russian president overestimated the capacity of his own military and severely underestimated the global reaction the invasion of ukraine would provoke he also did not take into account the will and courage of the people of ukraine pentagon spokesman john kirby made similar remarks on wednesday noting that the russian offensive against the capital city of kyiv has been stalled the official explained that their troops have been surprised by the stiff resistance that they are facing by the ukrainians and that their soldiers are dealing with fuel and food shortages the washington examiner noted one aspect of the fighting that has remained unexplained is the lack of russian control over the airspace above ukraine russia has 1 511 combat aircraft while ukraine has fewer than 100 according to flightglobal s 2022 world air forces directory we re seeing the same sort of activity in the air the senior official said there s a certain risk averse behavior they are not necessarily willing to take high risks with their own aircraft and their own pilots and of course we re seeing that on the ground in the fairly slow and stodgy progress that they have made ukraine has also benefited from other countries sending anti air and anti tank weapons it has helped them keep russian forces at bay and prevented them from taking control of kyiv nato while trying to stay out of the affair has still provided military resources to the country but russia is not only facing obstacles from the outside it is also dealing with internal opposition to military hostilities liberty nation spoke with christopher donnelly a specialist advisor to the british house of commons defence committee he explained like all tyrants the thing putin fears most is revolt by his own people the immense efforts taken by both the russian army and the state security organizations to prevent the russian people learning about what is happening in ukraine is evidence of how vulnerable the regime thinks it is to their population being exposed to the truth if russian casualties were to increase dramatically and images of russian soldiers brutalizing the very people putin claims are no different from russians themselves were to spread in from ukraine then the social pressure in russia could reach bursting point putin seems to recognize the threat coming from the russian populace which might not be amenable to seeing dead russian soldiers he recently blocked twitter and facebook ostensibly to prevent the citizenry from learning details about the conflict yahoo news reported in a written statement russia s media regulator roskomnadzor said on friday that facebook whose parent company is called meta had violated federal law by restricting access to russian state owned accounts which the regulator said violated fundamental human rights and freedoms as well as the rights and freedoms of russian citizens the report continued social media postings depicting the horrors of the war in ukraine and the bravery of its citizens and president volodymyr zelensky have helped sway world opinion staunchly against russian forces but friday s actions to further restrict access to information about the conflict may prevent russian citizens from receiving a fuller picture of what is unfolding another indicator that putin faces resistance from inside is the fact that alleged attempts to assassinate ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky have failed the kremlin has reportedly made three attempts on his life but he was able to avoid assassination because anti war elements in russia s federal security service tipped him off to the attacks these are only a few of the setbacks that russia has faced of course this does not mean putin will fail to overthrow ukraine s government indeed it is not easy to predict how this situation will pan out but one thing is clear if russia does succeed it could come at a cost that is greater than it is prepared to pay topics military veterans politics society keywords biden

the middle of a war the audience will believe the worst to seekandfind i know china sure wishes it was going better to seekandfind a whistle blower letter supposedly has been issued by a disgruntled fsb officer is it real unknown bellingcat thinks it possibly is the letter indicates that putin bit off way way more than he can chew and everyone is now fubar bellingcat tweet christo grozev christogrozev last night an alleged fsb whistle blower letter was published that damned russia s military performance in ukraine and predicted a disaster for the ru in the next weeks and months i wasn t sure if it was authentic as ukraine had previously leaked fake fsb letters as psy ops this letter appeared different though it came via a reputable source founder of and it was way longer than a forger would choose to make it the longer the text the more risk of making an error i showed the letter to two actual current or former fsb contacts and they had no doubt it was written by a colleague they didn t agree with all of his conclusions but that s a different story here s the text worth reading to seekandfind remind me how many days did it take us to win in afghanistan to seekandfind

now to secret agent man true they let china down to pgr88 its going to go down like this regardless of anglo american propaganda for zelensky pro ukrainian elements the anti russian factions in north america western europe will not spend the time money or blood to achieve their goals in the ukrainian region the russians will spend the time blood and treasure to accomplish their mission with or without putin sometimes when you re bluffing at poker with a bad hand you fold we need to cut bait by 12 posted onby unclebankster globalism is the last refuge of a scoundrel to ifinnegan agree silly articles to seekandfind part of an email message from andrew torba of gab yesterday gab engineers discovered a massive anti russian botnet on our platform which we quickly banned there were hundreds of newly created accounts all sharing the same dozen or so ip addresses they were reposting commenting and liking anti russian fake news to the gab explore page our bot detection systems caught them quickly and we removed them from the platform this type of activity is eerily similar to centcom s operation earnest voice we have no proof who was behind this activity all we know is what their agenda was promoting anti putin and anti russian propaganda gab is not a platform for state backed psyop campaigns we re not going to allow this coordinated inauthentic activity to take place in our community not from foreign state actors and not from our own government we also aren t going to ban a foreign news outlet or russian citizens from gab for no reason rt news has been on gab for over a year now and has never once even come close to violating our terms of service gab is now the one place on the internet where you can find rt news and you can do so by clicking here andrew torba ceo gab com happening here to some extent too to meet the new boss i got this from a deep cover agent named hyper tiger ok in 2014 ukraine went from a primarily western russia influenced area to a primarily eastern europe influenced area which is a western europe influenced area which is an eastern north and south american influenced area which is a western north american influenced area which is a eastern asian influenced area in the far east of ukraine the population is primarily russian the crimea outright joined russia due to it being almost totally russian anyways except for the flags the war in the donbas or the donbas war is an armed conflict in the donbas region of ukraine part of the broader russo ukrainian war from the beginning of march 2014 7 years 10 months this war that you all did not notice until recently has been raging the name of march comes from martius the first month of the earliest roman calendar it was named after mars the roman god of war and an ancestor of the roman people through his sons romulus and remus his month martius was the beginning of the season for warfare because i have a deep attachment to the above i noticed inside donbas are russian separatists fully backed by russia that have been waging a war with the ukrainian armed forces the current size of ukraine s armed forces which consists of 250 000 215 000 military personnel is the largest in europe and second in the region after the russian armed forces in 2022 president zelensky ordered to increase the size of the forces by 100 000 by 2025 while ending conscription in 2024 now i will show you why i have a deep connection code in communications and information processing code is a system of rules to convert information such as a letter word sound image or gesture into another form sometimes shortened or secret for communication when 1 a and 26 z hint adds up to 51 mars adds up to 51 michael adds up to 51 and elite adds up to 51 the technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society such a society would be dominated by an elite unrestrained by traditional values soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up to date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen these files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities to ceebass war spending alone will hit russia hard plus economic sanctions losing access to international shipping deplaforming by tech giant they are losing means to run their economy even if russia wins eventually in the battlefield russia will be set back for years in all other aspects whispering to russians that russia s living standard might plummet to the level of n korea will really shock them to algore technotronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society such a society would be dominated by an elite unrestrained by traditional values soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up to date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen these files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities i helped to build the electronic digital computerized world you all depend upon to sustain your continued existence i ve been trying to ignore your insert whatever you think you are doing here for years and years now since you made me aware of your existence oh ya plus today is 2 20 february 20 is the 51st day of the year in the gregorian calendar 314 days remain until the end of the year 315 in leap years 51st day when 1 a and 26 z february twentieth 220 anyways it looks like after years of war the separatists are on the ropes without russia running in to save them they will suffer sickening damage make no mistake the russian separatists and their supporters are not going to be treated nice in any way good thing you all are being sheltered from this it is real easy to look this all up but you all are not and if that which is controlling you makes sure you do not look it up then you will be blissfully unaware 7 years 10 months and 2 weeks of course the usa has said that it will be a false flag by russia to justify a more direct involvement than currently during the entire trump administration there was a war going on people being splattered for years and years the overall number of confirmed deaths in the war in donbas which started on 6 april 2014 has been put at 13 100 13 300 by 31 january 2021 that covers the last part of the obama administration the totality of the trump administration and so far the totality of the current biden administration the war is not something that all of a sudden is going to begin it began 2014 then i noticed the above 6 april 2014 to 31 january 2021 that is 6 4 and 31 1 64th prime is 311 i noticed that the nasdaq peaked at the end of 2021 and the dow peaked in the beginning of 2022 all that absolute capitalistic systems can do is inflate to maximum potential and then deflate to maximum potential like the virus waves on the charts the markets topped in the past everyone would have pointed this out but no one has really pointed this out but like this war that started in 2014 that you all think is about to start the collapse of the market that has already begun and in progress is going to show up as well then factor in the perfectly orchestrated protest chaos that provides wonderful cover to mcgruff these day 10 days is a quagmire longer than peoples attention span we live in the era of instant everything if a video takes 4 seconds to start people get all worked up back in the day you could have a hundred years war and people would exclaim boy that went by fast to louiefisk back in the day you could have a hundred years war and people would exclaim boy that went by fast at least the few that were more than 116 years old to algore in russia there was a segment of the population convinced of the extraordinary significance of the date 22 02 2022 the theory was explained to me but i can t remember it at the moment it was some characteristic russian numbers thing that seemed dumb and superstitious to me anyway they were convinced that if putin invaded on 22 02 2022 then that would be the end of the world or something and when he didn t i guess they all breathed a sign of relief at least until he invaded on the 24th disclaimer opinions posted on free republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of
