credit stock image getty images in march as a part of the american rescue plan the largest child tax credit ctc legislation in our history was passed giving most families monthly payments of 250 300 per child the ctc allowed families to purchase food childcare and other important household essentials this week however the inaction from elected officials namely west virginia sen joe manchin will leave families blindsided unprepared and 10 million children on a returned pathway to poverty poverty is not an accident or a series of poor decisions it results from many factors like corporate greed exploitative labor practices and unjust policies or actions by elected officials governments and private industries across the u s have a deep history of passing poverty increasing opportunity denying policies that directly target black people from jim crow laws and redlining to school segregation and mass incarceration racism contributes to burgeoning racial wealth gaps simultaneously social and economic safety net disinvestments have forced millions of americans to fall through the cracks the government continuously fails to pass poverty reducing policies that reach black communities a population that holds seven times less wealth than white americans even when strides toward real solutions and reinvestments are introduced like the ctc elected officials work quickly to end them earlier this fall president biden unveiled his build back better agenda a multitrillion dollar spending package to expand the social safety net that would set our families on an equitable path toward economic recovery but currently republican lawmakers and sen joe manchin d w va will not support the bill because of perpetuated classist narratives of spending aid wisely increasing a child s family income early in life has been found to have substantial benefits for the child s health educational attainment and future employment for example a 3 000 increase in annual family income for a child under five has been found to boost that child s earnings by 19 percent in adulthood a one year ctc extension is a fraction of the 1 9 trillion proposal in the house ways and means package an investment that will ripple out to positively impact our communities and our economy credit stock image getty images the ctc s narrative changing impact has been lauded by lawmakers and economists as a tangible way to tackle poverty in the country the extra income provided by the ctc allowed millions of families the opportunity to afford quality child care pay utilities chip away at debt and more with this legislation millions of children and their families are more financially secure have emergency savings and are rising up from poverty and the exploitation of their employers with the fate of the ctc seemingly unclear we sent a detailed letter in october to the white house and congressional leaders demanding that the universal child allowance remain without immediate action however millions of americans will not receive the vital support needed to make it through the holidays and put families behind on bills overnight canceling the ctc and economic justice provisions means abruptly cutting off families lifelines to accessing essential items a census bureau survey found 91 percent of families receiving ctc installments spent it on groceries rent clothing and school supplies the well being and economic stability of millions of families are not up for negotiation the ctc was one solution to disrupt poverty by lifting people up for the long haul after decades of keeping people including their wages communities and hopes down as we fight tooth and nail for economic recovery our federal government must proceed to undo centuries of systemic racism that have brought us to this point history has taught us that we cannot leave good policy unprotected with every conservative political gain we risk rolling back funding and social programs for those who need it most when republicans took control of the house in 2011 they refused to pass funding to government programs that hadn t been previously authorized causing unprecedented welfare cuts across the board these types of decisions are felt for generations the support for the ctc is clear but it s critical that this administration take every action that it can to pass this piece of legislation millions of families lives are literally at stake as we ve seen with the ctc direct cash assistance empowers our communities with the additional income necessary to make ends meet if our elected officials want to prioritize black and low income families then they must introduce and advance legislation that provides much needed relief to our communities we can t leave it up to chance for future congresses congress must do the right thing by assuring the ctc is here to stay arisha hatch is vice president of campaigns color of change the largest online racial justice organization in the

it would be easy to see gabriel boric s comprehensive victory in chile s presidential election as part of the narrative of latin america again lurching to the left and putting at risk the gains made by investor friendly governments a decade ago the pacific alliance countries chile peru colombia and mexico were financial markets darlings used to extol the virtues of orthodox economic policymaking after boric s win on sunday three of these countries have presidents with sometimes radical left wing convictions in colombia the only outlier former guerrilla gustavo petro is leading polls ahead of next year s election whether you side with those who can t believe that chile is throwing away the free market model that has transformed it into latin america s strongest economy or you agree with chileans who say that it is time for greater state intervention to ease inequality it is clear that latin american bond investors need to remove themselves from the left right dichotomy as creditors fret over post pandemic debt burdens it is mexico s left wing andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo who has proven to be latam s most frugal leader brazilian conservative jair bolsonaro whose victory in 2018 brought euphoria to markets has spent like there s no tomorrow and still growth is underwhelming moreover the hot headed bolsonaro s populist iconoclastic streak is leaking into fiscal policy he already gave investors a fright with the removal of petrobras s ceo early in the year and now wants to dodge constitutional spending limits brazil bonds have had a terrible time this is nothing new famous left wing presidents lula brazil and ollanta humala peru were nowhere near as destructive for fixed income performance as the election time collective meltdown would have foreseen more recently lenin moreno rafael correa s anointed successor in ecuador won the presidency and after a while realised that he needed a market friendly finance minister this did make him unpopular with correa and his base but it granted ample bond market access even as ecuador restructured during the pandemic the issuer earned plaudits for its approach what causes this a romantic might argue it is respect for a nation s institutions or a willingness to work for the greater good but often it s self preservation moreno realised that his predecessor s economic policy had an expiry date and he needed change to continue to access funding some of amlo s policies may disgust market participants but he knew from the start that he could not attempt them without limiting disarray in capital markets cancelling a new airport when it was a third built seems a terrible decision but amlo found a way to keep paying the airport s bondholders in this sense early signs from boric are encouraging his shift to the centre to earn votes suggests a willingness to moderate and indicates he understands the need for manageable governance if he keeps up this pragmatism expect the proposal to do away with chile s famous private pension system to be watered down into something far less destructive for capital markets ultimately a leader s ability to be pragmatic matters more than his political stripes antagonising bond markets rarely makes sense for a president even venezuela s hugo chávez had an impeccable bond repayment record this is food for thought ahead of what could be one of the most crucial calls of 2022 for em bond traders will el salvador s president nayib bukele take a pragmatic turn and realise in time for a january 2023 maturity payment that having financial markets onside and cheap funding from the imf is likely to make his life easier or will he remain in the thralls of his crypto dude personality cult as he appears to be today

the centralized deposit for compensation and settlement of private securities decevale dissociates itself from the mismanagement it had and declares itself as one more victim of the millionaire robbery faced by the social security institute of the national police isspol lawyers for the entity have asked the florida court in the united states for restitution of losses originated by criminal conduct that luis álvarez had when he held the position of operations manager at the beginning of the year álvarez began to be charged in that country for participating in an alleged scheme to pay bribes and money laundering with money that came from the police fund after a collaboration agreement signed with the north american justice system álvarez admitted having received from jorge chérrez ibcorp s president 3 1 million and an apartment in miami florida in exchange for pretending that the decevale was guarding 693 411 150 in isspol bonds and thereby make it easier for chérrez companies to control said investment resources that the police entity continues to demand to this day as a result of the clear abuse of his position to carry out his plan the decevale has suffered significant losses says the official letter sent by the law firm waserstein and núñez pllc to the southern district court of florida where the cause not only against álvarez but against chérrez and jhon luzuriaga former director of investments at isspol therefore it is cited in the request this court must grant the decevale a restitution that includes at least twenty five percent of the salary and benefits paid while álvarez was involved in the fraudulent plan in the official letter sent on december 10 it is detailed that from 2014 to 2020 the period in which the operations against isspol took place álvarez received 484 199 80 as salary to these losses it is noted must be added the 380 000 that the entity has had to allocate as payment of fees to lawyers and the 167 200 of the fine imposed by the superintendency of companies securities and insurance of ecuador and that it had to face this newspaper tried to talk with gonzalo hidalgo the new president of the deposit to have details of the matter and about other possible actions that are underway but asked to speak with the entity s lawyer eduardo carmigniani who leads the defense mentioned that they are still waiting for the judge to rule on this request which not only seeks monetary compensation but that the entity be recognized as a victim of álvarez s criminal acts the deposit today points to álvarez as the most responsible however the ecuadorian prosecutor s office within the 20 judicial processes that continues in the country to find those responsible for the robbery of the isspol for 950 million in addition to the bonds the amount includes other operations has opened several investigations in the that in addition to álvarez and chérrez the actions of rodolfo kronfle who was president of the guayaquil stock exchange bvg and decevale are being investigated carlos carbo cox its general manager oriana rumbea her former administrative manager and gonzalo navarro also a former director they have avoided commenting on the issue the thesis that we handle is that all these improper acts were engineered by a gang made up of álvarez oriana rumbea and gustavo navarro behind the backs of carbo and kronfle we are waiting to see what justice determines declared carmigniani this request for restitution of losses would be one of the first requests to be referred to the north american courts isspol the most affected is still working on hiring a staff of lawyers to initiate actions that allow him to recover resources on american soil renato gonzález director of isspol mentioned that decevale will have to prove to the united states justice if it is right or not but it does seem absurd to us that they want to present themselves as victims as they have tried to do with the investigations that are being followed locally according to the representative of the police the entity and its authorities at that time did not ensure control of the operations that were carried out on their behalf

e very year comes with its own unexpected twists for financial markets but 2021 has been jam packed with them here are some of the developments that took investors companies and analysts most by surprise this year and what they mean for 2022 supply chain disruptions paul samuelson a nobel prizewinning economist once joked that the stockmarket had predicted nine of the last five recessions a similar charge could have been levelled against the analysts who regularly fretted about major supply chain disruptions until now the onset of the pandemic in early 2020 was strikingly free of serious snarls beyond the fact that personal protective equipment was in short supply for a time by contrast this year has been marked by extensive shortages and surging supply driven inflation drewry a supply chain consultancy constructs a measure of the average cost of shipping a 40 foot container across a range of routes this reached a peak of 10 377 in late september quadruple the level a year earlier disruptions to factories and ports in china and south east asia driven by governments efforts to smother covid 19 outbreaks did not help matters but the lion s share of the tumult can be attributed to explosive demand for physical products spending on durable goods has risen by 34 in america since the beginning of 2020 compared with an increase of nearer 4 on services as the pandemic recedes that gap should narrow but supply chains may remain squeezed for some time relative to pre covid norms chinese markets upturned the established order in chinese financial markets was upended this year too for the best part of a decade investors clamoured for greater access to chinese assets with the country s booming tech sector regarded as particularly alluring but a regulatory crackdown in 2021 has left the msci china tech 100 share price index down by nearly a third since the beginning of the year the stock price of alibaba an e commerce giant has fallen by almost 50 over the same period evergrande a huge property developer had long been the most extreme symbol of china s heavily leveraged real estate sector in 2021 it at last defaulted in the face of a government effort to throttle borrowing by developers how the regulatory campaigns proceed depends on china s opaque politics which will be dominated by the communist party congress towards the end of 2022 but the shakedown of both the tech and property sectors has made clear that investment performance in china can still turn on a dime if the government s mood shifts the earnings bonanza analysts and investors expected a revival in earnings in 2021 after all things could hardly have been worse than last year but the scale of the recovery has beaten almost all projections in late december 2020 the consensus expectation was for a 22 increase in earnings per share on the s p 500 america s benchmark stock index in 2021 fourth quarter earnings are still to be announced but the estimate for growth in the year as a whole is now 45 stronger even than the 40 rise in 2010 after the global financial crisis this is partly down to a faster economic recovery than expected with companies earnings surpassing not just their 2020 levels but their 2019 levels too that puts stockmarkets in a more difficult spot as 2022 begins some of the economic recovery that had previously been expected to take place next year may already have happened analysts expect a much more muted rise in the earnings of s p 500 companies of 9 beating forecasts by a large margin again next year will be a tall order and with the index still priced at more than 20 times expected earnings that might limit how far prices can rise public v private for much of 2020 bankers moaned about the difficulties of operating in a pandemic but if the fewer physical meetings with clients the lack of roadshows for initial public offerings and the uncertainty of the economic outlook have had deleterious effects they are hard to find in the data in the first 11 months of the year listings in america raised 147 8bn more than twice the amount raised in the same period in 2020 although the surge was most pronounced in the early months of the year activity is still buoyant as 2021 draws to a close the boom casts some doubt over the idea that public markets are being inexorably supplanted by private capital the power of banks over the listing process may be ebbing as companies going public can now opt for direct listings or mergers with special purpose acquisition companies spacs so far in the fourth quarter 621 companies have gone public worldwide including through spacs a 16 increase over the past year the wave of flotations suggests public markets are not out for the count green finance executives and investors keen to appear environmentally friendly have sometimes been objects of derision in recent years and green finance in general has been regarded with often justified scepticism but this year has seen concrete developments green government bonds have flooded the market with at least 20 countries issuing such debt this year in mid october the european union issued its first green bond selling 12bn worth 13 6bn to enthusiastic investors perhaps the most interesting developments have come from the private sector though investment in climate tech startups reached 60bn in the first half of 2021 more than triple that in the same period last year there has been a huge surge of investor interest in electric vehicle firms from tesla to catl the world s leading battery maker meanwhile in may exxonmobil lost a proxy battle against activist investors who voted more climate friendly directors to the oil firm s board and the oil majors are among the companies exploring hydrogen technologies finance will struggle to be truly green without a widespread carbon price but the sector emerges from 2021 looking more mature and serious than when the year began for more expert analysis of the biggest stories

sales of previously occupied u s homes rose for the third straight month in november reflecting strong demand low mortgage rates and intense competition for a relatively few number of properties on the market existing homes sales rose 1 9 last month from october to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 46 million units the national association of realtors said wednesday that s the fastest pace since january but below the 6 51 million units that economists had been expecting according to factset sales fell 2 from november last year when they surged as buyers who had held off during the early days of the pandemic jumped back into the market through the first 11 months of this year u s home sales are up 10 from the same stretch of 2020 2021 has been a very strong year said lawrence yun the nar s chief economist continued job growth a stock market near all time highs rising rents and expectations that mortgage rates will move higher next year have been driving home sales yun said the housing market has strengthened during the pandemic as many americans transitioned to working at home which put additional living space at a premium the surge in demand has led to fierce competition and sharply higher prices the national median home price jumped to 353 900 last month a 13 9 increase from november last year the nar said the sharp increase is partly due to pricier homes making up a bigger share of all homes sold yun noted as prices continue to climb many would be buyers especially those seeking a first home are being priced out of the market historically low mortgage rates first time buyers accounted for just 26 of all sales last month matching a previous low recorded in january 2014 those buyers accounted for 32 of sales in november 2020 first time buyers are really struggling to get into the market yun said americans continued to snap up homes only days after they re listed homes typically remained on the market 18 days before they were sold last month the same as in october but down from 21 days in november 2020 in a market that s more evenly balanced between buyers and sellers homes typically remain on the market 45 days all told 83 of homes sold last month were on the market for less than a month at the end of november the inventory of unsold homes stood at just 1 11 million homes for sale down 9 8 from october and down 13 from a year ago at the current sales pace that amounts to a 2 1 months supply the nar said
photo credit j dennis shutterstock where people choose to live work and grow their families is one of the most important decisions they will make in life climate cost of living economic opportunities or proximity to family friends or desirable amenities may all be factors that people consider when deciding where to live but one factor that is often overlooked is environmental health and in that realm air quality is one of the most important considerations air quality matters because pollution is associated with a number of health issues high concentrations of pollutants can affect children s development cause or worsen respiratory problems like asthma or emphysema and put people at heightened risk of severe health events like heart attack or stroke and while like many health issues air pollution has been shown to disproportionately impact low income communities there isn t a meaningful correlation between levels of air pollution and cost of living at the city level in fact some of the highest levels of air pollution can be found in the nation s most expensive and sought after metropolitan areas air quality has long been a problem in the u s for much of the 19th and 20th centuries the growth of the economy brought heightened levels of air pollution through increased fuel combustion and industrial or chemical processes more recently the acceleration of global warming has contributed to drought wildfires and other conditions that can raise levels of particulate matter and other pollutants in the air fortunately air quality has also been improving over time since the passage of the clean air act and creation of the environmental protection agency several decades ago under the clean air act the epa is required to set air quality standards naaqs for certain airborne pollutants that have been deemed harmful to human health and or the environment to help meet these standards the epa can set rules around acceptable levels of pollution from sources like industry or vehicles over the years these policies have had a strong track record leading to steady decreases across all of the monitored air pollutants despite this improvement air pollution remains a major concern for many parts of the united states nearly 100 million americans almost one third live in a location that experienced unhealthy levels of air pollution in 2020 which the epa calculates based on whether counties have pollutants at concentrations above the naaqs americans most commonly experience pollution from ozone and particulate matter but carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide are also present at elevated levels in some communities the air quality issue is worse in some parts of the country than in others most notably residents in the southwest especially california and arizona typically experience the worst air quality in any given year much of the reason for this can be attributed to climate and geography the southwest is mostly desert or other very dry land with greater susceptibility to dust storms wildfires and other events that increase levels of particulate matter in the air further residents of major metros like los angeles and phoenix are more geographically spread out which increases dependence on cars and with it pollutants like ozone most of the metros where air pollution is highest are unsurprisingly found in california and elsewhere in the southwest the data used in this analysis is from the u s environmental protection agency and the u s bureau of economic analysis dataset to identify the most expensive locations with the worst air quality researchers at filterbuy looked at the median daily air quality index aqi for each metropolitan area in 2020 the aqi is a broad measure of air pollution that takes into account the concentrations of major air pollutants regulated by the clean air act higher aqi values correspond to higher levels of air pollution only locations with a cost of living greater than the national average as determined by the bureau of economic analysis were included in the study here are the expensive metros with the worst air quality expensive metros with the highest levels of air pollution photo credit you touch

luxury homes super luxury home sales in 2021 a phenomenon on steroids in 2021 at least 40 residential properties sold for more than 50 million in the u s eight went for 100 million or more rupert

40 residential properties sold for more than 50 million in the united states according to data appraiser miller samuel compiled that s about a 35 percent increase over 2020 which was also a record year the surge in this tier is unprecedented said jonathan miller the company s president and chief executive officer we ve never seen this kind of growth fueled by a booming stock market low interest rates and a pandemic era s heightened emphasis on home life prices for luxury houses have risen to stratospheric heights across the country it s a national phenomenon miller said not enough words have

country s eight most expensive homes according to miller samuel s data each sold for 100 million or more and are spread equally between the los angeles metro area the new york metro area palm beach fla and ranches in montana since 2014 there s been the establishment of a new class of property said miller referring to these 100 million plus houses initially it seemed comical or whimsical these numbers we were seeing came across as a flash in the pan but now we re in our seventh year of it a caveat miller said his tally is provisional because as financial advisers rush to line up deals before 2022 begins he predicts a flurry of closings at the very end of the year i don t think anyone is saying that in 2022 taxes are going to be cut he said so it s just hedging new york vs florida for all the chatter about rich people leaving high tax states new york still topped the list for the number of sales over 50 million with 13 florida had 11 the 157 5 million sale of a duplex at 220

following that is the 33 bedroom 15 acre compound in manalapan sold by the ziff family for 94 2 million hot on its heels is another manalapan home 1020 south ocean boulevard which hedge funder paul

sales wide 0pen spaces some of the biggest prices paid this year were for huge tracts of land advertisement rupert murdoch s 200 million purchase of a 340 000 acre ranch in montana topped the list no 4 on the list is climbing arrow ranch an 80 000 acre working ranch near bozeman mont which sold for about 136 million even if other properties couldn t match the sweep and scale of a county sized

165 million after failing to find a buyer it sold at auction for 51 million miller cautions against applying these sales to the wider market this suggests or illustrates the widening wealth gap he

oddly enough this week it seems to be razors hair products and pasta the empty shelves where pasta should be might be a fluke as i haven t seen anything in the national news about the great christmas pasta shortage of 21 the others make sense a few weeks ago at least for me the shortages seemed to be frozen chicken and canned cat food but i digress but not all states are experiencing the same shortages heck even different regions of one state can see lower levels of vastly different products or food items get our free mobile app all reputable sources with close connections to both retailers and suppliers such as supermarketnews com progressivegrocer com grocerydive com etc all seem to point to the same basic problems and those problems aren t necessarily the same generic reasons we ve heard over and over let s start with what s in short supply as of december 2021 according to taste of home note other than pet food specifically canned cat food and frozen chicken i haven t noticed a local shortage of any of the items that make the national list liquor bottled water lunchables pet food chicken turkeys canned goods the months long scarcity of many brands of pet food or much higher prices at least stem from higher input costs the ingredients such as corn meat etc another culprit for items like this is aluminum notice that kwiky marts don t have the greatest selection of single cans these days aluminum don t fret there are still plenty of brands available for purchase at specialty stores or grocery stores however there s a decent chance your usual brand or flavor may be low or completely out for a bit photo michelle wolfe photo michelle wolfe loading the liquor shortages i found surprising simply because i haven t experienced any issues locally but there are supply issues in many regions and it s apparently a multi faceted problem first import and shipping costs are much higher than we ve seen in many years second there seems to be trouble sourcing glass bottles jesus can t we figure out a way to make recycling glass cheaper and easier lastly some booze takes a long time to make and the powers that be are simply behind turns out that america drank quite a bit during stay at home months so next time you hit the grocery store take note but don t freak out your favorite razor blades just might be out of stock but nobody s hoarding them the cat might have to make due with friskies instead of whatever expensive foo foo brand he s used to trust me the cat will eat when they get hungry enough

this is one bizarre story the convicted killer formerly known as drew blahnik was recently sentenced to 57 years in prison for killing christopher bagley and his murder conviction will remain under that name here s the weird part i said formerly known because blahnik has what he referred to in front of a judge as acting aspirations and will be moving forward under a different moniker blahnik will go by the name johnny blahnik church after 6th judicial district court judge christopher bruns granted the request last friday according to the cedar rapids gazette blahnik filed the petition earlier this year stating he wanted to change his name to further his aspirations of becoming an actor before trial he had already been taking classes to hone his craft and in the petition stated upon being released i plan to jump right back into my pursuit of happiness with a career of acting and voiceovers that release is again 57 years away although he will be eligible for parole in 35 years that will make blahnik or church still the ripe young age of 69 make that 91 if he serves the full term drew blahnik also said he wanted to remove the name drew because of a link to another drew in the case that was causing him severe post traumatic stress to the point of hearing my first name acts as a trigger to the past and these events that have occurred which i plan to leave in the past and move forward drew wagner was also convicted in the murder case wagner testified that bagley had pulled drug and money robberies on drug dealer andrew shaw who later was convicted in federal court for being a large scale marijuana trafficker in cedar rapids while the drama between the two drews certainly has the feel of a blockbuster or an amazing episode of criminal minds i have a feeling the only acting roles johnny church will appear in will be the stock footage from true crime documentaries based on this bizarre case iowa s 25 most violent cities according to the fbi

management archegos a family office investment fund was founded and run by sung kook hwang hwang a former portfolio manager of tiger asia management a hedge fund he also founded goldman sachs and morgan stanley are global financial services institutions that served as two of archegos prime brokers helping it make trades and lending it capital in the form of margin lending archegos took big concentrated positions in companies such as viacomcbs inc viacomcbs vipshop holdings ltd discovery inc farfetch ltd gaotu techedu inc baidu inc iqiyi and tencent holdings ltd through financial instruments called total return swaps whereby the underlying securities are held by banks that broker the investments unbeknownst to investors and regulators several large brokerage banks including defendants each had simultaneously allowed archegos to take on billions of dollars of exposure to volatile equities through swaps contracts dramatically elevating the risk posed by these concentrated positions on march 23 2021 viacomcbs announced a new 3 billion offering to help fund investments in its streaming service paramount which had launched earlier in the month on march 25 2021 one of wall street s most influential research firms moffettnathanson published a report questioning viacomcbs s value downgrading the stock to a sell and setting a price target of only 55 per share compared to the company s 85 offer we never ever thought we would see viacom trading close to 100 per share read the report obviously neither did viacomcbs s management it continued citing the new stock offering in the wake of that report viacomcbs s stock cratered losing more than half its value in less than a week indeed by the close of trading on friday march 26 2021 viacomcbs was worth 48 per share this proved to be extremely problematic for archegos which had traded viacomcbs on margin because archegos had to maintain a certain amount of collateral to satisfy its lenders and since the value of viacomcbs stock drastically declined archegos needed enough collateral to cover or else a margin call where the lender can force a sell off of the stock to bring the investor back into compliance with margin requirements could be triggered on march 27 2021 it was reported that archegos failed to cover and as a result had to liquidate more than 20 billion of its leveraged equity positions on friday march 26 2021 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants sold a large number of iqiyi shares during the week of march 22 2021 while in possession of material non public information according to subsequent media reports defendants unloaded large block trades consisting of shares of archegos doomed bets including billions worth of iqiyi securities late thursday march 25 2021 before the archegos story reached the public sending iqiyi s shares into a complete tailspin as a result of these sales defendants avoided billions in losses combined defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that they were prohibited from trading based on this confidential market moving information but traded anyway disposing to plaintiff and other members of the class their iqiyi

andreas m darling a larger than life figure who homesteaded on the shores of lake darling which he named from 1859 to 1864 became a prominent figure in douglas county until his untimely murder by a vengeful son and his gang of bushwhackers on a missouri farm with the help of the douglas county historical society the echo press decided to take a deeper look into the life and untimely death of a man whose name is associated with one of the county s most popular lakes abner darling son of andreas one of the first police officers in alexandria stands posed for a picture contributed photo a battle with a bear here s one tale about darling in 1859 on his way to tend to his cows and accompanied by his trusty k 9 companion darling came across three bear cubs the dog chased the cubs up a tree knowing the mother would appear soon darling wielded a club climbed up the tree after the cubs and made one of them squeal advertisement the mother bear hurriedly came to her young one s rescue take her darling yelled at his dog and hustled down the tree to assist darling fell right into the middle of the scuffle but recovered quickly in his descent with a raise his club he delivered a swift blow the blow was enough to send the protective mama running at least for the time being darling began hollering for his neighbor who arrived weaponless moments later with his hired man darling told his neighbor to keep the cubs trapped while he retrieved his trusty rifle biting betty a custom made 16 pound gun with a half ounce ball of shot when darling returned he set a cub to a cry again drawing in the mother for another bout this time the man drew a bead on her and took her down with one shot or so the story goes that was published under the old settlers column in the alexandria post in 1897 describing the alleged first bear kill in douglas county darling was a large and well proportioned man standing well over 6 feet he became a prominent figure in the early days of douglas county tales of him seem mythical the book manomin rhythmical romance of minnesota the great rebellion and the minnesota massacres written by myron coloney states darling could shoot a loon s eye out from over 200 yards after darling s battle with the bear he fostered one of the bear cubs and named him ned who became a neighborhood attraction eventually ned was sold to the stearns house in st cloud and somehow ended up on a mississippi steamer never to be seen again darling s early years darling was born somewhere in northern new york state eventually earning a reputation as a rolling stone mirroring his father s persona his family migrated west to ohio and eventually michigan where he met and married his wife antoinette in a biography of antoinette she describes darling as a young adventurer as their family grew with children they moved into wisconsin then eventually into minnesota in 1958 59 laying claim on 12 acres of shoreline on a large lake darling named lake darling he built a house and stable on his newfound homestead advertisement myron coloney and his wife josephine arrived just days after the darlings on the shore of a lake the coloney s dubbed lake ida after an old friend myron befriended darling and described him as a most indefatigable hunter and trapper in his book dedicated to darling darling rises to local prominence when douglas county became officially organized under the act of the state legislature in 1858 darling became one of the first county commissioners along with samuel cowdry and j h vandyke in the fall of 1860 darling grew in prominence by being voted in as a judge with cowdry and daniel shotwell things were well for the darlings and the growing community then in the spring of 1862 the uprising of the sioux during the dakota war forced the darlings and other residents of alexandria to flee their homes for safety as many of the homes in the area were set ablaze by retaliating sioux described by myron s granddaughter ruth coloney sorelle for decades the dakota saw their hunting lands dwindle and provisions promised by the government rarely arrived the treatment they received from the federal government local traders and settlers was strained and eventually led to a breaking point in a letter to the editor published in the alexandria post news on july 29 1897 reflecting on the uprising years later the writer tells how the darlings and other families took refuge in st cloud once safe darling addressed the group the article reads mr darling stepping out from the crowd said friends all i have in the world is my home and i am going to try to save it and if there is a man among you who will stay with me let him step out in response n f barnes stepped out and the two men clasped hands there were some moist eyes among the men as two old neighbors turned and disappeared with their rifles on their shoulders for six weeks they worked with their guns on their backs never sleeping twice in the same place and saved much of their own stuff and some of their neighbors as well advertisement abner and ella darling pose for a portrait contributed photo the people of alexandria returned after company b of the 25th wisconsin regiment was sent to protect the community darling moves on and is bushwacked darling and his family stayed in alexandria until 1864 when myron offered darling a caretaker job on a farm in rolla missouri myron acquired the farm after his home burned down during the dakota war life for the darlings was peaceful for a while until september of 1864 myron received a telegram from his wife while doing business in st louis we were bushwacked last night and mr darling was killed the farm previously known as the hamilton lennox plantation sat on one thousand acres myron re named it union farm as it supplied hay and stock to the union army during the civil war according to an article from the phelps county focus the land was previously owned by hamilton lennox and his family until union soldiers seized it according to accounts in myron s book as well as in the war of the rebellion a compilation of the official records of the union and confederate armies and an article titled murder bankruptcy whiskey and revenuers myron colony s excellent adventures by lynn morrow a gang of more than 20 guerrillas ransacked the farm in the middle of the night bill and tom lennox sons of hamilton believed the farm belonged to their father and that no other family should live on the land they led a posse of confederate sympathizers to avenge their father by retaking the family farm bill ordered the darlings to leave during the ransacking but they refused and darling suffered a bullet from bill s gun he crumbled to the ground and a pool of blood left the levee of his body according to the accounts advertisement the lennox brothers and the rest of their band of bushwhacking guerillas held their guns on darling determined to make sure he died seeing some signs of life in her father his daughter tried to fetch water for him one of the guerillas held her at gunpoint preventing her from doing so but being her father s daughter she persisted they allowed her to moisten darling s lips until he took his final breath the gang emptied the house of valuables including darling s biting betty buried in an unmarked grave once word spread of the incident union soldiers were sent after bill s gang and darling was buried in an unmarked grave shortly after antoinette and the rest of her family moved back to their claim on the shores of lake darling according to brittany johnson director of the douglas county historical society darling s son abner became one of douglas county s earliest police officers johnson believes darling s descendants still live in douglas county today to this day no one knows the whereabouts of darling s gravesite or his trusty biting betty the final resting place of andreas darling may always be a mystery but it s obvious the darling family left their mark on douglas county said johnson for all his work as one of the first douglas county commissioners election judges and farmers in douglas county and with his family buried in alexandria and long prairie it s just strange to think of his final resting place being lonesome and lost somewhere in missouri multiple streets a resort and even a spa carry darling s name to this

oddly enough this week it seems to be razors hair products and pasta the empty shelves where pasta should be might be a fluke as i haven t seen anything in the national news about the great christmas pasta shortage of 21 the others make sense a few weeks ago at least for me the shortages seemed to be frozen chicken and canned cat food but i digress but not all states are experiencing the same shortages heck even different regions of one state can see lower levels of vastly different products or food items get our free mobile app get our free mobile app all reputable sources with close connections to both retailers and suppliers such as supermarketnews com progressivegrocer com grocerydive com etc all seem to point to the same basic problems and those problems aren t necessarily the same generic reasons we ve heard over and over let s start with what s in short supply as of december 2021 according to taste of home note other than pet food specifically canned cat food and frozen chicken i haven t noticed a local shortage of any of the items that make the national list liquor bottled water lunchables pet food chicken turkeys canned goods the months long scarcity of many brands of pet food or much higher prices at least stem from higher input costs the ingredients such as corn meat etc another culprit for items like this is aluminum notice that kwiky marts don t have the greatest selection of single cans these days aluminum don t fret there are still plenty of brands available for purchase at specialty stores or grocery stores however there s a decent chance your usual brand or flavor may be low or completely out for a bit photo michelle wolfe the liquor shortages i found surprising simply because i haven t experienced any issues locally but there are supply issues in many regions and it s apparently a multi faceted problem first import and shipping costs are much higher than we ve seen in many years second there seems to be trouble sourcing glass bottles jesus can t we figure out a way to make recycling glass cheaper and easier lastly some booze takes a long time to make and the powers that be are simply behind turns out that america drank quite a bit during stay at home months so next time you hit the grocery store take note but don t freak out your favorite razor blades just might be out of stock but nobody s hoarding them the cat might have to make due with friskies instead of whatever expensive foo foo brand he s used to trust me the cat will eat when they get hungry enough

the santa claus may be upon us after all markets thrive on the optimism that the wave of omicron appears to be milder the reports came out over a series of days and the upbeat sentiment was rehashed on wednesday of news of preliminary studies published in the uk and south africa early evidence suggests fewer people are needing hospital treatment than with other variants with estimates ranging from a 30 to a 70 reduction the bbc reported however the spread of the disease could overwhelm hospitals the article warns as it notes that more than 100 000 cases have been reported in the uk in a single day for the first time also cases of omicron are doubling about every two days in the past week the percentage of omicron cases in the united states rose from 13 percent to 73 percent the major question for everyone right now isn t whether omicron is going to hit their area it will said dr michael saag an infectious disease expert and associate dean for global health at the university of alabama at birmingham the question he said is how much disease will it cause the bbc wrote a deeper understanding of the severity of omicron will help countries decide how to respond to the virus the study in scotland has been tracking coronavirus and the number of people ending up in hospital it said that if omicron behaved the same as delta they would expect about 47 people to have been admitted to hospital already at the moment there are only 15 the researchers said they were seeing a roughly two thirds reduction in the number needing hospital care but there were very few cases and few at risk elderly people in the study meanwhile though much remains unknown about omicron experts say the variant could lead to long covid even with a mild case this means that patients with long term symptoms can experience crushing fatigue irregular heart rhythms and other issues months after their initial covid infection nonetheless experts continue to urge people to get vaccinated and get a booster shot to reduce the risk for severe illness markets are of the opinion that vaccinations will contain the spread and us stocks closed near session highs the s p 500 gained 1 to 4 696 56 the nasdaq composite rallied 1 2 to 15 521 89 and the dow jones industrial average gained 0 7 to 35 753 89 pfizer rose after the fda approved the covid 19 tablet for emergency use in the us
