it could be argued that of these three interconnected issues increasing the amount of housing is a top priority it will be hard to fill open jobs or expand childcare if people have nowhere affordable to live in addison county fred kenney of the addison county economic development corp said the area needs more middle income workforce housing 80 100 percent of area median income he knows the state s working on legislation to expand middle income housing still it could take years before new units are ready for habitation kenney believes more money and less regulation would go a long way in solving vermont s housing crunch some organizations such as middlebury college are tackling the shortage directly to help address the housing shortage middlebury acquired a 1 5 million property that summit properties is developing into workforce affordable and market housing in april the college announced it had purchased the 35 acre parcel the school will incrementally sell the land to summit as the property is developed summit plans to build 100 units of one to four bedroom apartments depending on the final mix of housing types the development will house between 250 and 350 people middlebury college s goal with this project is to support one of the community s greatest challenges affordable housing said david provost executive vice president for finance and administration at middlebury the college s ability to attract and retain faculty and staff is dependent on the economic development of the town of middlebury addison county and the state of vermont this provides the beginning of a solution for the college porter medical center and all businesses in the region households with incomes of approximately 50 000 to 80 000 in addison county are considered to be served by workforce housing also in the works are the firehouse apartments in bristol addison county community trust and evernorth are partnering to create 15 apartments for low and moderate income households another four apartments will be set aside as supportive housing for homeless or at risk households the new building is part of the stoney hill master development it includes a new fire station business park and mixed income housing realtor krista hoffsis with four seasons sotheby s international realty said a lot remains to be seen on the real estate side of the housing market looking at the june data coming out of four seasons sotheby s it appears the market is slowing down compared to the previous year the number of sales and the months of inventory has decreased however the median listing and sales prices increased in the same period june marked the first time since january that addison county had fewer new listings 38 compared to the month before may was 48 said hoffsis we still have an inventory challenge in the state of vermont which is that there s just not a whole lot of inventory and there s a lot of buyers she said that doesn t mean that you can t have a successful sale it just means that we have limited choices the whispers of a recession ending the pandemic seller s market hoffsis believes it is impacting people s mindsets about the market i ve had a few people come up to me over the last week and say oh it s not a seller s market anymore it s no longer a good time to sell she recalled and that s not true but even if that s what people are hearing they might be less likely to list their property right now she said the county s one month inventory indicates a solid seller s market hoffsis said there was a price drop as soon a buyer crossed from chittenden to addison county not so much anymore she attributes this to increased demand and remote work having extended people s geographical housing market she noted that the six month average for listed homes in addison county was 420 000 today s average list price in july was 480 000 the condominium market in the county has been bustling and the office is still seeing an influx of out of state buyers in her experience folks moving into vermont mainly come from the west coast searching for a less volatile environment with fewer natural disasters hoffsis said that out of state buyers have much more flexibility about where they move their goal is vermont they re just looking for that quintessential vermont house and lifestyle she said those are special properties and i think they re moving more quickly off the market in comparison in state buyers usually have more restrictions they re moving for a specific job and must be within commuting distance unfortunately many local buyers are being priced out of the market the rate of appreciation has been just bonkers she said so that really affects especially first time homebuyers in the state hoffsis states an expected rate of appreciation in a given year is five percent in 2021 the state averaged somewhere around 20 percent that rate of appreciation shouldn t continue she said still between that and the increase in interest rates a home is probably out of reach for many first time buyers one positive trend in the current market is that homes considered fixer uppers are no longer lingering on the market this trend could mean an overall improvement in vermont s housing stock if there was a silver lining in my mind and i m also really into historic homes it would be that those are now getting some tlc and once they re retrofitted those will end up being great options hoffsis said olga peters is a freelance writer from southern vermont

adjusted distributable net investment income per share stated dwayne l hyzak main street s chief executive officer these positive results included contributions from each of our core strategies and as a result of our strong performance adjusted distributable net investment income per share exceeded our regular monthly dividends by over 21 this strong performance resulted in our recommendation that

2022 and a supplemental dividend of 0 10 per share representing our fourth consecutive quarterly supplemental dividend while our net asset value per share declined in the quarter primarily as a result of the impact of increases in market interest rate spreads on our private loan and middle market debt investments we are very pleased with the continued strong performance of our lower middle market portfolio companies which resulted in another quarter of significant fair value appreciation in this portfolio and partially offset the overall decline in valuations of our debt investments we are also very pleased with the recent investment grade rating assigned to us by fitch and the support of our existing lender group that allowed us to complete the expansion and extension of our credit

anchorage alaska ap demolition is scheduled to begin this week on a once opulent downtown anchorage movie theater designed by the architect of hollywood s famed pantages theater anchorage entrepreneur austin cap lathrop opened the 4th avenue theatre with nearly 1 000 seats on may 31 1947 with a showing of the jolson story the art deco theater became the centerpiece of the downtown historic district but the last movie was shown over 40 years ago and the building has sat vacant for nearly half that time the building s current owners say bringing the building back to a usable venue after sitting vacant for more than 15 years is too costly among other problems and its use as a single screen movie theater is an outmoded business model instead building owners derrick chang and terence chang said in statement earlier this year that they will attempt to salvage the impressive artwork inside the building and the iconic 4th avenue art deco neon sign and incorporate them in a new 200 million redevelopment plan for the block that will include housing office space a hotel retail and entertainment venues the changs did not respond to messages from the associated press it is a very significant building architecturally its association with cap lathrop and as a historic icon in anchorage itself said judith bittner the state historic preservation officer i think that the interior and exterior are unique and worthy of preservation efforts over the years to save the theater weren t successful including a failed voter initiative to provide funding the realization that efforts to save the theater are over is sinking in for some who have fought to preserve the five story nearly 11 500 square foot 1 068 square meter building especially after fencing went up around the theater this week and traffic was restricted around the building i think it s a foregone conclusion that this is the end said trish neal president of the alaska association for historic preservation i think there s people grieving all over the state and beyond added sam combs a historic preservation architect it s going to destroy the historic center of our city lathrop was making a substantive statement

fifth floor wasn t added until about 1960 and it became a penthouse the building is solid with a lot of poured concrete bittner said it was built to last she said they re going to have a challenge

a new type of theater experience has emerged in rural rockingham county wmra s randi b hagi reports nestled in between mennonite farmland and thick woods there sits a charming little homestead on a recent august evening to a chorus of birdsong and crickets and cows huffing softly in the field a rehearsal was taking place on the porch katie downing i had never been very interested in romance or at least i hadn t been until i noticed the only other person who was always in the library downing we would sit across from each other not speaking this show is part of the inaugural season of the silk moth stage a venue for immersive theater experiences that break down the conventional separation between performers and audiences it s the brainchild of professional director aili huber randi b hagi aili huber center is the founder of silk moth stage aili huber i am really interested in things like what does an audience mean what does it mean when you go to a play that it matters that you re there that s what makes it different from a movie the stage came into being almost by accident huber was initially just going to replace her 50 year old deathtrap of a porch as she puts it when her son silas saw the design for the new porch and asked why it looked like a shakespeare stage with that comment the seed was planted huber i did my training at the american shakespeare center and i ve been very influenced by their approach to theater so if you go see something at the blackfriars which everyone should it s amazing you ll see that there s audience on three sides of the theater so you re looking at the stage more like a sculpture garden than a painting randi b hagi three sides of the stage are open to the audience so cast and crew must take into account that everything is being seen from multiple angles she said it s one of the illusions of modern theater that the audience sits in darkness and watches the stage as if they re looking through a window at a lit room at a shakespeare stage much like being outside in natural lighting huber part of the experience is how it changes a play when the audience can see the actor seeing them if you see a character abusing another character as an actor performing that role of an abuser there s often a moment when you look at an audience member and you have this moment of like you are seeing me doing this thing and that makes you complicit in what i m doing it can make for some really hilarious moments too like during a recent rehearsal for the one woman show every brilliant thing in the play the narrator tries to come up with a numbered list of every thing that makes life worth living against the backdrop of her mother s depression and multiple suicide attempts performer katie downing relies on the audience to read some of the lines in this case her director marybeth killian and the huber family downing it was my goal to reach 1 000 so that meant that i wasn t allowed to cheat a no repetition b things have to be genuinely wonderful and life affirming and c not too many material items uh 761 randi b hagi downing left drafts petra huber from the audience to play one of the side characters marybeth killian deciding you re not too old to climb trees downing 823 here nine year old petra had the line skinny dipping killian oh oh we ll explain that later petra skinny dipping whatever that is downing originally planned to perform every brilliant thing for her capstone project at bridgewater college in 2020 downing i ve always loved theater that sort of challenges the boundaries of what theater is and this is a show that is created by the community that is seeing it during quarantine while the performance was put on hold she and killian started their own list of brilliant things randi b hagi marybeth killian directing every brilliant thing killian i think my favorite and it s just because it holds such a near and dear part of my life is chaco tan lines performances are scheduled for august 6 7 12 and 13 on the seventh members of the bridgewater class of 2020 get a discount too huber we re inviting people to come early you can come about an hour before the performance if you want we re inviting people to picnic you can also order a dinner from the cafe sugar bean ahead of time and it ll be at the homestead when you arrive the food and fellowship aspects of silk moth are another callback to an earlier time huber gave me a quick lesson in pre world war ii theater customs huber you would go to a play maybe early you would see who s here who they re with and as we work backward we know that shakespeare s plays were taking place in the middle of a city where people knew each other and you d go to the theater and you d go to hear the play but you also would go to sit with your friend you d go to get information about tulip futures because that was the beginning of the stock market you d go buy some oranges you d hook up with somebody afterwards weather permitting huber plans to light a campfire so people can sit and chat with one another and the performers after every brilliant thing a september run of give us good will round out the 2022 season for tickets

the u s waited to order preparation of bulk stocks of monkeypox vaccine here s why share copy link copy and we are going to do everything that we can to end this outbreak that is our commitment uh and that s what we re going to make sure that we do that so as you all know the monkey pox outbreak has evolved rapidly and uniquely from prior outbreaks so we are in different it s different dynamic than it was the last couple of times because monkeypox has been here in this country before and so we have aggressively responded at different stages of this outbreak and so just wanted to give you little bit of that context because it s spreading at different phases here so first within two days of the first confirmed case of monkey pox in the us we began deploying vaccine to states and jurisdictions and prepositioning tens of thousands of additional doses in the strategic national stockpile the initial science lead us to believe this i think will answer your question little bit based on recent past monkey monkey pox outbreaks that those doses would be sufficient to meet the needs of the country as what we knew at that time because it s dynamic it s changing and so but however infectious diseases are dynamic as i just said and unpredictable uh inherently unpredictable which is why as soon as we saw that this outbreak was different and transmitting much more rapidly we quickly moved to order tens of thousands of more doses so just to give you little bit of the numbers that we have we have made more than 1 1 million doses available and shipped more than 600 000 doses those are currently out there going into jurisdictions to states and so and with more being delivered each day we also have ordered 5 5 million additional doses which are helping us get more doses out sooner knowing that more are on the way so this is this is just part of the process and what we have been following the science and making sure that we are you know we are rapidly reacting to this and that s what we ve been doing this is currently mismatch between the number of doses that the government has in bulk the number of doses that have been bottled and sent out to state local authorities and then the number of doses that are actually needed does the president feel like his administration has acted with enough urgency i mean what what we re saying to you is that i laid out how dynamic and how rapidly changing this virus has been uh and i m and also you know we we just had they just held hhs just held press conference and talked about this that s why we kind of moved the briefing so you all can have sense to hear what to hear directly from them there was 600 000 that they talked about they went from testing capacity from 6000 to 80 000 week that matters as we re trying to make sure we deal with monkeypox and we re working hand in hand with local authorities to get the resources they need and so and as you also know we took they took an additional step which is to announce public health emergency declared declaration of monkeypox and that s important because what that s gonna do it s gonna help accelerate the vaccine production and distribution this includes new dozing strategies that have the potential to increase the number of available doses by five fold so yes the president has confident in hhs and and let s not forget we just brought on the monkey pox uh coordinate coordinators the response team which is going to also make difference get national breaking news alerts the latest breaking updates delivered straight to your email inbox your email address submit privacy notice
canada s main stock index nudged slightly higher thursday as investors took a wait and see approach in advance of highly anticipated new employment data coming friday kevin headland co chief investment strategist at manulife investment management described it as a sideways market day as all of north america s major stock indexes bounced between slightly negative and slightly positive territory on light volumes throughout the trading session ultimately the s p tsx composite index closed up 31 10 points at 19 577 04 while in new york the dow jones industrial average closed down 85 68 points at 32 726 82 the s p 500 index closed down 3 23 points at 4 151 94 while the nasdaq composite closed up 52 42 points at 12 720 58 august is typically a slow month anyway headland said basically everyone is waiting for tomorrow with august featuring fewer economic data releases than a typical month and no central bank meetings until september investors will be looking to friday s jobs reports in both canada and the u s to help inform their decision making the headline number and the unemployment rate as well as data about hourly wages are expected to provide important insights about the economy and how far central banks may be willing to go in their efforts to curb inflation headland said if the jobs reports show a slowing of the north american labour market that could be a sign to central bankers that it s time to ease off the gas when it comes to future interest rate hikes that in turn would be a positive for stock markets i think right now we are at a point where bad news tends to be good news headland said weak payroll data could be a positive corporate earnings continued to be a focus for investors this week with major companies like canadian fertilizer giant nutrien ltd oilsands producer canadian natural resources ltd and tim hortons owner restaurant brands international reporting thursday in the u s clorox co and hostess brands inc were among the big names reporting earnings on the day headland said so far this earnings season companies are doing better than expected that s helping to bolster the market even though many investors also have an eye on the sliding price of oil particularly in canada where energy firms have a heavy presence on the tsx on thursday the september crude contract was down us 2 12 at us 88 54 per barrel marking the first time since the russian invasion of ukraine in february that the benchmark west texas intermediate price has fallen below us 90 but headland said slumping oil prices in recent weeks have less to do with the end of the invasion premium and more to do with a reduction in demand after months of sky high energy prices i think a lot of it is we re starting to see some demand destruction as a result of the economic weakness headland said the risk that we were going to see material supply demand imbalances driving prices higher seems to be abating right now the s p tsx capped energy index was down 4 47 per cent on thursday with every single company on the index in the red at the end of the session however headland said it s unlikely oil prices will fall much more as years of limited investment in the energy sector have resulted in a lack of new production growth that is going to mean continued supply constraints going forward in the mid term we may be seeing some demand destruction but i don t think that s a long term structural weakness he said the september natural gas contract was down 14 cents at us 8 12 on thursday the december gold contract was up us 30 50 at us 1 806 90 an ounce and the september copper contract was up 1 5 cents at us 3 48 a pound the canadian dollar was unchanged at 77 80 cents us this report by the canadian press was first published aug 4 2022
efforts fail to save historic alaska theater from demolition original publication date august 04 2022 3 11 pm anchorage alaska ap demolition is scheduled to begin this week on a once opulent downtown anchorage movie theater designed by the architect of hollywood s famed pantages theater anchorage entrepreneur austin cap lathrop opened the 4th avenue theatre with nearly 1 000 seats on may 31 1947 with a showing of the jolson story the art deco theater became the centerpiece of the downtown historic district but the last movie was shown over 40 years ago and the building has sat vacant for nearly half that time the building s current owners say bringing the building back to a usable venue after sitting vacant for more than 15 years is too costly among other problems and its use as a single screen movie theater is an outmoded business model instead building owners derrick chang and terence chang said in statement earlier this year that they will attempt to salvage the impressive artwork inside the building and the iconic 4th avenue art deco neon sign and incorporate them in a new 200 million redevelopment plan for the block that will include housing office space a hotel retail and entertainment venues the changs did not respond to messages from the associated press it is a very significant building architecturally its association with cap lathrop and as a historic icon in anchorage itself said judith bittner the state historic preservation officer i think that the interior and exterior are unique and worthy of preservation efforts over the years to save the theater weren t successful including a failed voter initiative to provide funding the realization that efforts to save the theater are over is sinking in for some who have fought to preserve the five story nearly 11 500 square foot 1 068 square meter building especially after fencing went up around the theater this week and traffic was restricted around the building i think it s a foregone conclusion that this is the end said trish neal president of the alaska association for historic preservation i think there s people grieving all over the state and beyond added sam combs a historic preservation architect it s going to destroy the historic center of our city lathrop was making a substantive statement by beginning construction on the theater in 1941 two years after the u s census

avenue theatre website twinkling lights illuminated the big dipper and north star constellations on the ceiling the theater was lacking one major detail however lathrop thought concession stands were unseemly and didn t include one forcing kids to visit the woolworth s at the end of the block to stock up on candy before hitting the movie the building was more than just a movie theater lathrop s tv and radio stations had their studios there plus there was room for offices and an attic on the fourth floor the fifth floor wasn t added until about 1960 and it became a penthouse the building is solid with a lot of poured concrete bittner said it was built to last she said they re going to have a challenge taking down some of that concrete that solid base could be one reason the theater

at thursday s meeting of the castro merchants association the first following its july recess members had the chance to speak with district attorney brooke jenkins who laid out ideas to help the neighborhood s business owners tackle the ongoing issues of petty theft vandalism and the presence of unhoused and often mentally ill individuals who have gravitated to the district over the past couple of years just before jenkins began speaking to the group meeting via zoom former district attorney chesa boudin who was routed in a recall election in june announced on twitter that he would not seek reelection to the office to which jenkins was appointed by mayor london breed in july jenkins will be on the ballot in november to complete boudin s term in media interviews before he left office including with the bay area reporter boudin had not ruled out seeking his old job i ve also taken stock of the burden that more than three years of nearly non stop campaigning placed on my family boudin wrote on twitter around 10 a m i m committed to criminal justice reform i m also committed to my family i am choosing to put my family first i will not be running for office in 2022 thread on the 2022 special district attorney election chesa boudin chesaboudin august 4 2022 jenkins who told the b a r that boudin s decision would have no impact on her own campaign for the office declined to comment at the merchants meeting however jenkins had plenty to say including ideas for making the da s office more responsive to neighborhood needs among them plans to re institute the formation of community affinity groups as well as the implementation of community prosecutors this was jenkins first appearance before the merchants group and her second visit in the community even if only virtually since she did a walk through in the castro a few weeks ago with gay district 8 supervisor rafael mandelman she promised cma members she planned to show up regularly in the neighborhood jenkins was warmly received by cma members who peppered her with questions about the district s ongoing problems with unhoused individuals who like to hang out particularly in front of walgreens at the corner of 18th and castro streets locals have taken to referring to the corner as the morgue dave karraker cma co president told attendees there it s not unusual to find people passed out or camped out begging for change from passersby jenkins assured cma members she was aware of their concerns i know that you all have been very vocal with the supervisor and he s been very vocal with me she told merchants he s the one supervisor who has brought her to his district and sat her down and addressed specific concerns she said i was able to gather a lot of information on the merchant walk i want you to know first and foremost i am committed to finding solutions she said her vision for community prosecutors is similar to a program put in place by her predecessor she said consisting of community liaisons with the department s assistant da s volunteering to fill those positions i know there s one for the tenderloin and the bayview she said in an interview with the b a r following the meeting it s been however more of an informal program the assistant da s attend monthly neighborhood meetings which would occasionally include representatives from the san francisco police department as the b a r previously reported district 8 which includes the castro had two different liaisons from the da s office during boudin s tenure jenkins idea still in the formative stages would take a more formal approach and would see a prosecutor assigned possibly part time to the various precinct police stations around the city where they would then cover the various neighborhoods served by that station jenkins said the program could take effect relatively quickly very soon jenkins said over the course of the next six weeks is what i m looking at the community affinity groups a program instituted under former district attorney george gascón who served as san francisco s da from 2011 to 2019 before being elected to the same position in los angeles in 2020 represented many of the city s various communities there were groups representing african americans and latinos as well as asian american and pacific islanders and the lgbtq community jenkins said she has heard a number of communities express interest in the affinity groups since she became da we used to have monthly meetings where members would sit down and have an agenda to discuss particular topics and questions they wanted to address she said the da would often attend these meetings as well she added they were sort of representing the voice of the overall community to the district attorney s office and we could work together said jenkins it could be a little while before these groups are organized however with things still rapidly changing in the da s office it s a matter of prioritizing what needs to be

tesla held its annual shareholder meeting which the company now refers to as its cyber roundup thursday at the tesla gigafactory texas the cyber roundup comes just a couple of weeks after tesla reported its q2 earnings which showed quarterly revenue declines caused by production challenges even as the company grew year over year the agenda had 13 shareholder proposals including one for a three for one stock split that appears to have helped push tesla s shares up 0 40 advertisement advertisement there were also several proposals geared toward getting tesla to be more ethically responsible particularly after a series of lawsuits that have accused the company of sexual racial and gender harassment in the workplace here are the five key takeaways from the event share split approved tesla shareholders approved the three for one stock split which will bring the company s shares down to the 300 range it s not clear when that will take effect though tesla ever savvy in how it uses twitter to affect its stock price initially tweeted out the news of the shareholder proposal on march 28 between then and now tesla s stock saw a 20 rally from june lows when the drama of musk s proposed twitter buy was at its peak shares rose thursday in after hours trading to 928 55 ethical improvements unlikely to pass shareholders have called for better reporting and transparency on reporting sexual racial and gender harassment as well as on tesla s lobbying activities and usage of child labor to mine for battery materials they have also asked for more diversity on the board to reflect tesla s workforce while the votes are not yet in preliminary results suggest tesla shareholders have voted against all such proposals irl trolling the 2022 shareholder meeting the first one in a couple of years at which hundreds of people were able to gather in person took on a boisterous tone from the outset investors in attendance shouted out encouragement and questions to musk they also took their roles as tesla boosters to a new level at one point the crowd laughed at laura campos director of corporate and political accountability at the nathan cummings foundation as she spoke about her proposal to improve tesla s lobbying disclosures and applauded tesla s investor relations head martin viecha when he cut her off as her time expired sister dorothy of sisters of the good shepherd was treated with similar derision the audience laughed and applauded when she ran out of time as she asked the company to improve its reporting on child labor in its cobalt supply chain story continues musk welcomed the cheers applause and standing ovation playing up to his biggest supporters retail investors he worked the crowd as he usually does telling the audience that he loved them and they were the best crowd exclaiming statements of grandeur and cracking jokes about his failed twitter buy more gigafactories musk teased the idea for another gigafactory location to be chosen later this year he also noted that tesla will probably build at least 10 or 12 gigafactories back in 2017 musk said that in the long term the company would build between 10 and 20 gigafactories advertisement advertisement demand continues to be high for teslas so it s no wonder musk wants to expand the automaker s factory footprint in the last few weeks tesla made its 3 millionth car said musk reaffirming the company s goal to hit a 2 million car run rate by the end of 2022 other takeaways musk reiterated his intention to rapidly grow tesla s advanced driver assistance system full self driving fsd beta we re now at over 40 million miles and i suspect by this year we re gonna have well over 100 million miles said musk and we re still tracking very much to have widespread deployment of fsd beta this year in north america musk also promised some cool stuff on the supercharger front as tesla prepares to begin allowing non tesla evs to use its charging network in addition musk hinted that the cybertruck specs and price will be different from what was first announced back in 2019 due to inflation but didn t provide any further specifics

twitter counters that musk has not pleaded a shred of evidence for these fact free allegations twitter inc on thursday dismissed elon musk s claims in a delaware court filing that he was hoodwinked into signing the deal to buy the social media company saying that it was implausible and contrary to fact musk made the claims in a countersuit filed under seal last friday which was made public on thursday according to musk he the billionaire founder of multiple companies advised by wall street bankers and lawyers was hoodwinked by twitter into signing a 44 billion merger agreement that story is as implausible and contrary to fact as it sounds the filing released by twitter on thursday said twitter s filing is the latest salvo in what is building up to be an increasingly acrimonious legal showdown between the world s richest person and the social media giant the two sides head to trial on oct 17 after musk sought to abandon his deal to acquire twitter over what he says is a misrepresentation of fake accounts on the site the san francisco based company is trying to force musk to follow through on the deal and accuses him of sabotaging it because it no longer served his interests a representative for musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment in the counterclaims made public thursday musk accuses twitter of stepping up efforts to conceal the true number of its users as the market plummeted as a long bull market was coming to a close and the tide was going out twitter knew that providing the musk parties the information they were requesting would reveal that twitter had been swimming naked the counterclaims say twitter counters that musk has not pleaded a shred of evidence for these fact free allegations fact free allegations musk also claims that twitter s misrepresentations run far deeper than simply providing incorrect numbers about its spam or false accounts while twitter touts having 238 million monetizable daily active users those users who actually see ads is roughly 65 million lower musk says in the counterclaims twitter maintains that its sec disclosures about monetizable daily active users were accurate musk the chief executive of electric car company tesla inc offered to buy twitter for 54 20 per share in april saying he believed in its potential as a global platform for free speech but he soured on twitter as its stock price lagged his takeover bid and began expressing skepticism that bot and spam accounts represented less than 5 of users musk sought to back out on july 8 without paying a 1 billion breakup fee citing twitter s failure to provide details on bot and spam accounts twitter sued him four days later earlier this week twitter issued dozens of subpoenas to banks investors and law firms that backed musk s takeover bid while musk issued subpoenas to twitter s advisers at goldman sachs and jp morgan over their work legal experts have said twitter s requests suggested the company wanted to know why musk turned against it or whether he reneged on his obligation to obtain sufficient financing except for the headline this story has not been edited by ndtv staff and is published from a syndicated feed

for all the worries about a possible recession and consumers struggling under the weight of inflation at the highest level since january 1983 it s not showing up in the numbers at bce inc the company s chief executive said thursday the consumer behaviour has been really strong said mirko bibic who is also bce s president in an interview customers are buying you know 5g handsets they re subscribing they re connecting to 5g networks 5g customers use their phones and data you know basically twice as much and they spend about 20 per cent more so we re kind of seeing healthy growth on 5g and on the internet side actually customers are subscribing to the higher speed plans so what we re seeing so far is quite healthy and we re not seeing any pressure on our receivables so the payments are strong as well it s a different portrait of consumer habits than what one of bce s large american peers recently presented last month at t inc chief executive john stankey said some customers are taking longer to pay their bills and told analysts on a conference call that a portion of the company s customer base is having to adjust spending patterns and behaviours and prioritization of how they pay their bills while stressing the trend isn t alarming nonetheless the comments about consumer habits fed into concerns that pushed at t s stock price down almost eight per cent that day and while bce said thursday its second quarter wireless product revenue dipped 0 9 per cent to 543 million because of fewer upgrades bibic said that s no surprise given the investments customers make in their handsets those are pretty powerful computers that you have in the palm of your hand and they can be you know fairly expensive and they re higher quality so consumers are paying for these devices they re lasting longer consumers are holding on to them longer so there s less of a need to switch devices every couple of years he said the company s wireless business saw a near doubling in subscriber growth during the second quarter as it added a net 83 197 postpaid customers compared to 44 433 a year earlier bce also said its churn of postpaid wireless users improved to an all time low of 0 75 per cent by comparison rogers communications inc last week said it added a net 122 000 postpaid wireless subscribers in the second quarter doubling year ago growth and its postpaid subscriber churn fell to 0 68 per cent from 0 76 per in the second quarter of 2021 churn which measures turnover and where a lower number is better could end up in the spotlight for the telecom industry in the coming quarters in the aftermath of rogers communications inc s network outage last month and bibic indicated he sees an opportunity for growth another kind of tailwind for us we think in q3 will be some of the switching behaviours as a result of our competitor s outage in early july he said he pointed out however that rogers network failure was no cause for celebration amongst its rivals where there s a culture of collaboration when one carrier s services break down it was a very unfortunate incident that no one ever wants to see and we always reach out to help when that happens to one of our competitors and i can say you know when we ve had issues in the past you know smaller in nature but when we ve had issues in the past could be something like a fibre cut that affects a particular region our competitors are quick to reach out to help us as well bce reaffirmed its full year financial forecasts thursday after its second quarter profit rose about five per cent the telecommunications giant said its adjusted net profit rallied 5 3 per cent year over year in the second quarter to 791 million on a per share basis it earned 0 87 analysts on average were expecting 0 84 in per share profit its adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda also edged past the average estimate at 2 59 billion bce s wireline business contributed the most to the company s overall revenue even as the haul from that unit slipped 0 3 per cent year over year to 2 99 billion while supply chain problems held back product sales to enterprise customers retail internet subscriber growth surged 27 9 per cent year over year the most robust growth during the second quarter was in bce s media division where revenue rose 8 7 per cent year over year to 821 million the company attributed that to ad growth the return of the f1 grand prix to montreal and subscriber gains in its crave streaming business however the return of that f1 race also contributed to a slight deterioration in the media unit s margins bce reported second quarter results that were generally better than expectations similar to rogers the company saw a strong print on wireless post net adds and very low churn overall wireless and media were a bright spot while wireline was steady wrote scotia capital markets analyst maher yaghi in a note to clients he cautioned however that weakness could be felt in bce s media division in the second half of this year due to the economic slowdown bnn bloomberg is a division of bell media which is owned by bce

type multi family residential completed 2018 80 000 sf 280 st marks avenue is an 80 000 square foot multi family building with 32 residences the street front townhouses update the classic brooklyn townhouse for a multi family context they feature private front yards with entrances that open directly onto the sidewalk inside the plan preserves the traditional arrangement of lower floors with the living room and kitchen and upper floors with bedrooms the penthouses have floor to ceiling windows and sliding doors that open onto private terraces looking out over the leafy green spaces of the neighborhood and to the manhattan skyline beyond at the center of the building is over 5 000 square feet of communal space featuring a front lobby and a double height residents lounge with communal table and pantry kitchen the oversized windows and doors open directly onto the landscaped 2 945 square foot backyard garden designed by patrick cullina additional amenities include a fitness room bike room common roof deck with grill and underground parking located in the heart of prospect heights one of brooklyn s most vibrant and historic neighborhoods 280 st marks avenue is at once thoroughly contextual and distinct from its neighbors the neighborhood features largely historic brownstones in popular demand with those who move from manhattan to brooklyn in search of more space and access to a backyard it is always a challenge to strike the right balance when designing a new building in an area with a strong architectural identity we believe our contemporary architecture should relate to its surroundings working to understand the distinct characteristics of the existing fabric and translating it into a thoughtful addition to the street the cadence of the typical brooklyn brownstone street is one of the most recognizable urban fabrics in new york city the even widths of brownstone facades set up a regular rhythm of front steps and yards while their differing heights play a secondary melody the variety of neoclassical details stoops plantings and colors adds a picturesque dynamism we synthesized these attributes by designing the facade around the 25 foot lot width of neighboring brownstones breaking up the mass of the multi family building and providing on street entrances to the ground floor duplexes while designed to be contextually sensitive 280 st marks avenue also purposefully differentiates itself from its neighbors in some ways in a neighborhood of deep reddish brown brownstones 280 st marks avenue is a striking white petersen brick building that spans what would otherwise be six individual townhouses this is not an instigation but rather an invitation to test how design can be used to respond and relate to a consistent building stock the building therefore presents multiple approaches to contextuality

is learnt to have taken the stance that amazon was a shareholder when cci initially ordered a probe in 2020 and thus cloudtail and amazon were linked cloudtail india used to be a preferred seller on amazon and at its peak in 2021 accounted for nearly 40 of the total sales on amazon s india platform however following regulatory action from the cci the ecommerce giant discontinued the joint venture

farmland prices in nebraska have hit record levels this year increasing by some estimates more than 30 from the first half of 2021 the university of nebraska lincoln s nebraska farm real estate report found that overall farm prices in the state rose 16 this year to an all time record of 3 360 an acre but that report is conservative especially when the prices are examined regionally united farm range management says prices are up 20 to 25 in central and southeast nebraska where the most productive cropland is located the federal reserve bank of kansas city estimated that nebraska s fourth quarter land prices were up 31 for non irrigated cropland 21 for irrigated land and 23 for ranchland compared with a year ago and the omaha based farmers national company reports that the average price paid for nebraska farmland in the first half of 2022 was 11 500 a jump of more than 30 from 2021 the nebraska gains are the biggest of any of the 18 grain belt states in which farmers national operates all of which saw jumps in prices the increased demand for farmland and the corresponding price jump is being driven by higher crop prices economic instability investor interest and until recently historically low interest rates investors and those concerned about an economic downturn see farmland as a stable investment usda data shows that since 1970 farmland has averaged a 5 7 annual return that will be less volatile than say the stock market that stability is fortified by the strong prices for the crops produced in the state which are expected to remain at least at today s levels even in a recessionary economy while they can be celebrated as a sign of a robust stable agricultural economy the rising farmland prices will as re evaluations of property are done by counties exacerbate the state s property tax crisis the increased prices will lead to higher valuation for nearby land which will increase the taxes collected on that property that go to pay for public education and local government the increasing valuations will trigger calls for school districts and local governments to reduce their levies and in the legislature for even more property tax relief created by diverting state funds collected from income and sales taxes back to property owners the only lasting solution to that rising land price dilemma however would require a change in the way nebraska values agricultural property shifting from price based valuation which will continue to increase sometimes at very high rates to a production based model like that used in iowa a production based system operates on the estimated income that a parcel of land could create and would still respond to the economy as increasing commodity prices would be reflected in the valuation calculations but valuation increases would be more moderate than the market based jumps and would thereby hold down property taxes charged to that land that makes it a change that would benefit nebraska s property owners especially small farmers for decades to come
