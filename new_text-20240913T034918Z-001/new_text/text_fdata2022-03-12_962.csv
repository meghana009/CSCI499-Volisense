herlinger ukrainians already constitute the largest non polish minority in poland so many ukrainians have relatives in poland whom they now call on in the belief that they can soon return home or what is left of it bruinen said in an email there are also the present geopolitical realities countries west of russia are solidarizing with each other against putin out of fear that it will soon be their turn she said finally religious ties link the two countries while poles are roman catholic and most ukrainians are orthodox christians there is a significant minority of ukrainian catholics who worship with a byzantine liturgy similar to that of the orthodox but are loyal to the pope an associated press story noted about religion s role in the russian ukrainian conflict given that christianity unites the people of poland and ukraine bruinen said relations between poles and ukrainians though have not been free of some tensions

by benedict gardner elif karakaya and mary atkinson kearvaig bothy scotland by benedict gardner if you want an escape from the ordinary you do not need to go far away some places close to home are hard enough to reach kearvaig bothy is a place where you have the time far away from life to do nothing if you want an escape from the ordinary you do not need to go far away first catch the train to inverness after 4 hours the rails end but the road continues the number 805 bus in reality more of a minivan runs once a day three times a week to durness post office here is the last town and the last pub and the last hotel to be seen before you cross the water be sure to stock up on food and wood as fuel is scarce where you are going and there is no shop bring plenty of beans and coffee and a gas stove and wool jumpers will be your friends if there was ever an ominous sounding journey it is the ferry across the kyle of durness to cape wrath luckily stu the ferryman is no charon and at least here there is the option of a return ticket most people if there are any others with you will be headed to the minibus and the lighthouse beyond whilst i would recommend a visit you should continue on your journey for there is still a two hour walk to your destination kearvaig bothy bothies are small walkers huts spread over some of britain s most secluded and beautiful places they are free to use you just turn up and open the door though they are not to be abused they are mostly converted shepherd s huts but as their original purpose and construction varies the bothies also have their own individual character kearvaig is exceptional for its location as well as its interior it is owned by the mod which means that as bothies go this is one of the more comfortable they demand only the best for their live ammunition practice oak panelling and real wood floors are some of the luxuries you will experience here as well as a wood fired stove to keep warm by at night bothies are small walkers huts spread over some of britain s most secluded and beautiful places however the real treasure of this place lies not on the inside but without set right on the beach it is so close to the sea that you might be afraid the waves will reach the walls the bay and the valley formed by its heads were the last first or last safe mooring for visiting vikings and with the land rising up all around the house this does feel like a safe place the last to be found in britain besides nothing dangerous would bother to make the journey the land is desolate and barren and so your focus is directed towards the sea on a clear day you can see the orkneys and closer than that dolphins leap out of the waves go and see the lighthouse go for a swim read a book at night the stars are bright and at dawn the sunrise is brighter but the fire inside is brightest instanbul turkey by elif karakaya widely sought after as a summer vacation turkey is often overlooked as an option for an easter escape yet the country has an expansive regional variety although it is a wonder to visit at any time of year it is especially a privilege to visit istanbul in the springtime it is especially a privilege to visit istanbul in the springtime in this season istanbul annually hosts a tulip festival celebrating the country s love for the tulip flower across an entire month with the official dates for the festival being from 1st to the 30th of april originating in the central asian mountain ranges the tulip was first brought over and cultivated under the ottoman empire before being brought over to the netherlands it seemed to hold a spellbinding quality captivating whoever made contact with it forming not only a traditional symbol of turkey in relation to arts and religion but mania if in one s possession for it seemed consuming it visually would not satiate the desire in the netherlands a single tulip bulb would be sold for between 40 000 to 80 000 the price of a house in amsterdam the world was enraptured by this flower that seemed to have a life of its own a certain vitality perhaps due to its individuality for even bulbs that grew a single colour one year would grow multicoloured the next as though controlled by its own command this festival has a long history in turkey yet was reintroduced by the government in 2006 where millions of tulips were planted every year reaching 30 million in 2016 half a million tulips are planted in sultan ahmet square alone to make a flower carpet in front of the blue mosque and the hagia sophia museum making this a must see spot half a million tulips are planted in sultan ahmet square alone to make a flower carpet similarly emirgan park is another site which holds a great number of tulips within it for it is one of the largest parks in istanbul hosting multiple tulip gardens within these locations are significant for not only are they great tourist attractions but incredibly culturally significant historical sites highlighting the importance of this relationship between tulips and turkish culture however you are bound to spot a tulip even if you do not visit these sights for any open ground is an invitation to partake in the festival other flowers are planted in this period too in order to contrast the colours and shapes of the tulips creating an enchanting vision it serves as a union between culture and nature demonstrating the artistry both in the floral arrangements as well as the artistic symbol of the tulip itself the tulip period of 1718 to1730 is an example of this for it was an era of peace and enjoyment in the ottoman empire as well as the artistic bloom that came around due to this source of great inspiration yet it was not limited to the artist for it is even adorned by the religious used commonly in the decorations of mosques praised for its relationship between allah and the sky it is planted anywhere on open ground a single simple request for survival and yet when in bloom the tulip too bows its head before god a symbol uniting the entirety of turkey milan italy by mary atkinson italy being perhaps one of the countries most visited during the summer season is admittedly bursting with tourists from afar locations hoping to soak up the italian sunshine however the same cannot be said for the winter and spring months upon my visit to milan during early spring it was nothing like your jam packed holiday destination with the streets being admired by a handful of american and canadian gap year students european citizens and italian school trips it was astonishingly quiet but with less people a more authentic experience awaited me making italy the perfect spot for a mid summative season break the country has endless locations to visit from milan to rome to venice to the more underrated locations such as siena bologna turin and more the possibilities are endless with large cities such as milan where they can act as base locations for those wanting to take day trips across the country to other locations such as lake como bergamo turin verona or perhaps even florence or bologna if you are willing to travel two hours with the high speed frecciarossa and italo trains alternatively for those looking at visiting the south naples is a great base location with pompei amalfi sorrento and many more beautiful locations to satisfy your italian dreams the possibilities are endless with large cities such as milan each city has its own rich cultural identity which makes italy the perfect place to engage your brain and explore its history for milan fashion bologna education with the oldest university in europe naples the birthplace of the best food to grace this earth pizza duomo di milano italy truly has whatever you could be looking for although the temperature may not be as hot as you d expect in the north with skiing even an option still at this time of year it still provides a sunny escape from the reality of the british weather and rather stressful university life with an overwhelming chilled atmosphere even in the some of biggest cities it can truly help you unwind and mentally reset after a busy term with famous cuisine

the united states and nato are shipping weapons into ukraine at break neck speed including highly sensitive items such as shoulder fired missiles called man portable air defense systems manpads that can take down aircraft the western arms deliveries another one of which is expected to arrive in the coming hours have been vital to enabling ukrainians to fight the invading russian forces far more effectively and fiercely than us intelligence expected but moving those amounts of weaponry into the largest conflict in europe since world war two carries with it risks that some could fall into the wrong hands a possibility the west has considered risk worth taking frankly we believe that risk is worth taking right now because the ukrainians are fighting so skillfully with the tools at their disposal and they re using them so creatively a senior us defense official said on friday when asked about that danger advertisement highly portable missiles such as stinger surface to air missiles which are a type of manpad can help win wars but in the past they have also been lost sold or wound up in the arsenals of extremist groups for example hundreds of stingers supplied by the united states were seen as key to helping mujahideen rebels drive soviet forces out of afghanistan in a conflict that spanned the 1980s and 1990s but the united states subsequently spent years trying to recover unused manpads from that country and from other conflict zones around the world in a pentagon financed study in 2019 the rand corp think tank estimated that upwards of 60 civilian aircraft have been hit by manpads since the 1970s killing more than 1 000 civilians as of 2019 57 non state armed groups were confirmed to possess or suspected to possess manpads russia was far and away the single largest exporter of manpads rand corp said with more than 10 000 systems sold between 2010 and 2018 to countries including iraq venezuela kazakhstan qatar and libya advertisement the united states and nato have not disclosed how many manpads have been transferred to ukraine since the start of the invasion which is now in its third week so far russia has not targeted western weapons convoys headed into ukraine and the senior us defense official said the united states had not seen any western supplied inventory falling into russian hands but that could change at a friday meeting of russia s security council defense minister sergei shoigu talked about potential future seizures of western made javelin anti tank weapons and stingers they should be handed to russian backed forces in the breakaway donbass region of eastern ukraine he said russian president vladimir putin publicly backed the idea as to the delivery of arms especially western made ones which have fallen into the hands of the russian army of course i support the possibility of giving these to the military units of the lugansk and donetsk people s republics putin said please do this putin told shoigu special team the pentagon is turning to a special team to respond to increased demand for new weapons sales and requests to transfer existing weapons among us allies as countries including ukraine scramble to obtain arms following russia s invasion three people familiar with the effort said the pentagon s office of acquisition and sustainment the weapons buyer for the us department of defense has been fielding increased demand from european allies hoping to ship weapons to ukraine through third party transfers or to buy arms to bolster their own defenses the sources said the rapid response team was revived in recent days to coordinate and cut through the bureaucracy around sales and transfers while prioritizing requests from allies the sources said the previously unreported effort comes as the pentagon works to respond to a rapidly changing landscape for arms deals and transfers the pentagon made use of the rapid response team during the trump administration as part of department of defense s ongoing supply chain resilience efforts the department is evaluating industrial base capacity to produce items critical to our national security and that of our allies and partners this effort is focused on identifying key supply chain constraints and mitigation actions to improve capacity a defense official said the pentagon headquarters of the us department of defense taken september 2018 credit wikimedia commons the operation is being run in cooperation with the us defense security cooperation agency which oversees weapons sales and transfers to other countries for the department of defense according to an email seen by reuters dsca recently asked the defense industry for devices that can be used to disable or shoot down drones that were either in stock or could be ready for delivery in 120 days in light of the ongoing crisis in europe the usg us government continues its efforts to identify effective solutions which would assist ukraine in the ongoing situation one of our focus areas is c suas the message said counter small unmanned aerial systems c suas technology is used to defeat drones counter drone devices come in a variety of sizes prices and formats including the portable radar gun like dronekiller made by ixi electronic warfare and the dronebuster from radio hill technologies that can cost in the tens of thousands of dollars each there are also larger versions of the technology including one that could shield an area the size of a stadium made by src inc the larger systems can cost in the 3 million to 6 million range industry executives have said the pentagon has stressed that smaller systems such as javelin anti tank systems and stinger anti aircraft missiles which allies are shipping to ukraine via truck near daily are most useful we believe the best way to support ukrainian defense is by providing them the weapons and the systems they need most to defeat russian aggression in particular anti armor and air defense pentagon spokesman john kirby has said in some cases allies are trying to leverage the ukraine situation to press for things they wanted even before the conflict one us official said on condition of anonymity adding that supply chains are still stressed from the pandemic so there was uncertainty about how this demand could be immediately met countries in europe and across the globe are looking at expanding defense budgets to meet an increasingly uncertain security outlook with germany among those promising a sharp increase in spending

they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and walmart wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of 2 14 21 this video was recorded on march 8 2022 chris hill after the worst day for the stock market in a year and a half we re taking a step back so we can share a few lessons we ve learned over the past 20 years and possibly air a bit of dirty laundry motley fool money starts now i m chris hill thanks for listening today s not going to be the usual tuesday episode allison southwick and robert brokamp have the week off because today march 8 is the 20th anniversary of stock advisor our flagship investing service at the motley fool was launched on this day in 2002 so we wanted to look back at some of the important things we ve learned from 20 years of investing successes as well as mistakes yes there have been investing mistakes i know subscription services are all the rave now for movies tv digital news and more but as someone who was working at the motley fool back in 2002 please believe me when i tell you the launch of stock advisor was a watershed moment for the company the idea that we would produce monthly stock research and recommendations and sell that research for an annual subscription of 99 was at the time pretty radical and hotly debated within company walls someone else who is there from the start is andy cross now the chief investment officer at the motley fool he s been involved in helping to expand the service from its origins to include more features to respond to our growing member base the stock advisor starts as a monthly newsletter members get two recommendations one from tom gardner one from david gardner over the years that scorecard starts to pile up with all of those recommendations and one of the big innovations in the service is i want to say it was 10 years in we added the feature called best buys now which is a way of helping members make sense of all of these recommendations to me best buys now is a great example of the idea that we talked about and it s not the sexiest idea in the world but it can be lucrative for investors the idea that sometimes the best place for new money is the stock you already own andy cross chris peter lynch said it himself that sometimes the best stock to buy is the one that s already sitting in your portfolio and as stock advisor started to grow with recommendations even before best buys now we started adding in some rerecommendations and some rankings to try to give our members who were reading the content different ways to invest their money and other ideas besides what was just the current new recommendation then as you mentioned we decided i think it was david gardner who realized that a lot of questions we get is of your existing stocks which are the ones that are your favorite to buy right now just that simple question kicked off this initiative to try to figure out the best way to provide that answer and along with the rankings that we were doing at the time we added the best buys now which as you said is from the two approaches of investing tom side the everlasting side and the rule breaker side started off with david s is we started providing a monthly best buys now which is looking through the current recommendations and identifying the ones that the team and the advisors think are good places that you can put new money if you re investing besides just the existing recommendation that s carried all the way through as you said it was an evolution of the service but a very important one and it is one that a lot of our members find very valuable as they read through stock advisor chris hill it also ties into something we talk about frequently on this show which is the importance of having a watch list which can feel like a homework in some ways but it really is important to have that short list of stocks for when you have an opportunity to deploy more money andy cross sometimes those stocks are the ones that you already own i combined my watch list as i think about the ones that are already owned plus the ones that i m researching for the services or other services i have recommended that i have interest in so that can be a combination and it is good to have that especially just all the market volatility we re seeing right now chris stocks are in a position that they re just lower than what they were a few months ago pretty much across the board and that gives you an opportunity to buy some businesses at cheaper prices understanding which ones you may want to go with at a certain time that you ve learned about is a good idea and members can use best buys now along with the recommendations to help build those lists out chris hill let s face it some of the stocks on the best buys now list are there for tactical reasons by that i mean because we take such a long term view we think in terms of 5 10 20 year periods but we are individual investors in a market that is swayed in the short term by hedge funds mutual funds or people who are trading hundreds of thousands of shares of stock sometimes a stock ends up on the best buy now list because in the short term over the next 30 60 90 days maybe there s something bearish about the business in short term period you ll say i don t want this on my book for the next 60 days i m going to sell it and when you take a 10 and 20 year time horizon like we do it s a buying opportunity andy cross it s often difficult to understand that concept chris especially for many new investors who they expect their stocks that they buy to especially if you come in the past two years or so which has been an extra bullish time for the markets but that is a fact stocks go through those cycles like any other asset class for the most part there are times when when even the best businesses and the best stocks for a variety of reasons have sold off 20 30 40 percent in a relatively short period of time none of the great winners in stock advisor s history have been immune to that at various points for whatever reason it could be just general market draw downs like we re seeing in this current environment with the horrible situation over in ukraine plus inflation or in interest rates or it could be something that happened maybe with the business and it got yourself and the business going forward may not be quite as good for whatever reason it falls down yes you re right chris so much of the trading activity in the markets today tends to be relatively short term driven by algorithms driven by hedge funds driven for lots of emotional reasons leverage in the market that forces those funds to do some selling and that often can be a great time you ll see that pop up in the best buys now now i will say when we put together the best buys now list we re still looking at that five year horizon we re still trying to find businesses that can be exceptional performers over that time period it s just sometimes the prices are just cheaper than where it was when we recommended it even fresh to the scorecard three or four months ago now it s just a more attractive opportunity because the price is cheaper but the fundamental business isn t so much different if at all from when the recommendation came out chris hill you mentioned some of the great winners in the history of the stock advisor recommendations have had times when they ve dropped 40 percent 50 percent let s face it there are also some recommendations in the history of stock advisor that fell and never came back there are recommendations that the thesis didn t workout the stock dropped 90 percent and eventually got sold through the service when you think about the stock advisor universe what is a mistake from that universe that you ve learned some investing lesson from andy cross why just two quick points chris before getting to just some of the learnings i ve learned a ton continuing to learn a ton and all investors should continue to learn a ton from your winners and losers i think you can learn more from your losers than you can from your winners but the fact of the matter is with investing at the individual stock level you will have those businesses if you ve done this long enough and you invest in a long period of time with the time horizon like we do and you diversify your holdings you will find those businesses that fall pretty dramatically and never come back studies show looking across long periods of time that maybe somewhere 40 percent of the businesses fall more than 70 percent or more from their highs that dramatic loss and they never recover furthermore it s the big gainers that drive the bulk of your portfolio gains over time that s the natural mathematics of history in the markets we certainly have seen that in the stock advisor and we ve had such great long term performers but certainly some as you mentioned chris that have fallen pretty dramatically that just never came back from a learning perspective i look at retail establishments like the container store or stitch fix both recommendations at various points in stock advisor s history both were founder led both were trying to change a retail environment do it differently stitch fix through algorithms to refer clothing and containers store for home goods and storage facilities very innovative the learning is that the founder led nature of businesses the nobility of what a business is trying to complete or accomplished as a mission its leadership team its founder team those are very admirable traits for a business but if the business is facing stiff competitive pressures or headwinds to be able to do what they want to do especially if you re trying to change the market a little bit it can be very tough now chris certainly looking at a company like amazon or netflix two great winners on our scorecard for so many years those are the opposite of that basically trying to change environment but you have to be careful learning for me is just understanding that some management teams and visionary ceos and leaders of the businesses sometimes they are just facing very competitive natures that long term make the unit economics of the business very hard to be able to continue to expand and grow in a way it s going to show up for shareholder return i m just very careful now when i m listening to management teams and founder stories trying to really determine which ones are going to have the unit economics and the businesses over the next five years that are going to be able to sustain shareholder gains chris hill hey andy cross thanks for being here andy cross thanks chris chris hill if you would please help me with a small thought exercise let s say you bought just one stock that was recommended in stock advisor and it was the only stock you bought how do you think you d feel that depends if you bought netflix when it was first recommended in late 2003 and held those shares you ve got a stock that s up more than 100 times in value there s a chance you re giving the motley fool more credit than is deserved since among other things we didn t do as good a job as we should have in talking about how important it is to build out a diversified portfolio now if the one stock you bought was say charlotte s web when it was recommended in the summer of 2019 you ve got a stock that s lost 95 percent of its value and you re not happy with the motley fool and i wouldn t blame you because among other things we didn t do as good a job as we should have to make sure you knew how crucial diversification is to long term success for stock investors like you and me it s something senior analyst asit sharma and his colleagues have increasingly focused on asit there s a lot of attention paid to single stock recommendations we always like to highlight our winners when i say we i mean we as investors it s always great to look at your portfolio and say i bought this one stock and this is the biggest winner in my portfolio but i think it s fair to say that one of the things we ve learned over the years with stock advisor is how important it is to not just have that one stock in your portfolio that diversification and the point we keep making about getting to a broader portfolio is so crucial for long term success asit sharma absolutely chris if public investments were entirely within your control in some cases it might make sense to put all your money in one stock in other words if you could pick up the phone and call the ceo and say i don t think you guys are doing a good job you should move into this market here and then hang up the phone and wait a year the results then validate your concerns it would be so easy but in reality each investment we make is outside of our control once we commit that money therefore we get exposed when we have fewer positions it could work out really well if you ve got a highly concentrated portfolio but it could also turn out very badly if you had 100 percent of your capital and divided that among four stocks that s a 25 percent position in each stock you can see how that math can work against an investor if those four choices happened to be sub optimal there are so many aspects of diversification we could talk about that is moving between different sectors having a focus that split between say value stocks and growth stocks etc all those are great ways to think about diversification but even before we get to those aspects of diversification chris i think it s just essential that we keep following this math because successful investing in some ways is about position sizing for example if i take that 100 percent that i m going to invest and divide it between 25 stocks which is what we re always messaging we call this the sledgehammer message and i need to sledge hammer message sometimes as well i think i ve learned it those positions then equal four percent each so our exposure decreases now if an investor takes 100 percent of the capital here she wants to invest and keeps 20 percent in cash allocating 80 percent to 25 positions each position then goes to 3 2 percent of that total portfolio one more example chris same investor 80 percent invested in stocks 20 percent cash spread among 40 positions each position becomes two percent of that portfolio now we always say those winners are going to make up for the smaller positions that don t work out huge winners over time drive the performance in a portfolio but i believe as investors we ve got to pay attention to this basic math that decreases our risk and increases our opportunity to have winning investments over the long term chris hill i m glad you mentioned the cash position because that to me when i think back over the last 20 years with this service i think is one of the important lessons this is a service that every month like clockwork is recommending stocks and whether or not you re investing in those shares the discipline to me is the important part of that clockwork just consistently putting money in the market we do it with retirement plans with 401 k plans and maybe that s easier to do because on our first week at a new job we sign up we check the box and we re not thinking about it we ve made the choice that it s going to happen like clockwork it s a little bit harder when we re looking at individual stocks but it really is important to have that discipline asit sharma it is chris and that s part of the reason why we roll out our stock picks twice a month theoretically we could spend half a year or full year researching our best ideas and come out with a list market in a really big way the stock advisor list is coming out january 1st you re going to get 24 awesome stock picks so our analysts have been working throughout the year to identify the greatest ideas that would be fun maybe now that i think about it but it wouldn t serve investors because this game is about continual learning it s about that motivation to be persistent to be disciplined to keep as you mentioned allocating your capital at regular intervals that s part of the theory of dollar cost averaging but it s also following innovation in the economy as new ideas are created as new businesses emerge you have to keep finding those ideas and allocating money toward them it s a never ending game in some ways but it s a very fruitful and rewarding game if you can adhere to this one concept but over time i think we ve tried to amplify for members of stock advisor chris hill when you look at the universe of recommendations over the years in stock advisor there are winners there are losers what is a mistake from that universe that you ve learned a lesson from asit sharma chris i think the one that i want to talk about is lemonade symbol l m n d this is a company that we recommended in december of 2020 a relatively recent stock advisor pick shows that we re continually learning as we go along as well this is a stock that got a lot of confidence in for the long term it is an insurtech so it combines technology with the underwriting of insurance they have a really fun model it is informed by artificial intelligence super high customer service scores and i think that over time they are going to emerge as a pretty successful insurance business now we recommended this stock not long after it went public and those members who bought in at that time have seen their investment in lemonade deteriorate so i go back to one of the principles we try to use in investing among services at the motley fool which is you don t have to buy a stock right after it goes public you can take some time to study that company now this isn t a hard and fast rule we have plenty of success with stories where we ve jumped in soon after an ipo and recommended a great company but this is one where maybe we could have waited a few months before recommending and members wouldn t be as down as they are now simply what we probably could have studied was their experience with underwriting their business lemonade is figuring out as it goes along the best way to optimize their insurance underwriting and their gross loss ratio so their ratio which tracks losses that they incur for the business they underwrite that s jumping all over the place if i had to go back i would say i really like this company let s wait two or three quarters and see how they go we can wait for these numbers to smooth out and then go in with the recommendation patience pays in many cases but there s no hard and fast rule that s both the mystery and the fun of investing once in a while you ll come across a company that you may invest in weeks after it goes public and do perfectly well with that chris hill asit sharma great talking to you thanks for being here asit sharma thank you chris chris hill if you ve ever listened to david gardner s podcast rule breaker investing you may be familiar with some investing advice he has shared for decades let your winners run which can be easier in theory than in practice but senior analyst emily flippen has done the math there are a lot of reasons to let your winners run emily but one of them is the fact that look we re all going to have losers in our portfolio and if you let your winners run it makes those losers so much easier to take emily flippen if you don t have losers in your portfolio you re probably not appropriately diversified you haven t invested in enough companies because if you re an investor especially an investor in individual businesses there are going to be times when you look at your portfolio and you see businesses down say double digits versus the market falling 50 60 70 percent even having businesses that never recover from those lows it can be really challenging i think for investors to look at those losses and ask themselves man what needs to happen from here for these losers to become winners in my portfolio the math really doesn t work in our favor when you look it just mathematically a 50 percent drop requires a nearly 100 percent gain just to get back to where it was before the drop and that can feel like a really massive thing that businesses need to overcome but virtually every massive winner in the stock advisor universe has at one point or another sustained a 50 percent plus drop it happens businesses recover you just need to take a long enough time horizon chris hill to let your winners run there are also the events happening outside whether it s happening with an individual business i look at a company like cintas which is one of the largest corporate uniform rental and sales companies in america that s a stock that was recommended in stock advisor in december of 2008 to this point it s up 2 000 percent but if you think about all of the major things that happened in the financial world you had to have held that through the great recession the fiscal cliff the flash crash god knows how many market drops of 10 percent or more to say nothing of a global pandemic emily flippen it s really easy to reflect on what you would ve done a decade or two decades ago and say of course cintas or netflix or amazon of course these companies were going to be massive winners of course i would have held when they pulled back but you could even take a more recent example the trade desk for instance a stock advisor recommendation i think it fell something like 45 percent versus the market from december 2020 to may 2021 in a matter of just a few months massive decrease in value and there were a number of investors looking at that business thinking it was never going to recover and it feels very real when you re sitting down in real time in 2021 2022 looking at these losses but if you know the trade desk since and they ve nearly caught up with the market from where those lows were in may 2021 it s a business that is executing really well so it s easy to have hindsight and look about what you would have done with these great winners if you had held them prior but don t let that hindsight prevent you from looking at your own portfolio today and say the same thing there are so many great businesses that are very likely down 40 or 50 percent in somebody s portfolio today there s nothing preventing them from becoming cintas i won t say netflix or amazon because there may be some things there but there s nothing that prevents them from turning into market beaters again other than locking in those losses and selling today chris hill we have these conversations you have these conversations with other people on the investing team we talk about them on the podcast in our video live team that sort of thing for individual investors a lot of them are essentially on their own maybe they are working with a financial advisor but maybe it s someone in their family or their friends are interested but a lot of people are doing it on their own and that means they are subject to other opinions coming their way whether it s on a podcast like this or watching financial television or something like that you and i were talking earlier about a conversation that took place years ago around tesla and doing the math on do we keep this stock recommended or do we sell it emily flippen this was maybe one of the biggest investing mistakes in terms of losses that i made here at the motley fool and that had to do with the odyssey 1 portfolio where we held a very small position in tesla and we re having to make a decision i think the timeframe was late 2018 early 2019 about what to do with these shares i was very afraid of the losses that tesla could potentially sustain there was a lot of uncertainty both around elon musk but as well as the business meeting their delivery targets all of this negativity i was convinced that we could see a huge pullback in this business we should sell now try to get out prevent ourselves from sustaining massive losses and there were periods after the fact that tesla did pull back dramatically but that did by no means make that decision the right decision by selling out of that small tesla position i caused that portfolio a ton in gains i think the stock has gone up nearly 2 000 percent since that decision while there were numerous periods as investors know where tesla pulled back double digits that has not prevented those gains from being anything less than dramatic it really does just go to show how much more important it is to focus on winners in a portfolio and how much they can gain that upside is unlimited in comparison to focusing on your losers where the downside is kept chris hill there are bunch of long term winners in the stock advisor universe there are also a bunch of clunkers there are mistakes that were made what is a mistake from the world of stock advisor that you ve learned from and applied in your own investing in life emily flippen one of the stats that i think is so interesting from stock advisor and you can call it a mistake i like to call it a learning opportunity is stock advisor s history of selling in the portfolio obviously with two decades plus of time underneath the stock advisor s hands here there s been lots of opportunities and many times where stocks were sold out of the portfolio but our math always says that stock advisor would have done better if our team had never sold a single position and that s sounds to me that i shouldn t be selling in my own portfolio we tend to be very bad as individual investors at timing when to get in and out of businesses that s why it s so important to take a long term buy and hold not sell approach i see this in my own portfolio i ve mentioned this before but the last stock i sold was actually best buy again think back in 2018 i had a lot of people telling me this is maybe the peak for best buy and clearly not the case missed out on double digit gains there over the markets if i just held on to these best buy shares so i d say just looking at the selling history and reminding myself again not to focus on the losers don t sell my losers focus on my winners and buy more of those when i have the opportunity too chris hill you re not the only one who made that mistake on best buy emily flippen i hope not although i hope i do i hope i am the only one because i hope we can all learn from my own mistake and prevent those mistakes moving forward chris hill thanks for being here emily flippen thanks for having me chris hill as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy yourself stocks based solely on what you hear i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow

when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at popular prices the godfather at almost three hours could certainly have gone that route its klieg lighted celebrity studded charity gala on march 14 1972 was at the manhattan movie palace that had hosted the exclusive world premiere engagement of ben hur for 74 weeks though the once 3 300 seat loew s state theater had recently been remodeled as loew s state i and ii even cut in half it was still a prestigious house that the godfather could have filled indefinitely before letting other theaters join in but paramount had a different plan this is business not personal sonny it asked theater owners across the country to bid to play the film days after the premiere in return for an upfront non refundable monetary guarantee against 90 of the box office take whichever was greater theater owners would keep just 10 cents of every dollar that came into their box offices but it would be a lot of dimes with the novel a runaway bestseller competition among theater owners was fierce paramount ended up accepting more than 300 bids and when those lucky theater owners ponied up their up front guarantees the producers had more than 15 million in the till before opening night more than twice what they d spent making the picture and then the godfather opened and critics and audiences saw what coppola had wrought not an edward g robinson style gangster flick not even the mob potboiler puzo had written in his novel coppola had crafted a quasi shakespearean epic about a mob family in crisis it was the violent wrenching bloodily epic story of a dynasty giving way king corleone and his princes it was enormously emotional as producer robert evans remembers henry kissinger saying at the film s premiere here was brando playing a gangster who d killed hundreds of people and when he died the whole audience was crying a touch of greatness leave the gun take the cannoli associated press associated press actor al pacino and actress jill clayburgh attend the world premiere of the godfather in which he stars as michael corleone by the time the film opened nationwide 10 days later absolutely everyone was buying tickets though sometimes for odd reasons as dave berg of member station kcur told all things considered while reporting on the film s sold out but empty premiere at the empire theater in kansas city missouri according to giles fowler film critic for the kansas city star the godfather is a triumph of traditional storytelling cinema in an age that had just about forgotten such things but no matter nobody saw the film the italian american unification council of greater kansas city bought all 1 000 tickets for 2 500 so that the godfather would play to an empty house they also got a court injunction barring stan durwood the theater operator from scheduling a matinee that day and spoiling their optics for obvious reasons he was fine with that durwood said he s just happy with all the publicity the film is getting reported berg so the group got its optics the theater got its first of several sold out performances and what did audiences get a portrait of the mafia that felt real reportedly even to members of gang families also a raft of star making performances al pacino diane keaton robert duvall james caan and a story that reached the point where a conventional mob movie would end at about the 90 minute mark and still had half its story left to tell the half that thrilled i thought when it was your turn you would be the one to hold the strings critics were enthusiastic about the film s most daring departures from hollywood tradition quite apart from the realistic performances and ambiance here was a gangster epic told not as a morality tale from an outsiders point of view but with sympathy for and from the viewpoint of its central thoroughly amoral family that said there were things that were not altogether new that line everyone quotes about an offer someone can t refuse forrest taylor said it almost word for word to john wayne in the 1933 western riders of destiny a full three decades before the godfather novel was written and that swoony earworm of a love theme composer nino rota provided for the godfather sounded awfully familiar to folks who d seen eduardo de filippo s italian comedy fortunella 14 years earlier rota scored that one too but his bit of recycling cost him an oscar nod there wasn t enough time we ll get there pop the godfather received 11 oscar nominations though even those came with complications brando decided best actor was an honor he could refuse and sent apache representative sacheen littlefeather to decline it citing the treatment of native americans by the film industry al pacino also boycotted the ceremony it was reported at the time that he was annoyed at being nominated as supporting actor when he had more screen time than brando did though he now says that wasn t the case regardless it was just a temporary setback pacino got his best actor nomination for the godfather part ii all of which qualified as blood under the bridge as far as the audience was concerned the godfather was the no 1 film at the box office for 23 consecutive weeks in 1972 then spent one week at no 2 supplanted by the goldie hawn comedy butterflies are free before coming back for three more weeks at the top of the chart it earned 100 million faster than any film before it and having cost less than 7 million to make it was so profitable that the l a times reported the stock price of gulf western the huge conglomerate that owned paramount more than quadrupled from 77 cents a share to 3 30 a share the film also began an era in which coppola s generation ostensibly fed up with the studio system essentially took over the studio system three years after the godfather rewrote the rules of film exhibition steven spielberg made jaws which established a new pattern of even broader release augmented by a first ever national tv ad campaign two years after that

today said chris beauchamp chief market analyst at online trading platform ig putin s hints that negotiations might be showing some progress was enough to engender a rally across markets although some of the optimism has been trimmed there is as yet no sign of any real deal emerging and russia s previous aims still appear to be in place so this rally might go the way of so many others of late with markets still unable to find the foundations for a sustainable bounce beauchamp noted next week investors are expecting the federal reserve to announce a rate hike in measures to control inflationary

market analyst at cmc markets uk there are some on the fomc who are probably in the camp that want to see a 50bps rate rise however in light of the russian invasion of ukraine and the resultant surge in global commodity prices we could well see a bit of caution the fed s bigger problem is how it manages its messaging for future rate rises against a backdrop of surging input prices which are likely to slow the us economy over the course of the rest of the year hewson noted on the corporate front shares of docusign tanked 22 after publishing its weak guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year

former cnn executive allison gollust gleefully texted her former boss andrew cuomo that he d dealt president trump an l in a 2020 cnn interview she helped orchestrate according to a report the revelation was part of a lengthy rolling stone piece delving into the ethically questionable relationship between recently ousted cnn president jeff zucker his lover and longtime lieutenant gollust former new york gov cuomo for whom gollust once worked as a communications aide and cuomo s brother former cnn anchor chris cuomo according to rolling stone on march 28 2020 after then gov cuomo offered an effective shoulder shrug to albany reporters about then president trump suggesting a covid 19 quarantine of new york connecticut and new jersey he appeared on cnn later that afternoon with a far more forceful response i think it would paralyze the economy he said i think it would shock the economic markets in a way we ve never seen before cnn saga how much cash did ousted boss jeff zucker get to leave network later in the interview cnn host ana cabrera teed up cuomo with a question about the stock market a subject of keen interest to trump on that point you made about the financial sector about being able to have interstate commerce but also the financial sectors it s the heart of manhattan right cabrera asked what would this mean for the stock market would it have to shut down oh it would drop like a stone cuomo said adding it would be chaos and mayhem that could have devastating economic effects between his albany press conference and the cnn appearance that same saturday gov cuomo had texted gollust ask jeff to call me plz an apparent reference to zucker shortly before his remote appearance on cnn gollust had copied zucker on an email to a programming staffer to offer cuomo as a last minute guest and she told zucker the governor wanted to speak with him after the segment ended according to the report gollust texted cuomo well done cuomo w trump l cnn scandal jeff zucker allison gollust gave gov cuomo covid talking points to combat trump report says the report lays out other examples of gollust who rose to be cnn s chief marketing officer under zucker blurring the lines with then gov cuomo at one point joking in a text i m pretty sure i stopped being your publicist 8 years ago but apparently i still am in another example she invited him on cnn s struggling morning show new day to squash a rumor that trump would shut down new york city and another time cuomo remarked that she often asked for favors but it was ok since it was mutual still zucker insists he never acted as a consultant to cuomo jeff has never advised andrew cuomo jeff zucker spokeswoman risa heller told news digital nothing crystallized the cozy relationship between andrew cuomo and cnn more than the chummy interviews conducted by his little brother on cuomo prime time the now infamous exchanges included mutual declarations of brotherly love the younger cuomo heaping praise on the governor for his coronavirus leadership and even prop comedy involving a giant nasal swab although praised in some media corners at the time as great television the interviews are now widely viewed as a black eye for the network and an ethical lapse particularly as gov cuomo s coronavirus failings came to light gollust served as cuomo s communications director from october 2012 until february 2013 jumping ship to cnn where zucker had just taken over as president cnn saga cuomo gollust zucker scandal causing legal mess that discovery would be wise to avoid experts say zucker s nine year run that saw cnn lurch to the left ended abruptly on feb 2 when he was forced to resign for reportedly not disclosing a sexual relationship with gollust he claimed their formerly professional relationship had become romantic during covid but the two had been romantically linked for years before that the revelations came during a wider investigation of former primetime star chris cuomo whose extensive journalistically unethical involvement in his brother s political sexual harassment defense and misconduct allegations of his own led to his termination in december gollust resigned two weeks later and warnermedia ceo jason kilar said she zucker and chris cuomo were all guilty of multiple violations of company news standards and practices casting doubt on the claim that zucker s resignation was solely for not disclosing his affair if it all seems too incestuous to be true it was hardly unusual within the culture that followed zucker wherever he went for all his many

reuters photo file kim jong un north korea s leader attends a meeting with nguyen thi kim ngan chairwoman of vietnam s national assembly at the national assembly in hanoi vietnam on friday march 1 2019 seongjoon cho pool via reuters by josh smith and david brunnstrom seoul washington reuters north korea used what would be its largest ever intercontinental ballistic missile icbm system in two recent launches and appears to be restoring some tunnels at its shuttered nuclear test site us and south korean officials said on friday the reports are the latest to suggest the country may soon follow through on threats to resume testing long range icbms or nuclear weapons for the first time since 2017 the escalation in north korea tensions comes as south korea on wednesday elected a new conservative president yoon suk yeol has said that pre emptive strikes may be needed to counter any imminent attack by the north and has vowed to buy american thaad missile interceptors while remaining open to restarting stalled denuclearization talks reclusive north korea and the affluent democratic south are technically still at war because their 1950 53 conflict ended in a ceasefire not a peace treaty south korea s military said on friday it had detected unspecified activity to restore some tunnels at punngye ri the north s only known nuclear test site which were demolished with explosives when it was closed in 2018 analysts say that with few details on the extent of the demolition it is unclear how quickly the site could be used again it is also unclear if the activity is related to a number of small natural earthquakes recently reported in the area the pentagon and us state department declined to comment on matters of intelligence when asked about punngye ri in what washington called a serious escalation requiring a united global response north korea used a huge new icbm system in launches on feb 27 and march 5 according to us and south korean officials seoul issued a strong condemnation and urged pyongyang to immediately stop actions that heighten tension the purpose of these tests which did not demonstrate icbm range was likely to evaluate this new system before conducting a test at full range in the future potentially disguised as a space launch pentagon spokesman john kirby nyse said in a statement north korea did not specify what missile was used but said it tested components for reconnaissance satellites that leader kim jong un said would soon be launched to monitor military activity by the united states and its allies it says its military activities including nuclear weapons are its sovereign right and only for self defense it accused the united states and its allies of threatening it with hostile policies such as military drills and sanctions the u s treasury which has imposed a range of sanctions on north korea over its weapons programs announced fresh steps on friday in response to the launches targeting russian individuals and companies it linked to pyongyang s procurement activities for its missile programs a senior us administration official said before the announcement the aim of the new sanctions was to help prevent north korea accessing foreign items and technology that enable it to advance its weapons programs he said the steps would be followed by a range of further actions in coming days japanese prime minister fumio kishida and yoon said they had agreed to ramp up three way ties with the united states in response to north korea s evolving military threat japan is also considering imposing additional sanctions against north korea as well as other diplomatic options kishida told reporters after a phone call with the south korean president elect u s deputy secretary of state wendy sherman in a call with her counterparts in japan and south korea on friday again condemned pyongyang s launches and said washington would continue efforts to seek diplomacy the u s state department said in a statement rockets and satellites the united states and south korea both said the missile system known as the hwasong 17 was unveiled at an october 2020 military parade in pyongyang and reappeared at a defense exhibition in october 2021 analysts said the tests probably only used one stage of the huge hwasong 17 and may have adjusted its fuel use to fly at lower altitudes the intelligence assessments released simultaneously by the united states and south korea came as north korean state media reported on friday that kim had inspected the sohae satellite launching ground the facility has been used to put a satellite in orbit and also to test various missile components including rocket engines and space launch vehicles that south korean and us officials say require similar technology to that used in icbms north korea has historically used its space launches to try to hide its attempted advancements of its icbm program the us official told reporters at the sohae station kim inspected facilities and ordered them to be modernized and expanded to ensure that various rockets could be launched to carry multi purpose satellites including a military reconnaissance satellite the north s kcna news agency reported i think the north koreans are genuinely working on a set of technologies that have applications across both icbms and satellites said ankit panda a senior fellow at the us based carnegie endowment for international peace
annual shifts between standard and daylight saving time said to harm health washington republicans and democrats in congress can agree on sleep or more precisely the inconvenience of losing or gaining an hour of it each year thanks to going on and off daylight saving time i believe that any justifications for springing forward and falling back are either outdated or are outweighed by the serious health and economic impacts we now know are associated with the time changes u s house energy and commerce committee chairman frank pallone of new jersey said this week as americans prepare to adjust their clocks this weekend for daylight saving time lawmakers at an energy and commerce subcommittee hearing on wednesday assembled a panel of experts to discuss the health energy and economic impacts of the shift twice a year congress would have to authorize a change in federal law to allow permanent daylight saving time but it s not clear there is the momentum to do that daylight saving time begins at 2 a m on sunday which means clocks in most of the u s will be turned forward one hour and there will be more light at the end of the day daylight saving time will end on nov 6 darkness kills and sunshine saves steve calandrillo a law professor from the university of washington said at the hearing he advocated for a permanent change to daylight saving time arguing that having one more hour of sunlight in the evening would reduce crime decrease fatal car accidents save energy and improve heath he said a biannual clock switch wreaks havoc with our sleep cycles notably causing a 24 increase in heart attacks in the week after we spring forward in march a study by researchers at rutgers found that nearly 350 lives would be saved by moving to permanent daylight saving time year round stop switching some lawmakers couldn t decide if they wanted daylight saving time or standard time but they all agreed that it was archaic for the united states to keep switching back and forth lawmakers from florida were adamant that an extra hour of daylight would be beneficial for health the economy and for schools florida sen marco rubio a republican has introduced legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent and similar legislation is pending in the house coming from the sunshine state we value sunshine for our quality of life recreation and our tourism economy rep darren soto a florida democrat said daylight saving time was used as an energy saving measure during various points in u s history such as world war i and has become a permanent fixture since the energy crisis of the 1970s under federal law states can opt out and remain on standard time but are not allowed to change to daylight saving time in the last four years 18 states have enacted or passed measures to provide for year round daylight saving time but without congressional approval they can t adopt those changes iowa s state house recently passed a bill that would put the state on daylight saving time pending federal action two states have passed measures to stay on standard time arizona and hawaii rep debbie lesko an arizona republican said her state has been on standard time for nearly 40 years she asked one of the witnesses dr beth malow a professor of neurology and pediatrics at vanderbilt university medical center in nashville tennessee if she knew of any studies on the health benefits for arizonans who are used to living on standard time malow who is also the director of the vanderbilt sleep division said she was not aware of any but advocated for a permanent standard time please don t mess with arizona we ve been doing this for 40 years lesko said to her colleagues anytime you change anything to arizona arizonans will be upset republicans object to topic rep fred upton a michigan republican said he believed it should be up to the states if they want to move to daylight saving time but he also expressed frustration for having the hearing in the first place he said he believed the panel should be focusing on america s energy independence after russia s attack on ukraine a handful of republicans on the panel agreed and argued that they should be focusing their time on helping ukraine amid the russian invasion rep bob latta an ohio republican said the last time he got a complaint from his constituents about daylight saving time was in 2020 and said that his constituents were worried about the russia ukraine conflict other things we should be talking about is american energy independence latta said reps neal dunn a florida republican and cathy mcmorris rodgers a washington republican raised similar points the top gop lawmaker on the panel gus bilirakis of florida discussed the health effects of switching back and forth and said he is concerned about children going to school in the dark if congress did move to make daylight saving time permanent calandrillo said that as a parent of four young children he did not want them to go to school in the dark and suggested that schools start later so children can get adequate sleep bilirakis agreed and said that he felt his kids going to school around 7 a m was too early and was open to the idea of giving schools flexibility to change their start times malow agreed that starting school later could help children particularly teens who are going through puberty which can affect their sleep schedules bright light in the morning is a piece of the puzzle that will help our kids get more sleep she said rep debbie dingell a michigan democrat asked malow to explain the effect sleep deprivation has on overall health when we re not sleeping well it has a whole host of ramifications malow said obesity diabetes heart disease even cancer and alzheimer s disease is linked to either

the shock to the global financial system from the russia ukraine war isn t only driving up the cost of gasoline in the u s but also raising the price of gas to heat homes boosting inflation and potentially undermining climate change legislation in california as well as the state s efforts to ramp down oil and gas production although the u s is banning russian energy imports california doesn t rely on russia for oil or gas yet already the industry is aggressively pushing the newsom administration to approve more than 1 000 permits for new production to help reduce the need to increase imports from foreign sources like russia said the western states petroleum association in a statement experts tell capital main this won t do anything to stop rising gas prices in the short term as legislation starts heading to committees in the california assembly and senate three bills that seek to limit the oil and gas industry s power in the state could feel the impact of this fast changing political environment one would divest billions in state pension funds from fossil fuel assets while another would shut down three offshore oil platforms a third would promote greater transparency in how companies that sell gasoline in california determine prices at the pump senate bill 1173 california oversees the largest public pension fund and the largest teachers retirement fund in the country the fossil fuel investments for calpers and calstrs add up to more than 9 billion including direct holdings and as part of larger funds according to fossil free california which is sponsoring a divestment bill introduced by sen lena gonzalez d long beach as of last year both funds held millions of shares in companies like chevron conocophillips marathon and exxon the bill would prohibit managers of the funds from new fossil fuel investments and require complete divestment by 2027 the state s two largest employee pension funds use enormous investment power to finance companies driving climate change gonzalez said during a press event in february the state building and construction trades council of california which commonly votes in step with the oil industry later sent a letter to the legislature opposing the bill to address climate change we need to phase out the use of fossil fuels and this means in the long run fossil fuel company stocks are expected to have lower returns emily kaufman fossil free california both calpers and calstrs hold millions of shares of gazprom russia s state owned oil company whose revenues accounted for more than a third of the government s total budget in 2021 last october those shares peaked at almost 11 but they have now plummeted to 1 10 in addition to gazprom calpers and calstrs are also invested in state oil ventures in saudi arabia canada hungary china and across europe in an emailed statement calstrs didn t say if it would release its holdings in gazprom but said it opposed the divestment bill calpers had investments in gazprom through stock market indices that have already dropped russian securities a representative said and was in contact with gonzalez s office about the divestment bill fossil free california put out a report in the early months of the pandemic that found calstrs had lost more than 1 billion when oil prices tanked in the first half of 2020 today the story is different with stock prices surging including record levels for chevron non russian oil companies could be attractive for short term gains supporters of the legislation don t see it that way to address climate change we need to phase out the use of fossil fuels and this means in the long run fossil fuel company stocks are expected to have lower returns and be a financial risk said emily kaufman who works on the divestment campaign with fossil free california senate bill 1322 russian oil accounted for a small amount of california s oil consumption but the state s refineries were among the u s s biggest recipients of imported russian crude last year the average cost of a gallon of gasoline in the state is now over 5 50 a bill authored by sen ben allen d west los angeles would force companies to publicly disclose each month the difference between what it cost them to buy a barrel of oil and refine it into gasoline and the price they sold it at the pump the industry is using high gas prices to double down on calls for more oil production in the state but it won t make much of a difference anytime soon says mark brownstein a senior vice president at the environmental defense fund who studies the energy transition from fossil fuels ramping up domestic oil production even if you thought it was the right thing to do takes months if not years to do at scale it would take years to impact the domestic supply or effect global pricing brownstein said a 2019 report found that californians paid about 30 cents more per gallon for gasoline sold by chevron shell and 76 compared with the national average companies that sell gasoline in california have a history of charging excessive prices compared with the rest of the country simply because they could a 2019 report by the california energy commission found that californians paid about 30 cents more per gallon for gasoline sold by chevron shell and 76 owned by phillips 66 compared with the national average the companies reaped an additional 11 6 billion in revenues from california customers between 2013 and 2018 compared to their national retail margins after the report was published the california justice department filed charges against a handful of companies importing gasoline into california including vitol inc sk energy americas and sk trading for allegedly manipulating prices at the pump after a 2015 refinery explosion in torrance disrupted the state s supplies the california justice department told capital main it was unable to comment on whether it was also considering charges against shell chevron or phillips 66 those companies have denied the allegations according to a press release from allen s office five oil refiners control 96 of the gasoline made in the state and still receive about 30 to 40 cents more per gallon compared to smaller brands selling gas at places like costco and united oil the mark up also started after the refinery explosion at a press conference for the bill consumer watchdog president jamie court whose organization is supporting the bill said additional costs per gallon in california couldn t be explained away by surcharges associated with environmental policies like cap and trade or the low carbon fuel standard which only add an additional 55 cents compared to the national retail margin currently it s 1 09 higher in california court said the oil and gas industry hadn t formally declared opposition to the bill but blamed environmental regulations for the price difference a spokesperson for wspsa kevin slagle said that its members are still examining the bill and may have more specific objections next week but what i can tell you now is that any examination of costs at the pump should start with looking at california s regulatory and tax environment the first 1 27 a gallon we pay at the pump now is for taxes and regulatory programs senate bill 953 the only bill introduced this session that proposes to limit oil and gas production in california would take three oil and gas platforms under the state s jurisdiction offline offshore drilling in nonfederal waters accounted for only about 5 and 2 of the state s oil and gas production in 2019 respectively the amount coming specifically from the three platforms excluding other offshore production such as at the thums islands overseen by the city of long beach is even smaller but the platforms still have the potential to cause catastrophic damage to marine life according to the text of the bill written by sen dave min d orange county in fact one of the platforms is currently offline after a pipeline it was connected to leaked oil into the sea offshore drilling in nonfederal waters accounted for only about 5 and 2 of the state s oil and gas production in 2019 respectively the real thing this punctuates both for europe and the u s is we rapidly need to move away from fossil fuels and gas prices i think our state needs to live up to its climate promises and continue to end existing drilling said miyoko sakashita oceans director at the center for biological diversity it will likely see pushback from a coalition of 21 legislators including republican and some democrats who sent a letter to gov newsom urging his administration to expand oil and gas production in a statement posted online wspa president catherine reheis boyd acknowledged the plight of ukranians before stating that energy leadership and independence in california would enhance domestic and global security but rather than serving as a reason to expand oil production brownstein says the crisis should accelerate the transition toward clean energy sources this is the fifth global oil price shock i ve seen in my lifetime tied to world events so how many times do you have to experience this before you decide to do something different copyright 2022 capital main

richmond unable to come to a resolution on the state budget virginia house and senate leaders say they expect to adjourn the regular session of the general assembly saturday giving negotiators more time to bridge their differences in anticipation of a special session senate democrats friday afternoon made clear to republicans that their caucus would not vote to extend the session past the constitution s prescribed 60 days that could spell trouble for gov glenn youngkin whose hands would be tied from making certain appointments if lawmakers then decide not to adjourn the special session separating the gop controlled house and the democrat controlled senate is a 3 billion gap on how much money they will have to spend in the two year budget that will take effect july 1 we ve got some ground to cover not a lot but there are differences we re going to sine die and then we ll come back at another time house appropriations chairman barry knight r virginia beach said friday afternoon referring to a latin term for final adjournment senate finance chair janet howell d fairfax said earlier friday we re still at loggerheads over the tax issues knight said friday evening that house and senate budget negotiators had not yet met on friday and had not met on thursday the house budget includes almost 5 5 billion in tax cuts and rebates but the senate continues to insist on deferring the centerpiece of the governor s tax plan the doubling of the standard deduction for income tax filers until a joint subcommittee completes a comprehensive study of virginia tax policy in the coming year doubling the standard deduction would reduce state revenues by 2 billion over two years the senate has agreed to partial repeal of the 2 5 sales tax on groceries but has balked at eliminating the 1 that goes directly to local governments and has approved a less generous tax exemption for military retirement income than the house it also has approved smaller tax rebates this year than the house and rejected a 12 month rollback in the gas tax as meaningless to soaring prices at the pump house and senate budget leaders have not yet announced plans for completing negotiations on the budget but it s already too late to produce an agreement in time for adoption on saturday under house rules that require at least 48 hours for members to review the spending plan republicans who control the house and have a narrow disadvantage in the senate generally support the republican governor s tax cut package but sen emmett hanger r augusta has sided with howell in delaying action on major tax cuts without a comprehensive study hanger said friday that a general consensus seems to be developing to adopt a more thoughtful approach to finalizing the budget rather than a rushed process knight meanwhile described the differences by saying they want to spend and we want to give money back to virginia taxpayers knight said he hopes negotiators can bridge their differences and come back in a matter of weeks to a special session called by youngkin a special session that doesn t adjourn a somewhat regular occurrence could spell trouble for youngkin as he tries to fill two vacancies on the supreme court of virginia and one vacancy on the state corporation commission any appointments youngkin makes would need to be taken up by the legislature within 30 days if they are not youngkin s picks would be barred from serving in those roles sen scott surovell d fairfax said democrats would strive to keep our options open when it comes to appointments surovell criticized youngkin and house republicans decision to reject 11 of former gov ralph northam s appointees earlier in the session including members of the board of education and the regulatory boards and rule of issues related to air and water quality they politicized a long tradition of board appointments surovell said senate democrats on thursday rejected four of youngkin s picks for the parole board meanwhile virginia s revenues dipped last month but youngkin s confidence remains high that the state will have plenty of money this year to pay for tax cuts and new spending in the budget now pending in a deeply divided general assembly youngkin said in an interview on friday that despite a 1 2 decline in february compared with the same month a year ago the state remains on track to finish the fiscal year on june 30 with at least an additional 1 25 billion in revenues under the revenue forecast he announced last month we have a strong revenue forecast that can fund tax cuts and this is the time to get it done he said the latest state revenue numbers aren t likely to change the budget debate revenues fell by 19 million in february or 1 2 over the same month a year ago but youngkin discounted the comparison because of what he called anomalies in last year s results the state s tax collections remain 13 6 ahead for the first eight months of the fiscal year that began july 1 he said last year s numbers were abnormally high by 125 million to 150 million because of a delay in conforming state and federal tax codes that suppressed the number of income tax refunds he said that income taxes withheld from pay checks also were abnormally high the previous february youngkin said he remains cautious about collections of non withholding income taxes paid by investors on stock gains and self employed professionals in the last four months of the fiscal year with the stock market highly volatile because of the russian invasion of ukraine and the soaring cost of oil and gasoline but he said he is highly confident in the revenues that pay most of the cost of state government taxes on payroll income corporate income and consumer sales which he called really strong underpinnings to support his forecast for a 27 9 billion general fund budget in this fiscal year asked whether the dip in february revenues would affect that outlook youngkin replied not at all not in the least

menafn valuewalk dwilliam pixabay stimulus checks may not be a priority for the federal government but for many governors especially democratic governors up for re election stimulus payments are on the top of their list such stimulus checks from governors are seen as a way to attract voters it is not a secret that voters love direct stimulus checks and the change org petition that has over 3 million signatures is good evidence of that get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q4 2021 hedge fund letters conferences and more this growth fund manager says value stocks will soon lose their luster there have been a plethora of reports about how hedge funds and the general markets have been rotating into value stocks over the last year or two in fact as economic uncertainty grows many market watchers believe value stocks will rule for the foreseeable future q4 2021 hedge fund letters conferences and more voss capital read more stimulus checks from governors what s the motive several states have benefitted from unanticipated tax revenue due to the rapid economic rebound and windfalls fueled by pandemic era federal relief checks a recent report from the ncsl national conference of state legislatures claims that half of the states will exceed their estimated revenue while 17 states will meet their revenue projections for the current year governors of many such states have already proposed or are in the process of sending direct stimulus checks to voters for instance gov tony evers d in wisconsin has called on republican legislators to approve 150 in stimulus checks for every resident in maine gov janet mills d has proposed giving 500 checks to about 800 000 eligible taxpayers while kansas gov laura kelly d has also proposed giving a one time 250 tax rebate to residents who filed a tax return last year there are also governors who have proposed giving targeted payments for instance michigan gov gretchen whitmer d plans to use a 5 billion surplus in a state insurance fund to give drivers a 400 rebate to every vehicle they own new mexico gov michelle lujan grisham d is proposing a statewide cut in gross receipts taxes while connecticut gov ned lamont d has proposed reducing property taxes for residents many see california gov gavin newsom d as a good example of how handing out stimulus checks can help with re election efforts newsom who approved stimulus checks for about two thirds of golden state residents survived the recall attempt by a wide margin why is it a good policy it is very likely that these stimulus checks from governors will play a significant role in the campaign advertisements this year political experts believe giving stimulus checks is one of the best policies at a time when people desperately need economic support to counter rising inflation giving stimulus checks is also a good policy because it won t put any extra pressure on state finances states are mainly using the extra cash they got from the federal government in relief payments as well as the unanticipated tax revenue to give out stimulus checks it is not just the democratic governors that believe giving stimulus checks is an effective way to attract voters republicans have similar thinking as well but rather than handing out direct payments they are more in favor of indirect benefits such as tax cuts iowa gov kim reynolds r for instance has lowered the state s income tax this year while mississippi gov tate reeves r is pushing to eliminate the income tax altogether the governors of tennessee and georgia have also proposed tax rebates or credits updated on mar 10 2022 9 56 am

to justify invading ukraine vladimir putin has painted russia as a hegemonic power re asserting its rightful claim to imperial greatness yet even before the invasion russia s economic capabilities were hardly capable of sustaining an empire now with foreign sanctions presiding over a plummeting russian ruble russia s economic standing has fallen further still if measured at today s exchange rates russia s economy would be the 22nd largest in the world with a gross domestic product gdp not much larger than the state of ohio s that s a far cry from the past when russia was a true world power according to data assembled by the late economic historian angus maddison it was the fifth largest economy in the world in 1913 behind the united states china germany and britain by 1957 when the u s s r outpaced the united states to launch the first satellite into space the soviet economy was the world s second largest after america s putin s quest for greatness putin was elected president following the chaotic disintegration of the soviet union and the 1998 financial crisis in which russia defaulted on its debt and abandoned its fixed exchange rate at the time russia s market value gdp had bottomed out at us 210 billion making it the world s 24th largest economy behind austria all contemporary gdp figures are from the october 2021 world economic outlook published by the international monetary fund putin established an informal social contract with the russian people based on his ability to deliver strong economic growth under putin s rule and buoyed by a commodity price supercycle that would stretch well into the 21st century russia s gdp in market exchange rates rose tenfold returning russia to global relevance and providing purchasing power to its middle class however russia researchers argued that as russia s economy began to flag from a peak in 2013 putin sought new legitimacy to govern through foreign policy actions to re establish russia s status as a great power these efforts were epitomized by the crimean annexation of 2014 russia s invasion of ukraine against the backdrop of russia s market rate gdp losing a third of its value between 2013 and 2020 represents a doubling down of putin s strategy to seek legitimacy from great power status rather than economic performance yet the west s unrelenting financial and economic sanctions have only accelerated russia s economic downfall russian stocks traded on the u k market have fallen by 98 per cent wiping out us 572 billion of wealth while stocks on russian exchanges remain suspended the russian currency has fallen to 155 rubles per dollar a drop of more than 50 per cent from 75 rubles per u s dollar before the invasion if not for recent captial controls and the rising prices of commodities brought about by the sanctions themselves that make up the majority of russia s exports it would fall even further domino effect a country s market rate gdp is its gdp converted to a global currency like the u s dollar while there are other ways to measure gdp when it comes to global trade and investment and economic power the market rate is what matters russia s market rate gdp in 2021 was us 1 65 trillion enough to make it the world s 11th largest economy behind south korea if we crudely convert russia s 2021 estimated gdp by march 7 2022 currency rates rather than the average exchange rate used last year and place it against the 2021 market rate gdp table the rankings change and russia slides to 22nd place falling between taiwan and poland this drop is likely an underestimate while a falling ruble lowers russia s exchange rate of its gdp to u s dollars its weakening economy lowers its ruble gdp directly and russia s isolation will erode its economic competitiveness widening the economic gap further in the medium term ukrainians confronted with the oncoming russian army were wise to putin s chimeric strategy don t you have problems in your country to solve are you all rich there as in the emirates one elderly man heckled russian soldiers putin s next move robert f kennedy famously observed that gdp failed to account for many things that we care about like health and education the fall in russia s market rate gdp cannot begin to describe the human tragedy playing out in both ukraine and russia but what these figures do make clear is that putin s claim to legitimacy through economic performance is all but destroyed with great power status tied closely to economic power putin s back door source of legitimacy from stirring up nationalist pride now seems closed as well putin may have led russia from one times of troubles but he has delivered it to another one that s cold comfort to the ukrainians and indeed to the rest of the world who are wondering putin s next move
when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at popular prices the godfather at almost three hours could certainly have gone that route its klieg lighted celebrity studded charity gala on march 14 1972 was at the manhattan movie palace that had hosted the exclusive world premiere engagement of ben hur for 74 weeks though the once 3 300 seat loew s state theater had recently been remodeled as loew s state i and ii even cut in half it was still a prestigious house that the godfather could have filled indefinitely before letting other theaters join in but paramount had a different plan this is business not personal sonny it asked theater owners across the country to bid to play the film days after the premiere in return for an upfront non refundable monetary guarantee against 90 of the box office take whichever was greater theater owners would keep just 10 cents of every dollar that came into their box offices but it would be a lot of dimes with the novel a runaway bestseller competition among theater owners was fierce paramount ended up accepting more than 300 bids and when those lucky theater owners ponied up their up front guarantees the producers had more than 15 million in the till before opening night more than twice what they d spent making the picture and then the godfather opened and critics and audiences saw what coppola had wrought not an edward g robinson style gangster flick not even the mob potboiler puzo had written in his novel coppola had crafted a quasi shakespearean epic about a mob family in crisis it was the violent wrenching bloodily epic story of a dynasty giving way king corleone and his princes it was enormously emotional as producer robert evans remembers henry kissinger saying at the film s premiere here was brando playing a gangster who d killed hundreds of people and when he died the whole audience was crying a touch of greatness leave the gun take the cannoli associated press associated press actor al pacino and actress jill clayburgh attend the world premiere of the godfather in which he stars as michael corleone by the time the film opened nationwide 10 days later absolutely everyone was buying tickets though sometimes for odd reasons as dave berg of member station kcur told all things considered while reporting on the film s sold out but empty premiere at the empire theater in kansas city missouri according to giles fowler film critic for the kansas city star the godfather is a triumph of traditional storytelling cinema in an age that had just about forgotten such things but no matter nobody saw the film the italian american unification council of greater kansas city bought all 1 000 tickets for 2 500 so that the godfather would play to an empty house they also got a court injunction barring stan durwood the theater operator from scheduling a matinee that day and spoiling their optics for obvious reasons he was fine with that durwood said he s just happy with all the publicity the film is getting reported berg so the group got its optics the theater got its first of several sold out performances and what did audiences get a portrait of the mafia that felt real reportedly even to members of gang families also a raft of star making performances al pacino diane keaton robert duvall james caan and a story that reached the point where a conventional mob movie would end at about the 90 minute mark and still had half its story left to tell the half that thrilled i thought when it was your turn you would be the one to hold the strings critics were enthusiastic about the film s most daring departures from hollywood tradition quite apart from the realistic performances and ambiance here was a gangster epic told not as a morality tale from an outsiders point of view but with sympathy for and from the viewpoint of its central thoroughly amoral family that said there were things that were not altogether new that line everyone quotes about an offer someone can t refuse forrest taylor said it almost word for word to john wayne in the 1933 western riders of destiny a full three decades before the godfather novel was written and that swoony earworm of a love theme composer nino rota provided for the godfather sounded awfully familiar to folks who d seen eduardo de filippo s italian comedy fortunella 14 years earlier rota scored that one too but his bit of recycling cost him an oscar nod there wasn t enough time we ll get there pop the godfather received 11 oscar nominations though even those came with complications brando decided best actor was an honor he could refuse and sent apache representative sacheen littlefeather to decline it citing the treatment of native americans by the film industry al pacino also boycotted the ceremony it was reported at the time that he was annoyed at being nominated as supporting actor when he had more screen time than brando did though he now says that wasn t the case regardless it was just a temporary setback pacino got his best actor nomination for the godfather part ii all of which qualified as blood under the bridge as far as the audience was concerned the godfather was the no 1 film at the box office for 23 consecutive weeks in 1972 then spent one week at no 2 supplanted by the goldie hawn comedy butterflies are free before coming back for three more weeks at the top of the chart it earned 100 million faster than any film before it and having cost less than 7 million to make it was so profitable that the l a times reported the stock price of gulf western the huge conglomerate that owned paramount more than quadrupled from 77 cents a share to 3 30 a share the film also began an era in which coppola s generation ostensibly fed up with the studio system essentially took over the studio system three years after the godfather rewrote the rules of film exhibition steven spielberg made jaws which established a new pattern of even broader release augmented by a first ever national tv ad campaign two years after that george lucas rewrote the rules again with star wars old hollywood had met new the godfather had been the bridge and the dynasty had changed copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at popular prices the godfather at almost three hours could certainly have gone that route its klieg lighted celebrity studded charity gala on march 14 1972 was at the manhattan movie palace that had hosted the exclusive world premiere engagement of ben hur for 74 weeks though the once 3 300 seat loew s state theater had recently been remodeled as loew s state i and ii even cut in half it was still a prestigious house that the godfather could have filled indefinitely before letting other theaters join in but paramount had a different plan this is business not personal sonny it asked theater owners across the country to bid to play the film days after the premiere in return for an upfront non refundable monetary guarantee against 90 of the box office take whichever was greater theater owners would keep just 10 cents of every dollar that came into their box offices but it would be a lot of dimes with the novel a runaway bestseller competition among theater owners was fierce paramount ended up accepting more than 300 bids and when those lucky theater owners ponied up their up front guarantees the producers had more than 15 million in the till before opening night more than twice what they d spent making the picture and then the godfather opened and critics and audiences saw what coppola had wrought not an edward g robinson style gangster flick not even the mob potboiler puzo had written in his novel coppola had crafted a quasi shakespearean epic about a mob family in crisis it was the violent wrenching bloodily epic story of a dynasty giving way king corleone and his princes it was enormously emotional as producer robert evans remembers henry kissinger saying at the film s premiere here was brando playing a gangster who d killed hundreds of people and when he died the whole audience was crying a touch of greatness leave the gun take the cannoli associated press associated press actor al pacino and actress jill clayburgh attend the world premiere of the godfather in which he stars as michael corleone by the time the film opened nationwide 10 days later absolutely everyone was buying tickets though sometimes for odd reasons as dave berg of member station kcur told all things considered while reporting on the film s sold out but empty premiere at the empire theater in kansas city missouri according to giles fowler film critic for the kansas city star the godfather is a triumph of traditional storytelling cinema in an age that had just about forgotten such things but no matter nobody saw the film the italian american unification council of greater kansas city bought all 1 000 tickets for 2 500 so that the godfather would play to an empty house they also got a court injunction barring stan durwood the theater operator from scheduling a matinee that day and spoiling their optics for obvious reasons he was fine with that durwood said he s just happy with all the publicity the film is getting reported berg so the group got its optics the theater got its first of several sold out performances and what did audiences get a portrait of the mafia that felt real reportedly even to members of gang families also a raft of star making performances al pacino diane keaton robert duvall james caan and a story that reached the point where a conventional mob movie would end at about the 90 minute mark and still had half its story left to tell the half that thrilled i thought when it was your turn you would be the one to hold the strings critics were enthusiastic about the film s most daring departures from hollywood tradition quite apart from the realistic performances and ambiance here was a gangster epic told not as a morality tale from an outsiders point of view but with sympathy for and from the viewpoint of its central thoroughly amoral family that said there were things that were not altogether new that line everyone quotes about an offer someone can t refuse forrest taylor said it almost word for word to john wayne in the 1933 western riders of destiny a full three decades before the godfather novel was written and that swoony earworm of a love theme composer nino rota provided for the godfather sounded awfully familiar to folks who d seen eduardo de filippo s italian comedy fortunella 14 years earlier rota scored that one too but his bit of recycling cost him an oscar nod there wasn t enough time we ll get there pop the godfather received 11 oscar nominations though even those came with complications brando decided best actor was an honor he could refuse and sent apache representative sacheen littlefeather to decline it citing the treatment of native americans by the film industry al pacino also boycotted the ceremony it was reported at the time that he was annoyed at being nominated as supporting actor when he had more screen time than brando did though he now says that wasn t the case regardless it was just a temporary setback pacino got his best actor nomination for the godfather part ii all of which qualified as blood under the bridge as far as the audience was concerned the godfather was the no 1 film at the box office for 23 consecutive weeks in 1972 then spent one week at no 2 supplanted by the goldie hawn comedy butterflies are free before coming back for three more weeks at the top of the chart it earned 100 million faster than any film before it and having cost less than 7 million to make it was so profitable that the l a times reported the stock price of gulf western the huge conglomerate that owned paramount more than quadrupled from 77 cents a share to 3 30 a share the film also began an era in which coppola s generation ostensibly fed up with the studio system essentially took over the studio system three years after the godfather rewrote the rules of film exhibition steven spielberg made jaws which established a new pattern of even broader release augmented by a first ever national tv ad campaign two years after that george lucas rewrote the rules again with star wars old hollywood had met new the godfather had been the bridge and the dynasty had changed copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

dodging victims exposes pm raging is not only what the morrison government does it s also scott morrison s own style of reaction pm s fatal flaw floats to surface march 11 whether on the floor of the parliament or responding to a journalist morrison is all bullying blustering and hectoring it s unattractive unacceptable and boorish attack can be done skilfully and quietly paul keating destroyed cant hypocrisy and stupidity with mocking humour his weapon was the surgical scalpel morrison s is the blunt axe morrison s hiding from flood victims seems to suggest he is very aware of his inability to be a nice empathetic bloke trevor somerville illawong mr morrison three years ago you believed god sent you a miracle unfortunately you took that miracle for granted and wasted your opportunity to be a strong wise proactive leader following your belief system s reasoning further it now appears that god s wrath is raining down upon you as a result this year presuming god is still doing miracles another one will be a lot harder to come by pam timms suffolk park it is clear from waleed aly s article that scott morrison s fatal flaw is that he is a reactive prime minister who is incapable of planning and so while staggering from one disaster to another learns nothing from the experience whether it be building quarantine facilities or coping with climate change there has been a lack of serious planning so when the inevitable disasters occur morrison can only blame someone else or apologise peter nash fairlight what has been clearly shown by the nsw and federal governments reaction to the floods is the message behind the coalition s mantra of small government fend for yourself nicholas triggs katoomba seven to one shot to your correspondent s slightly selective defence of the

while searching for my herald letters march 11 george manojlovic mangerton evs could drive renewal in manufacturing sector your correspondent s letters march 11 raising the prospects of an electric vehicle industry in australia is wishful thinking under this government that would mean the government doing something pre emptive a word that is unknown in the conservative lexicon the coalition has done nothing at all of any note since it has been in office so why would it start now it s a shame because the prospects these days for manufacturing are much better than they were before everything was sent elsewhere cars these days are made robotically in large part and a robotic installation in australia once up and running would cost basically the same here as in say china labour costs would of course be higher however with the size of the buildings required the roof carrying capacity for solar produced energy may cover the cost of the power for the factory for free australia is crying out for new industry stewart copper maroubra your correspondents wonder why the federal government isn t promoting the use of evs simple it hasn t worked out an electorally palatable way to tax them yet adrian connelly springwood i ve got a great start up business idea for mike cannon brookes build an australian electric car i ll even waive my commission paul mangioni darlinghurst explain envoy there seem to be increasing calls to expel the russian ambassador in my view instead the government should summon him daily to the office of the prime minister and ask him to explain the latest atrocity in ukraine paul hewson clontarf qld peace corp to the rescue one way to increase the adf better pay and conditions needed in 38b adf recruitment drive experts march 11 would be to change its name to the peace corp as with former us president john f kennedy s organisation what a waste of personnel and hardware with 60 000 people exercising their ability to kill people between fighting

our news will be filled with opinions from politicians and their minions ducking and weaving blaming and finger pointing and promising the world to assure us that things will be better next time then i read the clear and hard hitting account by dr cam hollows i saw the flood destruction first hand where was our government march 11 of his experiences assisting in flood ravaged coraki that our fellow citizens are left to fend for themselves in the way described is shameful that in the face of such shame many of our politicians seem more interested in pr photoshoot stunts and blame shifting is depressing however we can all take comfort and pride in our fellow citizens who simply roll up their sleeves and get on with fixing things thank you cam peter robertson stanmore thank you cam hollows for your wonderful and selfless aid yes we all need to ask where government taxation is going if it can t be used more broadly for natural disasters remember that individual and other withholding taxes comprise close to 46 per cent of total estimated commonwealth revenue of 513 7 billion in 2019 2020 budget review 2019 2020 index we all want to help but the government cannot abrogate its responsibilities at such times of community need natalie mabbitt randwick where do our taxes go this idea that governments should only ever provide the bare minimum and any substantial help should be provided by volunteers and others in the community is nothing new for years now the smith family has been running ads urging us to help children living in poverty is preventing poverty and other forms of hardship not what we pay our taxes for the government s supporters seem to be those who prefer to pay as little as they can get away with which leaves them plenty in their pocket so they can help out in an emergency but these things are happening more frequently when does an occasional emergency become a regular occurrence david rush lawson history for sale your correspondent

regrettably had to kill them out of concern for my young grandchildren given the unimaginable clean up flood victims face the redbacks remind us it s time for a big outdoor clean up and the relative

your correspondent clearly shows the contrast between whitlam s immediate and effective use of the adf after cyclone tracy in 1974 and scott morrison s delayed and chaotic response now contrast also whitlam s belief that the role of government should be to reduce fear not raise it by introducing policies that would reduce the fear of unemployment the fear of being unable to afford health care and

the right thing to do cranberry twp around the nation financial and government institutions are pushing to withdraw from russian investments local officials think it s the right thing to do eric ditullio president of the seneca valley school board said the state s public school teachers retirement fund made the call in early march to divest from both russian and belarusian funds as russia invaded ukraine the board chairman of the public school employees retirement system or psers brought the idea to the full 15 member board of trustees according to ditullio ditullio serves on the board as a representative of the state school boards association given there are 15 members of the psers board ditullio said there are people with different political affiliations regardless he said there was no dissent in divesting from russian assets it was easy it was this is the right thing to do we have to do this what russia has done is wrong and there s no reason to be investing in a country that does something like this ditullio said it was universal agreement the retirement system had roughly 300 million invested in russian and belarusian assets as of june 30 2021 according to a psers report in early march psers trustees unanimously voted to dump those investments by any means necessary divesting from those assets ditullio said may be difficult given trading on the moscow exchange russia s stock market has been closed since feb 25 to be honest our fund managers for those were already divesting before we even made the decision to protect those investments ditullio said county indirectly divests in butler county divesting from russian and belarusian assets may be more difficult the county for its retirement system primarily invests in index funds which are portfolios of investments aimed at mirroring the average composition of a given market as of dec 31 according to county reports the county holds seven index funds that may include assets from those two countries five international equity or stock funds and two international bond funds all seven funds are from vanguard a pennsylvania based investment firm in sum butler county s retirement fund held roughly 58 5 million in international stock and bond index funds as of dec 31 comprising about one fifth of its total investments benjamin holland the county s controller did not immediately return a request seeking comment jack mcmillin who served in that position until 2014 said it s up to vanguard to divest from those assets that s a good question for the people at vanguard to ask if they ve divested mcmillin said let s say the vanguard international fund have they divested from russian holdings in that fund on march 7 the investment firm said it has only 0 01 of its assets in russian holdings has suspended the purchase of russian assets and is actively working to further reduce our exposure to russia and exit the positions across our index funds vanguard stands ready to apply further measures announced by governments against russia for its unprovoked attack on ukraine the company said why divest widespread efforts to divest from assets in a country for human rights abuses or war crimes are not unprecedented even on the state level in the 1980s according to the associated press colleges and universities sold and refused to purchase more assets based in south africa to protest apartheid the south african racial caste system more recently in the 2010s certain states sought to divest from venezuelan assets and pennsylvania law required the sale of iranian and sudanese investments the associated press reported mcmillin said there s no hard line at which investments must be sold but said there are reasons an investment fund like the county s would look at divesting i think you look real closely at human rights issues he said obviously the u s has no longer any kind of foreign relation with venezuela that in and of itself ought to be sufficient to say is this a country we want to be investing in ditullio called the psers divestment an easy choice noting a moral obligation to divest but adding there was a fiduciary reason to hold those investments in the first place it was the right thing to do it was an easy decision to make and as far as why we were doing it in the first place that s also the right thing to do to have a diverse portfolio investing in emerging markets and international funds ditullio said it made sense to have some money not a lot but some money invested in emerging markets and international funds in fact mcmillin said there was not just a reason to divest from russian assets he said there s no reason to hold any russian investments to be holding any kind of russian investments whether they be in bonds or equities today it s just abhorrent to think he said in some way shape or fashion you re indirectly subsidizing the horrible events that are taking place as we speak in ukraine it s not just a moral reason either the former controller said you re always as a fiduciary evaluating the risk and return of a holding whether it s a domestic stock or an international stock mcmillin said you certainly would want to weigh the risk of holding investments in a country that could have a revolution next weekend

when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at popular prices the godfather at almost three hours could certainly have gone that route its klieg lighted celebrity studded charity gala on march 14 1972 was at the manhattan movie palace that had

menafn the conversation a dispute between britain and france about fishing territories has escalated rapidly french authorities detained a british trawler on thursday october 28 and britain promptly summoned the french ambassador for talks you can listen to more articles from the conversation narrated by noa here the wider issue here is the licences now required under the new brexit arrangements french fishermen complain that many of their applications for these licences have been rejected especially by officials in jersey the french government has threatened to subject british fishing companies to obfuscating bureaucracy perhaps to bar british fishing vessels from french ports and even to cut off the power supply to the channel islands the british government meanwhile has threatened retaliatory measures it has put royal navy vessels on standby in case french fishermen try to blockade those islands discussions to solve the problem have seemingly got nowhere these events follow earlier protests and stand offs during brexit negotiations but they also have a longer history the most obvious comparison might be to the cod wars of the 1950s and 1970s when britain s role was reversed back then iceland ended a previous agreement with britain and excluded british fishermen from icelandic territorial waters yet conflicts about fishing date back even further than that the history of these arguments over territorial waters and access to maritime resources can help us to understand why these issues remain iconic for modern national identity and why the two governments have responded in such a dramatic way in the early 1600s for example the dutch republic possessed the biggest fishing fleet in europe one scottish lawyer william welwod wrote that their overfishing in the north sea threatened the marine stocks of the area but the interests of britain s rulers were more economic than ecological they wanted a slice of the action and to challenge dutch dominance the first stuart monarch who ruled over all of the british kingdoms james vi of scotland and i of england wales and ireland and his son charles i tried to impose new licences and taxes on dutch fishing vessels but the efforts of the royal navy at that time under funded ill equipped and inefficient to enforce this policy bordered on the farcical the nippier dutch ships literally sailed rings around their british pursuers the closed sea later in that century the british and dutch fought three wars for commercial and maritime supremacy these policies on fishing were thus part of a wider argument then raging about maritime sovereignty it was a debate that became foundational for modern international law the dispute started with the dutch lawyer and diplomat hugo grotius who wrote that nobody could control the sea or prevent others from fishing and trading grotius s book mare liberum the free sea was aimed at the portuguese empire which was trying to keep the dutch from trading in the indian ocean nevertheless his ideas also went down badly in britain encouraged by the stuart monarchs welwod and other writers most famously the lawyer and mp john selden responded to grotius in defence of britain s territorial waters selden s influential mare clausum the closed sea challenged grotius and drew on historical examples to show why states had a right to claim parts of the sea selden went back to the romans and greeks mentioned contemporary states like venice and trawled medieval english history for suitable but often dubious precedents including the saxon king alfred selden made much of alfred s shipbuilding programme recorded in various saxon chronicles but these accounts were most likely exaggerated alfred s naval activities were much less successful than his sympathetic chroniclers made out nevertheless even popular culture has involved rewriting history to justify british claims on the sea the famous song rule britannia now repeated each year at the last night of the proms was written in the 18th century as part of a court masque that portrayed alfred again rather questionably as a naval hero supposedly setting britain on its path to maritime destiny these ideas were of course easily manipulated for realpolitik when the dutch in their turn tried to bar the british from trading in the indian ocean british negotiators quoted grotius s writing at their dutch counterparts one of whom ironically was grotius himself grotius also changed his mind about openness to a degree when exile from the netherlands led him to serve the king of sweden another monarch with strong views on maritime sovereignty opening up by the 18th century these disputes had resulted in a broad agreement about territorial waters in europe the three mile limit based on the range of a cannon shot together with a general acceptance that the sea should otherwise be open throughout the 18th and 19th centuries with the british empire expanding and aggressively seeking new markets the british government embraced the idea of free seas while britain s rulers did not abandon the idea of territorial waters those who interrupted british trade often through claims to their own maritime sovereignty were branded as pirates and often destroyed the british empire alamy these concerns arose again through the 20th century both through the development of weapons with a range exceeding three miles and with the increasing significance of access to undersea oil and other natural resources some countries have claimed territorial waters extending 200 miles out to sea and while the united nations convention on the law of the sea of 1982 aimed to resolve some of these issues and was influenced in part by the cod wars several nations including the united states have never formally ratified it if the current dispute about fishing revisits these earlier arguments in some ways there is also one important difference in the 17th and 18th centuries fishing was economically vital to britain by 2019 the sector had declined to just 0 02 of the national economy it is also dependent on cooperation with the eu with almost half of the uk s annual catch exported there the uncompromising position of both the british and french governments in this dispute might therefore seem excessive it does however reflect the continued symbolic status of both fishing and maritime sovereignty a status that has been repeatedly debated since at least the 17th century
when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at

russian forces inched towards kyiv and pounded civilian areas in other ukrainian cities friday drawing warnings of unimaginable tragedy as the us and the eu moved to tighten the economic noose around the kremlin sixteen days after moscow shocked the world by invading ukraine the united nations and others said it may be committing war crimes in cities such as mariupol which for days now has been besieged by vladimir putin s forces on friday officials in the southern port said more than 1 500 people have been killed during 12 days of russian siege survivors have been trying to flee russian bombardment in a freezing city left without water or heating and running out of food the situation is desperate a doctors without borders official said hundreds of thousands of people are for all intents and purposes besieged stephen cornish one of those heading the medical charity s ukraine operation told afp in an interview sieges are a medieval practice that have been outlawed by the modern rules of war for good reason as russia widens its bombardment and talks between moscow and kyiv seemingly go nowhere ukrainian president volodymr zelensky s pleas for nato to intervene have grown increasingly desperate but on friday us president joe biden again ruled out direct action against nuclear armed russia warning that it would lead to world war iii instead washington added more layers of sanctions to those already crippling russia s economy this time ending normal trade relations and announcing a ban on signature russian goods vodka seafood and diamonds the us and the european union also suspended the export of their luxury goods to russia putin must pay the price he cannot pursue a war that threatens the very foundation of international peace and stability and then ask for help from the international community biden said from the white house he spoke as the united nations said some 2 5 million people have now fled ukraine and around two million more have been internally displaced by the war nobody buries them yulia a 29 year old teacher who fled mariupol said her mother in law was still there and told them the attacks don t stop there are many corpses on the street and nobody buries them she told afp in ukraine s second city kharkiv doctors at a hospital described spending two days pumping ash from the stomach of an eight year old child whose home was blasted by a russian missile he still has cinders in his lungs dima kasyanov s doctor told afp dnipro an industrial hub of one million inhabitants saw its image as a relatively safe haven shattered when three missiles hit civilian buildings friday images of its charred or destroyed buildings including a kindergarten with windows blown out now join those from kharkiv and mariupol as testimony to the brutal conflict today we were supposed to host people who need a lot of support said svetlana kalenecheko who lives and works in a clinic that was damaged now we can t help anyone the attacks on civilians prompted a new flurry of warnings from the hague and the united nations friday that russia is committing war crimes we are really heading towards an unimaginable tragedy cornish of doctors without borders warned insisting that there is still time to avoid it and we must see it avoided catastrophe meanwhile the kremlin is slowly surrounding kyiv with ukrainian presidential adviser mykhailo podolyak calling it a city under siege he tweeted that it was ready to fight with checkpoints prepared and supply lines in place adding kyiv will stand until the end the ukrainian military has said russia is trying to take out kyiv s defences to the north and west where suburbs including irpin and bucha have already endured days of heavy bombardment russian armoured vehicles are also advancing on the capital s northeast as the slow but steady advance continues so has the tide of refugees around 100 000 people have been able to leave the northeastern city of sumy the eastern city of izyum and areas northwest of kyiv in the last two days ukrainian officials said zelensky warned living conditions were deteriorating fast in the sumy kyiv and donetsk regions there is no more electricity yes there are problems with heating there is no gas no water he said it s a humanitarian catastrophe murderers from syria foreign combatants have already entered the ukrainian conflict on both sides and on friday the kremlin ramped up efforts to bring in reinforcements particularly from syria a furious zelensky accused russia of hiring murderers from syria a country where everything has been destroyed like they are doing here to us the global ripple effects of the conflict continued elsewhere last minute russian demands related to the conflict threatened to derail the near complete process of reviving the iranian nuclear deal friday and the fighting spurred vows to bolster the european union s defences with eu leaders describing the invasion as a wake up call there s no denying the fact that two weeks ago we woke up in a different europe in a different world european council chief charles michel said russia also moved friday to block instagram and launch a criminal case against its owner meta as moscow fired back at the tech giant for allowing posts calling for violence against russian forces we will not fight talks have so far made no progress towards ending the fighting putin has said that negotiations are being held almost daily and us and european stock markets rose friday on his comments that there had been certain positive shifts but us vice president kamala harris speaking in bucharest said the russian leader has shown no sign of engaging in serious diplomacy at the united nations western countries accused russia of spreading wild conspiracy theories after moscow s envoy told diplomats that america and ukraine had researched using bats to conduct biological warfare the us envoy said russia had made the claims as part of a false flag effort for using chemical weapons of its own in ukraine biden warned russia would pay a severe price if it used chemical weapons but he again carefully steered clear of any indication that such an attack would be a red line that could draw direct us military action we will not fight a war against russia in ukraine he said burs st bgs
oreoluwa olomodosi 21 graduated with first class honours from the university of york united kingdom where she studied economics and finance she speaks to tunde ajaja about her motivation and strategy what have you been doing since you left school due to the pandemic i organised online classes for the three members of lattice club a club for girls from low income families which i managed remotely my motivation was for them to have access to quality education which would help them get a good job and ultimately break the cycle of poverty in their families i believe education is one of the most important ways to empower a woman and i am constantly motivated to help every member of the club achieve their dreams because i don t believe family background should limit a girl child whenever i m not studying or working i spend my time volunteering to mentor the girls i didn t want the pandemic to stop them from learning so i provided them with data to join classes i also prepared them for their university and scholarship application to pan atlantic university and three girls were awarded 98 per cent tuition scholarships to attend university i had previously set up an online revision programme for 20 girls preparing for the west african senior school certificate examination so i have been engaged with these volunteer works till i resumed my job in september 2020 have you always wanted to study economics and finance i got attracted to economics when i started taking the class in ss1 the teacher was very good and she made the subject very interesting and easy to understand i have always had an entrepreneurial spirit i learnt vocational skills like hairdressing bead making and making african prints so right from junior school i would sell anything i had in excess i baked cakes to sell as well as ankara fabric in the university i was a popular hairstylist for black students on campus and it was very lucrative because there were not many black hairdressers in the city i lived in i used some of my earnings to support the girls i spoke about earlier with my interest in entrepreneurship i knew economics would give me a good foundation to run a successful business in the future what would you tie your success to i would tie my success to god he was the one who gave me the grace to do so well my secondary school lagoon school also played a big role in my success the teachers instilled in me various virtues including hard work discipline and orderliness and they always pushed us to be the best this laid the foundation for me to succeed in the university there are students who believe that one needs to read at every given opportunity for one to make first class was that the situation in your case no and i will not advise anyone to read throughout their time in the university i think university is not just about academic work students should focus on their academic work but they should participate in other activities they should also build leadership and soft skills some of the skills one needs in the workplace are not learnt in the classroom but through experience i m happy with the much i was able to do in school i was both an international student ambassador and economics student ambassador i facilitated open days taking prospective students and parents on tour of the university and talking to prospective students online on behalf of the university i was the treasurer of york university nigerian society where we ran bi weekly events and nigerians and other nationals could come to socialise and learn more about the nigerian culture it was a safe space and always felt like home with the popular nigerian dishes present at our events laughs what are your aspirations i have always planned to work for a strategy consulting firm because of my interest in consulting and finance and now i work with kpmg after having conversations with many consultants coupled with my work experience at york community consulting i realised that i enjoy solving problems communicating with stakeholders and the variety in the work that consulting offers i have done various internships in corporate organisations like shell stanbic ibtc and deloitte with that i leveraged my expanded network by connecting the girls with young professionals who mentor them in addition i am passionate about education especially for the girl child i will continue to volunteer my time to causes that improve the educational outcomes for girls from low income families in nigeria someday i hope to build a successful non profit organisation to help more girls access quality education funding and scholarship opportunities my long term goal is to help reform education systems around the world starting with nigeria you mentioned that you had a wonderful time studying volunteering and taking up leadership roles in societies and departments can you expatiate on this i joined the university s volunteering group called york students in schools it was a scheme set up by the university s volunteering department where students could volunteer to tutor underperforming students in local secondary schools who would otherwise not be able to afford private tutors as a member of this group i tutored general certificate of secondary education students from low income backgrounds who were underperforming in mathematics it was very rewarding seeing their improvement each week and how their attitude towards mathematics changed the most rewarding moment for me was during an event when my student introduced me to her mum as her tutor she had been talking about her mum kept expressing her gratitude about how much i had impacted her daughter meanwhile to help the young girls cultivate the spirit of volunteering i coordinated them to carry out an annual community service project in a rural community where they taught 20 young people about hygiene recycling and basic culinary skills i also organised a three week workshop for primary six students on the art of marketing after a year of tutoring them i took up a managerial role where i helped to promote volunteering by speaking at events and running information sessions i also volunteered in my department as a peer assisted learning leader where i taught first year students who were struggling with statistics how did you combine these with your academic work in my first week in the university an older student advised me to divide my day into three parts eight hours for sleep eight hours for studying and eight hours for fun and extracurricular activities that was how i structured my week days most societies had their activities in the evening and by then i would have completed my eight hours of studying i would then spend the rest of the evening participating in the societies i was interested in or catching up with friends i also loved reading in the library as there was less distraction if i didn t have classes i would study in the library till evening how easy was it for you to graduate with first class honours i would say it was challenging it was a new way of learning especially in my first year coming from the nigerian education system it took some time to get used to the british system but there was a lot of support provided by my university in various forms and that made the transition a bit easier it was also challenging because i tried to balance my academic work with extracurricular activities i wanted a wholesome university experience and to have the best chance of getting a job after graduation in the uk you need to attend networking and career events right from the first year i was conscious of that would you say first class was a goal or your hard work simply paid off getting a first class was a goal i set for myself i knew it was attainable because in secondary school and foundation school i was one of the best students so i planned towards it by making sure i was consistent with studying and not leaving things till the last minute i also utilised my lecturers office hours by seeking clarifications if i needed to you expressed gratitude to your family members friends and mentors for their help what specific roles did they play in your achievement my family really supported me especially during the covid 19 lockdown when i had to study from home my parents always encouraged me and provided me with all i needed to succeed when i told them i graduated with first class they were elated and even more excited than me laughs they were proud of me and glad that my efforts paid off i also remember they told everyone who cared to listen that their daughter made a first class i m glad i did not disappoint them and their investment in my education was not a waste what about your mentors they also played a huge role in my university experience by pushing me to attain my full potential they guided me in applying for scholarships internships and graduate jobs they also supported me in my academic journey by teaching me how to write better essays and connecting me with people in their network who could teach me any subject i was struggling with furthermore they supported me with my volunteering initiatives in nigeria by giving their time and money and inviting some of their friends to join in volunteering having mentors literally changed my life i met them at the first internship i did and since then they have supported me every step of the way i used to be very shy but my mentors helped me to become more ambitious and bold what role did your friends play they helped me to settle in the uk and adjust to the cultural differences they also motivated me throughout my time in school i tried to interact and connect with as many people as possible but i made sure my circle of close friends shared similar values with me and had things i could learn from them meeting people from different parts of the world was an interesting experience i learnt about different cultures it also taught me how to communicate with people from different backgrounds and cultures and i learnt to respect people s ideas and opinions even if i do not agree with them what were your most memorable moments one of such moments as an undergraduate was when i got the york futures scholarship for outstanding academic and extracurricular achievement another one was when i was selected by boston consulting group to attend an all expense paid workshop in spain it was amazing connecting with successful women from around the world and learning more about consulting also seeing the kids i tutored improve in mathematics was also a memorable moment for me you said you led a book drive that raised 400 books to stock the library and provide textbooks for the members of the club how was it when i started teaching the girls i realised they did not have the textbooks they needed to study i found that most students from my secondary school had no use for their textbooks after they graduated i was right i went on the social media to make posts about it and i sent messages to my old classmates encouraging them to donate the textbooks they no longer used the turnout was great and i was able to raise over 400 textbooks since the book drive the word has spread and people have continued to donate textbooks after every academic session some students see being in a relationship as a distraction while some feel otherwise what do you think i think it is important to know yourself and what works for you while some students manage their relationship well some others don t and it ends up being a distraction it is also necessary to set boundaries if you decide to be in a relationship this was something i saw my friends do and they succeeded in their academic pursuit while having thriving relationships

when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at popular prices the godfather at almost three hours could certainly have gone that route its klieg lighted celebrity studded charity gala on march 14 1972 was at the manhattan movie palace that had hosted the exclusive world premiere engagement of ben hur for 74 weeks though the once 3 300 seat loew s state theater had recently been remodeled as loew s state i and ii even cut in half it was still a prestigious house that the godfather could have filled indefinitely before letting other theaters join in but paramount had a different plan this is business not personal sonny it asked theater owners across the country to bid to play the film days after the premiere in return for an upfront non refundable monetary guarantee against 90 of the box office take whichever was greater theater owners would keep just 10 cents of every dollar that came into their box offices but it would be a lot of dimes with the novel a runaway bestseller competition among theater owners was fierce paramount ended up accepting more than 300 bids and when those lucky theater owners ponied up their up front guarantees the producers had more than 15 million in the till before opening night more than twice what they d spent making the picture and then the godfather opened and critics and audiences saw what coppola had wrought not an edward g robinson style gangster flick not even the mob potboiler puzo had written in his novel coppola had crafted a quasi shakespearean epic about a mob family in crisis it was the violent wrenching bloodily epic story of a dynasty giving way king corleone and his princes it was enormously emotional as producer robert evans remembers henry kissinger saying at the film s premiere here was brando playing a gangster who d killed hundreds of people and when he died the whole audience was crying a touch of greatness leave the gun take the cannoli associated press associated press actor al pacino and actress jill clayburgh attend the world

when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at popular prices the godfather at almost three hours could certainly have gone that route its klieg lighted celebrity studded charity gala on march 14 1972 was at the manhattan movie palace that had hosted the exclusive world premiere engagement of ben hur for 74 weeks though the once 3 300 seat loew s state theater had recently been remodeled as loew s state i and ii even cut in half it was still a prestigious house that the godfather could have filled indefinitely before letting other theaters join in but paramount had a different plan this is business not personal sonny it asked theater owners across the country to bid to play the film days after the premiere in return for an upfront non refundable monetary guarantee against 90 of the box office take whichever was greater theater owners would keep just 10 cents of every dollar that came into their box offices but it would be a lot of dimes with the novel a runaway bestseller competition among theater owners was fierce paramount ended up accepting more than 300 bids and when those lucky theater owners ponied up their up front guarantees the producers had more than 15 million in the till before opening night more than twice what they d spent making the picture and then the godfather opened and critics and audiences saw what coppola had wrought not an edward g robinson style gangster flick not even the mob potboiler puzo had written in his novel coppola had crafted a quasi shakespearean epic about a mob family in crisis it was the violent wrenching bloodily epic story of a dynasty giving way king corleone and his princes it was enormously emotional as producer robert evans remembers henry kissinger saying at the film s premiere here was brando playing a gangster who d killed hundreds of people and when he died the whole audience was crying a touch of greatness leave the gun take the cannoli associated press associated press actor al pacino and actress jill clayburgh attend the world premiere of the godfather in which he stars as michael corleone by the time the film opened nationwide 10 days later absolutely everyone was buying tickets though sometimes for odd reasons as dave

on the morning of feb 24 i woke up to about 60 messages the first message i laid eyes on contained three words russia attacked ukraine from a friend in america scrolling down i saw a message from an investment manager of an australian fund for whom i consult which contained a terse you were right i wondered if russia could have really have attacked rushing to my computer i read news from bloomberg and the financial times and realized yes russia had attacked ukraine the financial times reported that russian forces had stormed ukraine along three axes from the north south and east a few days earlier my investment director friend two business acquaintances and i had engaged in a heated debate over whether we should invest in oil at 91 a barrel as a precautionary measure in case russia attacked ukraine at that moment people still believed russia would not invade ukraine most people thought russia would not dare because the economic damage would be terrible i was also hesitant but i was more worried about what would happen if russia invaded ukraine my view then was that everyone was thinking about this so i wondered what we would do if russia attacked our investment positions could suffer heavy losses if we didn t prepare for that situation in the end we came together and agreed to act defensively increase our cash reserves and close out other investments we had made when we were betting russia would not attack we opened an investment position in oil at the distasteful price of 91 a barrel fortunately i was correct but it doesn t matter if i was right or wrong or if we made money or not what mattered was that i have learned many things from this conflict in ukraine the first thing i learned was that nothing is certain in conflicts like this before today said there was no way russia would dare invade president joe biden predicted an attack merely to put pressure on russia and as a distraction because this was a war no one wanted to fight biden was merely posturing when the financial markets breathed a sigh of relief after biden announced moderate economic sanctions on feb 22 people believed the matter was finished that the ukrainian affair might as well be over and it would not further affect the market barely two days after i read that assessment russia sent forces to attack ukraine the financial markets in europe continue to burn people may reach certain conclusions based on the analysis of a few professionals sitting in an air conditioned room thousands of miles away from the conflict zone where they write about developments in ukraine many researchers offer sophisticated political opinions that are worth considering and i buy those reports too but i don t completely believe one side or the other and i also dare not reach final conclusions like they do for example one of the reasons i was anxious russia would attack ukraine was based on the viewpoints of political scientist john mearsheimer which were translated by nguyen xuan hoai and published in international studies the following point particularly caught my attention russia does not want a western bulwark on its doorstep which is perfectly logical from russia s perspective i don t understand why so many in the west can t grasp this simple fact we in america have the monroe doctrine which states very clearly no great power may establish a military alliance with any nation in the western hemisphere and garrison troops there the russians have their own version of this doctrine and are currently trying to apply it this crisis is the direct result of the foolish decisions of the u s and its allies planning for ukraine s accession into nato mearsheimer wrote i am not a political scientist capable of commenting on the monroe doctrine but i paid special attention to the point about a western bulwark on russia s doorstep the media all but ignored or downplayed this point as did political and financial analyses i read there may have been a word or two in the economist before its writers turned to what the west was doing to prevent the war and the price russia would have to pay if it attacked ukraine so the risk based on analysis clearly existed but people just ignored it why i think we can account for this if you consider the views of psychologist daniel kahneman winner of the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences in his book noise a flaw in human judgment co written with olivier sibony and cass sunstein one of the most powerful ideas in this book is that humans often make incorrect judgments or decisions because they are influenced by two factors bias and noise using a formula that posits bias plus noise equals error since many people have biases about american power and nato because russia feared doing damage to its economy and with opinions and decision making shaped by the news media and other commentary about russia s actions there may have been decisions based on the wrong initial assessment and the bias from the initial mistake continues to grow preconceptions about russia about the u s about russian president vladimir putin and about biden mean that people are not looking at the problem objectively anymore as a result people have made investment decisions such as betting on ukraine when they should have reflected soberly about the fact anything could happen and with that in mind found appropriate ways to defend against risk since i know how to be afraid how to say i don t know and remain calm and keep cool i firmly bet in one direction it made a huge difference and helped me keep my money during this period the second thing i learned is even more important you cannot rely on economic sanctions or the protection of a large military force in the hope that a major nation will not pick a war with small country in pursuing its own national interests the russian stock market fell by nearly half the value of the ruble plummeted and yet putin still remained committed to invading and nato did not send troops into ukraine that s the root of putin s bet on with respect to the incursion i say this to show that nothing can prevent an ambitious great power from doing the thing its leaders believe is in the best interest of the country and no one can count on the west to play peace keeper the best way to defend one s interests is to become powerful and stand on one s own two feet instead of relying on overseas investment and depending on preferential foreign aid if you do that no one will dare to repeat the gamble that was made in ukraine editor s note although accurately translated this quoted material could not be independently verified

from goldmoney insights tragic though the situation in ukraine has become the real war which started out as financial in character some time ago has now become both financial and about commodities putin made a huge mistake invading ukraine but the west s reaction by seeking to isolate russia and its commodity exports from the global marketplace is an even greater one furthermore with ukraine being europe s breadbasket and a major exporter of fertiliser this summer will bring acute food shortages worsened by china having already accumulated the bulk of the world s grains for its own population inflation measured by consumer prices has only just commenced an accelerated rise because they discount falling purchasing power for currencies rising interest rates and collapsing bond prices are now inevitable being loaded up with bonds and financial assets as collateral the consequences for the global banking system are so significant that it is virtually impossible to see how it can survive and if the banking system faces collapse being unbacked by anything other than rapidly disappearing faith in them fiat currencies will fail as well unforeseen financial and economic consequences back in the 1960s harold wilson as an embattled british prime minister declared that a week is a long time in politics today we can also comment it is a long time in commodity markets stock markets geopolitics and almost anything else we care to think of the rapidity of change may not be captured in just seven calendar days but in recent weeks we have seen the initial pricking of the fiat currency bubble and all that floats with it this is turning out to be an extreme financial event the background to it is unwinding of economic distortions through a combination of currency and credit expansion and market suppression the difference between state controlled pricing and market reality has never been greater zero and negative interest rates deeply negative real bond yields and a deliberate policy of artificial wealth creation by fostering a financial asset bubble to divert attention from a deepening economic crisis in recent years have all contributed to the gap between bullish expectations and market reality today almost no one thinks that our blessèd central banks and their governments can fail let alone lose control over markets and if you walk like a keynesian talk like a keynesian you are a keynesian everyone does even the gait of mathematical monetarists is indistinguishable from them in their support of inflationism and keynesians believe in the state theory of everything despising markets and now fearing their reality this week sees growing concerns that american led attempts to kick putin s ass comes with consequences put to one side the destruction wreaked on the ukrainian people as the two major military nations wage yet another proxy war this one is in europe s breadbasket driving wheat prices over 50 higher so far this year having laid waste over successive arab nations since saddam hussein invaded kuwait in 1990 the people who have survived american led wars in the middle east and north africa and not emigrated as refugees are now going to face starvation fuelled by the expansion of currency and credit it is not just wheat prices which are soaring other foodstuffs are as well and we learn through various sources that the chinese have been prescient enough to stockpile enormous quantities of grains and other comestible materials to protect their citizens from a summer food crisis twenty per cent of the world s population has secured more than half the globe s maize and other grains nikkei asia 23 december see figure 1 and that was two months before putin ordered the invasion of ukraine which has made the position over global food supplies even worse and china s dominant position in maize will hit sub saharan africa especially hard while global shortages of rice will hit southern and east asian nations all we need now is crop failures speaking of which fertiliser shortages exacerbated by the ukraine war and high gas prices are bound to affect global food production adversely for this year s harvest and well done to our elected leaders for imposing sanctions on russian exports of fertiliser which added to china s conservation of its supplies will ensure our poor and everyone else s poor face soaring food prices and even starvation in 2022 yet few seem aware of this developing crisis while ukraine is an obvious factor driving up food and energy prices the root cause has been and will continue to be monetary policies driving the leading currencies history is littered with examples of currency debasement leading to a food crisis and civil unrest the emperor diocletian s edict controlling prices in 301ad coin debasement leading to soaring food prices in 1124ad at the time of england s henry i the collapse of john law s livre in 1720 france to name but a few from the dollar as the reserve currency to euros yen pounds and the rest all of them have been debased in what used to be called the civilised world and an understanding of money and the empirical evidence both point to a consequential food crisis this summer read the rest of this much longer article here

hilton philadelphia at penn s landing philadelphia pennsylvania 12 41 p m est the president applause please thank you very much thank you please sit down please i ve been to enough senate caucuses and democratic retreats to know that when the last speaker is up you want to get the hell out of here laughter no matter who it is but thank you look folks let me begin by saying that when i ran and a lot of you helped me a lot of good people ran i made it clear i was running for three reasons and because i had no intention of running for office again when i left the vice presidency but when i saw those folks come out of those fields down in charlottesville carrying torches and singing nazi slogans and carrying swastikas and white supremacists i decided to get engaged the point is this i had a message which i didn t consult with anybody about generating to begin with which was not viewed as being very saleable the first was that i thought it was essential to literally restore the soul of this country a sense of decency and honor a sense of a sense that you could trust one another just restore the soul of the country because what we were seeing was not who we are and among some of our republicans what they re saying is still not who we are the second thing i wanted to do that has been the essence of my whole career from the time i ran 20 miles from here a 29 year old kid for the senate was that i wanted to rebuild the backbone of the country and the backbone of the country is the working class and middle class i m so sick and tired of trickle down when the middle class does well the poor have a way up and the wealthy do just fine they do just fine and third thing which a lot of you didn t like i know i thought we had to unify the country because ultimately we are a democracy and there needs to be for it to work there has to be consensus in a consensus you got to get a majority we ve not been able to do that for a lot of the important things that s why we have to continue to maintain our majority this off year election in my view may be the most important off year election in modern history because we know what happens we know the fundamental change that shifts if we lose the house and the senate the only thing i ll have then is a veto pen and so folks i want to thank nancy for the introduction for your friendship all these years nance and paul thank you as well and i want to thank the extraordinary job you ve done delivering the omnibus just like you delivered so many critical pieces of legislation last year and hakeem and steny and jim and emanuel cleaver and pete congresswoman katherine clark and all of you out there let me first say that i want to say thank you thank you for the support you ve provided ukraine i was on the phone today for a better part of an hour with with zelenskyy who i speak to almost daily the people of ukraine have demonstrated a remarkable source of bravery and courage but the security assistance that you ve provided has been absolutely critical critical in their defense second i want to thank you for showing a unified front to the world when putin unleashed his assault he thought he could divide nato he thought he could literally divide this country the west the united states in terms of the parties i know a former ambassador knows that out there he thought he could divide democrats and republicans at home but he failed he failed for months the united states has worked tirelessly to keep our allies and partners together as our former ambassador who you see on television a lot thank god will tell you i ve spent literally hours and hours and hours and hours keeping the alliance together the eu nato and all of our allies including our asian allies as a result we ve been able to ramp up our economic pressure on putin and further isolate russia on the global stage this morning along with the g7 nations in germany canada france italy japan and the united kingdom we moved which i know you wanted to do initially and nancy i drove her crazy on most favored nation status as we call it in the united states permanent normal trade relations and eliminate them applause but folks i know i ve occasionally frustrated you but more important than us moving when we want to is making sure all of nato is together is together they have different vulnerabilities than we do just like in the oil embargo a lot of them could not the only way i was it took i think you know weeks to work out i said we re going to block oil russian oil energy and energy we consume 15 percent of it they rely totally on it without russian oil they re going to find themselves in a position where they get choked off in a way that far exceeds anything we do anything we do so it took a long time sitting with my counterparts and saying look we re going to block oil but i m not going to ask you to do it i m going to say to you you do what you can i m going to explain why it s not rational for you to do the same thing in the meantime we re going to help you get energy through liquefied natural gas and a whole range of other things the point is revoking pntr for russia has made it harder for russia to do business with the united states but in doing it with unison with our allies that kept together make up half the global economy half of it is a crushing blow to russia along with our partners and allies we ve stepped up pressure on corrupt russian billionaires we re increasing we re increasing coordination among the g7 countries and to target capture the ill begotten gains the yachts you see some of these yachts 450 feet long no i m serious hundreds of millions of dollars in value their luxury apartments the totality of our economic sanctions and export controls are crushing crushing the russian economy the ruble has lost and i know many of you know this in detail lost more than half its value you know what the value of a ruble is versus a dollar you need 200 rubles to equal 1 dollar today 200 the moscow stock exchange is closed for a simple reason i get asked well why is it closed because for the last two weeks because the moment it opens it will be disbanded you hear me it will blow up credit rating agencies have downgraded russia s government to junk status junk status and the list of private businesses and international corporations leaving russia is growing day by day by day i want to be clear though we re going to make sure ukraine has the weapons to defend themselves from invading russian force applause and we will send money and food aid to save euro ukrainian lives we re going to welcome ukrainian refugees with open arms if in fact they come all the way here applause and as we provide as we provide this support to ukraine we re going to continue to stand together with our allies in europe and send an unmistakable message that we will defend every inch of nato territory every single inch with a united galvanized nato one movement that s why i ve moved over 12 000 american forces along the borders with russia latvia estonia lithuania romania et cetera because they move once granted if we respond it is world war three but we have a sacred obligation on nato territory a sacred obligation article 5 and we will not although we will not fight the third world war in ukraine putin s war against ukraine is never going to be a victory democrats are rising to meet the moment relying rallying the world on the side of peace and security we are showing a strength and we ll never falter but look the idea the idea that we re going to send in offensive equipment and have planes and tanks and trains going in with american pilots and american crews just understand and don t kid yourself no matter what you all say that s called world war three okay let s get it straight here guys that old expression don t kid a kidder now i d like to speak to our broader purpose here today to remind everybody where we were a year ago where we ve gotten since the direction we re headed in and all of you know that today is the anniversary as nancy said since we passed the american rescue plan within the first month in office thank god thank god you did it was it anybody s thought we re going to pass a bill that s 1 trillion 900 billion dollars we re going to do that yeah you did it i asked and you did it few pieces of legislation no hyperbole in american history have done more to lift this country out of a crisis than what you did it took about 2 million americans before i was before i was sworn in 2 million americans had been vaccinated today because of the efforts you ve what you ve voted for we have more than 215 million americans fully vaccinated you all remember the lines of cars you remember nice looking cars stretched for hours and hours to inaudible just to get a box of food well guess what stretching those miles and miles no longer is happening that box of food is not only in the table in the trunk because of that law 41 million people put food on their table and are putting it on the table who wouldn t have been able to applause because of that law we helped to keep a roof over 4 million people s heads who were about to be evicted applause and we gave families what my dad used to call just a little breathing room just a little bit of breathing room because we took action we created we created 6 7 million jobs last year more than any other time in american history and we haven t stopped last month we created over 7 678 000 jobs in february to get us well over 7 million jobs applause unemployment is down 3 8 percent the economy grew 5 7 percent the best economic growth in the last four decades and the leading financial firm on wall street moody s estimates that because of the rescue plan 4 million more jobs were created unemployment is 2 percent lower than it would have been and had we failed to act and it didn t cause the inflation look there s more to the story than that many of you remember when we went through the last financial crisis in 2008 i had the dubious distinction of the president standing before all of you and said and sheriff joe is going take care of the recovery act laughter well guess what the economy recovered but underneath the recovery just like the re like every other recovery in our history there was a lot of pain a lot of pain republicans in congress refused to give president obama the additional recovery funds he asked for and the truth is a lot of folks never got back on their feet a whole lot of young people saw their futures dimmed diminished they didn t get back on track and what s economists called the economic scarring that occurred as a consequence of that recession the chronic pain when an economy comes back but some of the folks who were left behind were left behind almost permanently trapped in long term unemployment evictions and foreclosures study after study showed that when you re stuck in that cycle it has the worst impact on your emotional health and that of your children and your family members that you can imagine and that s serious so when i came to office in the midst of this crisis i was determined not to let that happen together we made the choice to ask for all that we needed to leave nobody behind to minimize the pain and the hopelessness and the despair that so many had just lost their jobs lost everything through no fault of their own and look what happened it isn t just that the unemployment rate has dropped at a record pace we ve also seen the biggest drop in long term unemployment ever recorded in american history applause nearly 2 5 million americans have got to break out of that cycle of long term unemployment we ve seen the most significant drop in black and hispanic unemployment ever recorded black employment fell by more than 30 percent hispanic fell hispanic employment unemployment fell by 9 percent to 4 4 percent we ve seen the lowest child poverty rate ever recorded 40 percent decline in child poverty applause the lowest num the lower number of harm forcl home foreclosures ever recorded down to less than a third of what they were we were before the pandemic record low credit card delinquencies because families had money in their pockets the list goes on we ve got a long way to go though i m not saying we re over we re just getting going and a lot of work to do but never forget what we ve accomplished together so far and by the way the american people just trying to stay above water don t understand this you tell them what the american recovery act was and they look at you like what are you talking about understandably they re like my family mom dad four kids grandpop living in the house in a three bedroom split level home just every single day figuring out how you put enough food on the table even when things are okay well and on this one anniversary of the american rescue plan let s be clear we did it alone without one single solitary republican vote applause the american economy was flat on its back it was the democrats it was you that brought us back and you didn t stop there you invested in america in fact you passed the biggest investment of rebuilding the nation in history now it s true we got some republicans friends to help on their for on the recovery on excuse me on the infrastructure act but we re talking how many in the house 12 13 14 or something whatever it was participant thirteen participant thirteen the president thirteen i mean come on i mean i was happy for them don t get me wrong laughter and then every one of them got attacked look have but have you noticed that every new bridge every trench dug put in the to take out lead pipes every trench dug there s a republican standing there saying this is a great thing laughter wonderful we did it even mitch mcconnell for god s sake you know as we say in my outfit bless me father for i have sinned there has been so much since our last confession look the simple fact is this infrastructure bill is going to transform america i mean not figuratively literally transform america and it s already starting instead of having infrastructure week we have an infrastructure decade we voted for okay applause we got 4 000 projects all across the country including 1 500 bridges in disrepair that are starting to be repaired this year this year people back home need to know what s happening by the way where s my pittsburgh group where are you they re in pittsburgh laughter anyway i just out was out in pittsburgh that that bridge you saw that bridge it was devastating i stood there about that bridge that had gone down an hour before i got there over a hundred foot fall only a couple folks on that bridge and if it had been two hours later school buses would have been filled children would have died i mean it was you saw the pictures in the paper you ought to stand there and lean over and look at it look we need to tell the american people this law is going to create millions of jobs rebuilding roads and bridges airports and ports internet and a whole range of other things because that s what it s going to do and that s why i m not going to get into it right now but that s where we have to make sure we have our education system up and running so we can produce the kind of workers we need et cetera but it s going to start to get rid of the poisonous lead pipes as well so our kids and families can drink clean water there s 10 million homes with lead pipes in america and some of you on the health committee know the incredible studies done on the impact of lead on the brain of children and children s development four hundred thousand schools we re going to invest 65 billion to deliver affordable high speed internet everywhere in america urban suburban tribal city applause and by the way we can t be this is the united states of america we can t be the country where for a mom to get her kid on the internet to be able to do their homework has to pull into a mcdonald s parking lot i mean for real that s what was happening this law is going to put an end to all of that it s going to put people in a much different position to be able to determine their own their own judgments about when to sell their cattle when they should i just just we re going to change things but look we all know that despite the progress we ve made families are still struggling they re struggling with higher prices as i said i grew up in a family when the price of gas went up everybody felt it you talked about it it mattered it mattered but let s be absolutely clear about why prices are so high right now they re very high for two reasons notwithstanding what the republicans say covid number one what happened was the glo the way the global economy works if a factory in taiwan makes computer chips shuts down because of covid it causes a ripple effect that can slow down the manufacturing in detroit which it did one hitch can hold up everything because of the pandemic we ve had disruptions in our supply chain materials and important materials at the same time the strength and speed of our economic recovery and families making more money still kept up so here you had an unusual situation that during a pandemic people had money to spend but what they didn t do is they didn t want they didn t want to go to restaurants they didn t want to go out and go on vacations they didn t spend money on leisure activities so they wanted to spend it on other things on hard goods home improvements televisions additions to their homes the very products that slowed down by disruptions in the supply chain because there weren t people cutting two by fours because of covid they were shut down i could go on a list you all know this i m preaching to the choir here so what happened prices went up exponentially just take a look at automobiles last year one third of all the inflation in america last year was because of the price of automobiles people had the money to buy automobiles finally but because the companies couldn t get semiconductors they couldn t make the automobiles the result the price of automobiles skyrocketed and used cars the reason used cars went up is because when the when the covid hit and the leisure industry shut down the rental cars sold all their stock so people were in real trouble the second big reason for inflation is vladimir putin from the moment he put his over 150 000 troops on the ukrainian border the price of gasoline in january went up 75 cents then putin began amassing troops along the border and guess what the world took notice and those of you who work in the business know that the market anticipated and pricing went up more and then putin invaded make no mistake inflation is largely the fault of putin i love you know the republicans are saying it s biden s gas pipeline biden said he s going to stop the keystone pipeline and i did and that s the reason prices went up folks let s get something straight here the keystone pipeline was two years away it had been 2 percent finished give me a break laughter give me a break headline fact checker in the new york times republicans wrongly blame biden for rising gas prices and it goes on to explain why gas prices are so high washington post op ed by by dana milbank opinion biden heeded republicans plea to ban russian oil they pounced and it goes on to talk about why it s got don t let anybody tell you anything you did supporting the idea that we block russian oil coming into the country which is g and i said at the time prices are going to go up for gasoline it wasn t anything we did and by the way you re in a situation right now where if you take a look the idea can we can we pump more oil there are now now five there are 172 gas and oil rigs running now we have there were 519 in operation before this all began but guess what they have over 7 000 permits to dig oil if they want why aren t they out pumping oil why aren t they out pumping oil because they ve said and they re very clear wall street bankers have made it very clear not a joke check it out and i recommend these two articles to you just as a little bit of a primer you probably already know it what s happened well the oil companies and executives they don t want to pump more oil although they have every capacity to do so nothing is slowing them up from doing it if they want to why rather than spend the profits on the increased price of gasoline they would rather take those profits and buy back stock buy back their own stock rather than take that money and invest it in pumping new oil not a joke not a joke so don t tell me gas prices rose because i ve slowed down the american energy production in my first year in office american production grew by 9 7 million barrels a day to 11 6 million while we still made a major major effort to deal with global warming and changing the way in which we shift to renewable renewable energy and don t tell me gas prices rose because of the american rescue plan the san francisco reserve federal reserve analyzed this and other outfits confirm the rescue plan contributed to 0 3 percent of inflation 0 3 inflation they re the facts democrats didn t cause this problem vladimir putin did and we re and we are working on it to fix it because of the work we did this country is vaccinated and start building the economy from the bottom up in the middle out something incredible is happening we re seeing a manufacturing revival i don t think even those of you from the midwest thought would occur the pride that comes from stamping products made in america intel came to see me the ceo he said he wants to invest 20 billion to build factories in eastern ohio manufacture computer chips semiconductors that will power the world and everyday lives smartphones intel technology that doesn t exist today and they re prepared to increase their investment from 20 billion now to 100 billion now as soon as you get final passage of the innovation bill headed to conference now this bill will invest another 200 billion to make us competitive including 52 billion in computer chips we invented these damn things we the united states everybody forgets we invented the computer chip in going to the moon and we have made every single solitary part of modernizing the technology in a computer chip has been american made but we stopped making them in america and now we re going to make them again that s going to help bring down the price of automobiles appliances and so much more and it s not just intel take a look at what ford and general motors did ford committed 11 billion to build electric vehicles in america its biggest investment ever general motors committed 7 billion to build electric vo vehicles remember when general motors mary barra was suing california suing california because there s a higher standard mileage standard i talked to her and i m not saying she changed because of me i talked to her she came to called me and said she s no she s going to drop her suit and that she s going to commit that 50 percent of all general motors vehicles by the year 2030 are going to be electric vehicles and everybody started following suit just a few years ago companies might have built these factories elsewhere but now they re building them in america we re coming back we re coming back stronger than ever before and by the way one of the things i ve done you know i didn t know maybe you all knew it i didn t know when i was in the senate i should have that there s law in the books it s called build america you re allowed to insist i get to spend as your president allocate spending of 600 billion everything from the decks of aircraft carriers to a whole range of fleet of automobile all the things we spend money on in the government well the law says that the president of the united states can say all those products have to be made in america well what happened initially we just got really lax democrats and republicans i might add and said here s the deal if it has 55 percent american made product and 45 is from foreign sources that s okay not in my book so i just signed an executive order saying it s got to be a minimum of 75 percent to start it s going to go up applause and i think it s the third executive order i signed that no no department can give a waiver for a non american made product in any american product we re buying without my permission without coming to the white house to determine whether or not that s justified and know what s happening now a lot of minority businesses small businesses getting in on the deal it gets posted there s an office in the white house that says this is a product being built we can t find we can t find contractors for this we re an american product here s what we need and guess what it s increasing the number of small businesses we also know there s no one no one way to increase the standard of living putin s gas tax has pushed prices up higher it ll take american manufacturing to bring prices of cars down but in the meantime we can save people money in a big way by reducing the cost of childcare of insulin of caring for mom and dad and their energy bills because that s another way to fundamentally impact on inflation for a family and it gets down to what s the total amount of money you have to spend to meet your basic needs so guess what if you instead of the 200 000 folks with kids with type 1 diabetes if instead of spending an average of six 647 a month for that insulin as high as 1 000 you re only paying 35 and you ve saved a hell of a lot of money applause think about think about your parents particularly single parents particularly women out there the cost of childcare look when i got here as nancy and some of you know i had lost my family with an automobile accident i got a call saying my wife was dead and my daughter was dead and my two boys were very badly injured and i hadn t been sworn in yet and make a long an awful lot of help from a lot of senators saying come and stay just six months help us organize boy was i stupid laughter six months but they saved my sanity and so i came and everybody says god that ain t that joe biden a wonderful guy he commuted every single day roughly 300 miles a day four hours a day just to be home with his kids it s true i did i tried to hit over 2 million some miles on amtrak but here s the deal i did it because i could not afford childcare i couldn t even begin to think of it and i was making i was making at that time as a united states senator i was making more money than i made before i couldn t afford it so i think it s anybody making 100 000 bucks a year single person or 120 000 as a family should have childcare capped at 7 percent of their income period applause period we can do that that ll cut the cost of childcare in half and a family is paying 14 grand a year in san francisco philadelphia all the big cities of the country for just one child and look that extra 7 000 bucks in their pocket will make a difference in what they can do there s so much we can do let me be clear none of this is going to increase inflation seventeen nobel laureates spontaneously a month and a half ago wrote to me seventeen nobel laureates in the economic in economics wrote me a long paper saying this will have this will help ease inflationary pressures over time not increase it ease and we can do this without raising one single penny on taxes on anybody making less than 400 grand a year let me say that again be crystal clear no one making less than 400 000 a year will pay a single additional penny in tax for all these things that were in the in the build back better plan we have to do this we have to do this we have to ask easy ask the biggest those of the biggest corporations who pay very little to raise their hand everybody in here raise your hand if you think the existing tax structure is remotely fair i m not being so i could do this at a republican meeting privately laughter and they d say that no one would raise their hand but look we have in 2020 55 of the biggest corporations in america the fortune 500 paid zero in taxes and they made 40 billion in profit forty billion you know it i know it the american people know it it just isn t right look i m a capitalist this isn t about punishing anybody i love bernie and i really do he s a great friend but i i m not bernie if you can make a billion dollars make a b for god s sake pay your fair share for damn it applause right now but why are teachers and firefighters paying a higher percentage of taxes than billionaires and corporations which is literally true literally true applause and we can fix this we can raise the standard of living for hardworking people without raising taxes without raising inflation and without raising the deficit and for all those folks out there that like to tack us for you know let me remind them last year because of what you all did we reduced the deficit by 360 billion applause we the democrats while the economy grew we re on track right now i m on track to be the first president in history to lower the deficit by over 1 trillion in one year applause so i m sick of this stuff we have to talk about it because the american people think the reason for inflation is the government is spending more money simply not true i don t think we need any lectures from our friends on the other side about fiscal responsibility for god s sake look we have an ambitious agenda so let s go get it done that includes standing up for and not giving an inch on core democratic values we re going to continue to stand up to meet the great challenges of our time voting rights climate change gun violence criminal justice immigration and so much more coming out of the state of the union why i think we re in a strong position we have a record to be proud of an agenda that will lower costs for american families and lift this nation up and a message that resonates we re building a better america a fairer america a more decent america a country that s been through a lot these past few years and i mean what i said i meant what i said at the state of the union we re stronger today than we were a year ago and we will be stronger next year than we are today i ve long said and i mean this sincerely i m not i ve spent a lot of time with xi jinping over 36 hours of private meetings with him he asked me we were in the tibetan plateau and he asked me if i could define america for him just me and a simultaneous interpreter him and an interpreter and by the way i turned all my notes over okay laughter and applause but seriously he said can you define america for me he s a tough guy and i said i can and i said in one word and he looked at me i said possibilities we re the only nation in the world it s the reason why we re looked at as sometimes being arrogant we think anything is possible anything is possible if we act together look we ve taken every crisis we ever faced and turned it into an opportunity think of one that hadn t that way whatever the crisis was we ve come out

the posters were ubiquitous tacked up in break rooms and taped behind windows printed in magazines and painted on the sides of buildings food will win the war and food is ammunition they declared save wheat meat fats and sugars and serve the cause of freedom during world war i the united states food administration used these provocative slogans to convince americans to conserve food for soldiers fighting on the front lines and while the agency itself was abolished after the war many of its inventions are familiar to us today such as the clean plate club or the still popular meatless mondays to promote the latter the united states bureau of fisheries usbf launched its own propaganda effort the eat more fish campaign distributed posters that implored patriots to save the meat for our soldiers and allies or simply eat the carp one of the posters featured a stern looking woman in a starched lunch lady uniform and paper cap eat more fish she admonished the onlooker a real health food posters like this encouraged americans to eat fish so red meat could go toward the soldiers fighting overseas found image holdings inc getty images the woman s name was evelene spencer and to many americans she would have been a familiar sight from 1915 to 1922 spencer held the distinguished title of fish cookery expert at the usbf later renamed the u s fish and wildlife service where she led the charge in persuading the public to eat seafood so prolifically that she eventually became known as the fish evangelist spencer was a celebrity chef before there was such a thing says april gregory curator of collections and exhibitions at the national fish aquatic conservation archives in south dakota she was famous with american housewives who came to know spencer through her posters live cooking demonstrations and later her seminal and breathlessly titled cookbook fish cookery six hundred recipes for the preparation of fish shellfish and other aquatic animals including fish soups salads and entrees with accompanying sauces seasonings dressings and forcemeats born in canada in 1868 spencer was a 47 year old restaurant manager in portland oregon when she was hired by the usbf she was married and the mother of two daughters but little else is known about spencer s life or culinary training prior to her role as fish cookery expert according to gregory spencer was one of just a handful of women the agency employed she was a pioneer in that regard to hold a position other than secretary in promotional materials spencer often appeared in a starched uniform and lunch lady cap national archives and records administration gregory s research has revealed that spencer appears to have had great freedom in her career making her own choices scheduling her own tours gregory can t say how spencer would have pulled off such a feat other than positing that she must have had a great personality convincing americans to eat fish would have required a great personality and then some in the early part of the last century a movement to eat more seafood didn t just challenge the culinary status quo but cultural norms as well according to barton seaver author of american seafood heritage culture and cookery from sea to shining sea for most of the 19th through 20th centuries americans mostly considered fish being beneath our aspirations while european colonists in the 1600s and 1700s relied on the ocean for food and commerce that began to change as the population expanded westward where the fertile wide open land of the nation s interior became dominated by sprawling farms by the mid 1800s meat had become a proxy for prosperity families could mark their wealth by the amount of meat they served seaver writes it was considered embarrassing commentary upon a family s tastes and economic standing if lobster was served at their table spencer was instrumental in introducing a wide variety of seafood to americans mike bergmann unsplash if meat was a status symbol fish was the marker of the outcast the poor ate salt cod native americans ate shad and the sick and infirm were encouraged to eat seafood since it was thought to be easier on digestion additionally in the popular and largely protestant imagination of the early 20th century fish was associated with catholic days of fasting and therefore notions of penance punishment and sacrifice according to a 1909 united states department of agriculture report americans were eating 150 pounds of meat per person annually while consuming only 10 pounds of seafood but then according to seaver world war i broke out and food came to be realized as one of our greatest weapons suddenly everyday americans could support the troops fighting in europe as well as our allies by cutting back on and sending high quality food overseas to orchestrate the rationing campaign the government turned to those eye catching posters and to evelene spencer she hit the road sometimes with her daughter in tow performing cooking demonstrations at large department stores in cities where the government had sent refrigerated train cars full of fish to rationing patriots posters from the u s food administration treated food like a valued war resource national archives public domain as many of these fish are new to the average housewife reads a usbf bulletin from november 1918 the demonstrations are intended to acquaint her with their merits and at the same time broaden her knowledge of the possibilities of fish these possibilities included substituting devil fish for crab and squid for oysters a few months later spencer penned an article for a usbf circular called groupers fishes you should try and recipes for them spencer s live tutorials drew sizable crowds for example gregory found a letter of appreciation from a women s club in berkeley california expressing the appreciation of its 300 members and friends for the splendid demonstration of fish the letter promises there certainly is going to be a more intelligent response to the plea of eat more fish spencer seemed motivated by inspiring an intelligent response not simply disseminating elementary recipes with easy to get fish she wanted americans to learn how to cook fish but also where to find it when to buy it and how to debone and filet it spencer s cookbook which she coauthored with john cobb a fisheries professor at the university of washington may have been written for the amateur cook but its contents read like a technical manual containing headings like how to tell when fish is fresh nutritive value of fish and conditions affecting the market value of fish spencer wanted americans to learn how to cook fish but also where to find it when to buy it and how to debone and filet it chaloner woods getty images in her demonstrations and then her book spencer encouraged home chefs to try new kinds of seafood to save money and support the fishing industry instead of always purchasing the better known high priced fish she wrote choose the less known and cheaper kinds to that end fish cookery includes recipes like squid loaf whale pot pie creamed shark with cheese and poached filets of shad in foamy clam nectar there s a whole chapter on roe and another on water mammals the book overflows with expert tips buy even the small fish spencer advised and the frozen fish two items americans remained squeamish about but that could spencer promised help bring down the high cost of some seafood buy enough fish to have leftovers and a little more to pickle buy oily fish to save on expensive cooking fats insist on the trimmings too and use them to make fish stock most fish she revealed taste much better cooked in half the time usually given in recipes indeed the book s most enduring legacy was its guidance on calculating cooking times and temperatures based on the size and thickness of the fish a topic that had long mystified the home chef it also introduced the spencer hot oven method coating fish in breadcrumbs and baking it at a very high heat a technique that today we call oven frying celebrated chef and food writer james beard called it the most important announcement in fish cookery in the last century james beard here on the right at the 1968 fish expo declared the spencer hot oven method the most important announcement in fish cookery in the last century boston globe getty images by 1923 spencer had returned to her native canada to take a job at the national fish company promoting the consumption of seafood until her death in 1935 her obituary describes her as well known to the authorities at washington where her work on behalf of the government was valued highly and highlights spencer s cookbook which attained a circulation to be envied by a best seller in the realm of fiction spencer s message to eat more fish still resonates at the agency that once employed her history does repeat itself says gregory today our agency is promoting eating invasive species to help save native species those looking for fish recipes can still find and purchase spencer s book online multiple editions and more than a century later its dedication still reads to the women of the

portland ore ktvz alaska airlines and its regional partner horizon air are teaming up with hillsboro aero academy a premier flight school in the pacific northwest with facilities in hillsboro and redmond to launch the ascend pilot academy to address a growing shortage of pilots this new development program designed for aspiring pilots provides a simpler more financially accessible path to becoming a commercial pilot at horizon and eventually alaska the program is part of a larger effort to address a growing pilot shortage coupled with increased travel demand the airlines said in a news release which follows in full in partnership with hillsboro aero the two airlines will register and train up to 250 students a year once enrolled cadet pilots will be eligible for low interest financial aid a 25 000 stipend to cover the cost of a commercial pilot license mentorship and guidance from alaska airlines and horizon air pilots and a conditional job offer at horizon air with an opportunity to fly with alaska airlines after meeting certain criteria launching the ascend pilot academy addresses a critical need to build a larger and more diverse talent pipeline and remove historical barriers to entry for aspiring pilots said joe sprague horizon air president our goal is to create a program that enables students to complete an intensive training and time building program with a clear and established path toward flying for horizon as a first officer an industry wide shortage of pilots has emerged during the pandemic over the past two years thousands of pilots at major airlines took early retirements accelerating a pilot shortage that was already on the horizon in 2022 alone mainline airlines are expected to hire more than 10 000 pilots twice the amount hired in 2019 with 80 of these hires anticipated to be sourced from regional airlines like horizon air a more robust talent pipeline is critical to maintaining operational efficiency and business growth combined alaska and horizon estimate they will need to hire 500 pilots a year or 2 000 by 2025 the ascend pilot academy is one part of building that diverse talent pipeline we re taking a number of steps to actively recruit pilots at both alaska and horizon including enhancing our existing pilot development program and launching a robust marketing recruiting campaign added sprague barriers to entry the barriers to entry for aspiring pilots can seem nearly impossible to overcome particularly for young people who are unable to afford the estimated 70 000 to 90 000 to pay for training schooling and the licenses to become a commercially rated pilot furthermore it can be difficult for flight school students to secure government backed financing which means financing terms are often prohibitive in response to these challenges alaska airlines and horizon air have been advocating for expanded federal student loan aid to also cover costs associated with flight education it should be as easy to get a federally backed low interest student loan to become a pilot as it is to attend medical school sprague said the ascend pilot academy aims to do just that a pacific northwest partnership with campuses located in hillsboro and redmond near the metropolitan areas of portland and bend hillsboro aero academy is a premier flight school and long time horizon air partner hillsboro s fleet of 95 aircraft are equipped with modern avionics and their training staff are working directly with horizon s to develop instructional practices to best prepare students to fly in an airline environment through this program an aspiring commercial pilot will be able to realize their dream of learning to fly and work toward becoming a captain at alaska airlines said nik kresse hillsboro aero academy s vice president of airplane flight operations enrolling in ascend pilot academy is the first step of what we hope will be a long relationship with horizon air and alaska airlines we re eager to work with students through their entire journey and provide world class training and dedicated pilot mentorship along the way many pilots at alaska and horizon either started their careers at hillsboro or instructed at hillsboro horizon e175 captain emma bryson and her husband e175 captain ian bryson both previously worked as hillsboro flight instructors hillsboro aero academy and horizon air were the clear choice as the place to build my career said emma bryson they made a point of explaining that this is a place you could stay if you wanted my husband and i chose hillsboro aero because it was close to home and we thought flying in the pacific northwest was the best way to learn to fly in all types of weather and terrain alaska airlines and horizon air offer pilots a highly competitive compensation and benefits package in addition to a supportive work environment with opportunities for growth employees receive travel privileges across alaska airlines

when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark musical finian s rainbow he wanted to make smaller more personal films but zoetrope needed cash so coppola bit the bullet producer robert evans thought it was important that the film be directed by someone of italian descent so he was pushing hard coppola finally agreed on the condition that he be allowed to co write the screenplay with mario puzo author of the novel and that the period setting be retained producers had hoped to save money by resetting the story in the 1970s he immediately alarmed studio execs by insisting on casting marlon brando who at 47 was thought by many in the industry to be both difficult and past his prime i m gonna make him an offer he can t refuse the distribution team at paramount pictures was less than excited about all of this mob films had not done well at the box office for years but the book was a runaway bestseller and they d bought the rights for just 80 000 once committed they did know how to whip up a media frenzy and they were aided in garnering headlines when italian american anti defamation groups staged a madison square garden rally protesting what they predicted would be a film of ethnic slurs and glorification of the mafia these were the days when prestige films premiered with months long roadshow engagements in big cities exclusive runs with reserved seats and often intermissions before playing neighborhood theaters at popular prices the godfather at almost three hours could certainly have gone that route its klieg lighted celebrity studded charity gala on march 14 1972 was at the manhattan movie palace that had hosted the exclusive world premiere engagement of ben hur for 74 weeks though the once 3 300 seat loew s state theater had recently been remodeled as loew s state i and ii even cut in half it was still a prestigious house that the godfather could have filled indefinitely before letting other theaters join in but paramount had a different plan this is business not personal sonny it asked theater owners across the country to bid to play the film days after the premiere in return for an upfront non refundable monetary guarantee against 90 of the box office take whichever was greater theater owners would keep just 10 cents of every dollar that came into their box offices but it would be a lot of dimes with the novel a runaway bestseller competition among theater owners was fierce paramount ended up accepting more than 300 bids and when those lucky theater owners ponied up their up front guarantees the producers had more than 15 million in the till before opening night more than twice what they d spent making the picture and then the godfather opened and critics and audiences saw what coppola had wrought not an edward g robinson style gangster flick not even the mob potboiler puzo had written in his novel coppola had crafted a quasi shakespearean epic about a mob family in crisis it was the violent wrenching bloodily epic story of a dynasty giving way king corleone and his princes it was enormously emotional as producer robert evans remembers henry kissinger saying at the film s premiere here was brando playing a gangster who d killed hundreds of people and when he died the whole audience was crying a touch of greatness leave the gun take the cannoli associated press associated press actor al pacino and actress jill clayburgh attend the world premiere of the godfather in which he stars as michael corleone by the time the film opened nationwide 10 days later absolutely everyone was buying tickets though sometimes for odd reasons as dave berg of member station kcur told all things considered while reporting on the film s sold out but empty premiere at the empire theater in kansas city missouri according to giles fowler film critic for the kansas city star the godfather is a triumph of traditional storytelling cinema in an age that had just about forgotten such things but no matter nobody saw the film the italian american unification council of greater kansas city bought all 1 000 tickets for 2 500 so that the godfather would play to an empty house they also got a court injunction barring stan durwood the theater operator from scheduling a matinee that day and spoiling their optics for obvious reasons he was fine with that durwood said he s just happy with all the publicity the film is getting reported berg so the group got its optics the theater got its first of several sold out performances and what did audiences get a portrait of the mafia that felt real reportedly even to members of gang families also a raft of star making performances al pacino diane keaton robert duvall james caan and a story that reached the point where a conventional mob movie would end at about the 90 minute mark and still had half its story left to tell the half that thrilled i thought when it was your turn you would be the one to hold the strings critics were enthusiastic about the film s most daring departures from hollywood tradition quite apart from the realistic performances and ambiance here was a gangster epic told not as a morality tale from an outsiders point of view but with sympathy for and from the viewpoint of its central thoroughly amoral family that said there were things that were not altogether new that line everyone quotes about an offer someone can t refuse forrest taylor said it almost word for word to john wayne in the 1933 western riders of destiny a full three decades before the godfather novel was written and that swoony earworm of a love theme composer nino rota provided for the godfather sounded awfully familiar to folks who d seen eduardo de filippo s italian comedy fortunella 14 years earlier rota scored that one too but his bit of recycling cost him an oscar nod there wasn t enough time we ll get there pop the godfather received 11 oscar nominations though even those came with complications brando decided best actor was an honor he could refuse and sent apache representative sacheen littlefeather to decline it citing the treatment of native americans by the film industry al pacino also boycotted the ceremony it was reported at the time that he was annoyed at being nominated as supporting actor when he had more screen time than brando did though he now says that wasn t the case regardless it was just a temporary setback pacino got his best actor nomination for the godfather part ii all of which qualified as blood under the bridge as far as the audience was concerned the godfather was the no 1 film at the box office for 23 consecutive weeks in 1972 then spent one week at no 2 supplanted by the goldie hawn comedy butterflies are free before coming back for three more weeks at the top of the chart it earned 100 million faster than any film before it and having cost less than 7 million to make it was so profitable that the l a times reported the stock price of gulf western the huge conglomerate that owned paramount more than quadrupled from 77 cents a share to 3 30 a share the film also began an era in which coppola s generation ostensibly fed up with the studio system essentially took over the studio system three years after the godfather rewrote the rules of film exhibition steven spielberg made jaws which established a new pattern of even broader release augmented by a first ever national tv ad campaign two years after that

when the godfather premiered 50 years ago people knew it was sensational controversial precedent shattering a masterpiece even but they couldn t know what we know now it was a bridge between old hollywood and new the film industry had been struggling all through the 1960s a rough decade for big screen entertainment as color television siphoned off much of what was left of the moviegoing audience cinemas had tried everything they could think of to compete they d widened screens adopted stereophonic sound even experimented with 3 d glasses but american moviegoing having peaked in the 1930s had dropped precipitously with the advent of home viewing film attendance reached its nadir in 1971 which until the pandemic had the lowest ticket sales on record according to the motion picture association of america grand old movie palaces were being torn down to make way for parking lots rough hewn low budget indies like easy rider and five easy pieces were capturing the audience s imagination while extravagantly made and marketed studio projects like the gertrude lawrence bio pic star starring julie andrews were going belly up things got so rough for the industry that actor and memoirist david niven speculated that we might someday look back on movies the way we now look back on vaudeville as a quaint pastime the public had briefly enjoyed and abandoned and in the middle of all that along comes this kid francis ford coppola with a gangster flick it s a sicilian message luca brasi sleeps with the fishes the 32 year old filmmaker had initially and emphatically turned the godfather down he d just co founded american zoetrope with george lucas specifically hoping to steer clear of big hollywood projects after his recent experience directing the fred astaire petula clark

the biden administration under pressure to expand the arsenal of weapons that ukraine has in its conflict with russia is working with european allies to expedite more sophisticated air defense systems and other armaments into the war zone u s officials said friday discussions were ongoing ahead of defense secretary lloyd austin s planned trip next week to meet with nato allies in brussels and slovakia which along with poland and romania has indicated a willingness to transfer military aid to its embattled neighbor slovakia also possesses the s 300 surface to air missile system which is used to shoot down enemy aircraft and is familiar to the ukrainians pentagon spokesman john kirby told reporters that the united states is committed to arming the government in kyiv with the kinds of capabilities that we know the ukrainians need and are using very well he declined to specify what types of weapons could be included in the next wave of shipments advertisement some of that material we have and are providing some of that material we don t have but we know others have and we re helping coordinate that as well kirby said the administration is facing backlash over its decision earlier this week to scuttle poland s proposal that would have sent a number of its mig 29 fighter jets to ukraine via a transfer free of charge to the united states washington citing concerns that russia would view the move as a provocation said the offer from warsaw was not tenable ukrainian officials including president volodymyr zelensky have pleaded for the mig 29 transfer and while they have support from a bipartisan group of u s lawmakers the biden administration citing assessments from senior american military commanders in europe has said the additional aircraft would offer only minimal value to ukraine given the contested nature of its airspace advertisement we believe the most effective way to support the ukrainian military in their fight against russia is to provide increased amounts of antitank weapons and air defense systems which is ongoing with the international community said air force gen tod wolters the chief of u s european command the ukrainians are making excellent use of these weapons now after more than two weeks of war russia has failed to establish military dominance over ukraine here s why video drea cornejo the washington post photo salwan georges the washington post nato countries have been limited in what they can send to ukraine due in part to the ukrainian military s training which centers heavily on soviet or russian made weapons that exist in dwindling stock ukraine has sought the s 300 surface to air missile system said a senior european official familiar with the situation there are ongoing talks about that possibility the official said but questions remain about whether there are any that can be spared advertisement nobody wants to mishandle expectations said the official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue ukrainian troops also are trained on the buk surface to air missile system the same type of weapon that shot down a malaysia airlines civilian jet over a part of eastern ukraine held by russian backed separatists in 2014 some eastern european countries possess both systems but in small numbers the european official said austin s upcoming visit to slovakia could be used to secure additional agreements to use its railways to facilitate faster transfers of humanitarian aid and fuel into ukraine the european official said unlike some other countries nearby slovakia has a shipping hub that operates on both european standard gauge rail and the wider gauge rail used in ukraine making it an appealing option assessments of how long the ukrainians can continue to hold out against the russian onslaught are intertwined with what weapons they already have on friday a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the united states sent a letter to president biden asking him to transfer manned and unmanned aircraft to ukraine saying that despite heroic and skilled resistance the russians had achieved air superiority over the ukrainians that went farther than u s defense officials who have noted the russians have a significantly larger air force but had been unable to control the skies over ukraine advertisement russia s advantage in this domain could soon develop into air dominance if the ukrainians do not receive necessary military aid the lawmakers said the lawmakers called for the continued delivery of stinger missiles man portable antiaircraft weapons but also called for the united states to facilitate the transfer of s 300 systems providing soviet era platforms that ukrainian servicemembers have previously operated and maintained will be essential to their success on the battlefield and will also protect u s defense technology from falling into the hands of the russians lawmakers said in the letter which was first reported by politico they also urged the president to reconsider the polish mig decision and said the biden administration should look for ways to send more armed drones and su 25 aircraft to ukraine the jet is used by a handful of u s allies and partners including bulgaria a nato nation the lawmakers signing the letter friday included numerous u s veterans advertisement rep jason crow d colo a former army ranger who is among the signatories said the administration was drawing a nonsensical distinction between acceptable weapons and those it considers potentially too escalatory i don t believe there is a distinction between providing a mig and providing a javelin and a stinger he said these are defensive systems we are not providing offensive capabilities because ukraine is not on the offense all they re doing is fighting for their survival and trying to maintain their democracy against a vladimir putin invasion crow also said that while the provision of javelins and stingers has been useful thus far the west must step up its contributions to give ukraine a chance to sustain its resistance particularly in the skies where zelensky s forces are trying to prevent russia from achieving superiority advertisement short of migs they need more advanced ground to air missile systems crow said noting that the stingers provided to ukraine work well against helicopters and planes conducting low altitude bombing runs but aren t enough to ground the russian air force they need something that can reach out and conduct regional air defense higher altitude air defense rep michael waltz r fla who has served in special forces units and also signed the letter said that transferring s 300 systems and components of them such as radar could be helpful among western weapons the ukrainians also could benefit from the avenger system which allows stinger missiles to be mounted to vehicles he said other american air defense systems including patriot missiles require too much training to make them practical in the near term advertisement the ukrainians could benefit too from counter battery radar systems which scan for the originating locations of incoming artillery fire and its equipment they ve asked for before waltz said at a minimum once the russians know you have that they won t be able to just sit there and lob round after round after round waltz said it degrades their ability to just sit there and pummel you they have to move obviously because now you have the ability to counter battery the ukrainian military has 56 fighter jets left and is using them just five to 10 hours per day a senior u s defense official said friday the official speaking on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the pentagon cited that as one reason the administration had decided against transferring the migs to ukraine noting that russian surface to air missile systems can reach just about anywhere over the war zone advertisement u s officials continue to speak to the ukrainians regularly the defense official said and the things they need the most are antiaircraft and antiarmor weapons such as javelin missiles for items the ukrainians need that the united states does not have the administration is working with allies and partners who might have inventory we re trying to help them further that defense in ways and with systems that they know how to use already the official said they re good at it and it s having effect on the russians

madison a federal funding bill containing 1 6 million to install a forever chemicals treatment system in the anson madison sanitary district has been sent to president joe biden s desk and is awaiting his signature the u s senate passed the interior appropriations bill thursday night 68 31 the bill was passed earlier by the house of representatives and now just needs to be signed by the president sen susan collins r maine secured the funding and got the item added to the bill last october i strongly advocated for the funding for the construction of this treatment system which will help maine address the pfas contamination threat to our communities statewide and ensure a safe food and water supply collins said in a statement friday the money will be used to create a pfas or forever chemicals treatment system at the anson madison wastewater treatment plant that will serve the entire state pfas or per and poly fluoroalkyl substances are a group of manmade chemicals that are both oil and water resistant making them useful in a wide variety of consumer products from clothing to cosmetics however the chemicals do not break down easily in the environment or in the body and in some areas of maine have been found in water soil people and animals earning them the nickname forever chemicals dale clark general manager for the anson madison sanitary district said friday that he was happy to hear about the funding and see the project start to come together advertisement we recognize this is a serious problem and why not get out in front of it and get a proper treatment system to remove it from the environment clark said we can help other communities with pfas treatment issues this will be bigger than what we need for just anson and madison much of the pfas contamination in the state has been linked to the spreading of sludge a byproduct from wastewater treatment and high levels of the chemicals have been found in some areas such as fairfield in well water soil venison fish chicken eggs and even some vegetables the maine department of environmental protection is currently working to install carbon filtration systems in homes with contaminated well water that registers pfas levels above the state s 20 parts per trillion limit for drinking water but maine doesn t have the infrastructure right now to address pfas contamination in other substances this can be a significant problem for dairy farmers with contaminated cows wastewater treatment plants won t accept manure that has pfas unless the chemicals are removed with advanced technology if farmers can t get rid of the manure at a wastewater treatment plant it will likely end up in a manure pit once those pits are full though where can it go collins statement goes on to say that the best long term solution to the problem is off site treatment at wastewater treatment facilities and disposal at secured landfills unfortunately maine has experienced considerable pfas contamination which has not only threatened our water supply but adversely affected the livelihoods of farmers collins said farmers across maine are discovering pfas contamination that is not only affecting their livelihoods but also threatening our food supply advertisement gov janet mills expressed support for the funding when it was announced in october and thanked collins for her work again friday in a statement pfas threatens the health and wellbeing of maine people and it is devastating the livelihoods of our hardworking farmers mills said it s a serious problem which is why my administration has been working closely with maine s congressional delegation to secure funding that will allow us to build the infrastructure needed to treat pfas contaminated materials a move that will complement our efforts at the state level to remediate pfas mills has also committed 1 million through the department of environmental protection s clean water state revolving fund to the project and her maine jobs and recovery plan includes another 1 million collins also worked with u s sen angus king i maine and u s rep jared golden d 2nd district to secure 1 million for an anaerobic biodigester in madison in the transportation and housing appropriations bill which was also passed by the senate thursday the forest products sector is one of maine s oldest and most important industries creating countless jobs
