enbridge inc expects to settle on a new tolling plan for its mainline pipeline system this summer the calgary based company said friday the pipeline giant said it is consulting with industry about two potential options after its proposal to fill canada s largest oil pipeline network through long term contracts was rejected by the canada energy regulator in november one scenario being advanced is an incentive rate making agreement that may be similar to the competitive toll settlement cts agreement that expired on june 30 2021 enbridge chief executive al monaco said on a conference call with analysts friday the other option is a cost of service application enbridge will be ready to submit an application for one of the two proposals for regulatory approval in the latter half of the year the company said the goal is to land on which option works best for our shippers and make sense for us monaco said as we ve seen shipper consensus is tough to achieve enbridge s mainline is canada s largest oil pipeline system moving over three million barrels per day of petroleum products to market the pipeline provides about 70 per cent of the total oil pipeline transportation capacity out of western canada the pipeline s demand has exceeded capacity over the past few years so enbridge had applied to enter into long term contracts for 90 per cent of the mainline system s capacity enbridge had argued firm contracts would give customers more predictable access to the pipeline but some canadian oil producers argued the proposed change would worsen the existing capacity constraints and could lead to lower oil prices in rejecting the proposal in november the canada energy regulator concluded enbridge s proposal would dramatically change access to the pipeline it said certain companies would benefit from long term stability but others would lose access to the pipeline monaco told analysts enbridge is equally comfortable with either an incentive agreement or a cost of service agreement right now the company is collecting tolls consistent with what was in place under the cts agreement when it expired in june and will continue doing so until a replacement commercial framework is selected and implemented ultimately said monaco what oil shippers want given the difficulty building new pipeline capacity in canada is certainty and the ability to move barrels at low cost everybody s been through the wringer on this over the last almost three four years monaco said toll certainty but just generally certainty commercially for our customers is important as it is for us so everybody wants to move forward i think enbridge inc reported its fourth quarter profit rose compared with a year ago the company says its profit attributable to common shareholders totalled 1 84 billion or 91 cents per share for the quarter ended dec 31 the result compared with a profit of 1 78 billion or 88 cents per share in the same quarter a year earlier on an adjusted basis enbridge says it earned 68 cents per share for the quarter compared with an adjusted profit of 56 cents per share in the final three months of 2020 analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of 76 cents per share according to financial markets data firm refinitiv enbridge says it s going ahead with a us 400 million plan to modernize compressor equipment in texas that will increase safety and reliability of the system and reduce associated greenhouse gas emissions it will also spend us 100 million to expand its texas eastern system to provide additional capacity to meet u s northeast demand for natural gas on the call monaco repeated his view that north america is facing an energy crisis due to demand driven by economic recovery as well as a significant shortfall in recent years of investment in both conventional and renewable energy projects not surprisingly that brings energy shortages higher fuel costs and of course inflation as you re seeing which challenges competitiveness and economic growth monaco said adding enbridge is bullish on the outlook for traditional oil and gas given current supply and demand conditions before the crisis our view was that conventional energy will grow at least through 2035 and what s happening today just reinforces that view

pinch of salt and pepper coat each fillet in the flour patting gently to remove any excess in a large non stick frying pan ideally a silver pan so you can see the colour of the sauce melt the knob of butter and the oil until foaming add the fillets and quickly fry on a medium heat for one minute increase the heat and fry for a further minute then gently flip them over and cook through for a final minute remove the fillets to a plate and keep warm to make the beurre noisette sauce wipe the pan and melt the butter on a medium high heat for a few minutes until it starts to foam swirling the pan until it bubbles and turns a golden nutty brown colour remove from the heat it will keep cooking and add the lemon juice parsley and capers to finish pop the fish onto plates and spoon the sauce over

arrived and i had to find a way to use them i developed this dish and it was put on the menu james says the secret to this pudding is to not overcook it it should be liquid in the centre otherwise you

will be noteworthy after he surprised markets thursday with a call for the fed funds rate to be 100 basis points or 1 percentage point higher by july producer price inflation data tuesday and fed minutes wednesday will be important releases stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between russia and ukraine and debate how quickly the federal reserve can raise interest rates markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading thursday upended many wall street forecasts for interest rate hikes investors were dealt another blow friday after the white house warned that russia could invade ukraine during the olympics both the u s and u k have called for their citizens to leave ukraine as soon as possible get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters i think the fed is keeping everyone on edge and this is going to add to that edginess said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group so we had a three week earnings respite from the macro we turned micro and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again the major averages slid sharply on friday afternoon and treasury yields came off the highs they set after thursday s report that january s consumer price index jumped by 7 5 a 40 year high the s p 500 lost 1 8 for the week falling to 4 418 with about two hours left to friday trading u s national security advisor jake sullivan told a white house briefing that there were signs of russian escalation at the ukraine border sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the olympics despite speculation to the contrary up until now i d say it was all about monetary policy this throws an extra unknown into the works said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex the dollar is rallying oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off even if nothing happens this weekend people will be nervous about it in the next week boockvar said the russian tensions complicate the central bank s outlook and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation it s causing problems for the fed because this basically would inflate oil prices food prices wheat fertilizers and everything else and just make the fed s inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver he said the fed can t back off you can t blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates he said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact it could slow hikes fed s inflation fight by friday morning some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the fed to hike interest rates by a half point in march following the january inflation report others like economists at goldman sachs have raised their views to a faster pace with as many as seven quarter point hikes for this year fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead particularly st louis fed president james bullard who appears on cnbc s squawk box monday at 8 30 a m bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points or 1 percentage point by july i think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish fed to this more hawkish fed policy which we re experiencing said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse we haven t yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency i think volatility is going to remain elevated and that s going to be more true for high valuation companies what to watch the federal reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on wednesday investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet there will also be more important inflation data when the producer price index is reported tuesday that report is also expected to be very hot after january s cpi surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump and now economists are watching consumer spending closely that means january s retail sales will also be important when it is reported wednesday there is also a final rush of big earnings reports with cisco nvidia and aig wednesday walmart reports thursday and deere reports friday we re starting to transition beyond earnings i think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did said palfrey i think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters are we able to pass through prices at the same rate fed debate palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank bullard is the only fed official who endorsed a 50 basis point hike while others like cleveland fed president loretta mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point fed chairman jerome powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it fed governor lael brainard speaks friday as does fed governor christopher waller mester speaks thursday other fed officials have pushed back on bullard s comments but still there is a high level of uncertainty in the market and bond pros are wondering if the st louis fed chief will walk back his comments monday morning liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank s tightening path the fed is full steam ahead they have to be they re still adding to the balance sheet we re still at zero on rates she said there s nothing in my mind unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens that makes the fed say we re fine we re going to stay at zero they re admitting themselves they re behind the curve they let the inflation cat out of the bag i don t think they thought it would have the traction it has had she said rate rally and reverse when bonds sell off yields go higher and they jumped this past week the 10 year yield was as high as 2 06 friday after the ukraine news the 10 year yield was back down to about 1 93 the 2 year yield was at a high of 1 63 friday up from 1

concerns over russia ukraine tensions spooked investors friday and may continue to hang over the markets st louis fed president james bullard appears on cnbc s squawk box monday morning his comments will be noteworthy after he surprised markets thursday with a call for the fed funds rate to be 100 basis points or 1 percentage point higher by july producer price inflation data tuesday and fed minutes wednesday will be important releases stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between russia and ukraine and debate how quickly the federal reserve can raise interest rates markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading thursday upended many wall street forecasts for interest rate hikes investors were dealt another blow friday after the white house warned that russia could invade ukraine during the olympics both the u s and u k have called for their citizens to leave ukraine as soon as possible get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters i think the fed is keeping everyone on edge and this is going to add to that edginess said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group so we had a three week earnings respite from the macro we turned micro and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again the major averages slid sharply on friday afternoon and treasury yields came off the highs they set after thursday s report that january s consumer price index jumped by 7 5 a 40 year high the s p 500 lost 1 8 for the week falling to 4 418 with about two hours left to friday trading u s national security advisor jake sullivan told a white house briefing that there were signs of russian escalation at the ukraine border sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the olympics despite speculation to the contrary up until now i d say it was all about monetary policy this throws an extra unknown into the works said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex the dollar is rallying oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off even if nothing happens this weekend people will be nervous about it in the next week boockvar said the russian tensions complicate the central bank s outlook and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation it s causing problems for the fed because this basically would inflate oil prices food prices wheat fertilizers and everything else and just make the fed s inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver he said the fed can t back off you can t blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates he said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact it could slow hikes fed s inflation fight by friday morning some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the fed to hike interest rates by a half point in march following the january inflation report others like economists at goldman sachs have raised their views to a faster pace with as many as seven quarter point hikes for this year fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead particularly st louis fed president james bullard who appears on cnbc s squawk box monday at 8 30 a m bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points or 1 percentage point by july i think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish fed to this more hawkish fed policy which we re experiencing said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse we haven t yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency i think volatility is going to remain elevated and that s going to be more true for high valuation companies what to watch the federal reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on wednesday investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet there will also be more important inflation data when the producer price index is reported tuesday that report is also expected to be very hot after january s cpi surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump and now economists are watching consumer spending closely that means january s retail sales will also be important when it is reported wednesday there is also a final rush of big earnings reports with cisco nvidia and aig wednesday walmart reports thursday and deere reports friday we re starting to transition beyond earnings i think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did said palfrey i think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters are we able to pass through prices at the same rate fed debate palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank bullard is the only fed official who endorsed a 50 basis point hike while others like cleveland fed president loretta mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point fed chairman jerome powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it fed governor lael brainard speaks friday as does fed governor christopher waller mester speaks thursday other fed officials have pushed back on bullard s comments but still there is a high level of uncertainty in the market and bond pros are wondering if the st louis fed chief will walk back his comments monday morning liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank s tightening path the fed is full steam ahead they have to be they re still adding to the balance sheet we re still at zero on rates she said there s nothing in my mind unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens that makes the fed say we re fine we re going to stay at zero they re admitting themselves they re behind the curve they let the inflation cat out of the bag i don t think they thought it would have the traction it has had she said rate rally and reverse when bonds sell off yields go higher and

editor s note this story was updated on feb 21 2022 with a more accurate description of the caveats surrounding potential toxicity of molnupiravir to the embryo or fetus supplies of the eagerly awaited oral covid 19 antiviral prescription medications are slowly arriving at us pharmacies but despite strong evidence that they can help reduce symptoms and prevent severe illness federal data and experts suggest that many patients don t know about them or don t want to take them two oral covid 19 antiviral medications molnupiravir merck and paxlovid nirmatrelvir and ritonavir pfizer have been proven to be safe effective and convenient treatments to take at home however patients have to surmount several hurdles to get them including recognizing that they have symptoms of covid 19 getting a covid 19 test having a positive test securing a doctor s appointment getting a prescription and finding a pharmacy with a supply and they have to do all of this quickly antivirals need to be started within the first 5 days of covid 19 symptom onset in order to produce a benefit high risk patients in the first few days after diagnosis don t realize how much sicker they re going to get so they miss the opportunity to get better faster and by the time they actually do it s too late said bryan jarabek md phd chief medical informatics officer and hospitalist at m health fairview in minneapolis patient hesitancy confusion hailed as a potential lifesaver by their manufacturers and experts alike molnupiravir and paxlovid were expected to be in high demand after the us food and drug administration issued emergency use authorizations euas for both therapies in late december but federal data show otherwise with many courses still on pharmacy shelves the data show that m health fairview had received 2 100 5 day courses of molnupiravir as of feb 1 and as of feb 6 the last date with available data 2 031 were still available likewise it had received 420 courses of paxlovid by feb 1 with 279 unused as of feb 8 the antivirals are authorized for the treatment of mild or moderately ill patients at high risk for covid 19 hospitalization and death molnupiravir is indicated for patients 18 years and older owing to concerns about impeding bone and cartilage growth in children while paxlovid can be given to those age 12 and up the much lower efficacy of molnupiravir 30 relative to paxlovid 88 and glaxosmithkline and vir s monoclonal antibody sotrovimab 85 may also factor into patients decision to decline it according to kurt proctor phd rph senior vice president of strategic initiatives at the national community pharmacists association ncpa in washington d c given the prevailing information people have that s going to make that option less attractive to some folks and to prescribers he said another reason jarabek said is that patients know that molnupiravir and paxlovid are reserved for patients at high risk for progressing to hospitalization or death people don t often identify themselves as high risk jarabek said they say someone else is probably more high risk than me why don t you give it to them when m health fairview first received the antivirals it invited high risk covid 19 outpatients for appointments to see if they were eligible for the drugs about 70 of those accepted an appointment jarabek said i would think that there s a big group of patients who don t accept or call us back but for patients who aren t eligible for paxlovid or monoclonal antibodies because they re not at high enough risk 4 or greater on minnesota s m mass covid 19 therapy ethical scoring system or have contraindications to those treatments 30 is a lot better than nothing jarabek said it s better than being sick or out of work he said caveats for both drugs both molnupiravir and paxlovid come with warnings while pregnant and lactating women can take paxlovid they can t take molnupiravir owing to potential toxicity to the embryo or fetus thus some providers require women of childbearing age to take a pregnancy test before getting a prescription they must also use contraception during treatment and for 4 days after the last dose while men must use contraception during treatment and 3 months after the last dose paxlovid on the other hand is not appropriate for people with severely impaired kidneys or liver and may be contraindicated for those taking other medications that can t be interrupted or adjusted minnesota state epidemiologist ruth lynfield md said while her department doesn t provide patient care it is aware of low patient acceptance particularly with molnupiravir we have heard anecdotally about hesitancy with molnupiravir she said the challenges with paxlovid we have heard about have had to do with drug interactions associated with the ritonavir component but jarabek said that doctors and other personnel always work to ensure that it s safe to take molnupiravir and paxlovid by adjusting patients other medications if needed they are safe and effective when we prescribe and take them correctly he said patients also may be reluctant to take a new experimental drug experts say and proctor said that because the drugs are prescribed under an eua their manufacturers are likely limited in what they can say and do manufacturers play a big role in educating about their products proctor said when fully approved they can be much more aggressive in educating and communicating more shipments on the way thus far the united states has ordered 10 million courses of paxlovid and 3 1 million courses of molnupiravir which are provided for free under purchasing agreements between the manufacturers and the federal government while shipments of paxlovid have lagged behind that of molnupiravir in a roughly 1 5 ratio supplies of the state allocated therapeutics are slowly arriving according to the us department of health and human services public health emergency website the government has shipped 364 850 courses of paxlovid and 1 500 360 courses of molnupiravir as of this week minnesota for instance has been allocated 4 960 5 day courses of paxlovid and 20 364 of molnupiravir which are still arriving according to sarah lim md mph a medical specialist with the minnesota department of health proctor said that his organization has been advocating for pharmacists to be able to prescribe molnupiravir and paxlovid which would be particularly convenient for patients tested for covid 19 in the pharmacy the eua for these medications doesn t allow pharmacists to prescribe the antivirals that adds staff time and time for patients to get access to it he said it s a contributing factor to a lot of the big issues at hand and because health plans including medicare part d plan sponsors and pharmacy benefit managers are providing dispensing fees for molnupiravir and paxlovid that some pharmacies say are too low to cover the extra time and effort to fill their prescriptions some pharmacies may decide they can t afford to stock them proctor said access to these meds could decrease because pharmacies might decide it s too much to carry and provide them he said in a jan 28 2022 letter to the centers for medicare medicaid services ncpa chief executive officer b douglas hoey rph mba said that fees to pharmacies have ranged from 1 to 10 50 for a prescribing procedure that may take nearly an hour in addition to following a nonstandard process for ordering the antivirals pharmacists must receive the physical product educate new patients and work with prescribers to prioritize the drugs ascertain the data on electronic prescriptions and transition patients from monoclonal antibodies to oral therapy the letter said prescriber pharmacist patient communication more direct communication between prescribers and pharmacists can pave the way for patients to be able to more quickly and safely access their medications by understanding which pharmacies have the medicines in stock and choosing pharmacies that have access to the provider notes and can arrange drive through or curbside pickup since these patients have covid jarabek said to try to convince more at risk covid 19 patients to take advantage of molnupiravir and paxlovid jarabek said his hospital has changed the wording it uses rather than emphasizing that the drugs help prevent serious illness and death it talks about rapid symptom relief patients care more about if it makes them feel better he said debunking patient misconceptions about covid 19 preventives and therapies is also important it s really strange how the trust of science and healthcare providers has eroded based on political views jarabek said we ve all really seen a lot of distrust and we can t figure out why we still just want to help people while some patients may be deterred by the hurdles and obstacles they must surmount to get treatment proctor said it can be done i do think that while there is a very short supply if the process is started soon enough these medications are available to them he said it s not easy but it s not an impossible mountain to climb when asked about how this process is working stephen w schondelmeyer pharmd phd with the university of minnesota s resilient drug supply project said this is a classic example of a public health effort that falls short of success in the last mile and fails to get the treatments to many of the patients who most need them on the one hand the federal government has worked hard to get oral covid 19 medications developed and purchased in large quantities and they have allocated and distributed the drug to the states he said on the other hand the feds and states have not taken sufficient steps to incentivize physicians and pharmacists to encourage prescribing distribution and use of these drugs or to educate and motivate patients about the benefits of these potentially lifesaving medications

this interview is from sdpb s daily public affairs show in the moment hosted by lori walsh the housing affordability crisis in rapid city continues so does the housing availability crisis in pierre state lawmakers and the governor s office are working on legislation that would fund housing infrastructure in the state through grants and loans meanwhile south dakota communities are seeking solutions of their own tom johnson president and ceo of elevate rapid city is with us for an update on efforts to solve the housing crunch in the black hills area the following transcript is autogenerated tom johnson hi lori good to be with you lori walsh a research report from 2018 from the black hills knowledge network shows this community in crisis for housing availability and affordability lori walsh let s start with what you can tell us about how this situation has actually gotten worse in the past four years what are we looking at today tom johnson well i think we re following a trend that s pretty national in scope the black hills is a little more magnified i mean i think we started this journey probably about 3 000 to 5 000 housing units in the black hills behind tom johnson so when we hit covid and the crisis and with the b 21 coming to the black hills we know that there are a lot of people moving to the area we know right now there s about 2 500 people a year moving to the black hills just because of the quality of life tom johnson you add then base expansion and what s happening after covid that s probably going to be about 3 000 to 3 500 people moving to the black hills a year for the next 10 years so we ve got a population increase somewhere between 30 and 40 000 people coming to the black hills in the next decade tom johnson so if we already started behind the curve with housing that s only going to put further demand on what we need to get done tom johnson i wouldn t say we re panicked out here but we re definitely trying to get farther in front of this if you really can ever get in front of a housing crisis we re trying like heck to do that and we re going to need all the help we can get lori walsh well i want to talk about what s happening in the state in a moment but first local partnerships that you find encouraging in 2022 what s happening right now that gives you hope for solutions tom johnson yeah we decided to just right out of the gate january hire a housing coordinator in partnership with the black hills area community foundation and the john t vucurevich foundation as well tom johnson so we re partnering with two foundations here to hire a housing coordinator and this person will serve as a resource for developers coming into the community for big businesses that are looking for housing tom johnson we want to be a one stop shop for those folks who are trying to get housing things done it could be anything from the planning process we ve got resources there to helping the new school teacher find a rental unit so we re putting somebody on the ground and devoting resources and bodies to it tom johnson we ve also raised probably between about 12 to 15 million dollars locally for a revolving loan fund that can do flexible low interest backfill loans to the development community so that we can get more housing stock and more affordable housing stock tom johnson a guy like me who s making pretty good money i ve got housing flexibility even though it might be tough for me to find a house i can have that flexibility some folks that are making even 40 or 50 or 60 000 in the black hills right now they don t have that same housing flexibility tom johnson so we ve got to do everything we can to get more stock on the market and also become more affordable and that doesn t mean just single family houses that means multi family housing rental housing it means the whole nine yards lori walsh i want to talk about what s happening in pierre right now senate bill 53 and some supporting legislation are making their way through various committees and conversations lori walsh if something like a comprehensive housing plan passes and there is an influx of newly available funding sources what do you think the ideal project for rapid city and pennington county would be to pitch or apply for those kinds of new funds tom johnson well i think my answer is d all of the above lori because again we need everything in rapid city right now from infrastructure to multi family to single family tom johnson what we really like about the governor and the governor s office of economic development and the legislature is they came together with this bill to do a variety of things which includes infrastructure the potential for loan funds and it allows flexibility at the local level to do what we need to do now tom johnson in some to cases we might need to put infrastructure into the ground and the governor has made room for that in this bill in some cases we might need to help with a low interest loan for a developer and there s room in this bill for that tom johnson so we re really proud of the governor and the legislature for coming together to try to provide flexibility for communities like rapid city but it s not just rapid city i mean we re talking everybody from watertown to sioux falls to kyle we just need housing across the board and i think every community has its own flexible needs tom johnson and this bill really we re just really proud that it allows for that flexibility assuming that it gets out of the legislature lori walsh no specific project though that you think this would be ideal for my community tom johnson oh gosh like i said all of the above we ve got projects right now that we could use that infrastructure on right now to do a hundred units we ve got a project right now that s 600 units that we could use the loan fund for tom johnson so right now i got to tell you we re in contact with five or six projects a week that are looking at the black hills so when i say we can use all of it on all those projects we absolutely mean that we can i mean we re ready to go yesterday as soon as this money s available we re ready to go and apply for it

minerals or increase domestic extraction we would still be reliant on china for processing before use in end product manufacturing the white house admitted in the report the energy department announcement friday is part of the white house effort to decrease reliance on foreign minerals refining and production capacity for the green policies it is aggressively forwarding the plan is also in

will be noteworthy after he surprised markets thursday with a call for the fed funds rate to be 100 basis points or 1 percentage point higher by july producer price inflation data tuesday and fed minutes wednesday will be important releases stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between russia and ukraine and debate how quickly the federal reserve can raise interest rates markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading thursday upended many wall street forecasts for interest rate hikes investors were dealt another blow friday after the white house warned that russia could invade ukraine during the olympics both the u s and u k have called for their citizens to leave ukraine as soon as possible get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters i think the fed is keeping everyone on edge and this is going to add to that edginess said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group so we had a three week earnings respite from the macro we turned micro and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again the major averages slid sharply on friday afternoon and treasury yields came off the highs they set after thursday s report that january s consumer price index jumped by 7 5 a 40 year high the s p 500 lost 1 8 for the week falling to 4 418 with about two hours left to friday trading u s national security advisor jake sullivan told a white house briefing that there were signs of russian escalation at the ukraine border sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the olympics despite speculation to the contrary up until now i d say it was all about monetary policy this throws an extra unknown into the works said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex the dollar is rallying oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off even if nothing happens this weekend people will be nervous about it in the next week boockvar said the russian tensions complicate the central bank s outlook and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation it s causing problems for the fed because this basically would inflate oil prices food prices wheat fertilizers and everything else and just make the fed s inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver he said the fed can t back off you can t blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates he said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact it could slow hikes fed s inflation fight by friday morning some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the fed to hike interest rates by a half point in march following the january inflation report others like economists at goldman sachs have raised their views to a faster pace with as many as seven quarter point hikes for this year fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead particularly st louis fed president james bullard who appears on cnbc s squawk box monday at 8 30 a m bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points or 1 percentage point by july i think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish fed to this more hawkish fed policy which we re experiencing said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse we haven t yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency i think volatility is going to remain elevated and that s going to be more true for high valuation companies what to watch the federal reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on wednesday investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet there will also be more important inflation data when the producer price index is reported tuesday that report is also expected to be very hot after january s cpi surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump and now economists are watching consumer spending closely that means january s retail sales will also be important when it is reported wednesday there is also a final rush of big earnings reports with cisco nvidia and aig wednesday walmart reports thursday and deere reports friday we re starting to transition beyond earnings i think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did said palfrey i think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters are we able to pass through prices at the same rate fed debate palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank bullard is the only fed official who endorsed a 50 basis point hike while others like cleveland fed president loretta mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point fed chairman jerome powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it fed governor lael brainard speaks friday as does fed governor christopher waller mester speaks thursday other fed officials have pushed back on bullard s comments but still there is a high level of uncertainty in the market and bond pros are wondering if the st louis fed chief will walk back his comments monday morning liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank s tightening path the fed is full steam ahead they have to be they re still adding to the balance sheet we re still at zero on rates she said there s nothing in my mind unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens that makes the fed say we re fine we re going to stay at zero they re admitting themselves they re behind the curve they let the inflation cat out of the bag i don t think they thought it would have the traction it has had she said rate rally and reverse when bonds sell off yields go higher and they jumped this past week

rishi sunak has been urged to step up his efforts to persuade arm to return to the stock market in london earlier this week nvidia abandoned its 50billion bid for the british chip group amid intense scrutiny from regulators around the globe which were investigating the deal over competition concerns the decision has sparked a fight between the london stock exchange and the nasdaq in new york both of which want arm to float with them decision rishi sunak has been urged to step up his efforts to persuade arm to return to the stock market in london in a bitter blow for the city of london the owner of arm softbank s masayoshi son said he plans to float the cambridge based firm on the technology heavy nasdaq but leading tech figures believe son has not fully made up his mind and have urged the chancellor to do everything in his power and to roll out the red carpet for arm co founder hermann hauser told the mail last night the uk is where arm belongs but the clock is running and rishi must talk to son and give him the reassurances that he wants rishi needs to corral fund managers in the city and show son that there is the backing to make it happen former tory leader iain duncan smith said he wants to see arm back in london and has urged the government to crack on with reforms of the city to show the uk can compete with the us he said arm wants to see that there is access to lots of cheap capital at the moment this is easier for uk companies that head to the us i call on rishi sunak to deregulate so that our best companies do not decamp to the us but top fund managers believe there is plenty to attract son to london adding that arm s float would spark other tech start ups like klarna and graphcore to follow richard buxton at jupiter asset management said london has an emotional attachment to arm as it was such an outstanding success when it was listed before one idea being touted is for the government to take a stake in arm in order to reassure potential investors but some brokers were sober about the prospects of arm heading to london stating that at best the uk was fighting for a secondary listing one said the whole set up is better in the us pressure chancellor rishi sunak including analyst coverage
in this series we bust the jargon and explain a popular investing term or theme here it s the price to earnings or p e ratio what is a p e ratio investors use the price to earnings ratio the p e ratio as a way of deciding whether a company s shares are cheap or not it is based on past or future earnings that is profits the ratio shows how much you are paying for every pound of those profits there are two types of p e the forward p e is based on forecast future profits and the historic or trailing p e which is based on past profits in the us p e ratios are often called market multiples in the know investors use the price to earnings ratio the p e ratio as a way of deciding whether a company s shares are cheap or not are they used only to assess the value of companies no p e ratios are also calculated for different stock market sectors and for the main stock market indices to which a lot of attention is being paid at present the american activist investors who are currently targeting uk companies like gsk unilever shell and vodafone are said to be mobilising largely because the ftse 100 has a p e of 12 5 suggesting that opportunities abound this compares to 15 for france s cac40 index or 20 for the us s p 500 how are p e ratios calculated by dividing a company s current share price by its earnings per share the earnings per share eps can be worked out by dividing the company s net profits by the number of shares outstanding if the eps is 200 and the current share price is 2000p then the p e ratio is 10 this means that investors are willing to pay 10 for every 1 of profits generated by the company where can i find this information although you could calculate a p e ratio yourself relying on one of the online calculators why would you bother since this data is widely available if you use a platform to buy and sell shares and funds the p e ratio will be listed alongside other such vital statistics as the share price performance history market capitalisation the value of the company and the dividend yield is a high p e ratio a signal to buy or to think twice a high p e ratio could suggest that a share may be overvalued while a low p e could suggest it is a bargain but this is an oversimplification a high p e could be an indication that investors are confident that a business is set for strong growth a low p e could indicate that investors suspect a company is in a sector with poor if any growth prospects

in 2020 the gray wolf lost protections under the endangered species act esa across 44 of the lower 48 states the controversial decision by the us fish and wildlife service fws was not informed by the best available science in fact an independent peer review panel of scientists found several significant errors with the fws delisting proposal in a win for science yesterday a federal court in california struck down this decision granting esa protections to the gray wolf once again will the ruling stick the biden administration could appeal the decision and has not given a clear indication that it will not vanessa kauffman a spokesperson for fws said in an email to the hill that the administration was reviewing the decision the biden administration defended the 2020 delisting in february 2021 stating that it was made using the best scientific and commercial data available the statement stands in contrast to the view of scientists who peer reviewed the agency s delisting proposal protections for the gray wolf have long been a politicized and controversial issue in 2011 esa protections were removed for wolves in the northern rockies by congress the first time ever that the legislative body delisted an endangered species the scientific community largely agreed that this rollback of protections was not based on the best available science since the delisting of the species in the northern rockies interest groups have attempted to delist the protections for the gray wolf across most of the lower 48 states the fws submitted a proposal for this delisting in 2013 but an independent peer review as well as a majority of public comments argued against the proposed delisting and delayed the agency s decision subsequent attempts to remove protections for the gray wolf have each failed largely because the scientific consensus has not changed gray wolves remain endangered and need to be protected in their review of yesterday s federal court decision the biden administration needs to think critically about whether the science aligns with delisting protections for the gray wolf this is especially important because listing and delisting decisions under esa are legally mandated to be based on the best available science and commercial data there is no gray area for these decisions politics must steer clear protections are needed a major concern of scientists about the 2020 delisting decision was that the hunting and illegal poaching of wolves would decimate populations of the species these concerns were unfortunately validated after the 2020 decision wolf hunting increased sharply in wisconsin for example more than 200 wolves were killed in a span of less than 60 hours during the spring of 2021 far in excess of the state s quota of 119 six ojibwe tribes sued the state for violation of treaty rights secretary of interior deb haaland also penned an op ed expressing support for protections for wolves particularly because of their historical ties and significant meaning to indigenous peoples ranchers and hunters continue to express concern especially in western states that protections for wolves will increase their populations such that the carnivores will annihilate stocks of prey e g elk sheep cows but there is no scientific evidence that killing predators makes livestock safer in fact in some cases it seems that killing predators may actually worsen the problem while the gray wolf remains without protections in the northern rockies advocate groups scientists and secretary haaland have all suggested maybe it s time to bring back protections for that population hunting has increased in this area in recent years particularly in montana where quota limitations for hunting gray wolves were removed last year wolves were reintroduced to yellowstone national park in 1995 and research is showing they are having a profound and positive impact on its ecosystem in recent months more than 20 of these wolves were killed after they left the park s boundaries biden must listen to the science the fws is legally mandated to base delisting decisions solely on the best available science and in this case the science is clear gray wolves still merit endangered species protection and they play an integral role in stabilizing our country s ecosystems listening to the science in this case means the biden administration must not appeal yesterday s federal court decision the administration also should consider protecting the gray wolves in the northern rockies area given the recent uptick of deaths there due to hunting science informed policies protect us all creatures big and small we must remember that we are all interconnected when the existence of a species is threatened it threatens the health of our ecosystem and that in turn affects our health as well

methodology in this article we will focus on the dividend stocks in larry robbins portfolio for this list we collected data from glenview capital s 13f portfolio as of q3 10 best dividend stocks according to billionaire larry robbins glenview capital 10 baxter international inc nyse bax number of hedge fund holders 42 dividend yield as of february 9 1 26 glenview capital s stake value 174 350 000 an american healthcare company baxter international inc nyse bax cut its annual dividend from 0 98 to 0 51 per share during 2015 because of the company spin off however the company started growing

morgan stanley called the acquisition a transformative deal and upgraded baxter international inc nyse bax to overweight while raising the stock s price target to 110 at the end of q3 2021 42 hedge funds tracked by insider monkey held stakes in baxter international inc nyse bax down from 46 in the previous quarter the total value of these stakes is around 3 5 billion like alphabet inc nasdaq goog meta platforms inc nasdaq fb and uber technologies inc nyse uber baxter international inc nyse bax is also one of the important holdings of glenview capital in q3 cooper investors mentioned baxter international inc nyse bax in its q3 2021 investor letter here is what the firm has to say during the quarter we exited our position in baxter having originally bought in 2017 as a low risk turnaround with clear stalwart attributes in essence the core businesses were highly durable providing life sustaining or saving medical products such as iv medication or pumps and dialysis machines they had been mismanaged prior to the company spinning off its biopharmaceutical business in 2015 which had generated most of the baxter s operating profit with a new ceo in joe almeida who came with a successful track record leading another medical device company covidien we identified three sources of value latency for the new standalone baxter firstly optimising the cost structure baxter were successful here they were able to effectively double operating margins from low single digits to mid to high teens over a relatively short four year period secondly accelerating sales growth through a more focused r d effort this is inherently more difficult than cost optimisation and on this front success has been muted with only moderate impact to revenues from new product introductions finally capital deployment through baxter s significantly under levered balance sheet several smaller bolt on acquisitions were nicely complementary to the existing portfolio but in early september the company announced the acquisition of hil rom holdings a medical device company with leading positions in bed systems and patient monitoring the deal is significant at us 12 5bn in size and exhausts all balance sheet latency in one fell swoop whilst it is eps accretive we believe the high single digit roic management are targeting over five years is most reflective of the financial merits of the deal put another way despite visions of providing digital and connected healthcare think a baxter iv pump combined with a hil rom smart bed ultimately the combined entity will likely remain a low to mid single digit grower baxter look like they are getting bigger but not necessarily better this combination of uncertainty around the merits of the hil rom acquisition and the underwhelming performance on the product development side of the business led us to conclude that the investment proposition today is less attractive relative to other opportunities 9 amerisourcebergen corporation nyse abc number of hedge fund holders 44 dividend yield as of february 9 1 29 glenview capital s stake value 225 283 000 in q3 2021 glenview capital increased its stake in amerisourcebergen

leading national pharmaceutical distributor provides an example of our approach the company has been quietly bolstering its business model during the past few years to include animal health products for the european market and an expanded line of higher margin value added services that reach beyond drug distribution during these efforts valuations for the company have been under pressure due to liability issues stemming from opioid litigation as well as concerns about increased scrutiny of drug prices by politicians our team has been following these developments and believes the strides management has made on the business side are not being fully recognized by the market as more clarity has emerged related to opioid litigation we ve increased the portfolio s stake in

industry crop chemicals protect farmers fields from insects fungus and weeds which allows them to increase their crop yields as a result farmers are more than willing to pay a price premium for effective products similar to pharmaceutical companies crop protection products also are often patented which gives them pricing power in addition the development time and investment combined with

particular stocks securities or other investments one of the first things i noticed about my now fiance i ll call him ezra was that he didn t eat leftovers takeout thai pizza you name it he wouldn t eat it at first this turned into a lovely symbiotic relationship that resulted in me getting free lunch the next day it wasn t until years later that i understood how his aversion to leftovers was a tiny piece of a much larger financial puzzle ezra and i were raised with radically different perspectives on money my parents were thrifty and financially savvy our house was paid for and we enjoyed a lot of stability something i couldn t appreciate until i was much older i grew up knowing never to spend more than i had and to invest for my future for ezra things were different his childhood was punctuated by frequent moves overspending and financial stress money was for spending not saving and these discrepancies impacted our relationship in more ways than takeout leftovers here are four things we learned that helped make our relationship with money and with each other better than ever examine your past together as our relationship evolved it became clear that we needed to reconcile our differing views on finances when i would tell him how to invest his money it made him feel bad that he wasn t already doing it unbeknownst to me my insensitivity made him feel judged and he d disengage while conversations about money felt natural and normal for me for ezra they were overwhelming and nerve wracking but over time he became more forthcoming with me and we talked about how money was a source of constant stress for his family whether they had it or not it dawned on me that his family never utilized leftovers as a way to save money the way mine had and he realized that eating leftovers was a choice that had a monetary impact according to maggie gomez a certified financial planner and founder of the website money with maggie understanding your partner s history is key did they grow up poor did they grow up wealthy do they have a scarcity mindset she says then you can lead with compassion instead of judgment for us opening up about money made our lives better and it turns out we re not the only ones according to td bank s 2022 love and money survey 50 of partners in unhappy relationships are keeping a financial secret while only 32 in happy relationships are keeping one opening the doors to family history can be emotional and even traumatic if dredging up the past is creating excess stress for you and your partner it may be worth looking into a financial therapist financial therapy uses both behavioral therapy and financial coaching to help you reform your feelings and behaviors when it comes to money have the hard conversations financial conflict is a natural part of relationships 44 of partners say that they sometimes argue about money according to the 2021 fidelity investments couples money study the study also notes that 51 of couples disagree on how much they ll need to reach retirement which can make deciding how much to invest and how much to keep for the present extra tricky but when conflict does arise it s important to remember that you re a team facing a problem not that your partner is the problem if they find themselves in a tough conversation where they re disagreeing i say let s discuss the problem and let s separate it from the person says stephanie campos a certified financial planner and founder of campos financial in miami i try to avoid people saying my husband is a spender or my wife doesn t save i don t think that s helpful campos advises that before couples get serious it s important to have conversations about the nitty gritty of your goals i think a lot of couples go into the assumption of we re going to blend our lives we re going to blend our house and we re going to blend our bills says campos but one person thinks they re going to buy a million dollar house and the other person thinks they re going to buy a 500 000 house having better communication about finances wasn t just a vague skill ezra and i could applaud ourselves for ezra pulled himself out of significant debt has built up savings and has opened a roth ira i have become more compassionate and include him in my own investment planning find systems that work but stay flexible ezra and i used to split things 50 50 but when we changed jobs and had significantly different incomes we decided to use a calculator that factors in annual income when sharing expenses and investing in our retirement accounts gomez and her husband faced a similar situation but decided it was easier for them to merge finances no matter what system you land on together having one can help both you and your partner feel more aligned on how to move forward having a strong financial foundation is super important in relationships and i knew getting on the same page would help us have a more successful relationship says gomez it s always good to have a system that works for you and your partner but life happens if one of you changes jobs or loses a job or you start a family or move your systems may not work anymore so revisit how you re handling money frequently gomez suggests meeting regularly with your partner for financial date nights say once a month get together and order pizza and talk about finances you can review spending and see if you re on track for saving and spending how you want to and not as a point of judging the other for their spending invest for your future goals uncovering your past can help you better understand your motivations for the future both ezra and i felt it was important to be financially stable before starting a family so we focused more on saving for retirement that way we could benefit from compound interest over time and use our income later when we would need it more gomez says it s critical to align on investment goals before diving in i ve seen couples where one person wants to invest and the other doesn t and the person that s not investing can start to feel behind so getting on the same page about investing is really important she says and determining how much of your overall budget you want to set aside or put towards investing is going to be important because then there s no resentment on either side aligning on investment goals isn t just about how much money to put toward your goals you should also discuss how much risk you re comfortable taking what types of investments are best for your portfolios and what types of retirement accounts such as iras or 401 k s work best for you if you and your partner are feeling a little lost when it comes to investing for retirement or any other goal it might be worth speaking with a financial advisor who can help you identify financial goals create a financial plan build a budget and start investing alana benson writes for nerdwallet email abenson nerdwallet com the article how my fiance and i reconciled our relationships with money originally appeared on nerdwallet
debates over interest rates will likely dominate markets again in the week ahead as investors look for guidance from federal reserve officials on the course of central bank rate hikes this year concerns over russia ukraine tensions spooked investors friday and may continue to hang over the markets st louis fed president james bullard appears on cnbc s squawk box monday morning his comments will be noteworthy after he surprised markets thursday with a call for the fed funds rate to be 100 basis points or 1 percentage point higher by july producer price inflation data tuesday and fed minutes wednesday will be important releases stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between russia and ukraine and debate how quickly the federal reserve can raise interest rates markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading thursday upended many wall street forecasts for interest rate hikes investors were dealt another blow friday after the white house warned that russia could invade ukraine during the olympics both the u s and u k have called for their citizens to leave ukraine as soon as possible get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters i think the fed is keeping everyone on edge and this is going to add to that edginess said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group so we had a three week earnings respite from the macro we turned micro and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again the major averages slid sharply on friday afternoon and treasury yields came off the highs they set after thursday s report that january s consumer price index jumped by 7 5 a 40 year high the s p 500 lost 1 8 for the week falling to 4 418 with about two hours left to friday trading u s national security advisor jake sullivan told a white house briefing that there were signs of russian escalation at the ukraine border sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the olympics despite speculation to the contrary up until now i d say it was all about monetary policy this throws an extra unknown into the works said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex the dollar is rallying oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off even if nothing happens this weekend people will be nervous about it in the next week boockvar said the russian tensions complicate the central bank s outlook and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation it s causing problems for the fed because this basically would inflate oil prices food prices wheat fertilizers and everything else and just make the fed s inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver he said the fed can t back off you can t blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates he said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact it could slow hikes fed s inflation fight by friday morning some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the fed to hike interest rates by a half point in march following the january inflation report others like economists at goldman sachs have raised their views to a faster pace with as many as seven quarter point hikes for this year fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead particularly st louis fed president james bullard who appears on cnbc s squawk box monday at 8 30 a m bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points or 1 percentage point by july i think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish fed to this more hawkish fed policy which we re experiencing said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse we haven t yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency i think volatility is going to remain elevated and that s going to be more true for high valuation companies what to watch the federal reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on wednesday investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet there will also be more important inflation data when the producer price index is reported tuesday that report is also expected to be very hot after january s cpi surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump and now economists are watching consumer spending closely that means january s retail sales will also be important when it is reported wednesday there is also a final rush of big earnings reports with cisco nvidia and aig wednesday walmart reports thursday and deere reports friday we re starting to transition beyond earnings i think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did said palfrey i think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters are we able to pass through prices at the same rate fed debate palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank bullard is the only fed official who endorsed a 50 basis point hike while others like cleveland fed president loretta mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point fed chairman jerome powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it fed governor lael brainard speaks friday as does fed governor christopher waller mester speaks thursday other fed officials have pushed back on bullard s comments but still there is a high level of uncertainty in the market and bond pros are wondering if the st louis fed chief will walk back his comments monday morning liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank s tightening path the fed is full steam ahead they have to be they re still adding to the balance sheet we re still at zero on rates she said there s nothing in my mind unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens that makes the fed say we re fine we re going to stay at zero they re admitting themselves they re behind the curve they let the inflation cat out of the bag i don t think they thought it would have the traction it has had she said rate rally and reverse when bonds sell off yields go higher and they jumped this past week the 10 year yield was as high as 2 06 friday after the ukraine news the 10 year yield was back down to about 1 93 the 2 year yield was at a high of 1 63 friday up from 1 32 the week earlier the biggest moves were thursday and the yield on the 2 year note moved more than 20 basis points thursday but by friday afternoon it had fallen back to 1 51 week ahead calendar

analyzing other people s relationships which is to say gossiping about them can be the beginning of moral inquiry wrote the literary critic phyllis rose it s how we workshop our ideas about power care and the way we want to live lately we ve been gossip deprived the air s been thick with judgment but that judgment has concentrated in less intimate quadrants public health politics we re hungry for stories of others domestic arrangements if only to gain a little perspective on or escape from our own so when heather havrilesky declared in the new york times do i hate my husband oh for sure yes definitely people feasted the atlantic s david frum likened the essay excerpted from havrilesky s new book foreverland on the divine tedium of marriage to filing your divorce papers in front of millions of people in a now deleted tweet the feminist writer andi ziesler suggested with magnificent passive aggression it might be a net good if we stopped conflating successful marriage and marriage that lasts forever strikingly many readers responses doubled as paeans to their spouses in a substack post jill filipovic called her own marriage the first relationship of my life that felt expansive my marriage is a source of intense joy in my life josh barro wrote in his newsletter why not shout it from the rooftops albert burneko denouncing the excerpt as an incomprehensibly monstrous betrayal also took the occasion to celebrate his wife on the website defector i follow her around the house like a cat following a laser pointer some might call this defensive i find it sort of sweet though their authors may not realize it such tributes operate in basically the same genre as havrilesky s memoir they at least make many of the same moves insist you are neither saintly nor smug for glorying in your marriage say you got lucky still you d be justified in taking foreverland as an unwitting indictment of hetero marriage the nuclear family the whole catastrophe havrilesky the longtime author of the advice column ask polly makes the milestones of white picket fence life sound miserable when they got engaged i knew for the first time that bill would never stop tormenting me with his nerves and his bad judgment at their wedding i looked like an overwrapped present hormonal overwhelmed underslept jittery full of dread but for every complaint about his throat clearing like the fussiest butler in the mansion there are some exquisitely simple moments of recognition bill is my only friend she thinks when at a tense moment he puts his hand on her knee advertisement at some point over the years havrilesky explains my love had started to take the shape of sleepwalking in her view a marriage that depends on peacekeeping through silence and studious ignorance might as well be dead paying attention is an unalloyed romantic good so is self expression she won t settle for one descriptor when she can have six the prose tumbles out in helpless run ons earnest asyndeton an infant is a cloud a ball of white light a sweet duckling that smells like vanilla beans a giggling monster an angry rabbit recounting their lives together she overextends her metaphors so far it s like she s hoping to hear the joints pop when that verbosity swamps their fights her husband wades in thankfully bill is bill she writes he boarded a boat and sailed down my river of words until we reached dry land together he listens not just with patience but also with interest havrilesky won t win over everyone with her high saturation comic style but to readers receptive to that kind of swashbuckling bluster bill i suspect among them the sheer effort of her prose is a kind of valentine readers who crave that warm feeling of being taken into someone s confidence will also find a lot to like in laura kipnis s love in the time of contagion a diagnosis apologies to the washington post s copy desk which not long into 2020 unofficially banned all forms of the phrase in the time of in pandemic related headlines like havrilesky kipnis a social critic and film professor styles herself as a teller of unflattering truths embracing life s messes completely uninhibited she doesn t disclose as much about her current relationship but her book taking stock of the pandemic s effects on intimacy does go deep into her conversations with friends one chapter exploring the concept of codependency grows out of zooms with a recent divorcé mason in which they dissect his 20 year marriage to an alcoholic another maps the dense entanglements of a former student zelda queer black and very online who acts as our field guide to a new lingua franca of hookups screenshots and dms young adults kipnis marvels are creative geniuses at using their phones and screens to create unbelievable romantic chaos and misery the commentary about various interpersonal dynamics never quite resolves into a particular thesis reading these chapters juicy and repetitive absorbing and exhausting feels like looking too long at a hyperrealist painting objects are rendered in eye popping detail but our gaze has nowhere to rest advertisement the absence of a unifying narrative may be the point kipnis believes that we overvalue tidiness the metoo movement primed us to view physicality with suspicion she argues and the pandemic only exacerbated our libido killing compulsion to police our interpersonal boundaries kipnis s best known work may be her 2003 anti marriage polemic against love but she shares at least this cornerstone of havrilesky s worldview true intimacy is less glamorous and more laborious than anyone admits share this article share decades from now we might view love in the time of contagion as inescapably a pandemic book less because of its subject matter than because of something more essential about its composition its circling obsessiveness and sometimes distorted sense of scale feel like outgrowths of this moment a period when many of us have retreated discouraged from making unexpected new connections our mental habits grooved by feeds that algorithmically deliver whatever triggers us you detect that crampedness in the book s small comprehensively interrogated cast of characters you see it too in the skippable second chapter which rehearses provocations familiar to readers of kipnis s recent work especially unwanted advances from 2017 the campus left has abandoned liberation for puritanism society punishes sexual transgressors too harshly we villainize intergenerational pairings old dust ups a jezebel article she disliked jeffrey toobin s suspension from cnn occupy bafflingly broad tracts of real estate kipnis s intellectual restlessness is what makes her so fun to read in love in the time of contagion she seems to be climbing the walls advertisement so it s a relief to reach the book s coda which collects short dispatches overheard on the internet about relationships in lockdown it s as if kipnis has cracked open a window here are entire unexplored worlds he counts out how many berries he eats for breakfast and before you ask twelve blackberries or eighteen blueberries one person reports i worry that large swaths of society cannot love each other but my relationship with my wife is solid she s the little bit of the future that i can still imagine says another these gleanings feel like the book s freshest offering a rich supply of something very like gossip what fascinated rose about marriage was how it presents an observer with parallel lives the members of a couple build narratives of their experiences which are sometimes similar but also inevitably separate a successful marriage doesn t hinge on these narratives relationship to objective truth but the couple has to agree about what kind of story they re in havrilesky s and kipnis s books confirm this much at least there s nothing worse than losing your shared sense of plot there s nothing more excruciating and worthwhile than the struggle to recover it and there s always an outsider ready to eavesdrop sophia nguyen is an assistant editor for outlook and posteverything at the washington post foreverland on the divine tedium of marriage by heather

dictated health policies relevant to those companies price went on to head the health and human services department under former president trump supporters of the tougher restrictions maintain that

power running from boston to washington using january to make public predictions about the year ahead is an ironclad tradition usually these predictions end up being completely wrong because no one here has any idea what they re talking about i hope that holds true in my case because i want to use my mandatory annual forecast to dump a few gallons of cold contrarian water on what seems to have recently become a fashionable prediction that the woke ideological revolution roiling the west has peaked and will soon be in full blown retreat consider a handful of examples of this new genre while a few of those examples are from earlier in 2021 this theme seems to have really emerged and begun to solidify into a consensus among more centrist types soon after the beginning of november 2021 that was when some conservative american politicians won or almost won a few special elections in part by riding a popular backlash to critical race theory in schools and a number of local ballot measures to defund police departments failed around the country republicans feeling especially good about their chances against a flailing biden started drooling over a red wave expected to sweep them back to power in the 2022 midterm elections and now that private equity executive turned virginia governor glenn youngkin has personally won the culture war s battle of midway the tide has turned and aside from the occasional messy beachhead here or there inevitable victory is now in sight or something they could have taken note of all the fundamental factors driving this ideological belief system all of which had to be painstakingly uncovered layer by layer even as it swept through every institution but they have not like do they even read the pages and pages of erudite substack anthropology on the topic no look honestly i really didn t want to have to do this come the new year i had resolved to focus on the positives and all that crap but i haven t seen anyone else do it so guess i have no choice and the duty falls to me to deliver the pessimistic news no the revolution is far from over so in what might also serve as a handy tour guide to the vast depths of the ideological abyss catalogued at length here in convenient listicle format are twenty reasons to get woke and despair what is called wokeness or the successor ideology or the new faith or what have you note the foe hasn t even been successfully named yet let alone routed rests on a series of what are ultimately metaphysical beliefs the fact that their holders would laugh at the suggestion they have anything called metaphysical beliefs is irrelevant they hold them nonetheless such as the world is divided into a dualistic struggle between oppressed and oppressors good and evil language fundamentally defines reality therefore language and more broadly the word thought logic logos is raw power and is used by oppressors to control the oppressed this has created power hierarchies enforced by the creation of false boundaries and authorities no oppression existed in the mythic past the utopian pre hierarchical state of nature in which all were free and equal the stain of injustice only entered the world through the original sin of western civilizational hierarchy all disparities visible today are de facto proof of the influence of hierarchical oppression discrimination to redeem the world from sin i e to end oppression and achieve social justice to return to the kingdom of heaven on earth all false authorities and boundaries must be torn down deconstructed all injustice anywhere is interlinked intersectional so the battle against injustice is necessarily total ultimate victory is cosmically ordained by history though the arc of progress may be long moral virtue and true right to rule is determined by collective status within the oppression oppressed dialectic morally neutral political liberalism is a lie constructed by the powerful to maintain status quo structures of oppression the first step to liberation can be achieved through acquisition of the hidden knowledge of the truth of this dialectic a select awoken vanguard must therefore guide a revolution in popular consciousness all imposed limits on the individual can ultimately be transcended by virtue of a will to power i could go on but the real point is that and they have a strong civilizational resonance because they are in fact not arbitrary but deeply rooted in a metaphysical struggle that effectively stretches to the very beginning of western theological and philosophical thought and that s unlikely to change anytime soon because i mean did the gaping hole of meaning in people s lives created by the uprooting forces of secular liquid modernity get resolved in some alternative way while we weren t looking you know the spiritual void that this creepy chimeric faith ideology and its romantic political crusades rushed to fill in the first place has decadent nihilism stopped being the defining sentiment of the age did the young even become hyper nationalists or revolutionary marxist class warriors instead have they found an alternative passionate heroic narrative to act out in some new davos slide deck no and in fact meanwhile it also seems that it sure seems like the kind of robust communities civic associations and little platoons which once served to fortify society against the revolutionary per burke and totalitarian per arendt forces that thrive on atomization haven t suddenly been rebuilt from the ground up in fact even the most basic such unit and that may be because that is liberalism made the autonomy of the individual its highest good to maximize individual autonomy this is certainly deserving of more argument than i have space to recap here see four big questions for the counter revolution for a bit more liberalism has thus acted as a centrifugal force severing all the centripetal counter forces that once kept individuals connected to recognizably human communities and launching them outward towards solitary orbits where they can drift cold and alone in their pods from this perspective it is more obvious why the amorphous ideology referred to as wokeness so often seems mixed up and chaotically self contradictory it is the confused response to two opposite instincts on the one hand in identity groups and in fixed racial identity in particular but on the other hand celebrating an individual s right to self define everything about themselves without limit up to and including their own concept of material reality this cognitive dissonance has never been much more than an ideological speedbump however don t get your hopes up and this hyper individualism has now collided head first with the technological revolution which increasingly positions itself as offering hope for the boundless potential necessary to escape from any natural limits whatsoever including by fracturing any solid definition of what we once thought it meant to be human and speaking of technology and fracturing meanwhile ultimately what s more important in driving societal change ideas individuals material conditions or technological forces that s a fascinating question to debate but for now all that matters is that it s become manifestly clear that the ongoing revolution in information technology most notably the internet and social media has been a tremendous driver of cultural and political change in fact a growing number of thinkers tend to attribute nearly the entire phenomenon of wokeness to technological factors social scientist jonathan haidt for example traces it directly to the 2009 2012 period when twitter added the retweet button and facebook added the share button and whatever the precise influence of technological change in driving the revolution it certainly hasn t ended when the invention of the gutenberg printing press launched an information revolution in the 15th century the full consequences took well over a century to play out a century of theological chaos bitter division and bloodshed the mass media revolution of radio then helped do the same in the 20th century we should hardly expect the consequences of the internet to be any less dramatic or long lasting in part we ve already seen how its disintegrative effect has helped ensure that who or what institution today is now able to establish any kind of common metaphysical framework common moral narrative common vision of a properly ordered life common norms or even a common reality that most of society will respect trust follow and collectively defend cnn ted cruz yeah no we can move on but how then can this ideological upheaval quickly be put to rest exactly considering this and all of the above it really shouldn t be a surprise to discover that actually political strategists have been pointing out for some time now that woke ideas like critical race theory and defunding the police are not politically popular and are hamstringing the democratic party s electoral chances so theoretically they would just drop these things stop talking about them change course and talk about popular things but of course it s not that simple because some small portion of their base maybe some 8 of americans are true believers gripped by a religious fervor that transcends political calculation and this minority is steering the ship because unfortunately for those dreaming of harnessing a majority anti woke popular will the truth is that as statistician and philosopher nassim taleb has explained in detail it s typically not the majority that sets new societal rules if the vast majority generally prefers to eat food a instead of food b but a small minority is absolutely insistent on eating food b and is willing to start chopping the heads off of anyone who disagrees and serves food a and the majority doesn t care enough to get all bloody dying on this particular culinary hill all restaurants will soon be serving only food b the new national cuisine this is especially true if the intolerant minority already holds a disproportionate position of influence within the system given that let s imagine for example that some lawmakers officially ban the teaching of critical race theory in their state s schools or universities will this be the end of the matter no of course not as one consultant cleric recently advised teachers don t say critical race theory you re going to see how classroom teachers apply some of these pedagogical models in ways where they don t even mention the words critical race theory but are doing anti racist work yes the work of spreading the new good news shall not be stopped will they be fired by the woke human resources department or the woke principal abandoned by the woke teachers union reported to the state by their un woke peers all of whom have already been systematically purged from the collective for their heresy if concerned parents do manage to get them fired who will hire their replacements why the woke hr department the people who actually set the effective policy of any institution are inevitably the personnel located in the power centers closest to implementation or as a chinese saying goes for every measure that comes down from on high a countermeasure arises from below 上有政策 下有對策 that principle works equally well for a revolutionary professional managerial class as it does for beleaguered counter revolutionary peasants and in this case the reality is that have the top universities already been retaken from the woke or replaced no one still imaginary university in austin doesn t count what about the elite finishing schools the accreditation companies most mainstream news media the social media companies the publishing houses hollywood the major foundations the non profits and the think tanks the consulting and accounting companies the investment banks the nasdaq the digital service providers the hr departments of the fortune 500 and most of their boards the law schools the bar association the permanent federal bureaucratic state heck even halliburton no at such a ludicrous suggestion the cathedral merely echoes with the mocking laughter of the new woke high clerisy they know from experience that when herbert marcuse and the rest of the neo marxists and critical theorists of the frankfurt school finally took to heart antonio gramsci s directive to seize cultural hegemony and first conceived of launching rudi dutschke s long march through the institutions it was only the start of the 1970s it was not until almost fifty years later that their dream was realized however much the last several years may have seemed like an avalanche of shockingly rapid ideological coup d états to those who saw power abruptly change hands in their institutions one after another coups only succeed if the backers necessary to support them are already in place now much as marcuse was lamenting in 1971 that the fact that the radical left has no equal access to the great chains of information and indoctrination is largely responsible for its isolation the right and its moderate liberal fellow travelers today find themselves isolated and impotent in turn and yet in response instead mostly trying to either force the institutions to behave differently through political power mostly pointless or fleeing from the institutions entirely in a bid to create new ones from the ground up a longshot if more promising either way they seem to hope everything achieved by the left can be reversed in the matter of only a few years which is naïve on multiple levels because in his book bowling alone the legendary political scientist robert putnam explained that sweeping social changes typically only occur generation to generation or through what he called cohort change for most people the formative experiences of coming to age are truly formative afterwards their fundamental values will typically barely change for the rest of their lives for this reason as tanner greer adeptly elaborates it is necessarily the case that culture wars are long wars because cultural insurgents win few converts in their own cohort instead the real target of ideas are not their contemporaries but their contemporaries children and grandchildren so for the generational cohort at the height of its power any change will seem to only be happening very gradually but eventually a transition point is reached and the end falls swift the older cohorts suddenly find themselves outnumbered and outgunned swept up in a flood they had assumed was a mere trickle they are shocked and confused but only because the revolution occurring below did not echo in their souls like it did for the youth whose views they neglected or ignored only once it is far too late do they realize their mistake hence even if the anti woke were prepared to launch their own long march through the institutions the cohort from which they would currently need to recruit their talent is the same one that s been busy tearing things down and chanting the revolution will not uphold the constitution of generation z americans those born after 1996 51 report that america is inextricably linked to white supremacy 52 support racial reparations 60 believe systemic racism is widespread in general society and 64 say rioting and looting is justified to some degree by the need to address systemic racism by whatever means necessary 51 believe the gender binary is outdated and up to 40 self identify as lgbtq although gallup separately finds only about 16 do compared to 2 of baby boomers 59 support expanding non binary gender options 41 support censorship of hate speech 66 support shouting down speakers they consider offensive and 23 support using violence to silence such speakers 61 have positive views of socialism and 70 think government should do more to solve problems sorry conservatives but even if gen alpha those born after 2010 were all to become rampant little reactionaries tomorrow but why are the youth so woke anyway well maybe for one thing at least back in 2015 when most people still thought of what is now referred to as wokeness only as a bizarre and vaguely amusing phenomenon that was isolated to college campuses jonathan haidt and greg lukianoff published an essay titled the coddling of the american mind in the atlantic later to become a book of the same name as an early hypothesis of what was happening they advanced an essentially psychological explanation for why so many college students were suddenly acting simultaneously like fragile snowflakes and rabid authoritarians thanks to the embrace of the self esteem movement and helicopter parenting by their boomer parents along with liability risk aversion by institutions young people had grown up physically and psychologically coddled and therefore emotionally fragile by this the authors specifically meant that these unhealthy beliefs included always trusting your feelings assuming disagreement is always a personal attack and believing hurtful words lead to real harm including permanent trauma normalization of these beliefs led to a cult of safety on campuses with hyper attention devoted to the prevention of offense because it was now actual violence hence the emergence of such innovations as microaggressions trigger warnings and safe spaces i must admit that i ve grown a bit skeptical of this explanation by now as things have progressed it s become increasingly clear to me that but it does seem true that gen z sadly does indeed suffer from much higher rates of mental illness than older generations though the millennials are very close even before the pandemic the rate of anxiety and depression recorded in their age group nearly doubled between 2007 and 2018 as they came of age the suicide rate rose 57 from 2009 to 2019 the proportion of high school students reporting persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness increased by 40 only 45 reported their mental health was good overall in 2018 one third reported having a mental health or substance abuse problem they are also far and away the loneliest generation meanwhile our whole culture seems to have grown significantly more possessed by emotivism in general to the point that the decline of rational language and the rise of emotional reasoning can even be tracked quantitatively but i digress if we assume any of this may be causally related to the revolution the real question for us here is has any of this gotten better of course not the pandemic has had a devastating impact on gen z s already fragile mental health up to seven in ten now report feeling depressed rates of severe depression rose to around 25 hospitalization for suicide attempts by girls in particular rose 51 from 2019 to 2021 meanwhile far from pulling back at all on the cult of safety colleges have now expanded it to absolutely insane levels and speaking of anxious entitled young people in what is rapidly becoming one of my preferred explanations for the revolution the evolutionary anthropologist mathematician prophet of doom peter turchin has identified elite overproduction as having been one of the top drivers of revolution and civil conflict throughout history he points to the tendency for decadent societies leading to large numbers ofof the type who tend pine after the position and status they deserve and eventually start spending their free time starting revolutionary cells or as james lindsay has put it all the children of the upper middle class bourgeoisie fake elites who find they will likely never be part of the truly wealthy elite e g bezos that they aspire to be have quickly become a breeding ground for ressentiment in society instead but scrabbling desperately with one another for status and horrified at the idea of ever falling into the ranks of the mere working class the overproduced elites have found another solution and now they ve succeeded in creating their own job market e g critical theorists diversity consultants out of thin air or as mary harrington recently put it succinctly once you start seeing the calls for moral re evaluation of everything as a mass job application on behalf of an ever expanding surplus of arts graduates it s difficult to unsee and in this crowded hyper competitive world of the bourgeoisie the surest way to move up is to take someone else down hence cancel culture and the vast elaborate ever changing mandatory correct vocabulary that functions as a way to help weed out any of the competition or dirty proles who can t keep up thus wokeness it s just that thanks to the latest expansion of a huge growing industry of administrators and consultants the professional managerial class has an array of profitable new fallback options after investment banker now instead of having to labor through something difficult like medical school in order to achieve a respectable well paid career one can always become a chief diversity officer average annual salary in northern california in 2021 231 500 to 329 500 fortunately the government is there to help make sure this will remain an option in perpetuity because why are america s university presidents and ceos so terrified of their gen z students and employees capitulating immediately to their every demand is it because twitter has become basically their entire world do they as theodore roosevelt once said of william mckinley just have the backbone of a chocolate eclair probably a bit of both but likely much more important is that they are terrified of the law this includes the concept that all disparities are due to discrimination disparate impact the requirement that employers relentlessly police private speech that could be in any way offensive to any protected class to prevent a hostile work environment and affirmative action in hiring moreover the law as written is so deliberately vague in its language that any new claims to rights raised by any protected identity group can be seamlessly slipped into the body of harms that any company or organization must legally prevent so for example if any employee refuses for whatever reason to refer to another employee by their chosen gender pronouns the entire company is in real danger of being held liable for violation of title ix and title vii by permitting discrimination on the basis of sex as affirmed by the supreme court in its bostock decision or at least so the company must assume because the potential financial penalties are far too high to risk it the nonconforming employee is getting the boot unless they themselves are of a protected class that could conceivably sue for being fired due to their identity including by subjecting employees to a vast numbers of training sessions run by dei consultants all of which can if necessary then be pointed to in court as evidence that the company was definitely doing everything it could to prevent any discrimination from occurring hence why while fewer than 30 of organizations had an hr office in 1955 that number had grown to 70 by 1985 and today it is close to 100 of all firms of any significant size so as christopher caldwell has painstakingly explained the unintended legacy of the original emergency measures of 1964 wasthen the fear of litigation privatized the suppression of disagreement or even of speculation and so the phenomenon of political correctness emerged as simply the cultural effect of the basic enforcement powers of civil rights law but because enforcement gradually expanded through new case law and executive orders and therefore there was no statutory smoking gun behind it this new system of censorship was easily mistaken for a change in the public mood or as richard hanania has put it simply the fact that we now have uniformly woke institutions is just civil rights law practically speaking this means any claim by conservative politicians that they will put an end to wokeness if elected to office is pure theater have i mentioned how very woke law students are but unless these politicians are willing to take on the politically suicidal task of reforming the civil rights act practically holy writ in american society due to having tackled a genuinely great moral wrong nothing they do will have any significant impact on the concrete incentives at play so it s a safe bet that they will just posture rhetorically and pass another tax cut instead and speaking of incentives those who live outside places like washington d c or san francisco might hear the word philanthropy and think it means feeding the hungry or something naïve and low brow like that but philanthropy is really a word for how the concentrated power latent in oligarchic money is transformed into applied political and cultural power in this process money from concentrations of wealth today mostly from the tech industry flows tax free into very special institutions called foundations where it is laundered of any appearance of corrupt influence or nefarious motive and then handed out to the vast constellation of non profit ngos activist organizations think tanks and academic programs that subsist almost entirely on such money where it can find a way to inspire change a large proportion of the elite in places like washington are engaged in helping facilitate this process as their full time labor how to spot a budding young elite aspiring to join this trade simply scan their job applications for polite requests to be given some power pretty please such as a stated desire to make an impact or change the world government officials being lazy and chummy with the non profit experts and executives who are often former or future colleagues simply copy their ideas almost directly into the rules they implement alternatively those in the government with an agenda can hand over trial policy ideas in the other direction to be validated independently by the other side of the blob this wealth foundation ngo government complex thus works in unison to pour huge amounts of money power into causes that are essentially by definition progressive ones being to affect rapid change today this means there are massive tides of woke capital hard at work changing the world how much money well as thomas edsall writes in the new york times about just one cause du jour hundreds of new institutions will have been set up to get in on the feeding frenzy and all of these now have an incentive to justify their existence in perpetuity by hyping whatever problem they purportedly exist to solve in time their specific priorities may change as the foundations priorities change but one thing you can be sure of is that those priorities will stay woke because if you begin to dig into what say the ford foundation has gotten up to in its lifetime the deeper you go the more and more horrifying it gets until you learn they were the ones who essentially invented modern left wing identity politics in the united states in the first place the ford foundation is also a great example of how the foundations often run riot well beyond even the intentions of their donors henry ford ii went to his grave lamenting the family had ever set theirs up in the first place describing it as a fiasco from my point of view from day one having got out of control because i didn t have enough confidence in myself at that stage to push and scream and yell and tell them to go fuck themselves you know which i should have done we can get thrown out or we can go broke but those people they ve got nobody to answer to but even the foundations despite their zeal and close relationship with government may ultimately wield only a shadow of the influence exerted more quietly by titans of finance like the big three asset managers blackrock vanguard and state street with a collective 22 trillion in assets under management and owning an average of 22 of the typical s p 500 company both by acting as voting proxies for their index fund investors and through the environmental social and corporate governance esg standards they choose to set as requirements for investment and because these firms leaders are now woke or at least see advantage in acting woke there is now as vivek ramaswamy has explained in detail in woke inc constant pressure on companies to get woke too or face losing critical access to capital in any case whether it s the influence of foundations or asset managers what should be obvious is not only is the american political class power over moneyed interests held back by legal limits but they also have significant political and personal incentives not to upset the same elite coastal donor and investor class that funds their campaigns and employs them after they retire despite their collective anger about wokeness america s conservatives in particular still seem to have no real consensus or even understanding of how to begin to tackle such a problem given their traditional worship of capital which is a big problem given that given all of the above it should be clear by now that political opposition to the revolution is rather unlikely to be sufficient yet what else has emerged so far as outlined in detail above the woke left is unloading huge amounts of cash to advance the social causes that matter to them if people standing up to the woke are being fired for their ideals and losing their employer provided health insurance for example does the right have a concrete plan to make sure they have an alternative how many people other than oren cass have started seriously considering a new conservative wave of unionization by now and if this is a culture war is there a conservative foundation for the arts no it doesn t seem like it at least the dissident right has some great memes and a lot of people who can tell you more than you ever wanted to know about cryptocurrencies i guess so even if red tribe does sweep the elections in november or 2024 what is likely to be the result and speaking of politics in such a scenario donald trump may not have been the cause of the revolution but his presidency certainly helped send it into overdrive worked into frothing at the mouth levels of outrage the ranks of the resistance were easily converted to wokeness on the purely tribal need to be for whatever trump was against traditional liberal principles be damned america s partisan political rancor has hardly improved in the year since trump left the white house if anything it is somehow even worse so let me make a prediction if trump wins again in 2024 some might argue this has already begun meanwhile even if anti woke republicans were to seize back the white house with or without trump they would soon learn that in the end at the risk of sounding like one of them conspiracy theorists who really controls the power centers in the united states are all these run by elected representatives accountable to the people including an elected president and his appointees who then set a policy direction which is faithfully executed it may be worth considering that this is simply not the case that instead these power centers are and who all happen to have went to the same schools let s go hoyas and received the same prestigious fellowships from the same foundations and share overlapping networks and marry each other and hang out at the same parties even though secretly they actually all mostly loathe one another and who hire each other as they cycle seamlessly between the public and private sectors and who all consume the same media and like to send each other the same latest must read piece in the atlantic or whatever and who somehow all use exactly the same identical phraseology when they humble brag on linkedin as when they issue a state department press release it may then be the case that this class prefers to believe that they have a certain right to rule as they do a certain nobility of superior virtue merit and knowledge that justifies their permanent hold on power and the material gains that happen to come from it it may then be that if any entity intrudes into this body politic from outside it naturally gets all inflamed and ideologically feverish in an attempt to purge the infection by whatever means necessary both to reassert control and so its members can assure themselves that they are in fact still the good guys the ones who retain the mandate of history as it were and it might be that this class which is of course the most diverse inclusive and enlightened ever assembled by said history has recently come to realize they aren t much liked by the masses out there those people whose wild and unpredictable behavior driven by dark irrational impulses is impossible to understand even after a safari in that case they may have determined that it is necessary to form a united front transcending any specific past political demarcations to make sure none of those dangerous barbarians ever gets anywhere close to the levers of power in our democracy if all this were the case there might be a need to build a big beautiful metaphorical wall to separate the inner from the outer allies from enemies the good people from the bad people in this effort a strict moral ideology like a state religion but with none of that unscientific stuff would be an essential tool to distinguish between us and them and to help keep dangerous dissenters from polluting the united front with class treason and then once this firewall was in place if any wrong thinking elements with the incorrect ideological encryption key were to be mistakenly elected by misinforming the people they could be instantly identified isolated contained and suppressed before they could do any harm to the system it might be worth considering this theory just in case what s happened is that in the end it may be that revolution isn t quite the right word for wokeness after all true this is happening at the individual level with many a white male manager finding himself suddenly replaced by someone younger and more diverse but at the broader level this is a revolution that has been who show little fear that they will ever be replaced as a class indeed they seem to have adopted woke ideology as a wonderfully useful tool for reinforcing their position while punishing their inter and intra class rivals in this way the woke revolution strikes me as and not just because of a similar ideological emphasis on the destruction of the four olds old ideas old culture old habits and old customs as many have now pointed out already rather because at root the cultural revolution was started by mao seeing many of his peers as encroaching on his authority and threatening the continued centralization of power he stirred up an internal revolution to destroy them while reenergizing the party base just like then things may not turn out quite how today s woke riding elite hope of course the cultural revolution became an uncontrollable inferno that consumed many who thought themselves safe or even to be its leaders but it seems to me that the woke revolution as co opted by the elite is being tailored to point not towards dissolution and lawless chaos forever in this revolution the liberation and safety of the individual by the state becomes the greatest good each individual comes under the tender empathetic care of the state alone which ensures their liberty through safety the state contains only autonomous individuals whose general will is represented by the state hobbes leviathan wakes in 2019 america s most celebrated high priest of wokeness ibram x kendi was invited by politico magazine to offer his take on how to fix american politics he proposed an an anti racist constitutional amendment that would make unconstitutional racial inequity and racist ideas by public officials and establish and permanently fund department of anti racism doa comprised of formally trained experts on racism and no political appointees the doa would be responsible for preclearing all local state and federal public policies to ensure they won t yield racial inequity monitor those policies investigate private racist policies when racial inequity surfaces and monitor public officials for expressions of racist ideas the doa would be empowered with disciplinary tools to wield over and against policymakers and public officials who do not voluntarily change their racist policy and ideas most would of course argue that the chance of such an amendment ever being passed in today s united states is basically zero but kendi s idea of through which unelected and unaccountable trained experts would tirelessly ensure democracy can no longer be misled by unacceptable people or ideas is this not a sight of awful beauty for here is leviathan emerging from the deep momentarily visible as it crests above the waves here is kendi revealing the whole telos the whole intended final destiny of the woke revolution as it and the shared destiny of the technocratic state rush to merge into one point of singularity where all shall be consumed as i said in the beginning i hope i am wrong but i think it is perhaps too soon to scoff at kendi s plan to trust that this is not where we are headed in the end eventually if a firm stand is not taken not if the terrible truth is that wokeness is leviathan and leviathan is woke some of these many explanations above for what continues to drive wokeness may seem contradictory and perhaps some are but they also aren t necessarily exclusive and in fact there are certainly likely to be many more factors than this list contains like a hydra today s revolution is a complex beast with many heads its causes and its consequences may be multitudinous also like a hydra it is likely to prove very difficult to kill if there is a wave of conservative political victories in u s elections this november expect the wokeness is dead takes to come fast and heavy but hopefully now you won t be fooled and will know the revolution isn t over so if you re looking for a vision of hope and change and ultimate victory well you ll just have to tune in another time in the meantime why not subscribe

dave kolpack and sara burnett associated press as the omicron wave of the coronavirus subsides several u s states including nevada new york and illinois ended mask mandates this week for indoor settings while others lifted requirements at schools the white house says talks are underway about how and when to move the country out of the emergency phase of the pandemic but in the meantime people are advised to keep following guidance from the u s centers for disease control and prevention recommending mask use in indoor settings in places with high transmission rates here s a look at what happened with mask rules this week why are many places lifting mask mandates now mainly it s the drop in hospitalizations and case counts even in states that have enacted the most stringent rules this week s epidemiological report from the world health organization showed that case counts fell 50 in the united states and 17 worldwide across the u s covid 19 hospitalizations have dropped nearly 30 over the past three weeks others have cited the protections offered by vaccines as well as the increased availability of at home testing kits and therapeutics for those who catch the virus more ready for the super bowl seven eastern connecticut restaurants to stock your party the risk has also fallen dramatically for health care workers many of whom have either been exposed to the virus or are fully vaccinated and boosted said dr craig spencer a new york city emergency room physician he said medical workers have been dealing with covid long enough that treating it has become run of the mill akin to dealing with heart attacks or other conditions typically seen in an er honestly for us right now covid isn t hard to treat we know what to do spencer said with this latest wave we haven t seen a huge amount of severe disease and those we do see we have gotten so much better at managing it more where can you buy local chocolate flowers and other valentine s day treats in eastern ct even so the head of the who issued a warning wednesday stressing that covid isn t through with us although its focus was more on vaccinations than masks there s also a new urgency in finding ways to protect up to 7 million americans with severely weak immune systems who are at greater risks as mask mandates fall where are mask rules easing nevada on thursday became the latest state to end indoor mask mandates following announcements the previous day in new york and illinois though school mandates remain in those states nevada gov steve sisolak said the requirement for masks in public places would be lifted effective immediately state casino regulators quickly followed with an order eliminating the mandate for casinos unless a local jurisdiction still imposes such a requirement sisolak said he knows some people think it s too early to lift the mandate but he said school districts and employers may still set their own policies more how does artflame now at norwich s foundry 66 help young musicians pursue careers new york gov kathy hochul said infection rates have declined to a level where it is safe to rescind the broader mask order and the state will revisit in early march whether to continue requiring them in schools illinois gov j b pritzker said that state s indoor mask requirement will end feb 28 assuming a continued drop in hospitalizations which his office said are declining faster than at any point in the pandemic other places have announced similar plans to ease mask rules including juneau alaska and orange county california not everyone is following suit the mayors of minneapolis and st paul minnesota said they will soon end vaccine or test requirements instituted last month for restaurants bars and other entertainment venues but neither has talked about scrapping mask mandates more masking rules should be up to schools says ct gov ned lamont where does norwich stand washington gov jay inslee said a mandate for large outdoor events will be lifted next but indoor requirements will remain for now i agree with cdc that today is not the day to totally eliminate masks but it is a day that is rapidly approaching what about schools about a dozen states require face coverings in schools at least six of them said this week they plan to lift statewide mandates this month or next new jersey gov phil murphy who last month reinstated a public emergency due to the omicron wave said the end of his state s mandate on march 7 represents a huge step back to normalcy for our kids individual school districts can still make their own decisions connecticut delaware massachusetts oregon and rhode island have made similar announcements on easing restrictions for schools more after two years of trying plainfield nets school sidewalk grant where will the money go hemi tewarson executive director of the national academy for state health policy said states rescinding or relaxing school mask mandates is a reflection of the country s desire to move to the next phase of the pandemic after roughly two years it s also a sign of progress she said from vaccine availability to finding ways to safely return to in person schooling you see this hope tewarson said i think we all hope we are on the other side right now pritzker and illinois health officials said they want masks to be mandatory in schools for a while longer because of the potential spillover effect at any given school you might have hundreds or thousands of young people who are vaccinated at lower rates than adults coming together for six to eight hours a day five days a week and then going back out into the community including sometimes coming into contact with vulnerable family members that could increase community spread and force schools back online nobody wants kids to be back in remote learning said dr emily landon executive medical director of infection prevention and control at university of chicago medicine what do the white house scientists and health officials say the cdc has not changed its recommendation that people mask up in indoor public settings in areas where there is high transmission last month it updated its guidance to recommend n95 or kn95 masks those used by health care workers rather than cloth ones n95s have a tighter fit and are made with material designed to block 95 of harmful particles their fibers are pressed close together and have an electrostatic charge that attracts molecules to stick to the mask rather than passing through more after sitting in on brutal griswold triple murder trial sen somers turns to court reform the cdc added that it s most important to pick something you ll wear consistently any mask is better than no mask masks are generally not necessary in most outdoor settings despite growing pressure to ease restrictions president joe biden is waiting for fresh guidance from federal health officials press secretary jen psaki acknowledged that people are tired of masks and we understand where the emotions of the country are but said the administration is following the advice of medical experts who rely on scientific evidence that doesn t move at the speed of politics it moves at the speed of

debates over interest rates will likely dominate markets again in the week ahead as investors look for guidance from federal reserve officials on the course of central bank rate hikes this year concerns over russia ukraine tensions spooked investors friday and may continue to hang over the markets st louis fed president james bullard appears on cnbc s squawk box monday morning his comments will be noteworthy after he surprised markets thursday with a call for the fed funds rate to be 100 basis points or 1 percentage point higher by july producer price inflation data tuesday and fed minutes wednesday will be important releases stocks are likely to be volatile in the week ahead as investors watch tensions between russia and ukraine and debate how quickly the federal reserve can raise interest rates markets were roiled in the past week and bond yields spiked after a hot inflation reading thursday upended many wall street forecasts for interest rate hikes investors were dealt another blow friday after the white house warned that russia could invade ukraine during the olympics both the u s and u k have called for their citizens to leave ukraine as soon as possible get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters i think the fed is keeping everyone on edge and this is going to add to that edginess said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group so we had a three week earnings respite from the macro we turned micro and this week we were reminded earnings season is pretty much over and all macro issues matter again the major averages slid sharply on friday afternoon and treasury yields came off the highs they set after thursday s report that january s consumer price index jumped by 7 5 a 40 year high the s p 500 lost 1 8 for the week falling to 4 418 with about two hours left to friday trading u s national security advisor jake sullivan told a white house briefing that there were signs of russian escalation at the ukraine border sullivan said it was possible an invasion could occur during the olympics despite speculation to the contrary up until now i d say it was all about monetary policy this throws an extra unknown into the works said marc chandler chief market strategist at bannockburn global forex the dollar is rallying oil prices have rallied and stocks are selling off even if nothing happens this weekend people will be nervous about it in the next week boockvar said the russian tensions complicate the central bank s outlook and an invasion would add to already hot global inflation it s causing problems for the fed because this basically would inflate oil prices food prices wheat fertilizers and everything else and just make the fed s inflation fighting capability that much more difficult to maneuver he said the fed can t back off you can t blame geopolitics as a reason not to hike rates he said if the central bank were concerned about an economic impact it could slow hikes fed s inflation fight by friday morning some economists had ratcheted up expectations for the fed to hike interest rates by a half point in march following the january inflation report others like economists at goldman sachs have raised their views to a faster pace with as many as seven quarter point hikes for this year fed speakers will be a highlight in the week ahead particularly st louis fed president james bullard who appears on cnbc s squawk box monday at 8 30 a m bullard added to market turbulence and the sharp jump in bond yields thursday when he said that he would like to see rates rise by 100 basis points or 1 percentage point by july i think volatility remains elevated as we transition from essentially this more dovish fed to this more hawkish fed policy which we re experiencing said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse we haven t yet settled on how hawkish we are going to be and until we can chart a new path for interest rates hikes with some consistency i think volatility is going to remain elevated and that s going to be more true for high valuation companies what to watch the federal reserve releases minutes from its last meeting on wednesday investors will watch it carefully for any new insights on its plans for rate hikes the inflation outlook or comments on its balance sheet there will also be more important inflation data when the producer price index is reported tuesday that report is also expected to be very hot after january s cpi surging inflation has caused consumer sentiment to slump and now economists are watching consumer spending closely that means january s retail sales will also be important when it is reported wednesday there is also a final rush of big earnings reports with cisco nvidia and aig wednesday walmart reports thursday and deere reports friday we re starting to transition beyond earnings i think investors took a fair amount of comfort that profit margins stayed as high as they did said palfrey i think the question is as we look out at the next couple of quarters are we able to pass through prices at the same rate fed debate palfrey said investors are looking for more clear communications from the central bank bullard is the only fed official who endorsed a 50 basis point hike while others like cleveland fed president loretta mester said she does not expect to raise the fed funds target rate by more than a quarter point fed chairman jerome powell has left the door open to a half point hike but did not say he favored it fed governor lael brainard speaks friday as does fed governor christopher waller mester speaks thursday other fed officials have pushed back on bullard s comments but still there is a high level of uncertainty in the market and bond pros are wondering if the st louis fed chief will walk back his comments monday morning liz ann sonders chief investment strategist at charles schwab said some investors wonder if market volatility could slow the central bank s tightening path the fed is full steam ahead they have to be they re still adding to the balance sheet we re still at zero on rates she said there s nothing in my mind unless an asteroid lands on earth and blows us all to smithereens that makes the fed say we re fine we re going to stay at zero they re admitting themselves they re behind the curve they let the inflation cat out of the bag i don t think they thought it would have the traction it has had she said rate rally and reverse when bonds sell off yields go higher and they jumped this past week the 10 year yield was as high as 2 06 friday after the ukraine news the 10 year yield was back down to about 1 93 the 2 year yield was at a high of 1 63 friday up from 1

segment as it continues to develop digital offerings for dealers and customers more than 8 000 of mp s machines are fitted with telematics hardware and the number of dealers using customer and dealer integration or cdi has doubled in 2021 mp s end market diversification is a strength whether it s aggregates construction recycling or global infrastructure all of these markets are growing please turn to slide 8 and i will review awp offerings and end markets starting with our utilities business it has excellent growth prospects the need to maintain and grow the electric grid along with continued 5g rollout will drive multiyear demand some key product lines for terex utilities include bucket trucks digger derricks and tree trimmers used for the maintenance and expansion of electrical grids also we recently invested in viatec s battery technology for utility trucks called smart power takeoff or smartpto this environmentally friendly solution allows our utility booms to operate without truck idling as a result our customers can reduce vehicle maintenance and carbon emissions turning to our genie business genie is a globally recognized brand with great products the 60 foot j boom was named the contractors top 50 new product hybrid power options on scissors and booms provide indoor and outdoor job site flexibility and quiet emission free performance and our new telehandler offers increased lift capacity and lower cost of ownership these products demonstrate genie s strength in listening to customers and responding with innovative industry leading products genie s end markets of construction infrastructure and industrial applications will drive demand further we are at the beginning of a new multiyear replacement cycle in north america and european rental markets please turn to slide 9 and i will discuss the supply chain environment like most other industrial companies we are facing shortages and cost pressures for materials logistics freight and labor these headwinds have constrained our growth in the short term the significant increase in covid cases in january and february around the world are impacting our production and supplier deliveries however we are aggressively managing these challenges the team continues to mitigate cost pressures and minimize production disruption by staying close to our existing suppliers and expanding our supply base we designed components to maximize availability of critical inputs to improve production provide transparent communication of delivery and cost headwinds for our customers and we have taken pricing actions but they have not been sufficient to offset unprecedented material and logistics inflation which accelerated in the back half of 2021 we anticipate these challenges to continue in the first half of 2022 however for the full year we anticipate material costs stabilizing and being price cost neutral as price realization improves throughout the year our production and supply chain team members are working tirelessly they are demonstrating resilience and flexibility to increase customer deliveries and with that i ll turn it over to julie for her first earnings call with terex julie julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks john and good morning to everyone i am very excited to have joined terex with its great brands terex way values strong history and strong balance sheet i look forward to working with the team to drive operational margin improvement free cash flow generation growth and enhancing value for all stakeholders now turning to slide 10 i want to congratulate the team on posting excellent fourth quarter results looking at the fourth quarter sales of 990 million were up 26 year over year and year end market demand remained strong for the quarter we recorded an operating profit of 70 million more than double our operating profit of 32 million in the fourth quarter of last year operating profit increased due to strong sales and 3 million of positive financial call out operating margins improved 300 basis points in the quarter driven by actions to prudently manage and reduce costs we achieved this positive operating results through disciplined cost control while adapting to a dynamic market environment interest and other expense was approximately 8 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2020 due to a gain related to the relocation of our genie administrative office and reduced debt levels our effective tax rate of approximately 15 benefited from discrete items including the favorable resolution of tax audits our fourth quarter earnings per share of 0 82 increased nearly four times representing a 0 61 improvement over last year the financial call out highlighted in this slide represent a 0 16 benefit in the quarter free cash flow for the quarter was below our expectations first we have not yet received an approved 39 million irs refund and second inventories increased due to disruption and logistics delays turning to slide 11 and our materials processing segment financial results mp continues to perform very well with sales of 454 million up 24 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and the business ended the year with a backlog of 1 billion which is nearly double that of a year ago these results were driven by continued strong customer demand in all end markets and geographies mp delivered 13 8 operating margins by driving sales growth while managing material costs and manufacturing headwinds this is a testament to the team s operational execution turning to slide 12 and our aerial work platforms segment financial results awp sales of 534 million increased by 30 compared to last year driven by strong global end market demand awp fourth quarter bookings of 922 million were up 23 year over year while backlog at quarter end was nearly 2 billion up 137 from the prior year awp delivered improved operating margin of 4 8 in the quarter driven by strong customer demand and prudent expense management turning to slide 13 and full year 2021 financial highlights our performance in 2021 reflected strong improvement in the business and the extraordinary efforts of our team members earnings per share increased significantly from 0 13 to 3 07 or a 2 94 improvement sales of 3 9 billion were up 26 year over year as end markets recovered operating margin of 8 4 expanded 620 basis points driven by strict expense discipline sg a spending was 42 million lower year over year at 11 of sales beating our 12 5 target we delivered a 32 incremental margin exceeding our 25 target and we repaid 0 5 billion of debt reducing net leverage to 1 1 times turning to slide 14 this slide summarizes our 2021 financial results and call out included in our operating profit were 5 million of positive call out below the line there were 29 million of noncash charges associated with our debt refinancing and term loan repayment this was partially offset by a 12 million cash gain related to our genie administrative office relocation turning to slide 15 i want to reaffirm our disciplined capital allocation strategy including a strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation to enable growth our team members remain vigilant and aggressively manage all costs generating 125 million of free cash flow in the year our strong free cash flow generation and proceeds from the sale of our terex financial services portfolio in february 2021 allowed us to repay 0 5 billion of debt this year resulting in net leverage of 1 1 times as a reminder we have no near term maturities our next maturity is in 2024 we continue to invest in the business in 2021 with 60 million of capital expenditures our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allowed our board of directors to reinstate and pay out a quarterly dividend for 2021 just this week the board has approved an increased dividend of 0 13 per share as we continue to return cash to our shareholders we have ample liquidity with 867 million available to us at year end so we can manage and grow the business now turning to slide 16 and our full year 2022 outlook i would like to update you on how we currently anticipate 2022 to develop financially it is important to realize we are operating in an unprecedented supply chain environment and a pandemic so results could change negatively or positively with that said this outlook represents our best estimate as of today we anticipate earnings per share of 3 55 to 4 05 based on sales of approximately 4 1 to 4 3 billion traditional seasonality of sales is less applicable in 2022 as the supply chain environment has extended product deliveries this sales outlook reflects the latest dialogue with our suppliers our 2022 sales are not a function of demand rather the ability of the supply chain to deliver components we have the internal capacity to produce more and have demonstrated such in the past awp sales of 2 3 to 2 4 billion and mp sales of 1 8 to 1 9 billion reflects strong customer demand but with the constraint presented by the supply chain turning to operating margin we expect operating margin for the year to be in the range of 8 8 to 9 5 operating margin is expected to be lower in the first half of 2022 and higher in the second half as supply chain headwinds abate and pricing actions taken are realized as backlog is shipped to help frame the development of operating margin in 2022 the first quarter of 2022 will see increased cost pressures compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 mp s margins of 14 to 14 5 will be relatively balanced throughout 2022 but the first quarter will be challenged by supply chain constraints awp margins of 7 8 to 8 5 reflects significantly higher input costs peaking in the first quarter with price realization improving throughout the year as we work through the backlog in the first quarter of 2022 we expect awp operating margin in the low single digit and meaningfully improving throughout the year based upon global tax laws we expect a 2022 effective tax rate of approximately 20 5 due to higher u s income and lower discrete benefits partially offset by lower local and u s tax on rest of world income for 2022 we are estimating free cash flow of 175 to 225 million reflecting another year of positive cash generation we also estimate capital expenditures net of asset disposition will be approximately 90 million the largest component being our genie mexico facility corporate other costs are planned to occur relatively evenly throughout the year overall our 2022 guidance represents a continued improvement in operating performance when compared to 2021 despite the challenging supply chain environment turning to slide 17 our 2022 earnings per share outlook reflects the following assumptions from an operational perspective sales will increase as customer demand remains strong pricing actions along with manufacturing efficiencies will offset cost pressures sg a reflects prudent investment in the business including our new product development engineering and digital initiatives and remains at 11 of sales further nonoperational impacts include unfavorable foreign exchange headwinds due to a lower euro exchange rate when compared to 2021 in addition we have an unfavorable tax impact as our full year effective tax rate is expected to normalize to approximately 20 5 as favorable discrete items from 2021 are not expected to repeat these two items together amount to a 0 30 per share headwind next favorable interest and other expense due to lower debt levels and interest rates finally onetime items both positive and negative related to our bond refinancing and genie administrative office relocation are not expected to reoccur taken together these assumptions result in our 2022 earnings per share outlook of 3 55 to 4 05 this outlook is the best view at this time and can be impacted positively or negatively depending on how the supply chain develops in 2022 before i finish i would like to thank john sheehan for his support and teaching me all things terex and leaving me such a strong finance team happy retirement duffy and with that i will turn it back over to you john john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks julie turning to slide 18 looking ahead to 2022 let me provide you a few highlights from our execute innovate and grow strategy execution is the foundation to deliver on our commitments to our team members customers and shareholders we must and will continue to drive operational improvements turning to innovation we are investing in new product development whether it s electrification of our products or new end market applications such as recycling and environmental we re also investing in digital in multiple facets of the business improving our internal business processes and enhancing the ease of doing business with terex growing terex is a focus for all team members we are investing in parts and service capabilities and expanding manufacturing capacity as we look to better serve our customers we have a disciplined m a process and are looking to grow from acquisitions turning to slide 19 to conclude my prepared remarks terex is well positioned to deliver increased shareholder value in 2022 because we have strong businesses strong brands and strong market positions upon which we can grow we will continue to invest including in new products and manufacturing capacity where demand calls for it and we have demonstrated resiliency and adaptability in a challenging environment i am confident this will result in terex being an even stronger company and with that let me turn it back to randy randy wilson director of investor relations thanks john with that i d like to open it up for questions operator questions answers operator thank you your first question comes from stephen volkmann from jefferies please go ahead stephen volkmann jefferies analyst we talked about sort of more demand in 2022 if you could get more out the door so i guess my question is it looks like things did improve a little bit in the fourth quarter from a supply chain perspective and we re kind of hearing that from other companies so can you just maybe take us through what you re actually seeing in the supply chain and i m curious if your revenue guidance is kind of backed up by kind of firm commitments from suppliers or are you being kind of conservative about how this plays out through 22 john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks stephen good morning so if we just take a step back and look at the supply chain we re not in the demand outpaced production really across the supply chain so similar to other companies we ll continue to see persistent disruptions in our plants either component shortages and logistics related delays the reality was stephen in the fourth quarter we actually didn t see an improvement we saw a modest decrease frankly in key metrics like supplier on time deliveries number of parts and so that did impact our output and it continues to impact us going forward now what are we doing about this is first everybody in the organization is engaged we have an escalation process and frankly all the way up to my level i ve spent more time over the last year on supply chain related issues than frankly i have on dealing with customer related issues because that s what we are we ve done a lot of engineering redesigns and that s really helped especially around our electronic components working with our suppliers to make availability or use what is available in the marketplace as a result of our strategic sourcing initiatives we did expand our supply base so we know where to go now for secondary and third suppliers for parts so we continue to execute that and then our teams are just really doing a heck of a job being adaptable in modifying schedules the number of schedule changes that we have to implement is frankly daily and so the teams become pretty confident in modifying schedules to get as much out as we can for our customers and so we re staying very close with our suppliers we re communicating with our customers in terms of where we are our outlook steve is guided by supply chain constraints we i would say we are hedging if you will what suppliers are telling us because based on their previous performance we are hedging to some extent the material plan that we have is higher than our current outlook if you will but we ve factored that into our outlook steve so this is our best look that we have as of today in terms of what we believe the supply chain is going to be able to deliver and again if the supply chain is able to deliver more we will be able to deliver more for our customers because this is really it s a supply chain driven situation i think the other important comment around the supply chain and working with our supply chain teams and my interaction with ceos is we re driving not just to drive improvement in our supply chain in 2022 we believe we re setting up for a pretty extended strong demand environment across our businesses and so it s not just 2022 that we need to increase the availability of supply it s for 23 and beyond and so this is an incredibly focused effort on the team we believe we re going to see improvement as we go through the year and but we didn t see that improvement in q4 so we have to be prepared for it and again the team has done a heck of a job being adaptable and resilient to the significant changes they ve had to absorb on a day to day basis so that s how i d describe the situation again steve i don t think it s that much different than most industrial manufacturing companies around the world today stephen volkmann jefferies analyst ok great that s helpful color and then for the quick follow up i m just curious on steel specifically how much of your 22 steel is kind of protected as it were and obviously as steel prices kind of go down i m trying to get a sense of how long it would be until you see that benefit john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks so we have a steel hedging program but again stephen it really is just for hrc or hot rolled coil for the u s our awp business specifically genie uses about 60 of that there s not a hedge market for plate so we have been hedged we continue to hedge we hedge to have price visibility not to speculate and the good news is is that steel was especially in north america and europe in the middle of the year and into the fourth quarter was an incredible high 1 800 to 2 000 we are seeing the steel indices and markets come off of that high thankfully and we re anticipating that continues as we go into 2022 stephen volkmann jefferies analyst thanks team appreciate it we ll talk to you soon john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator next question operator your next question comes from mig dobre with baird please go ahead mig dobre baird analyst thank you and good morning everyone john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning mig mig dobre baird analyst so i guess good morning my question is on slide 17 i appreciate that break in all the details here the so two things the 2 30 worth of cost pressure i m curious if there s any way to sort of delineate the major buckets in here in terms of what s raw materials versus freight it would just be helpful for us to kind of we can make our own assumptions in terms of where things go from here and then i guess the second part of the question is as we re thinking beyond 2022 the price and efficiency component that you have here 2 55 do you think that it s something that you can hang on to beyond 2022 or will you have to sort of get back some of the gains that you ve got on the slide john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks mig i ll try to take them in sequence and if i don t please jump back in in terms of the cost elements it is both cost pressure is included both in materials components and freight and we ve seen substantial increases especially in the back half of 2021 and that s what our current outlook reflects and it does reflect looking at forward indices which again we do believe in that case we are going to see some abatement of the rapid increase that we re seeing in the material costs and as you look to our pricing actions and this pricing action continues so if you just take a step back our pricing actions have really been designed across our global businesses to offset our material and logistics cost increases mig we have taken pricing actions throughout 21 and now obviously taking pricing action into 2022 these are not easy conversations with customers but we ve been very transparent with our customers and distribution partners on the level of inflation that we re seeing basically showing all the way down to showing invoices and so that s the action we ve taken if you look at our respective businesses mig on the awp side we ve instituted a combination of pricing and surcharges if you look at the results in 2021 those pricing actions did not offset all the material and freight cost increases that we had and we saw an acceleration of inflation in the back half in 2022 with further increased pricing we believe that price realization improves throughout the year as we ship some of the backlog that with that 21 we re supposed to deliver in 21 we didn t and then with that 21 pricing so we believe price realization will improve if you look at our mp business they ve really done a good job offsetting most of the material and logistics inflation that we ve seen globally with the nature of their business they ve been able to be more dynamic in updating their pricing on an ongoing basis and if you look at their results they were pretty close to price cost neutral in 21 and we expect they will be price cost neutral in 2022 and so that with that said they ve got the challenge of the inflation spiking in the second half of the year so the first half of the year is going to be a little bit more of a challenge and we think that improves in the back half of the year now your the other good question is are these prices going to stick and i think the answer is yes mig and why do we believe that well first we re seeing broad based inflation across multiple industries so our customers are not just seeing price increases from us they re seeing price increases across the spectrum and so we ve been very transparent our pricing actions again are designed to offset significant material cost increases that we re seeing and trading cost freight increases that we re seeing thus far mig i would say especially across the line of mp businesses we ve seen good pricing discipline in the industry and i would say in the awp business i would say with reasonable pricing discipline reflecting the dynamic environment in north america a little less in europe frankly the only place we re not seeing strong price discipline is in china chinese competitors are very aggressive on price but if we look around the world and across the business i would say we re seeing good price discipline now and given that everyone is seeing inflation i do believe going forward that these prices are going to be able to stay mig dobre baird analyst got it that s helpful color and then my follow up is on materials processing maybe get a little more color on how you see demand progressing here just optically looking at the orders a little bit softer this quarter i m wondering kind of what drove that and the outlook going forward john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks mig i m going to be a little i m going to take some time on this one too because yes we did see a little softening on the orders but that s really timing we re seeing strong global markets and strong customer demand across our mp portfolio actually we have record backlog frankly our backlog is too high we want to ship more product to our customer if we look at our crushing and screening business our backlog more than doubled versus the prior year and we re seeing good growth around the world in our concrete business backlog is up tremendously a year ago we had several large orders that did not repeat at the end of the year and so that was a partial reason for the bookings falling off slightly our materials handling business will be called fuchs you ve heard me say that the only benefit of high steel prices is scrap metal prices are up and that backlog is up almost fourfold and so we re seeing great demand literally around the world with our fuchs product in our environmental business the investments we ve made there we re seeing our backlog up significantly we believe we re going to continue to be able to grow that business and then our lifting businesses our pick and carry franna business down in australia it s been strong throughout the pandemic and we actually saw a rebound in our rts and our power businesses from an order rate and a backlog standpoint so overall we re seeing strength we did see some and again it s just timing we believe with the bookings decline the backlog is exceptionally strong and we re not seeing any weakness frankly across any of those businesses around the world randy wilson director of investor relations thanks mig operator next question operator your next question comes from stan elliott with stifel please go ahead stan elliott stifel financial corp analyst hey good morning everyone thank you all for taking the question welcome julie a quick question for you when you think about the two businesses performing from a margin perspective i mean it looks like the incremental margins are about the same for both the awp and the materials processing business could you help us a little bit kind of understand what s happening and the dynamics between the two julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer ok sure thanks stan just as we think about our incremental margins obviously we had some really strong performance in 2021 with 32 incremental margin particularly strong in the awp business and the mp business has been strong in terms of absolute margin performance so i just want to emphasize that our target remains at 25 incremental margin and what you saw in 2021 was higher incremental margins in the first half and then lower in the second half as we started to experience increased material costs so when you look at the year over year comparison and we talk about going forward into 2020 22 the framework is challenged in the first half of 2022 as accelerating inflation happened in the back half and it continues into the first half of 2022 so that s a summary of where we re at if we look at awp we re looking for our awp business in 2022 to improve by 110 basis points year over year again as a result of the price cost in the first half we ll see incremental margins substantially below our target in the first half of 2022 and substantially above our target in the second half of 2022 for the mp business we re continuing to invest in new products like environmental and recycling as well as manufacturing capacity such as in places in northern ireland and china and india we re pleased with mp s absolute level of performance at about 14 operating margin and we re making growth investments in the business this business has been offsetting inflationary pressures it s done a really nice job and they re maintaining strong operating margins but again they too will be a little bit pressed in the first half of the year so the team understands our 25 incremental margin framework we re working hard to achieve those long term goals and as the new cfo i fully support the target of 25 incremental margins going forward stan elliott stifel financial corp analyst perfect and thanks for hashing that out because i was really getting around the level of investment on the mp side given the comments of it being more price cost favorable or neutral and then along those lines there s lots of talk about growth kind of as we go into the next year how do we balance kind of some of the growth investments you ve got on the mp side could we look at a sizable sort of an m a deal or what s the temperature there john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks and in terms of on the first place the good news is the very strong cash flow generation strong balance sheet so we have balance sheet capacity to do m a related activities our focus is in and around the mp business if you look at the structure of the different markets and different verticals that we compete in there s still a pretty high degree of fragmentation so as we build out our pipeline our pipeline looks to in and around the mp space we did two smaller acquisitions in 2021 the mds international is a great example it s near to our plant in northern ireland which is good it s in southern island but it s also a near adjacency in terms of products so we re able to put that product line through our existing distribution and really get a substantial increase in the sale so we would look to do m a we do we re going to drive organic growth across both businesses awp and mp and we re looking for inorganic growth and right now we re looking more around the pipeline associated with our mp business and perhaps our parts services business because we think there may be some opportunities there randy wilson director of investor relations great thanks stan operator next question please operator your next question comes from david raso with evercore isi please go ahead david raso evercore isi analyst hi good morning thank you for taking the question my question is related to how you re thinking about the awp cycle by my math the north american awp business ended 21 still not even within 25 30 of where you were back in 2018 so when i think about inflation obviously where the backlog is versus your sales guide for this year you seemed relatively locked and loaded for 22 it s just about execution on the factory floor and price cost but when you re thinking of investing in mexico when you think of the capacity that you re going to need i mean it looks like at the end of 22 your north american business which is not just aerials right it s utilities as well but you re still going to be almost 20 below where you were in 18 so i m just curious your confidence in the cycle beyond 22 and not just qualitatively but how are we thinking about the capacity exiting 22 with these investments in mexico we re just trying to get a flavor for how much are you thinking about growth in 23 and 24 with some quantification and obviously your willingness to invest in capacity is actions not just qualitative description john garrison chairman and chief executive officer so thank you for that question david and i ll speak within awp both genie and utilities as you clearly indicated we are substantially below our demonstrated capacity in those businesses based on just go back to 2018 as a result now and we have increased our capacity since 2018 we ve expanded our changzhou china facility for example now as you rightly call out we re investing in mexico so installed capacity we believe we re going to be appropriately sized for installed capacity going forward we re not anywhere near where we were in 2018 and we ve adding capacity since then why are we doing that because we do believe the awp business i ll talk specifically genie and then i ll talk utilities is going to grow if you just look at the replacement cycle david for the awp business and genie business and specifically u s north america and europe the replacement cycle frankly was delayed by the pandemic and now it s being delayed somewhat by constraints across the industry if you look at the rental companies they re growing they need their fleets to grow their fleets are aging rental rates are doing great used equipment values are doing great and so we believe that we re in the beginning of that replacement cycle it s a seven to eight year replacement cycle it s always difficult as you know david we ve been doing this a long time to predict exactly what quarter or what half of the year but the economics in that industry are such that we are entering a pretty strong growth period in the replacement cycle coupled with growth in other markets in the genie business so we do believe we re in a growth phase in that business and the replacement cycle with a little bit of growth is going to give us a really strong tailwind for the next several years that coupled with david the other investment we made was in our utilities business we have a brand new facility there we went from 11 buildings to one so we ve increased our installed capacity there as well now we ve got the same supply chain issue so we ve got to break through those constraints but if you look at the utilities business and the growth prospects of the utilities business the infrastructure bill even without the infrastructure bill there s significant investment required in the electrical grid transmission distribution and maintenance and so we think we re in a strong growth period as well in the utilities business so we ve committed capital over the last three to five years to improve our manufacturing capability improve our manufacturing capacity because we do believe we re entering a good tailwind period of time for the next couple of years in that awp segment and i might add we re also bullish on our mp business we ve made capacity expansions in northern ireland we ve made capacity expansions in india and so we re investing in our mp business for growth because we also believe those macro trends are going to continue in a positive fashion for the mp business and as a result we had a fairly substantial capex budget the last couple of years it s going to extend into 2022 with our mexico investment and we re doing that because we believe there s good growth opportunities in both segments going forward david raso evercore isi analyst and trying to quantify it a little bit right i know some of these moves were not just incremental capacity they were a more efficient lower cost manufacturing but can you help us with if my numbers are right and by the end of 22 we re still almost 20 below where we were in 18 on revenues where is your capacity at the end of this year like watertown s already built essentially it s up and running mexico i assume up and running fully by the end of this year where is your capacity exiting 22 versus 18 just kind of ballpark is it similar just more efficient is it 15 20 i m just getting a sense of how you must be viewing the cycle to be adding that capacity and where your revenues are exiting 22 versus that last peak john garrison chairman and chief executive officer right so again david near term and for the next 12 months or so it s really supply chain so as you ve said we ve got demonstrated capacity above i don t want to necessarily say how much all right but if you just look at watertown we ve substantially increased the capacity there for that business we said on the order of magnitude of 50 for our utilities business and we believe that s achievable over a couple year period of time we expanded our changzhou facility that gives us a good export for the china market in an export market and the only thing david i want to be clear on our mexico facility would stood up our temporary facility right now we ve got our team in place we re growing our team we re producing telehandlers there we are building a special purpose center that will take the next two to three years to complete in mexico so we believe we ve got plenty of capacity given the market needs david and that s why we re working so hard on the supply chain not just the immediate but working with the ceos of our suppliers to have them understand that we believe we re in a strong growth cycle and we need product not just for 22 but 23 24 and 25 randy wilson director of investor relations david thank you operator next question operator your next question comes from jamie cook with credit suisse please go ahead jamie cook credit suisse analyst hi good morning i guess my question is i m just trying to square your top line guide for aerial i think it s like implied at the midpoint up 8 to 9 so sort of what are you assuming for price versus volume i m assuming little or not a lot of volume in that forecast i m just trying to square it relative to your competitor who s i think implying double digit growth so i guess that s my first question and then my second question can you just provide a little more color on i know the free cash flow was a little short of expectations you talked about inventory build sort of what s the strategy for inventory in 2022 and just what happened during the quarter thanks julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks jamie for the question when we look at 2022 and compared to 2021 we re seeing far more price increase than we are of volume increase and again the volume increase again is due to those supply chain constraints they are holding back some of that production so far more again far more on price than volume in terms of free cash flow yes we had a disappointment in with shortfall for q4 we were we had an approved irs refund we have an approval letter for 39 million and we still have yet to receive that and then we also had an increase in inventories in the quarter and this again is due to those supply chain disruptions there s we have a machine sitting in the hospital being ready to ship waiting for parts that haven t shown up yet it s causing production disruptions as well and we have a lot more inventory on the water and in transit than we have had in the past so we did have an increase in inventory when we look to 2022 we expect another strong free cash flow year we re expecting anticipating our fourth year in a row of strong free cash flow and when we talked about it we ll have we talked about increased earnings and in terms of our working capital as sales increase that working capital and inventory level will increase right along with that jamie cook credit suisse analyst just to follow up though on the top line guide more price versus volume john just to be clear this is more you as well just to be clear it s not you re assuming you re going to lose market share it s more of a function of we re being conservative with the guide because of the challenges that are out there john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks jamie in terms of market share we held market share in the genie business throughout 2021 we are not assuming any significant market share or any market share rose and we actually think in a couple of product lines we can gain some market share for one product category we did have some significant disruption this was in telehandlers and we re working with our supply base to improve that so no we re not anticipating any significant changes in market share on a year over year basis it s basically based on the current constrained supply chain environment and we got to work to break those constraints jamie cook credit suisse analyst all right great i appreciate the color thanks john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks appreciate it operator your next question comes from steven fisher with ubs please go ahead steven fisher ubs analyst great thanks good morning thanks julie for the q1 color and the first half second half on incrementals i guess with a low single digit margin in awp in q1 it seems like you should have a double digit margin somewhere in the year would you agree with that and with the normal seasonality not as applicable this year what do you think or what are you planning for is likely to be your highest margin quarter of the year in awp julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer so from you re exactly correct in the first quarter we expect awp margins to be in the low single digits and meaningfully improve each quarter on a sequential basis throughout the year so it just improves as we go every quarter steven fisher ubs analyst ok so fourth quarter should be the highest quarter of the year you think then ok julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer yes steven fisher ubs analyst great and then your awp backlog is almost 85 of your revenue target just because of that supply chain constraint on the revenues i guess how much of that backlog is for 2023 at this point and if very little is for 23 are you expecting to be kind of fully booked on your revenue plan by the end of march and i guess if the supply chain doesn t allow for any more upside are you just going to sort of stop taking orders or are you going to take orders and just give a 2023 delivery date on them john garrison chairman and chief executive officer so you re right in terms of our coverage it s historically high based on the constraints that was described in terms of our backlog we only report backlog that s for 12 months and so we do have some backlog that extends beyond that not excuse me that s not in our backlog because we only say what we expect to deliver in the next 12 months we will be taking pricing actions as we go through 2022 again our pricing objective is to offset material and freight cost increases so we re booking deliveries into 2023 those would be at a 2023 price level not at the 2022 price level steven fisher ubs analyst ok very helpful thank you john garrison chairman and chief executive officer appreciate it operator next question operator your next question comes from nicole deblase with deutsche bank please go ahead nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst yes thanks good morning guys john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning nicole nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst so you mentioned during the prepared remarks julie that the quarterly cadence of revenue is going to look different this year which makes sense is this kind of similar to what it feels like the margin progression is where you start off at a low point and each quarter gets better is it the same path for revenue julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer really the revenue strength is about half the first half and second half are relatively consistent what really happens is that price cost mix gets better throughout the year so the first quarter again is really challenged as we ship stuff but still we have some things in backlog at 2021 prices and we re experiencing the higher cost in q1 so really it improves throughout the year but it s more because of the price cost as opposed to the revenue mix they re relatively equal in the first half and the second half nicole deblase deutsche bank analyst got it ok that s clear thanks and then on the sg a to sales so you re guiding at a little bit below 11 in 22 this is the second year in a row that the guidance looks well below like the original 12 5 target how do we think about like the sustainability of 11 sg a to sales beyond 2022 john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes thanks nicole it s an internal debate and we actually would think that 11 to 11 5 range given a growing revenue environment is perhaps a more reasonable target yes we were at 12 5 that was in the past we ve gotten a lot more efficient in our systems and our processes and so i would say that 11 to 11 5 range is probably a more realistic range for us subject to change but as we look at our strategic plan now i would say 11 to 11 5 is a better target for us than the 12 5 julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer and just to add the team has been really has done a great job of lowering sg a costs here they re down 100 million from where they were in 2019 and so we re going to be very disciplined about anything that we add we ve only add are those value creating projects very very prudent with expense management always going forward as well john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good thanks operator next question operator your next question comes from courtney yakavonis with morgan stanley please go ahead courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst hi good morning guys thanks for the question john garrison chairman and chief executive officer good morning courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst if we could just go back john to your comments that we re going to see an improvement in some of the cost pressures as we go through the year i think you mentioned you didn t see that improvement in the fourth quarter so is the right way to understand that that if you were carrying forward the fourth quarter s cost pressures that 2 30 that s in your outlook would be significantly higher and you are baking an improvement or is that improvement mostly from lapping the tough or the easier compares that you re going to have in the third and fourth quarter of the year john garrison chairman and chief executive officer it reflects the cost increases that we re expecting in the year in 2022 part of those cost increases were as a result of the inflationary increases that we saw in the back half of the year if you remember in a lot of the contract steel for example it takes 120 days or so for it to go through the p l and so it reflects the higher cost basis that we saw in q4 and it reflects some of the amelioration or the abatement in cost increases that we re anticipating based on certain key indices that we follow closely courtney yakavonis morgan stanley analyst ok got it but to be clear it is not the run rate from q4 you are expecting the abatement and is it primarily on the material side where you re baking in that improvement or are you also baking in an improvement in the logistics and i think mig had asked earlier just the breakdown if you could give us of that 2 30 what s logistics versus material so we can put some of our own assumptions in john garrison chairman and chief executive officer i would say just looking at it it really is the material the underlying material we re not necessarily assuming any significant improvement in the logistics world right now it s still significantly constrained so it really is a material play we ll see on the material side but that s not our operating assumption right now julie beck senior vice president and chief financial officer and if we look at the cost pressure and what s there for 2022 a vast majority of that is the increase of material costs not in transportation randy wilson director of investor relations thanks courtney operator operator and your last question for today comes from jerry revich with goldman sachs please go ahead jerry revich goldman sachs analyst yes hi good morning everyone julie welcome i m wondering if you could talk about the implications of your growing electrification mix within the portfolio are there any incremental opportunities that are coming up for you folks in terms of helping with on site charging or anything along those lines that s coming up as an opportunity as the electrification mix in the portfolio rises and can you comment now that you re scaling the business what the margin profile is if there s any difference between electrified powertrains for you folks versus diesel thanks john garrison chairman and chief executive officer thanks jerry just longer term our product portfolio across the businesses really looks at electrification as we said a lot of the genie products are already electrified what s changing there is going all electric electric drives changing from deep cycle batteries to lithium ion batteries and so you re seeing the evolution of battery technology that s playing a role in the genie business as the evolution of that technology continues you will see that be adopted even into more product lines booms scissors and someday i think telehandlers will be the laggard in that given their duty cycle but we will see that as well in the future so as lithium ion continues to be adopted across other industries we ll see that adoption in our industries as well in the mp business it really depends on what specific products we re talking about there is a lot of times we have an electric option if the electric with or our irish friends would say the mains are available or the electric distribution is available if it s not then you re going to remain with large diesel engines but again across the product portfolio on every product line we have an electrification product development plan for those products as the world continues to move toward electrification so incremental jerry i don t know if it s necessarily incremental or not i think it s just how the market is moving and then in terms of the margin side and cost side originally lithium ion was more expensive frankly and the battery solutions were more expensive but as that cost is coming down the cost curve because it s being utilized in so many other industries now you re getting to the point where that lithium ion solution on a life cycle cost basis is competitive to other alternatives especially internal combustion engine alternatives so as you see that continue i think that will also precipitate a greater move toward electrification as the life cycle costs come down with it so that s how we re handling it it s a key part of our product development efforts across our business lines looking at what s going to happen in the next three five 10 years and that s incorporated into our development plan incremental i m not sure jerry i wouldn t say that i think it s where the world is going jerry revich goldman sachs analyst terrific separately on the supply chain side can you talk about what are the critical components that you re concerned about today if that s any different from three months ago and you alluded to having supplied components on the water to what extent is that driving the outlook for production to ramp up over the year because you have the visibility in terms of what s at ports etc john garrison chairman and chief executive officer yes so jerry i think similar to what other manufacturers have talked about electronic components we ve had to do a lot there to modify chips boards circuits and the like so electronic components continue to be a challenge tied to electronic components is engines the ecus or ecms whichever manufacture choice is used so engine availability is the near term constraint that i think will work itself out but right now that s a near term constraint hydraulic systems there are several hydraulic systems that have been constraints for us and that s caused a challenge and then our utility business it s the only business where we use chassis that was adversely impacted with the chassis supplier so those are the primary commodities that we re dealing with there s the odds and ends that creep up as well but those are the key ones that we re working on to improve supply of so that we can increase our production to meet the needs of our customers operator duration 66 minutes call participants randy wilson director of investor relations john garrison chairman and chief

together to deliver strong results quarter after quarter despite being a year full of challenges our performance reflects strong customer demand for our products and our commitment to customer service and supply chain reliability through the toughest conditions all underpinned by a companywide commitment to the holistic safety and health of our workforce revenue was up 28 year over year to 6 3 billion adjusted ebitda rose 49 to 1 3 billion and we generated 543 million of free cash flow consistent with our focus on sustainable growth and high quality earnings across our businesses with strong free cash flow conversion 2021 was truly a team effort across the entire business in our tt segment we built what we believe is the strongest book of contracted business ever with strategic customers who appreciate our value proposition and with whom we can grow over time in tss we delivered strong sales and margin performance despite all the oem headwinds and look forward to the growth we can achieve under the u s aim act and in apm we achieved record setting results on both the top and bottom line in a business which is being driven by several exciting secular growth trends finally in chemical solutions we completed the sale of our mining solutions business which will give us greater bandwidth to focus on our industry leading tt tss and apm businesses i m proud of the results we re reporting today and proud of the entire chemours team that delivered them i would also like to thank our customers for their trust and confidence in chemours but 2021 wasn t just about the financial results we made significant contributions to the planet our people and the communities in which we operate through progress on our corporate responsibility commitments chemours believes that together with our employees customers suppliers and communities we will create a better world for the power of our chemistry our chemistry is essential to so much of our daily lives today and is also key to a more sustainable infrastructure clean energy and advanced electronics in fact we are integral to the u s semiconductor industry supply chain and we are making significant investments to manufacture this chemistry responsibly with the latest abatement technology all part of our commitment to reduce emissions of floor organic compounds by 99 and greenhouse gas emissions by 60 by 2030 additionally we continue to focus on our remediation commitments at our key sites including the barrier wall project at our fayetteville north carolina plant finally with the dupont corteva chemours mou behind us we are actively working to address manage and resolve rest of the company related to legacy pfas liabilities a good example of this is the resolution of legacy natural resource damage claims in the past year with the state of delaware as we look forward to 2022 our guidance reflects our confidence in chemours and our intent to drive consistent performance through the cycle while generating significant free cash flow we continue to invest behind key secular growth drivers especially in clean energy and advanced electronics and behind innovative and responsible chemistry that enables the sustainable products of the future from advanced coatings to lower gwp thermal solutions to fuel cells and beyond all while strengthening our balance sheet and returning the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders turning to the next chart i d like to highlight more of the good work we re doing across chemours through our corporate responsibility commitment programs last quarter we discussed our evolved portfolio pillar and how the aim act will help drive opteon lower gwp refrigerant adoption across the u s today i d like to cover our inspired people pillar the inspired people pillar has been one where we have consistently delivered outstanding progress through all three platforms safety excellence vibrant communities and employee empowerment in the fourth quarter we launched a new program we called chemfest short for the chemours future of engineering science trades and technology chemfest helps bring stem education to under resourced middle schools in communities in which we operate this year with an initial investment of 4 3 million we are bringing improved access to early stem education to schools around our wilmington headquarters our new johnsonville site and our chambers works site this program is a natural feeder to our fossi program which targets high school seniors pursuing stem education at the college level in total chemours has committed over 15 million to our inspired people initiative an investment which will pay back many times over in the lives we change and the impact we have on the communities in which we operate i m proud of this work which reflects our company s strong commitment to purpose and people and we d like to thank alvenia scarborough our chief brand officer and her entire team for leading the charge over the last several years with that i ll turn things over to sameer to review the financial results for the fourth quarter i ll be back to talk about our guidance before turning to q a sameer sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark and thanks everyone for joining us today before i begin my remarks i would also like to recognize all our employees for their outstanding effort over the course of 2021 your energy and determination were instrumental in delivering the outstanding financial results which mark and i have the privilege to report let me go to chart 5 to go over the full year results our 2021 full year results were driven by strong demand across all three of our primary businesses with a significant rebound in demand from 2020 full year net sales rose 1 4 billion to 6 3 billion volume and price gains across the portfolio backed by solid operational performance drove the strong results gaap eps more than doubled to 3 60 per share in 2021 from 1 32 per share in 2020 adjusted eps was 4 per share in 2021 also more than doubled the 1 98 cents per share we earned in 2020 our full year 2021 adjusted ebitda was 1 313 billion up 434 million or 49 from the prior year this resulted in adjusted ebitda margins of 21 for the full year up 300 basis points from 2020 free cash flow continues to be a strong point for the company in 2021 we generated 543 million of free cash flow this is despite the shift to networking capital consumption in 2021 based on improved customer demand and inventory levels our performance on free cash flow reflects the power of the business to generate significant cash through any part of the economic cycle and reflects the collective effort to improve the earnings quality of the business and spend turning to chart 6 and our fourth quarter results fourth quarter net sales of 1 6 billion were up 18 from the fourth quarter 2020 price gains were strong across the breadth of the portfolio while volume was up across most of our segments adjusted ebitda rose 25 in the fourth quarter to 307 million resulting in slight margin expansion to 19 versus 18 in last year s fourth quarter free cash flow was 131 million due to higher working capital needed to support increased sales and the impact of certain tax items in the quarter turning to chart 7 let s review the adjusted ebitda bridge for the fourth quarter fourth quarter 2021 adjusted ebitda was 307 million up 61 million from the same period in 2020 price was a large contributor to the improved results with pricing gains across the entire portfolio however the impact of volume gains across most of our segments was more than offset by demand headwinds from automotive oems primarily related to the impact of semiconductor shortages on auto builds our net price versus cost contribution continues to be positive despite the inflation in the environment we are in as i said in the last quarter we continue to be diligent across our businesses to ensure that we stay ahead of inflation turning now to chart 8 our cash position liquidity and balance sheet remained strong as we have throughout the year our cash balance at the end of the year was 1 45 billion up from 1 billion in the prior quarter in the fourth quarter we generated 214 million of operating cash flow and capex was 83 million we returned 134 million of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we reduced our debt by 70 million and proceeds from the mining solutions sale were also recognized in the fourth quarter we ended the year with gross debt of 3 8 billion our net leverage ratio improved to 1 8 times on trailing 12 month basis down from 2 3 times in the prior quarter total liquidity stands at approximately 2 3 billion including revolver availability of approximately 800 million turning to chart 9 as we continue to strengthen our cash and ration we also continue to execute on our disciplined approach to capital allocation in 2021 we invested 277 million in capex to maintain our assets meet our crc commitments and grow the business long term timing of our capital expenditures in 2021 was impacted by labor and material issues which shifted several projects from 2021 into 2022 from a credit profile perspective we reduced debt by 204 million in 2021 and we also contributed 100 million earlier in the year into the escrow account as per the mou agreement with dupont and corteva this amount is reflected as restricted cash on our balance sheet last but not least we continue to return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders with 164 million return via dividends and 173 million through share repurchases in 2021 since then we have retired more than 10 of our total shares outstanding going from approximately 151 million shares to approximately 161 million shares at year end 2021 let s now turn to chart 10 where i ll cover the results and outlook for our titanium technology segment our titanium technology segment continued to deliver in 2021 with strong performance over the course of the entire year despite global logistics issues and feedstock disruptions ti pure pigment demand was strong across all regions and all end markets as the global economy recovered from the low levels we saw in 2020 our tvs strategy continues to deliver with strong traction across all three sakes channels customers continue to see the value of a long term relationship with chemours as our reliable high quality supply has enabled them to succeed despite other supply chain issues as a result our contracted customer base has never been stronger and we have welcomed many new customers on our flex portal who want to buy ti pure from chemours turning to the results fourth quarter net sales rose 25 to 855 million versus the prior year quarter price rose 19 while volume rose 6 on a year over year basis fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 198 million improved 33 versus the prior year quarter segment margins were a healthy 23 despite ongoing ore logistics constraints sequential price of 5 more than offset increased costs in the quarter for the full year 2021 net sales were 3 4 billion up 40 from 2 4 billion in 2020 price rose 10 and volume was up 28 as demand returned from pandemic induced lows in 2020 adjusted ebitda rose 59 to 809 million from 510 million in 2020 volume margins came in at 24 we exited 2021 having regained all of the share lost on installation of our tvs strategy and then some ti stayed ahead of rising costs throughout the year despite inflationary environment with higher costs required to support ti production looking ahead we anticipate strong demand for ti pure pigment to continue in all geographies and end markets at the same time ore constraints are likely to continue into the first part of the year but will moderate over time as mark said earlier we have never felt better about the customer book we have built and look forward to continuing to serve them with the highest quality ti pure pigment available in the market today turning to chart 11 thermals and specialized solutions delivered a strong fourth quarter and full year 2021 driven by improved demand despite headwinds from automotive oems related to semiconductor shortages our execution throughout the year was solid and we continue to execute on pricing initiatives to stay ahead of rising raw material costs the breadth of our portfolio across victory aftermarket and non refrigerant applications enabled us to deliver solid financial performance despite the drag of automotive oem demand headwinds and contractual price downs looking more closely at the results fourth quarter net sales improved 8 from the prior year fourth quarter strong price contribution in the quarter of 19 more than offset the impact of 11 lower volumes as a reminder the fourth quarter of 2020 was an exceptional quarter from an auto oem demand perspective but both have been down across 2021 due to semiconductor shortages as a result of these headwinds adjusted ebitda declined 8 to 97 million in the quarter for the full year net sales rose 14 to 1 3 billion the result of stronger volumes and price which rose 9 and 4 respectively full year adjusted ebitda was 412 million up 16 from 354 million in 2020 adjusted ebitda margins improved from 32 to 33 demonstrating the earnings power of the segment we delivered solid growth in both legacy refrigerants and lower gwp opteon refrigerants across both end markets as we look ahead we expect a continued market recovery in 2022 with recovery in automotive oem build rates from the semiconductor related shortages of 2021 the u s aim act earmarked and emission less gas enforcement in europe will drive continued conversion to opteon low global warming potential solutions at the same time we continue to enter new markets with innovative products including opteon 1150 our newest low gwp foam blowing agent chemours remains well positioned to be very sustainable management provider of choice for our customers let s now turn to chart 12 for our advanced performance materials segment the apm segment has delivered outstanding results throughout 2021 and exceeded our own expectations for profitability throughout the year as the business continued its turnaround the power of chemistry continues to shine from polymers to membranes our portfolio contains class leading products which are key to unlocking the future potential of high growth end markets in clean energy and advanced electronics sales set an all time record of 346 million in the fourth quarter up 24 from 279 million in the prior year fourth quarter strong demand drove 10 price and 15 volume gains on a year over year basis with strong demand and underpinning growth across the breadth of the portfolio adjusted ebitda rose 160 to 65 million as price actions and productivity more than offset sharply higher energy and logistics costs in the quarter for the full year 2021 we delivered record net sales and adjusted ebitda of 1 4 billion and 261 million respectively the top line grew 27 from 2020 levels with 20 volume growth reflecting strong demand across all product lines price growth and currency contributed 4 and 3 respectively to the top line growth we continue to experience a favorable price cost dynamic across a diverse product portfolio of the segment and as a result margins expanded to 19 in 2021 from 11 in 2020 this achievement was exceptional given the logistics and weather related challenges experienced during the year looking ahead we believe the strong underlying demand will continue into 2022 we anticipate headwinds from raw material costs energy and logistics were moderate over the course of the year in total we continue to target top line growth in excess of gdp we are also targeting ebitda margins in the low 20 with operating discipline and efficient plant operations helping to offset rising input costs we see significant market momentum building in clean energy and advanced electronics where our technology is uniquely suited to drive high levels of performance whether it s our nafion membranes in hydrogen or teflon tfa in semiconductor fabs or viton elastomers in electric vehicles apm is playing a leading role in enabling the technologies that will help shape the future turning to chart 13 we continue to focus on the overall portfolio of chemours and completed the sale of our mining solutions business in the fourth quarter comparability of results in the fourth quarter and full year for chemical solutions segment was impacted by these portfolio actions that said the underlying business performance in pc i and mining solutions was solid throughout the year fourth quarter net sales were 69 million as the impact of price and volume gains of 8 and 14 respectively was more than offset by portfolio changes adjusted ebitda was 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 again reflecting the impact of portfolio changes in the quarter for the full year net sales were 336 million while the full year adjusted ebitda was 51 million strong demand and pricing gains across most end markets and key product lines contributed to the solid results looking ahead the segment is now focused on a world class glycolic acid franchise we anticipate solid growth in 2022 across more technical and high purity greater product along with continued expansion into new markets such as clean and disinfect and electronics with that i ll turn things back over to our ceo mark newman to cover our 2022 guidance mark mark newman president and chief executive officer thanks sameer i ll continue my remarks on chart 14 our business results have continued to improve steadily and are now well above pre pandemic levels reported in 2019 a result of the hard work of our employees and execution of our focus strategies as we look ahead to 2022 we believe our results will continue to improve with another year of solid earnings and cash flow growth our full year adjusted ebitda is projected to be between 1 3 billion and 1 45 billion up 8 at the midpoint after accounting for the divestiture of our mining solutions business at the end of last year we project adjusted eps of between 4 07 and 4 70 finally we forecast free cash flow of greater than 500 million in 2022 inclusive of capex of approximately 400 million taken together these results reflect the higher quality business we are driving across chemours and our ability to improve earnings through the cycle from a capital allocation perspective we remain committed to returning greater than 50 of that free cash flow to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases to that end we expect to complete the remaining portion of our 1 billion share repurchase authorization by mid 2022 with the momentum we have built in 2021 we believe 2022 will be another excellent year for chemours and for all our stakeholders i would like to close with some thoughts on the next chapter of chemours at spin we set out to create a new kind of chemistry company one which would have the courage to make difficult decisions and lead the industry forward the foundation which has been laid is strong as we look to the future the next chapter of chemours chemours 2 0 as we call it we ll refocus our efforts to create a better world through the power of our chemistry this vision will be underpinned by four key elements agile innovation and sustainable solutions environmental leadership community impact and making chemours the greatest place to work for every employee to that end i have challenged every chemours employee to ensure their work helps to contribute to these goals i truly believe the spirit of this vision owned collectively by our 6 400 employees can take the company to new heights and it will reward our customers our planet our team and of course our shareholders i m excited to be leading chemours on this leg of the journey and look forward to engaging with all of you in the coming year with that operator please open the line for q a questions answers operator and your first question comes from the line of john silverstein from wolfe research your line is open josh silverstein wolfe research analyst hey good morning guys for 2022 for tio2 you re still factoring in continued ore constraints and supply chain issues and raw material inflation are you factoring it to get worse relative to the fourth quarter versus or improvement throughout the course of the year and if there continues to be ore constraints what are the supply alternatives for them mark newman president and chief executive officer hey good morning john mark here our guide really assumed that we continue to build momentum in all three of our industry leading businesses and on tio2 in particular you know we were down sequentially in the quarter in line with expectations from a volume perspective on very strong demand but you know as we had indicated in our q3 call we were ore constrained we expect the ore constraint to relieve itself in the first half of the year so you know we start the year with ore constraint our expectation is volumes will be relatively flat from q4 to q1 but will then you know mirror more of the seasonal patterns beyond that as the ore situation resolves itself so you know great great good quarter on a great year but i just want to share with you that we see real good momentum in all of our businesses especially from a demand and a pricing perspective which we expect to continue josh silverstein wolfe research analyst thanks for that and then just on pricing under the tvs model you pushed through another 5 increase this quarter on top of a 6 increase in the third quarter with inflation indicators continuing to push higher and higher is the expectation for you guys to keep being able to push through higher prices in 2022 thanks mark newman president and chief executive officer so our the short answer is yes and as you ll see in our ebitda bridge you know we are continuing to be able to take price you know across our entire businesses in excess of cost clearly you know you re going to have some lumpiness as you move through time so it s not always a you know perfect timing in terms of how those two move together but recall that you know we have you know three go to market approaches on the tvs which provide us real price latitude maybe i ll ask sameer to comment on that because that s something that we watch very carefully sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark john look you touched on the ava contract but at the same time in flex and distribution as mark talked about there s an opportunity to push prices even faster than the ava contract right so all in all we feel pretty good about where the supply and demand is and what our opportunity is to pass the prices mark newman president and chief executive officer and josh bottom line i would say you know our expectation is to you know have our tio2 business you know for the full year we were at a 24 ebitda margin our expectation on this business is to be in the mid 20s going forward clearly you know you had a quarter in which we you know had lower volumes related to ore and as that relieves itself our expectation is through both price as well as volume you know we would return this business to mid 20s going forward josh silverstein wolfe research analyst all right thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of john mcnulty from bmo your line is open john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks very much for taking my question so a question on the tss business just in terms of how you re thinking about how 2022 plays out i know we had some of the issues around autos being a little bit weaker in the back half of the year i assume that s there s an assumption in your guide for a recovery there you also had some really strong pricing as well so i guess can you speak to how you re thinking about how that business progresses in terms of earnings trajectory through 2022 mark newman president and chief executive officer yeah you know john thanks for the question tss had a good year despite the auto oem headwinds and of course we had the winter storm uri that impacted our corpus christi plant early in the year so when you look at the year of being up 14 with greater than 30 margins with all those headwinds really great job by the team you know when we look at ihs forecast for auto builds we expect that to be in line with those projections clearly you know we re focused on both the oem and aftermarket growth in opteon and so we feel quite encouraged by that and our guide reflects you know the continuing improvement of the auto as we go through the year on the pricing side you know we re seeing a better market in the stationary mainly here in north america but also in europe and you know as we get through this next covid wave you know our expectation is we ll see a lot more folks returning to offices business travel picking up we ll see a lot more sort of normal recovery in the commercial aspects of the refrigerant demand across the spectrum so quite encouraged by early indications in the year but clearly you know we have a cautious note in our guidance until the auto oem situation clears itself john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it got it no that s helpful and then maybe just as a follow up kind of a broader question so when i look at the guidance that you provided it s a pretty wide range admittedly and it s a crazy year to start so maybe that s part of the rationale but when i look at the low end of the range i mean it s basically pointing to when you adjust for you know the chem sol sale about 1 5 to 2 ebitda growth which you know given kind of the outlook that you laid out for tio2 the outlook that you laid out for tss and what i would think is going to be continued decent demand growth in the apm segment can you i can t figure out what could get you to that low end of the range so can you kind of help us to at least frame the risks or the potential or the things that could go wrong that you know maybe put you toward that low end of the range or is it just hey look it s early and you know we don t want to get we don t want to set the bar too high type of thing like how can we get to that mark newman president and chief executive officer john i d say it s early and we re starting the year obviously with a number of uncertainties we did mention being you know ore constrained in tio2 you know we re seeing you know we re not through with the semicon issue with auto there s been some auto disruptions even in the quarter unrelated to semicon and you know so i think it s just you know starting the year with a lot of uncertainty and having some caution in our guidance but i would not factor anything more into that than this you know being thoughtful early on in the year john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst got it thanks very much for the color mark newman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bob koort from goldman sachs your line is open unknown speaker goldman sachs analyst this is emily on for bob so looking again at the 2022 outlook it reflects a continued economic recovery and you guys mentioned the expected supply chain normalization in early 2022 so just kind of across the businesses what trends have you seen that give you confidence in that normalization mark newman president and chief executive officer yes so emily great question i would start by saying that demand remains strong in all key markets and all key product lines and in fact in many cases we are we remain sold out and pricing power is in our favor obviously we are working carefully with our customers to make sure we re not doing anything that s disruptive but as i look at it you know clearly demand is strong at the outset but we re somewhat constrained especially in tio2 as we start the year so i think our guidance really reflects growth top line growth in all of our businesses this year clearly you know if i go through the businesses we re outside of tio2 you know we will be looking at the impact starting the impact of the aim act in our tss business where we re going to start to see more traction on some of our blends businesses in refrigerants our expectation around our apm business is that the gdp plus growth from this point on because of all the secular trends related to both semicon and evs that are you know driving our portfolio unknown speaker goldman sachs analyst ok great and then just one more can you provide more color on the new strategic partnerships you mentioned in the tnss business sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is sameer let me just jump in it s these are the strategic partnerships that we have with the sorry with the hvac oems some of these are public and some are of course not in the public domain but being across the broad spectrum of oem suppliers we have been working and as they transition to a new equipment right as the aim regulation comes in yes it will be initially the balanced portfolio but all the oems are working through their models and upgrading how they will work with the new refrigerant so there s great exciting opportunities to be working with our key customers and to help them transition into the new product lines unknown speaker goldman sachs analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets your line is open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks for taking my questions i guess first off just real quickly on the cash usage maybe you can just kind of go through and order your priority uses of cash it looks like you do have quite a bit of cash on the balance sheet there and about you know close to 1 5 billion 1 45 but it sounds like your buyback plans are for about 2 15 in the first half how do you plan to spend the remainder of the cash there thanks mark newman president and chief executive officer so arun great question i ll start and ask sameer to follow on as well so clearly when you look at our free cash flow generation in 2021 and the guide that we ve given for this year this will be the third year of free cash flow greater than half a billion what we want investors to understand is this is a franchise which has improving earnings quality across all three businesses and significant cash conversion this is a management team with support from our board that believes in returning the majority of free cash flow to our investors and in 2021 coming out of covid 19 we thought a more balanced approach with that in mind made sense and so you see we made really good gains in terms of improving the strength of our balance sheet and our leverage ratios as well as returning the majority of free cash flow we actually stepped up the cash flow to shareholders more so in the second half of last year as we got more confident on the full year outlook and we re coming into the new year and stepping that up again so we have 250 million remaining on our current share buyback authorization and you know our commitment is to have that completed in the first half of this year you know consistent with the cash generation of the business going forward maybe sameer if you have any other thoughts sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks mark arun i will just go back to how are we going talk about the cash usage in the past right but we as a manufacturer our first priority in terms of investing in our cash is to make sure we have safe and reliable operations as you know we have you know our responsibility commitments that we have to ensure we can cut down on the emissions and our there are some pretty attractive growth opportunities as well as mark kind of talked about with aim act and all the stuff that s happening around semiconductor on shoring it s a great exciting opportunities for us on both of the apm tss and tt franchises we first our first priority is to make sure we do the right capex and that s why you ve seen in the guide roughly 400 million of capex and i would the way i would look at capex arun as i said in my remarks is number of projects move from 21 into 2022 so combine that 21 and 22 is around 50 million of capex and after that as mark said you know we will do look over at debt reduction we are committed to our 3 5 billion gross debt target we made pretty significant improvement in that we ll continue to our march forward on that and then last is our commitment stays that we will return majority of free cash flow to shareholders so if you look at our comments around that we expect to finish the remaining commitment on the buyback program in the first half that s roughly 250 million of cash coming back to the shareholders we have repurchases just in the first half of the year so that s how i you know you should think about our cash usage investment credit profile enhancement and majority of the cash coming back to shareholders arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst ok thanks for that and just as a follow up i wanted to understand the high end of the guidance i know there s about a 60 million difference between the midpoint versus the high end so would you characterize that as mostly possible that 60 million and apm and tss if there s quicker resolution on chip shortage issues or supply chain is that the right way to think about it thanks sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah arun there are lots of puts and takes but i would say it s pretty balanced look i mean there are growth opportunities across all three businesses right if ore situation is resolved i think on the tio2 side as mark said earlier the demand remains really strong so there s an opportunity from there from a midpoint to the high end and the tss you hit the nail on the head you know if the auto oem market recovers i think that provide us some pretty interesting exciting opportunities f gas regulation mark mentioned about aim act but at the same time as the enforcement increases in europe on the f gas that provides us an opportunity as well and similarly on the apm side i mean as we talked about the margin improvement as the efficiency of the operation improves getting into the margins in the low 20 that provides us a great opportunity as well so it s an opportunity rich environment and on across all our three businesses so on the high end i would keep it pretty balanced mark newman president and chief executive officer arun as i said you know we really love the momentum we have in all of our businesses obviously we re being very thoughtful on our guide early in the year but when i look at tio2 we have the best book of business that we ve ever had and we can grow with our customers we are working to unlock the bottleneck capacity to achieve that growth when i look at tss you know we have the recovery of auto plus the growing impact of aim over time as well as just you know more commercial refrigeration as things go back to normal post covid and then in apm you know we re working on so many exciting opportunities from semicon to hydrogen to evs to advanced electronics where our fluoropolymers really are the only answer to sort of solving the world s most difficult issues so i m very excited about the potential of these three businesses and the focus we have of our leadership team and our employees you know to keep driving forward arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst thanks operator your next question comes from the line of duffy fischer from barclays your line is open duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning first question is just around your free cash flow last year you guys did about 41 conversion from ebitda to free cash flow it s the midpoint this year that would give you 564 million of free cash flow which is a pretty big distance from you know i mean it s within the guidance but it s much higher than the 500 is that conversion ratio still good in your mind or are you likely to convert less ebitda to free cash flow this year than last year sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer no duffy this is sameer let me just take that one as you kind of look at the 2022 versus 2021 i think that one of the biggest drivers was just capex right as we kind of move from this year to next as i said just to arun you know capex is going up it s just a transition given how some of the projects got delayed and also i think from a working capital perspective this is a year in which we will be more seasonal in terms of the working capital consumption and release of the working capital so that s going to have a little bit of impact as well 2019 2022 you know inventories have been pretty light across the chain and that applies to us as well so as we kind of move into 2022 you re going to see some of the working capital stuff as well so all in all i would say you know combination of the two years given the capex movement kind of makes more sense the way you look at it duffy fischer barclays analyst fair enough and then a couple of quick ones just on tio2 one as you exited last year what percent of your tio2 was on the ava contracts and then two if you look at the tonnes you produced last year where is that relative to your capacity you know so we can kind of build it in if we think things are going to grow how many more tonnes we re going to be able to add over the next couple of years you know to your revenue line mark newman president and chief executive officer yeah so duffy you know we ve guided to about 70 of our book of business is contracted and the rest is you know either our distributor business or our flex portal and we oscillate around that from quarter to quarter but that s a pretty good guide what i d tell you is in 2021 you know our mix of contracted business really improved we used the market tightness as a way to enhance both product and customer mix throughout the year to where we can now say this is we re supplying the best set of strategic customers with the best contracts that we ve had in our history so i m really encouraged by that you know clearly the impact of ore as it relates to capacity had an impact on our q4 volumes and we re starting the year that way so we would expect our volumes to be relatively flat from q4 to q1 but beyond that we would expect to be able to show volume growth as well given our capacity duffy fischer barclays analyst terrific thank you guys mark newman president and chief executive officer thanks duffy operator your next question comes from the line of vincent andrews from morgan stanley your line is open vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning everyone could you just give us a sense of the visibility you have on your supply improving for after the first half i just ask because obviously you know the situation has gotten more challenging over the last three months so i just like to get a better sense of how much comfort you have in that view on ore mark newman president and chief executive officer yeah you know i would say the main thing that we were watching currently is ore supply to tio2 vincent that s related to some force majeure activity in q3 of last year which you know we see improving as we move forward in time clearly even though things at the mine face are improved you still have the impact of pretty congested logistics so that s really playing into our near term you know performance but again our view is you know we see that resolving itself here in the first half and you know we expect to have more to say at the end of q1 vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst ok and just as a follow up if i look at your historical balance sheet and the cash balances at the end of the year the lowest number i see in 2015 is 366 million is that for walking around assumption is that the amount that you could comfortably finish the year with on an ongoing basis or would you need more than that sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah vincent this is sameer look i mean it really depends on the needs of the businesses and what kind of investments you re looking at the u s versus non u s cash what i would say is the balance sheet cash you should really look in the context of where we are spending you know our view is we continue to make investments in our businesses both on the run and maintain and reliability perspective and make continue to make progress on our crc commitments get our balance sheet debt back to 3 5 billion range so we are committed to that and then go back to returning majority of the free cash floww to the shareholders look i mean that s how i would look at it the exact balance sheet cash as you know can move around based on where the needs are and also really importantly how we generate the cash into u s versus non u s and making sure we have enough u s cash vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thanks very much mark newman president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of josh spector from ubs your line is open josh spector ubs analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question just a couple of ones to take on ore again just you know as ore limits supply i guess is it fair for me think about most of your north america sales to be on avas already do they get perhaps first dibs at north america supply and does that mean that europe gets a bit shorted in the near term the next couple of quarters and just on your 2q seasonal ramp comment i assume for you to meet that you need the ore for 2q already on the water and ships now is that in place to get it 2q seasonal ramp mark newman president and chief executive officer so i d say as i said earlier the issue at the mine has largely been resolved and we re seeing improvements there and shipments are on the water so yes the last question has been the short answer is yes obviously it s something we keep monitoring clearly we are very focused on meeting our contracted book of business and their customer needs first and when i look at our growth in 2021 we grew in all markets so there s no north america versus europe versus ap trade off here the trade off is hey you make sure you deliver first and protect your contracted book of business and that s candidly part of the value prop that so many customers have flocked to or being contracted with chemours so in the short term it will put a little bit more volume on some percentage on our ava book but again this is just a matter of a couple of quarters here where we re somewhat ore constraint josh spector ubs analyst and maybe another way to ask that then is is your flex quartile distribution significantly different than your average i mean i guess i would think maybe ap perhaps as more of the spot market activity is that a fair way to think about it mark newman president and chief executive officer our flex portal is available to our global customers so customers around the world in different markets the availability on flex is somewhat reduced when you re constrained and then that usually results in prices on flex you know which reflect the spot markets being significantly higher so that s we always want to have volume available for flex and distribution because of the opportunity it brings in a tight market like we have and that s why you know we ve made this rule of thumb that we would constrain our contracted book of business to about 70 of our volumes josh spector ubs analyst ok thank you mark newman president and chief executive officer you re welcome operator your next question comes from the line of matthew deyoe from bank of america your line is open matthew deyoe bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning thanks a few quick ones on the tss volumes so if the business was down like 11 does that mean opteon was down closer to 18 to 20 and why did it take until 4q to see that headwind given what we ve kind of saw transpiring even at the 3q i know you mentioned comps from last year is that the case and what do we see this type of should we see this kind of volume print consistently until we get to the back half of next year when things ease up a little bit mark newman president and chief executive officer no as i ll start it and maybe ask sameer to comment a little bit further recall q4 of last year was a very robust recovery for auto it s just a tough year over year comp on auto volumes vis a vis the semicon constrained build and omicron constrained build in q4 so you know the way you should read that is just a year over year comp our expectation and i think if you look at ihs outlook they re projecting order volumes this year to be up around 10 and so we are using ihs as the guide clearly you know we re focused on both oem and aftermarket opportunities as the opteon car park continues to build matthew deyoe bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok and then a quick one on pfoa so dupont made some comments about making progress on settlement work they really didn t go into a lot of detail on the call and maybe that s on purpose but there s kind of this outstanding south carolina mdl and perhaps other cases just kind of wondering through what the cadence of any kind of announcements we might get through the year or what you re looking at and you know how you frame out liabilities versus perhaps risk to setting precedence mark newman president and chief executive officer so josh i wouldn t speculate on cadence but i d make two comments here first is dupont corteva and chemours continue to work well together under the mou framework and you saw that this year with the delaware settlement that we announced last year secondly as a leadership team we re always open to potential for settlements that reduced the risk to the company but are done in a way that we believe create value to our shareholders and so we will continue to have that mindset i m very encouraged by the fact that you know in my discussions with dupont and corteva you know we have a shared view of using the mou to work through issues that relate to our legacy paths so stay tuned but nothing more to say at this time matthew deyoe bank of america merrill lynch analyst understood thanks operator your next question comes from the line of eric petrie from citi your line is open eric petrie citi analyst hi good morning mark and sameer mark newman president and chief executive officer hi eric eric petrie citi analyst i saw your second patent infringement case in japan and it s a good example of enforcement but i was wondering could you give an overview of your patent estate and when could we expect the competitor to produce hfo for the auto air conditioning market mark newman president and chief executive officer hey we continue to view our passengers state as going well toward the end of this current decade and we will vigorously depend defend our ip estate globally and so i just say you know we continue to innovate around our opteon franchise bring new ip to market that you know makes our product better for our customers and we would expect to continue to have significant ip defenses through the through later half of this decade eric petrie citi analyst ok and then secondly on tio2 given the shipping and logistics and strengths did you have to reroute any of your tio2 volumes i know altamira is a big exporter of tio2 so any changes in trade routes sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer hey eric this is sameer nothing of significance look there s always supply chain teams making some adjustments here and there based on the port availability and the vendors that we use but nothing material mark newman president and chief executive officer eric i ll just say you know this year our operations teams worked hand in glove with procurement and logistics and our customer service organization to ensure minimal disruption to our customers and we you don t build up book of business like we have by not really taking seriously your value prop to your customers so i really it was a year where we had collaboration across all aspects of the organization but you know a big shout out to our ops teams who despite three waves of covid run our plants really well and worked with our logistics team to make sure our customers had minimal disruptions eric petrie citi analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of hassan ahmed from alembic global your line is open hassan ahmed alembic global analyst good morning mark mark newman president and chief executive officer hi hassan hassan ahmed alembic global analyst how are you doing mark newman president and chief executive officer great hassan ahmed alembic global analyst question around titanium technologies look sequentially your volumes were down 10 and i obviously understand the seasonality of things i understand sort of supply chain constraints considerations and the like but one of your sort of larger competitors you know back in november had guided to volume decline sequentially in the mid single digits so i m just trying to understand did you guys lose some market share in q4 or was that just you know the way the market was and part and parcel with that on a go forward basis in 2022 now that you guys stated that you ve regained your lost market share how should we think about your volumes in tio2 year on year will you grow with the market or will you continue to try to regain market share as you consider debottlenecks and the like mark newman president and chief executive officer yeah hassan it s a great question and clearly you know among competitors you will have variation quarter to quarter but when you look at our overall volumes for the year tio2 revenue up 40 you know it s hard to argue with the result that we had in the year as sameer said in his remarks we regained the market share we lost with tvs and then some so our focus here is to really you know maintain our market share maintain grow our market share and but by doing that by growing with our customers first we have a really good strategic book of business and our focus now is how do we grow as our key strategic customers grow as it relates to sort of a volume outlook for the year clearly we are starting the year or constrained and as i said earlier we expect that to alleviate itself as we move through the first half and our expectation is based on the strength of the market we re seeing and how light inventories are throughout the whole system that we should have another great year in terms of revenue growth in this business hassan ahmed alembic global analyst understood and as a follow up just sticking to tio2 again you know as you sit there and look at where the cost curves are today with you know with you rightly pointed out ore constraints obviously or pricing the prices going up but also sort of the chlorine side of things you know all in out there shuttering as much as 15 of their capacity could 2022 be a year where you see major differences between the integrated tio2 producers versus the nonintegrated ones and again i m thinking about the flexibility that you guys have you know in toggling between a whole range of ores so could this be a year where the nonintegrated feast or famine you know relative to whether you re integrated or not mark newman president and chief executive officer so listen we like our book of business we like our supply on all of our you know we continue to work you know across both chlorine and ore to be well supplied through time so i just say and then we like our cost curve where we are on the cost curve and as we debottleneck capacity we re seeing opportunities to do that at some of our lower cost plans as well so overall hassan i remain very encouraged about where we are in our tio2 journey clearly we re starting the year slightly more constrained and that s something we ll work our way through hassan ahmed alembic global analyst very helpful sameer ralhan senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah the only other thing hassan i would add is look i mean if you look at you know the quality of our operations and technology in tio2 i won t exchange that for anything else at the end of the day what matters is return on

good morning everyone in 2021 we delivered steady growth while progressing our cleaner energy goals during the year we invested 3 6 billion of capital to support the continued delivery of reliable electricity and natural gas to our customers despite the ongoing challenges of the covid 19 pandemic on the esg front we advanced many of our priorities including becoming a supporter of the task force on climate related financial disclosures improving the diversity of our board and enhancing our sustainability disclosures all while continuing to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions financially absent foreign exchange differences we grew adjusted earnings per share by approximately 5 supporting our 6 dividend growth and strong shareholder returns in 2021 2021 was another year of extreme weather across north america and a few of our service territories were impacted british columbia saw fires and record heat in the summer and a devastating flood in the fall while itc system experienced the derecho windstorm for the second year in a row with our operating model our utilities were able to respond to those events and restore service quickly and safely using their local system knowledge and the support of best practices and expertise shared from across the fortis group a strong reliability and safety culture continues to be the foundation of our utility operations as evidenced by another year of outperformance relative to industry averages i would like to thank all of our employees and our utilities whose dedication day in and day out allows us to provide exemplary service to our customers our long history of achieving strong shareholder returns continued in 2021 with a one year total shareholder return of 21 8 looking back over a 20 year time frame fortis has delivered average annual total shareholder returns of approximately 13 or 975 in total also as shown on slide 6 this far exceeds the returns generated by the benchmark indices since 2019 we have reduced scope 1 emissions by 20 this demonstrates significant progress toward reaching our target to reduce these emissions 75 by 2035 at uns closure of the coal fired navajo generating station in late 2019 as well as the recent additions of the 250 megawatt oso grande wind project the 100 megawatt wilmot solar project and the 99 megawatt borderlands wind project have driven our carbon emissions reduction to date with a full year of these renewable generation projects and the planned closure of san juan generating station scheduled for midyear we expect further reductions in carbon emissions in 2022 and remain on track to achieve our 75 reduction target in 2021 our utilities deployed 3 6 billion of capital focused on resiliency modernization and sustainable energy including 600 million for cleaner energy projects these investments supported rate base growth of approximately 6 over 2020 capital investments for the year were broadly in line with plan however a lower u s to canadian dollar exchange rate and pandemic related timing delays for both the wataynikaneyap transmission project and planned spending at caribbean utilities modestly tempered investments during the year this was partially offset by higher capital spending at itc including restoration costs following the december derecho storm while the pandemic has not had a material impact on our overall capital plan to date we are continuing to monitor the supply chain in order to identify and mitigate issues promptly for 2022 capital expenditures remain on track and are not expected to be significantly impacted in the fourth quarter we rolled out our 20 billion five year capital plan through 2026 reflecting approximately 4 billion of annual investment in our utilities the plan consists of virtually all regulated investments and a diverse mix of highly executable low risk projects supporting rate base growth across our utilities with investments spanning the entire energy delivery chain 3 8 billion of the five year capital plan is allocated to cleaner energy investments aimed at improving our already low carbon footprint the plan is expected to increase rate base by over 10 billion from approximately 31 billion in 2021 to nearly 42 billion in 2026 supporting average annual rate base growth of approximately 6 above and beyond our base plan we remain optimistic about incremental opportunities to enhance our growth strategy specifically as it relates to our transmission business we continue to see a supportive policy environment at the state level the transmission infrastructure planning act in michigan was signed into law in december with this legislation enacted itc now has a right of first refusal in iowa michigan and minnesota providing itc the first right to build and own regional projects located within its service territory at the federal level the white house released a fact sheet last month outlining various administrative actions that will take in 2022 to implement its clean energy goals and climate agenda including a new initiative from the department of energy building a better grid this initiative is expected to support the nationwide development of new and upgraded transmission lines enhance resiliency and provide additional access to clean energy in addition to these positive policy advancements itc s geographic footprint puts them in a strong position to take advantage of the miso long range transmission plan miso is identifying regional transmission required to support the evolving needs of the system as it transitions to cleaner energy visibility on the initial tranche of projects is expected in the second quarter following the approval of the proposed cost allocation methodology that was filed earlier this month with ferc by miso and a majority of its transmission owners on the lake erie connector project the fully permitted shovel ready project continues to progress last month the ontario minister of energy issued a letter to the province s independent electric system operator or ieso acknowledging the many benefits of the project in the letter the ontario government requested ieso continued discussions with itc to advance contract negotiations on a transmission service agreement and requested a report back from ieso in late march should itc reach a finalized agreement with ieso construction of the project would take approximately four years our current five year plan does not include investments associated with these projects as these or other opportunities that we ve highlighted in the past come to fruition they would either be additive to our existing plan or extend growth beyond 2026 in 2021 we increased our dividends paid per common share to 2 05 an approximately 6 increase compared to 2020 marking 48 years of dividend increases looking ahead we remain committed to building on this record through the execution of our growth strategy and a targeted 6 average annual dividend growth in 2025 now i will turn the call over to jocelyn for an update on our fourth quarter and annual financial results jocelyn perry executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you david and good morning everyone turning to slide 13 and looking first at our fourth quarter results while we continue to see rate base growth across our utilities we successfully concluded the central hudson rate case and advanced the tep rate settlement in the fourth quarter there were a number of key drivers lowering eps quarter over quarter reported earnings per common share was 0 69 0 02 lower than the fourth quarter of 2020 and adjusted earnings per common share was 0 63 0 06 lower than the fourth quarter of 2020 unfavorable weather impacts in arizona and belize impacted eps by 0 04 alone in arizona retail sales were down 6 in the quarter driven mainly by milder weather and production in belize was down 87 because of lower rainfall central hudson also experienced a number of weather related service interruptions that contributed to the company not meeting its performance targets and fortis share price increased approximately 9 in the quarter which resulted in higher stock based compensation expense and together this decreased eps by 0 03 uns also experienced lower gains on its retirement investments during the quarter and this was a 0 01 impact and as expected timing of tax deductions at fortisalberta lowered eps by 0 02 and a lower foreign exchange and a higher weighted average shares outstanding each decreased eps by 0 01 looking at the annual results reported earnings per common share was 2 61 0 01 higher than 2020 and adjusted earnings per common share for the year was 2 59 0 02 higher than 2020 this increase in eps year over year was achieved despite a lower foreign exchange rate which decreased eps by 0 10 excluding foreign exchange impacts adjusted eps grew by 0 12 or approximately 5 in 2021 the waterfall table on slide 15 breaks down the annual eps drivers as well as the earnings growth at our regulated utilities excluding the impacts of foreign exchange in 2021 our regulated utilities increased eps by 0 18 over 2020 our largest utility itc increased eps by 0 07 reflecting 9 year over year earnings growth at utilities strong rate base growth coupled with a favorable adjustment related to interest rate swaps was partially offset by higher nonrecoverable stock based compensation costs uns energy increased eps by 0 02 growing its earnings by approximately 4 i ll speak to you in more detail on the next slide central hudson contributed a 0 02 eps increase growing its earnings by approximately 7 reflecting rate base growth and the conclusion of its rate case our western canadian utilities contributed a 0 05 eps increase driven mainly by rate base growth higher earnings at fortisalberta were also driven by favorable weather in total earnings in western canada grew 6 year over year at our other electric segment higher sales in the caribbean due to the continued recovery of the tourism industry and rate base growth contributed to a 0 02 increase in eps or 7 segmented earnings growth compared to 2020 at our energy infrastructure segment eps decreased 0 03 mainly driven by lower hydroelectric production in belize and realized losses on natural gas contracts at aitken creek with the lower rainfall in belize production in 2021 was 147 gigawatt hours compared to 229 gigawatt hours in 2020 this reflects a 35 decrease year over year and the realized losses at aitken creek as we discussed in the third quarter reflect contracts settled in consideration of market conditions and favorable forward curve as expected with our dividend reinvestment program eps decreased 0 03 due to higher weighted average shares outstanding and lastly the average u s dollar to canadian dollar exchange rate was 1 25 for 2021 compared to 1 34 for 2020 which lowered eps by 0 10 as i mentioned on the previous slide uns grew earnings grew by 4 compared to 2020 uns benefited from higher net margin in 2021 driven largely by new retail rates at tep the ferc settlement and higher wholesale margins this increased eps by approximately 0 10 uns did however report higher planned maintenance cost at tep s generating facilities which lowered eps by 0 03 and lastly weather impacts in 2021 lowered eps by 0 05 as you recall tucson experienced its hottest summer on record in 2020 looking ahead to 2022 we expect to reasonably manage regulatory lag as we expect lower planned generation maintenance costs coupled with customer growth and formula based transmission rate additionally while no decision has been made we are in the process of evaluating the timing of the next rate case filing at tep as you can see on slide 17 we were active in the debt capital markets again in 2021 with over 1 billion in long term debt raised at attractive rates highlighted by itc s inaugural green notes debt issued at fortis inc mainly refinanced maturing debt while our regulated utilities issued debt in support of their capital programs with the backdrop of a rising interest rate environment several of our utilities accelerated long term debt issuances in 2021 locking in attractive rates in addition itc entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate refinancing risk we continue to monitor the capital markets and any impacts on our future financing requirements with our recent debt issuance coupled with over 3 billion available on our credit facilities we continue to maintain a strong liquidity position supporting our 20 billion five year capital plan our capital plan is expected to be primarily funded with cash from operations debt issued at our regulated utilities and our equity dividend reinvestment plan while maintaining a relatively steady capital structure through 2026 this funding plan coupled with fortis low business risk profile provides financial flexibility and positions us comfortably within our existing investment grade credit ratings turning to recent regulatory updates first itc continues to await a final rule from ferc in relation to the supplemental notice of proposed rule making on transmission incentives which proposes to eliminate the 50 basis point rto return on equity incentive matter in november itc filed comments in response to the events notice of proposed rule making or anopr on regional transmission planning cost allocation and generator interconnection processes in its response itc recommended for direct the rtos to conduct regular holistic transmission planning and highlighted some of the impediments of order 1000 competition while ferc has indicated its plans to move the anopr through the regulatory process as fast as possible it remains unclear whether aspects of the anopr will be broken out into multiple noprs at tep you may recall ferc issued an order in 2019 accepting formula transmission rates as filed subject to refund and settlement procedures a settlement in principle was filed with ferc in december 2021 the settlement includes an allowed roe of 9 79 and a single roll in rate design the ferc rate design settlement is positive as over 20 of uns energy s five year capital plan is allocated to transmission investments which will receive timely recovery in rates in november 2021 central hudson received an order from the new york public service commission approving a three year rate plan retroactive to july 2021 the commission approved the joint proposal which includes an roe of 9 and an equity layer of 50 declining by 1 annually to 48 in the third rate year in british columbia the generic cost of capital proceeding is expected to continue into 2022 and the effective date of any change in the cost of capital remains unknown fortisalberta filed its 2023 cost of service application in november in conjunction with the return to a third performance based rate making term beginning in 2024 a decision from the auc is expected in the third quarter and lastly in january 2022 the auc initiated a generic cost of capital proceeding to consider whether the current cost of capital parameters should be extended for 2023 a decision is expected as early as march the auc also confirmed it will begin a separate process for cost of capital for 2024 and beyond later this year that concludes my remarks i ll now turn the call back to david david hutchens president and chief executive officer thank you jocelyn at fortis we have the right people values and plan to advance our growth strategy and deliver a cleaner energy future with our local operating model geographic and regulatory diversity and operational expertise our stakeholders stand to benefit from the long term value of fortis that we will deliver in 2022 and beyond i will now turn the call back over to stephanie stephanie amaimo vice president investor relations thank you david this concludes the presentation at this time we d like to open the call to address questions from the investment community questions answers operator thank you and your first question is from linda ezergailis with td securities linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you i m wondering if you could help us understand a normalized weather year on a consolidated basis what that might look like in terms of eps it was really helpful to get the year over year 0 05 impact recognizing that 2020 had record hot weather but i m wondering what the sensitivity would be to normal weather if you could provide it in 2021 david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah that s good morning linda i m glad you can make the call the weather sensitivity is quite a bit of a combination of art and science and it is very difficult to get kind of some really good thumb rules from a year over year basis particularly coming out of the pandemic because we saw very different customer behavior back in 2020 than we did in 2021 with everyone working from home we saw a very different use per customer profile so that compounded by the fact that we tend to get a little bit warmer every year these days other than 2021 where we saw kind of slip back it is pretty tough to get that sensitivity so i know that it s a nonresponsive answer but we re trying to work on how we can see that really from a it mostly is impacted by the weather in arizona because most of the other utilities that we have have very limited weather flow through to the bottom line so i would say when you look at 2021 versus 2020 obviously 2021 was a much more normal weather year so that would be more of a normal than i would think of on a going forward basis linda ezergailis td securities analyst that s helpful thank you and in terms of different customer behavior again i know it s an art not a science but maybe just as a follow up are your teams putting thought toward what s the new normal and how much of that shift in customer behavior might be not permanent but systemic and continue versus what might revert back to historical patterns potentially going forward david hutchens president and chief executive officer sure so in arizona we re actually seeing it kind of revert back to normal back to the pre 2020 timeframe when you look at it from a use per customer perspective as well as the more normal for the most part residential and commercial load shapes because in arizona i think a lot of folks did return to work in 2021 business has opened up quite a bit more obviously than in 2020 so we have seen in 2021 probably what i would call pretty darn close to the new normal from a load perspective and from a customer usage and demand profile perspective not to say that doesn t change on a going forward basis when you look at some of the other new technologies dsm energy efficiency etc that can be deployed across our utilities but for the most part we re kind of back to what the pre 2020 or pre pandemic behavior linda ezergailis td securities analyst that s helpful thank you and recognizing that q1 is only half finished at this point and a lot can happen still in the quarter i m wondering if anyone on the team would be able to provide a sense of what the weather and believes water levels have them so far that we ve been seeing in q1 and even any sort of natural gas storage if i may be so bold david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah i mean it is just tracking rainfall in belize and it s better than q4 that s we have we are starting to see production tick back up but it s hard to say where we ll end up at for the quarter it is frankly a pretty variable based on that rainfall and believes that production is obviously directly correlated with that q4 was a very very low quarter for us when you compare it 21 to 20 so we do see it coming back somewhat linda ezergailis td securities analyst thank you i ll jump back in the queue thank you so much david hutchens president and chief executive officer all right operator your next question is from maurice choy with rbc capital markets maurice choy rbc capital markets analyst thank you and good morning my first question is on miso lrtp dave you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you see supportive policy from premium to federal and state levels as you approach the announcement of the first tranche of projects in q2 how should we view your market share if i could call it that way and how does this market share do you change for the michigan decision in december david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah so i don t really have it broken down by jurisdiction and maybe linda could provide a little color on this but we have talked in the past about just our overall footprint in the miso region and that s 23 ish percent 22 23 of the miso footprint that s our assets and we also kind of use and i don t know how indicative it is and probably not that indicative for on a forward looking basis because the miso trends these new long range transmission projects we don t know exactly where they re going to land where they re going to come in in the tranches and frankly this isn t a great indication obviously looking backwards but when we did the mvp projects i guess almost a decade ago we did get about that same level 22 23 of the mvp projects came our way at itc so it s hard to necessarily project any of that on a going forward basis especially when you can just wait a few months and we ll hopefully be able to see you and have a really good view on it and then once we see that tranche we see the where our rofrs land related to those projects we ll get a really good view of what we think from projects which projects are ours on a going forward basis and then start the fun part which is figuring out how to plan and build them linda do you have any color to add on that linda apsey president and chief executive officer itc holdings corp no dave i think you captured it all nothing additive for me maurice choy rbc capital markets analyst ok got it and maybe a second question is on arizona jocelyn i may have missed it and apologies if i did but i think you mentioned that fortis evaluating the timing of the next rate case filing in for tep as the current rates were approved just over a year ago what are the changes to your business that you d be highlighting to the acc to justify new rates and as a follow up how do you see the acc s recent regulatory decisions relating to peers in the state being factored into your view about this rate application jocelyn perry executive vice president and chief financial officer maurice before i throw it to david because i m sure david will talk about the arizona environment there but with respect to the rate case it s not uncommon for tep to be thinking about a rate case the last rate case was filed with the year end december 31 2018 so it s been several years since we ve last set rates so we ve invested as you know we keep investing in arizona so we do have what i would say suggests that we would highlight to the regulator that we re continuing to invest and we need to revisit what we ve invested over the last couple of years and get that into rates tep has done a great job right it s done keep moving forward with its clean energy plans it s managing its cost it s doing the right things so this is just very typical for a utility to file the rate case every couple of years and so nothing out of the ordinary from tep s perspective i ll let david speak to what s happening with the peers there david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah i d just add that you re right on jocelyn because it really is three years is a lot of lag for a utility like ours in arizona and we have obviously not just invested in the past three years but are looking to invest quite a bit on a going forward basis to go down the path of our clean energy transition in arizona so we want to make sure that we re getting in front of our regulators telling that story looking for mechanisms that we need to make sure that we get adequate and timely cost recovery related to those investments as we go forward and then the regulatory environment in the arizona i know this has been a bit of a hot topic for the past few months but i think one a lot of that conversation and the results of another company s rate case in arizona don t necessarily reflect on expectations don t reflect at all expectations on an outcome for us i think those are very utility specific we ve got a different utility a different relationship with the commission different resource plan all of that stuff is different so from my perspective there s not a there s definitely not a read through to tep from that and frankly there s been some very good and positive very recent positive outcomes in arizona regulatory environment just this week the arizona corporation commission acknowledged the integrated resource plans that we filed for tucson electric power and our smaller electric utility uns electric which supports that 2020 integrated resource plan that supports our 80 greenhouse gas reduction at tep that of course supports 75 greenhouse gas reduction that we have fortis wide so those are all good signals that the commission is moving in the right direction providing the right signals and allowing us to do what we have to do which is plan our system its needs for our customers for the reliability and affordability through an integrated resource planning process and they re actually spending a good amount of time to get those integrated resource plan rules right so that we can look at a broad array of different opportunities from a lease cost portfolio to the most aggressive renewable portfolio and make sure that we pick the one that our stakeholders and our customers and our regulators all agree on that s what we did in 2020 so nothing new for us we re looking forward to getting that next integrated resource plan which actually is now not due until august of next year so a lot of work to be done between now and then maurice choy rbc capital markets analyst great and just a quick follow up could you help us focus a little more on timing of this filing are you talking about in the next few months or by the end of this year roughly that would be great david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah it s really hard to put a pin in it at this point but we re looking at it there s one of these things that you always evaluate is capital plan timing and when is the right test year to pick and so we re still working through all of those bits and pieces maurice choy rbc capital markets analyst understood thank you david hutchens president and chief executive officer welcome operator your next question is from rob hope with scotiabank rob hope scotiabank analyst good morning everyone just a follow up question on the midwest transmission projects i assume that there s not a ton of capital in your existing capital plan related to the next tranche that will be coming out but when you take a look at just kind of the selection schedules the project timing when do you think you could start to see capital being layered into the capital plan on a more meaningful basis is this more of a 2024 2025 start to put steel in the ground david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah rob thanks for that question just to clarify yeah there is no money in our existing capital plan related to those miso projects we don t put something on top of our current existing plan in there so the question around timing is a good one because it s really hard to tell there s who knows which projects are going to come out first in this first tranche there might be some that are upgrades there might be some that are maybe a little bit easier like transmission interconnection that s a different process that ferc is going through but that can fall in the next several years because those are a little bit easier to do than some of the long term transmission projects that are obviously going to be a big chunk of this tranche and the next tranches so i would say the majority of that expenditure is going to be late in this five year plan to mostly i would say past the 2026 timeframe that s in our five year plan so with a little luck we get the easy ones on the front end here and we can lay that in to boost up the current capital plan but i would say the biggest impact is going to be on the later years of the five year plan and the extension from year 6 on rob hope scotiabank analyst all right that s helpful and then just pivoting over to another large transmission project lake erie connector it looks like it s getting through some of the gates here in ontario where are you in discussions with the government is kind of the key terms been broadly discovered or can you maybe just give us an update on the process there david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah it s broad terms term sheets the principals have been laid out it s now getting to the details and finalizing all of those pieces so that was part of the update that the ieso gave the government in december they came back and said this all looks reasonable now finish the negotiations and work toward that tsa and bring us back another update in the end of march and so these are all positive step by step movements that we re making on getting to a final agreement and then of course once we get to that final agreement we get it we agree with the ieso the ieso brings it to the ontario government everybody signs it and then we start the process or continue the process of designing getting the epc contractor and start construction so it s feeling obviously the best we ve ever felt on this project and just a couple of steps a couple of signatures away from really getting this thing moving which is a real testament to the time that our team at itc has put in on this project to make it a go this one has been talked about for a while and we know it s difficult well it s a cross border project it s got two iesos on each end that you got to connect between pjm and ontario so lots of details but the harder the project size the more fun in there when you actually get to put them into service and we re looking forward to getting those last couple of steps done as quickly as we can rob hope scotiabank analyst i appreciate the color thank you david hutchens president and chief executive officer yup operator your next question is from mark jarvi with cibc capital markets mark jarvi cibc capital markets analyst thanks good morning everyone a couple of questions on alberta one would be around the potential move to a formula if you guys could comment on that in terms of want to see your openness to that and then second on the cost of service rebasing just expectations in terms of what the parameters are in terms of maybe like ability to keep earnings flat to up because i remember last time around sometimes we saw flat or down earnings after that rebasing can you give some color on both those items david hutchens president and chief executive officer sure i ll talk about the first one and then turn the cost of service rebasing over to janine to get some direct insight janine sullivan is the ceo of fortisalberta on the potential formula this is one of those things where it all depends right it all depends on how the formula is set whether it takes in to account the right risks and that are specific to your utility if it s flexible enough to adapt to the changing energy environment that we re all going to see over the next few years and obviously extending further than that so we re going to work hard if it is a formula type rate we want to make sure that it works for us it s like any regulatory mechanism it all depends on the details in the end so i think we could be supportive of either way as long as it provided the right ability for us to get the return on the investments that we make and for the growth opportunities that we see and the participation frankly that we want to have in that clean energy transition in alberta janine i ll turn it over to you to talk about the cost of service rebasing janine sullivan chief executive officer of fortisalberta sure so the cost of service rebasing is ongoing we are in the midst of it it is an important opportunity for fortisalberta in terms of rebasing our revenues and costs after almost a decade of pbr based regulation so we are optimistic that the process will provide visibility of the current costs that fortisalberta is incurring and what we foresee happening into the future and as dave indicated some of the newer projects that need to be addressed as part of a clean energy future and having those address as part of the revenue requirement which would then provide a strong starting point for going into a third term of pbr and of course that will be determined over the next 12 months as to what that third term will look like in terms of specific mechanisms with respect to cost of capital there is a desire to become prospective or more prospective at least in alberta around such matters and so it s very early days with respect to setting cost of capital for 2024 with the formula so the focus right now is really on determining what should happen in 2023 there is early indications that it likely hold the current parameters just given that desirable prospectivity and a difficulty in terms of readdressing it in the short term for anything new for 2023 but then really setting the foundation for more deliberate conversation around what it should look like in 2024 and beyond and the possibility of a formula but still very very early days mark jarvi cibc capital markets analyst and just coming back to the rebasing when you look at sort of where you are and what your stance is now in terms of your submissions it is the thought that your sort of achievable roe can be held flat through that process janine sullivan chief executive officer of fortisalberta we are optimistic that this rebasing will provide a solid starting point for 2023 in terms of a full realignment of our revenues and our costs i mean there are some concerns in the province around affordability and that dynamic between investing for the future and clean energy programs and how we do so in a thoughtful and affordable way is certainly for us to demonstrate but we believe we have a very good plan going forward that does both and i think that we ll be in a good position starting in 2023 mark jarvi cibc capital markets analyst ok and jocelyn a question for you just in terms of the drip and just updated thoughts on the discount in terms of usage of the drip now or a pivot back to the atm where you have a bit more control on sort of when shares are issued sort of updated thoughts on that jocelyn perry executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so mark we actually put the drip in a couple of years we turned it off and then we put the discount back on and it s a pretty effective way of getting the equity we need and so it does provide us with some flexibility the uptake is back up to over 35 again so pretty healthy participation we evaluate it every year right now it s working for us it has given us the equity that we need we don t need any discrete equity the atm program in my opinion worked as well it s just a different way of getting it but i think the drip is an easy effective cost effective way of getting the equity that we need because we understand our growth profile should with all the opportunities that dave is talking about change our capital program in any meaningful way we ll revisit funding on every level so but for right now the drip is working for us mark jarvi cibc capital markets analyst ok thanks operator your next question is from david quezada with raymond james david quezada raymond james analyst thanks good morning everyone my first question here just on bc relates to the tilbury site and any or the planned expansions there as well just curious how you re thinking today about the infrastructure in that region and the floods that we saw over the past year i understand that the regulator is undergoing some kind of review process just any color you can provide there david hutchens president and chief executive officer yes i ll turn it over to roger here to get all the details particularly around the tank that we re proposing because i think that s a real important project for the bcuc to consider from a resiliency perspective as we have now seen in the past several years some hiccups i ll call on enbridge s system one back in i guess it was winter 2018 and then of course the one recently with the flood it makes us makes it more important for us to look for resiliency projects down in the lower mainland in the vancouver area and one of those projects as you know is the big new lng tank that we have a big three bcf tank that we have proposed that s going to be really important to providing that resiliency in that back up i ll turn it to roger to tell you where we re at from the application perspective with the bcuc and the ea process roger dall antonia so yes on the tilbury tank there s two processes underway one is with the bcuc we re mid process on that cpcn answering information requests from intervenors that process will continue for the better part of the year before we get to conclusion in addition because of the size of the tank we have to file and obtain environmental assessment certificate from both bc and canada we re on track with that process we filed the detailed project description last year we received a readiness decision and expect to go to public comment q1 of this year the impact assessment agency of canada did agree to write a substitution so the bc ea will lead the process and that will continue for the better part of 2022 before we figure out what the next steps are in that environmental assessment david quezada raymond james analyst ok great thank you for that and roger maybe a follow up for you it feels as though with news headlines lately there s been some increased momentum for the use of rng in marine bunkering and i know you guys have made really good progress on procurement of rng in the bc at fortisbc just curious if you think you could ultimately depending on the extent of rng for usage in the marine end market could you potentially get to more than a 15 mix in bc on the rng side roger dall antonia yes i think there are two distinct questions there the marine market i think rng eventually will end up there we did have that pilot project with seaspan where we ran low carbon for their barge ferries i think there is a similar pilot down in florida last year as well so i think the marine market is looking at lng and if it can come from renewable gases all the better it s already got a significant advantage over marine fuels like diesel so i think that will be an added benefit so we see that as an additive support for increasing lng in marine market i think generally our rng development we received approval from the bc government last year to go to 15 of our resource or gas supply coming from rng including hydrogen we just recently signed 8 petajoules deal still needs regulatory approval but we expect to get that this year we re about 18 petajoules which is just over halfway to our 2030 target of 15 so we believe we can go beyond that for sure over time and that doesn t include the adoption of hydrogen so we see a growing amount of renewable gases in our system going forward david quezada raymond james analyst excellent i really appreciate the color roger that s it for me operator your next question is from matthew weekes with ia capital markets matthew weekes ia capital markets analyst good morning thanks for taking my questions i think they ve mostly been answered at this point but i think i ll just ask on the macro and rate cases in terms of rate cases that are ongoing right now or that you re planning on doing in the near future how do you expect the outlook for rising interest rates to impact those proceedings and are you pursuing any creative measures to maybe address the rising rates over the couple of years or anything like that david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah matthew a great question because the rising rates can help or hurt obviously from an inflation perspective and cost of doing business that s going to put some upward pressure on the cost that we incur and depending on which jurisdiction we re talking about across our footprint some of those have very direct pass through mechanisms to customers like itc and now tep s transmission down in arizona has that same pass through mechanism so there isn t really an impact because it s on a forward basis and then trued up as well other jurisdictions like alberta and bc have inflation in part of their calculations for cost escalation and then the one bigger jurisdiction that doesn t have it is tep s non ferc assets or their retail rates which would be subject to some regulatory lag between obviously when you see that inflation and when you actually get those costs and that inflation reflected in rates so it s a bit of a mishmash across the utility but no huge impact from a company perspective now of course this all has impacts to our customers raising their costs across the board whether it s things from normal inflation in products and services to natural gas prices etc so we are very laser focused on making sure that we are doing everything we can from a cost perspective throughout the rest of the utility to reduce the impact on our customers now on the other side of things roes are obviously track that rising rate and it s obviously not a direct correlation sometimes it lags down sometimes it lags up but the general hypothesis here is in rising rate environment roes rise and so we would expect to see that over time increase the return that we would get on our equity and of course that s why these proceedings on generic cost of capital etc and rate cases are important to get that reset and reflected matthew weekes ia capital markets analyst ok thank you appreciate the answer on that that s everything from me i ll turn it back david hutchens president and chief executive officer thanks matthew operator your next question is from patrick kenny with national bank patrick kenny national bank analyst yeah good morning just a follow up on your 100 rng initiative in bc and i was just curious if you see any opportunities to implement this newbuild renewable energy source offering across some of your electric utility platforms and how that might be able to accelerate your overall 75 reduction target by 2035 david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah first off what a great program that fortisbc that team came up with it s making it s getting everyone to recognize the role that natural gas companies and their infrastructure can play in delivering the cleaner energy future we talk about it a lot on how you can green up electrons on the transmission and distribution side but we need to be talking more about how you can green up and clean up the molecules that you send through your pipe whether it s through renewable natural gas and gas hydrogen whatever it is that shows that we re part of that solution so that s a great solution for fortisbc it could be in our other we have small gas companies in arizona and new york that could also look at programs like that and utilities like arizona where we have a vertically integrated utility we do offer some green power programs for our customers already so those things can and of course you got to be looking at more and more opportunities to do that to create the customers option to go a little bit faster than perhaps we were going from a portfoliowide perspective of course our goal is to if you if we execute on our integrated resource plan in arizona our customers in 2035 70 actually about right around 2032 about 70 of the energy that we provide will be renewable energy so people forget how much we re really doing behind the scenes and increase in that volume but still there s customers who want to have like me myself at my home in arizona have 100 renewable energy tariff where my energy comes 100 from renewables and we have that obviously for across the board in arizona patrick kenny national bank analyst excellent thanks for that and then maybe just a high level question david on the portfolio in general in light of the rising rate environment and the potential here to add some additional larger scale growth within your larger core utilities i know you ve always seen the benefits of diversification but it s now the time to weigh the option of perhaps divesting of one or two of your smaller utilities simply to beef up liquidity ahead of some of these larger scale projects david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah not really a priority for us i mean i think the utilities that we have we don t we re not blind to market drivers and value and opportunities etc but i think that we run every single one of our utilities within our model the best they can be run and we will continue to improve each one of those utilities on a going forward basis and improve the growth of each so i don t someone would have to see some weird outsized value because to create value in one of our subsidiaries or one of our pieces of our portfolio above and beyond what we can i think that s a it s a high hurdle but we ll pay attention but definitely not something that we re looking at in the near term patrick kenny national bank analyst ok that s great thank you very much david hutchens president and chief executive officer thanks patrick operator your next question is from dariusz lozny with bank of america dariusz lozny bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good morning and thank you for taking my question just wanted to hopefully get a quick update on the cardinal hickory creek project i realize it s not a significant part of your long term capex plan but there have been some hurdles there and i was just curious if you could provide an update and potential timeframe for next steps and the part two of that question would be given the experience of bringing that project along thus far does that inform your approach at all to potentially further down the line additional projects in the miso footprint david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah thanks dariusz for that question you get full points for getting into the details because that s in the details and i m going to pass that that s so far in the detail i m going to pass it to obviously our expert on this linda apsey from itc linda apsey president and chief executive officer itc holdings corp great thanks dave and thanks dariusz for the question yes i think to keep in mind i mean no doubt certainly there s multiple legal proceedings around cardinal hickory creek but i think just to kind of put it in perspective the litigation all revolves around essentially what is 1 5 miles basically 150 mile project and that litigation so far has not ceased construction on the project we continue to construct the projects both in iowa and in wisconsin with our partners on the project who are about a 45 owner of that project and so it s a partnership project with both american transmission company and dairyland power so despite i would say some headlines complexity of sort of the litigation and multiple lawsuits it really is a minimal portion of the project the concession and we continue to pursue our construction activities and quite frankly i think we feel pretty confident that we ll continue to realize that project given the need for the project this is a project that was identified over 10 years ago with an mvp project through miso and certainly the need the benefits for customers just have continued to grow so i think we feel pretty confident that the project will be realized and it has not stopped our construction activities at all and then i think in regards to the sorry i know you had the second question just in terms of does it alter how we think about the future lrtp projects no look i mean i think generally i think just from a broad perspective certainly litigation environmental opposition to energy projects in general is certainly growing but i think when we step back when you look at the primary drivers of all of these lrtp or regional transmission projects the primary driver is to interconnect and deliver green energy to customers and ultimately when you i think you layer on the additional benefits of any transmission project economic benefits reliability benefits when you look at the analysis and study process that the rto goes through when they assess these projects there is no doubt i mean all of these projects have to pass cost benefit calculations and there is an immense amount of detail around the benefits of any of these projects so i think we feel pretty comfortable and confident that ultimately when you have a need based project typically the projects prevail but certainly depending on the location of a project maybe the sensitivity of certain geographies all of those things need to be considered and particularly considered and how we think about the timing of construction approval and obviously putting those projects into operation but i don t think we see this as any type of sign of the future that s different than what we ve been dealing with i think at itc we have a great track record of citing transmission projects and we work very very closely with all of our local communities our states our landowners we take all of those things into consideration on the front end and so i think we feel pretty confident in our ability to continue to realize transmission projects that come out of the lrtp effort dariusz lozny bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent thank you very much and i appreciate the detail in that response if i could just ask one more quickly this is pivoting over to the q4 adjusted drivers i noticed as part of the central hudson 0 03 drag related to nonrecoverable costs you referenced performance targets is there any way you could elaborate on that just in brief what those targets were and perhaps was isolated to q4 or something you d see maybe potentially being ongoing david hutchens president and chief executive officer yeah let me send that over to charlie he s got the color on that charlie freni who s the ceo of central hudson charlie freni chief executive officer central hudson thanks dave so we have within all of our rate agreements performance metrics which we need to meet and those performance metrics if they aren t met do result in penalties associated with missing those and so two targets that were related to reliability that we missed were frequency of outages and duration of outages and those are all outages that are nonstorm related outages so it s kind of on a day to day basis i mean those provisions have been in our rate cases for many years and they are continue to be part of our rate structure going forward i certainly believe that last year was an unusual year and i wouldn t expect that we would exceed those targets going forward dariusz lozny bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok great thank you very much i ll pass it along here david hutchens president and chief executive officer
