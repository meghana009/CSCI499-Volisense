unemployment high for a year in order to get back to 2 god bless them if they do but i wouldn t bet on it said blitz who is chief u s economist at the macroeconomic research firm he said the inflation

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video economists say it s way too soon to know for sure if the worst bout of inflation in four decades has possibly peaked washington consumers struggling with skyrocketing prices for food gas autos and rent got a tantalizing hint of relief last month when prices didn t budge at all from june after 25 straight months of increases with gas prices continuing to fall inflation is probably slowing further this month so has the worst bout of inflation in four decades possibly peaked economists say it s too soon to know for sure even if it has peaked it will likely remain high well into next year since inflation ignited early last year it has temporarily slowed before only to re accelerate in later months when that happened last fall federal reserve chair jerome powell was forced to jettison his description of higher prices as being merely transitory and to acknowledge that high inflation was proving to be chronic even if some prices should keep declining others housing costs for example are almost sure to remain painfully high and that means there s likely still a long way to go before inflation will get anywhere close to the 2 annual pace that the fed has targeted and that americans were long accustomed to on wednesday the government reported that consumer inflation jumped 8 5 in july from 12 months earlier that was an unexpectedly sharp slowdown from the 9 1 year over year inflation rate in june which was the largest in four decades but it was still quite high so called core prices which exclude the volatile food and energy categories to produce a better picture of underlying inflation also rose more slowly they increased 0 3 from june to july less than the 0 7 rise from may to june over the past 12 months core prices rose 5 9 the same as in june here are some questions and answers about inflation where is inflation headed that s hard to say because there are multiple signs pointing in both directions in addition to the ongoing drops in gas prices the cost of groceries a huge driver of inflation for the past year could soon rise much more slowly futures prices for dairy chicken and eggs have been falling in recent weeks according to capital economics a forecasting firm and costs for such farm commodities as wheat corn and soybeans are also well off their springtime peaks many supply chain snarls are loosening with fewer ships moored off southern california ports and shipping costs declining that should help reduce the cost of furniture cars and other goods prices for appliances are already falling in addition americans expectations for future inflation fell last month according to a survey by the federal reserve bank of new york likely reflecting the drop in gas prices that is highly visible to most consumers inflation expectations can be self fulfilling if people believe inflation will stay high or worsen they re likely to take steps such as demanding higher pay that can send prices higher in a self perpetuating cycle but the new york fed survey found that americans foresee lower inflation in future years than they did a month ago are there signs inflation could stay high plenty inflation is a byproduct of broad economic trends too much money chasing too few goods in the classic economic view not merely whether individual industries are struck by supply shortages or other problems one trend that may be keeping fed officials up at night is that companies are still hiring workers at a voracious pace and are willing to pay more to find the people they need in the april june quarter employees wages and salaries excluding government workers jumped 1 6 matching a two decade high that was reached last fall businesses typically pass on at least some of their higher labor costs to their customers in the form of higher prices but if workers become more productive if they use more technology say or a company streamlines operations a business can pay more and make up for the higher costs through greater efficiency rather than through higher prices for customers unfortunately for the first half of this year the opposite has happened productivity has tumbled and wages adjusted for declining efficiency have been growing at double digit levels economists say that means further pay increases would have to be passed on to consumers through higher prices and those price increases would fuel continued high inflation this is way above anything we ve seen since the high inflation of the early 1980s said peter hooper head of economic research at deutsche bank securities referring to labor costs the danger here is that you re entering into a wage price spiral that increasing wage costs are pushing up prices further and making it that much more difficult to actually bring down inflation to a more desirable level what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a severe recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed short term interest rates suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others assigned a greater blame to supply shortages and some argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets how are higher prices affecting consumers it s hitting most people pretty hard even if they have received pay raises on average weekly paychecks adjusted for inflation fell 3 6 in july compared with a year ago for

economists say it s way too soon to know for sure if the worst bout of inflation in four decades has possibly peaked some prices are almost sure to remain painfully example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington consumers struggling with skyrocketing prices for food gas autos and rent got a tantalizing hint of relief last month when prices didn t budge at all from june after 25 straight months of increases with gas prices continuing to fall inflation is probably slowing further this month so has the worst bout of inflation in four decades possibly peaked economists say it s too soon to know for sure even if it has peaked it will likely remain high well into next year since inflation ignited early last year it has temporarily slowed before only to re accelerate in later months when that happened last fall federal reserve chair jerome powell was forced to jettison his description of higher prices as being merely transitory and to acknowledge that high inflation was proving to be chronic even if some prices should keep declining others housing costs for example are almost sure to remain painfully high and that means there s likely still a long way to go before inflation will get anywhere close to the 2 annual pace that the fed has targeted and that americans were long accustomed to on wednesday the government reported that consumer inflation jumped 8 5 in july from 12 months earlier that was an unexpectedly sharp slowdown from the 9 1 year over year inflation rate in june which was the largest in four decades but it was still quite high so called core prices which exclude the volatile food and energy categories to produce a better picture of underlying inflation also rose more slowly they increased 0 3 from june to july less than the 0 7 rise from may to june over the past 12 months core prices rose 5 9 the same as in june here are some questions and answers about inflation where is inflation headed that s hard to say because there are multiple signs pointing in both directions in addition to the ongoing drops in gas prices the cost of groceries a huge driver of inflation for the past year could soon rise much more slowly futures prices for dairy chicken and eggs have been falling in recent weeks according to capital economics a forecasting firm and costs for such farm commodities as wheat corn and soybeans are also well off their springtime peaks many supply chain snarls are loosening with fewer ships moored off southern california ports and shipping costs declining that should help reduce the cost of furniture cars and other goods prices for appliances are already falling in addition americans expectations for future inflation fell last month according to a survey by the federal reserve bank of new york likely reflecting the drop in gas prices that is highly visible to most consumers inflation expectations can be self fulfilling if people believe inflation will stay high or worsen they re likely to take steps such as demanding higher pay that can send prices higher in a self perpetuating cycle but the new york fed survey found that americans foresee lower inflation in future years than they did a month ago are there signs inflation could stay high plenty inflation is a byproduct of broad economic trends too much money chasing too few goods in the classic economic view not merely whether individual industries are struck by supply shortages or other problems one trend that may be keeping fed officials up at night is that companies are still hiring workers at a voracious pace and are willing to pay more to find the people they need in the april june quarter employees wages and salaries excluding government workers jumped 1 6 matching a two decade high that was reached last fall businesses typically pass on at least some of their higher labor costs to their customers in the form of higher prices but if workers become more productive if they use more technology say or a company streamlines operations a business can pay more and make up for the higher costs through greater efficiency rather than through higher prices for customers unfortunately for the first half of this year the opposite has happened productivity has tumbled and wages adjusted for declining efficiency have been growing at double digit levels economists say that means further pay increases would have to be passed on to consumers through higher prices and those price increases would fuel continued high inflation this is way above anything we ve seen since the high inflation of the early 1980s said peter hooper head of economic research at deutsche bank securities referring to labor costs the danger here is that you re entering into a wage price spiral that increasing wage costs are pushing up prices further and making it that much more difficult to actually bring down inflation to a more desirable level what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a severe recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed short term interest rates suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others assigned a greater blame to supply shortages and some argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets how are higher prices affecting consumers it s hitting most people pretty hard even if they have received pay raises on average weekly paychecks adjusted for inflation fell 3 6 in july compared with a year ago for lower income families economic research shows that the hit is typically harder poorer americans are more likely to spend a greater proportion of their incomes on items that have increased the most in price in the past 18 months food gas and rent there are also subtler differences that can make inflation harder for

prescribed by ifrs therefore these terms as used by viq may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers investors are cautioned that ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net income loss as determined in accordance with ifrs the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with ifrs non ifrs measures are used by management to provide additional insight into our performance and financial condition we believe non ifrs measures are an important part of the financial reporting process and are useful in communicating information that complements and supplements the consolidated financial statements this news release also includes certain measures which have not been prepared in accordance with ifrs such as adjusted ebitda and bookings to evaluate the company s operating performance as a complement to results provided in accordance with ifrs the term ebitda refers to net income loss before adjusting earnings for depreciation amortization interest expense and current and deferred income tax expense the term adjusted ebitda refers to net income loss before adjusting earnings for stock based

goodwill and intangibles other expense income foreign exchange gain loss and current and deferred income tax expense we believe that the items excluded from ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not connected to and do not represent the operating performance of the company the term bookings refers to the annualized estimated monthly value of our recurring client contracts entered into during the period from i new clients and ii net upgrades by existing clients within the same workload plus the actual not annualized estimated value of professional services consulting advisory or project based orders received during the period recurring client contracts are any contracts entered into on a multi year or month to month basis but excluding any professional services contracts for consulting advisory or project based work we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful supplemental information as it provides an indication of the results generated by the company s main business activities prior to taking into consideration how those activities are financed and taxed as well as expenses related to stock based compensation depreciation amortization impairment of goodwill and intangibles other expense income and foreign exchange gain loss accordingly we believe that this measure may also be useful to investors in enhancing their understanding of the company s operating performance we believe that bookings is useful supplemental information as it measures the amount of new business generated in a period which we believe is an important indicator of new client acquisition and our ability to cross sell new services to existing clients while we believe bookings in combination with other metrics is an indicator of our near term future revenue opportunity it is not intended to be used as a projection of future revenue our calculation of bookings may differ from similarly titled metrics presented by other companies for a reconciliation and or calculation of adjusted ebitda and

there are two schools of thought with regard to the marriage of prince charles and princess diana the first is that he was a villain who married an innocent young girl as a kind of royal broodmare while planning to continue his clandestine relationship with camilla parker bowles the second is that diana was a self indulgent grandstanding showboat a bad partner with no sense of propriety and little respect for the institution she d married into the princess a new hbo documentary premiering saturday aug 13 leans heavily in the first direction if any footage was available of charles scowling or otherwise looking unpleasant director ed perkins included it but as with the best documentaries there s enough here for viewers to form another conclusion altogether a third school of thought that combines the other two charles was awful but so was diana that is he was immoral but she was insufferable this new documentary comes at the diana story from a new angle it doesn t attempt to get inside her head but rather presents her entire public life through a combination of news reports chat show comments and amateur videos from the general public the amateur videos are particularly eerie the documentary opens with brits in paris who notice a crowd outside a hotel they re wondering what celebrity might be inside but they are too busy taking pictures of each other to catch diana getting into her limousine with dodi al fayed princess diana the woman behind the camera says in an almost mocking tone with no idea that she s witnessing the last moments of a woman s life another home video moment is from later that night and features a group of american men playing cards with the tv on one turns to the camera and says that diana has allegedly been gravely injured he treats the whole thing like a joke until word comes in that she has died and then the room goes still sometimes it takes nothing short of death for people to realize that a famous person is actually human there s a lot to digest in the princess we see the extent to which diana was a prisoner of the paparazzi if she had lunch on a terrace with friends a swarm of photographers was less than 100 feet away it was a ridiculous unbearable life and one wonders how long this could have gone on diana would be 61 if she were alive today would they still be out there or is this variety of torment the exclusive privilege of young attractive women the charles and diana story is told from the point that the press became aware of their courtship and what s amazingly clear in hindsight is the extent to which these two people had no business getting married just watching them together is an uncomfortable experience he s frosty and she s needy he s older and smarter and she is young and dim but not quite dim enough her uneasy intuition makes her prickly and paranoid watching them we know without a doubt that these people are going to hate each other but no it s even worse they probably should hate each other the movie captures something that we missed on this side of the atlantic the british public s obsession with diana was unrelenting every move she made became occasion for analysis most of it idiotic on the endless string of talk shows they have over there the british are famously rational and hard headed but when it comes to the royal family they re pretty much insane what a royal mess and the princess conveys it no wonder one of her sons became the ultimate company man while the other seems like a genial basket case who can barely tie his own shoes imagine growing up in this cauldron with a flighty tormented mother and a bunch of stuffed shirts who act like they were embalmed at birth imagine having a ringside seat for this epic 20th century disaster m the princess documentary directed by ed perkins tv 14 109 minutes premiering 8 p m saturday aug 13 on hbo and hbo max

was 1 7 million compared to 16 2 million in q2 2021 the change in net income was mainly driven by lower sales at san jose of 20 7 million due to declining silver prices and corresponding negative concentrate sales adjustments and lower production additional items impacting the quarter were a 4 0 million write down of low grade stockpile inventory at yaramoko and higher g a expenses the increase in g a was related to 1 2 million of non recurrent items and higher expenses associated with the roxgold acquisition other items contained in net income were a foreign exchange loss of 3 1

million in q2 2021 sales by mine in the three months ended june 30 2022 were as follows lindero recognized adjusted sales of 57 2 million from 30 546 ounces of gold ounces sold a 68 increase from the same period in 2021 higher gold sales were the result of increased performance at the three stage crushing and stacking facility yaramoko recognized adjusted sales of 45 9 million from 24 598 ounces of gold sold san jose recognized adjusted sales of 39 6 million a 34 decrease from the 60 3 million reported in the same period in 2021 lower sales were driven by a 13 decrease in the volume of silver and 16 decrease in the volume of gold ounces sold which was driven by lower mined grades and lower realized silver prices caylloma recognized adjusted sales of 25 2 million a 3 decrease from the 26 0 million reported in the same period in 2021 the decrease in sales was the result of lower realized prices for silver as well as a decline in gold production which is in line with plan outlook on cost and inflation inflationary pressures continued in the second quarter of 2022 as a result of geopolitical events supply chain constraints and increases in the cost of energy and commodities these inflationary pressures were realized in the company s cost structure as prices increased for several key consumables including diesel reagents explosives and steel the impact of inflation has been the most pronounced at the lindero mine the inflation situation remains dynamic and the company expects higher input costs to remain for the second half of the year and beyond to mitigate inflationary pressure on its cost structure the company will continue to focus on operational efficiencies and cost optimization across all mining operations however even with these efforts it is expected the continued cost pressure will push the san jose and lindero mines towards the upper end of our cost guidance yaramoko s all in sustaining cost for the year is expected to be at the upper end of guidance as a result of additional capital development to provide earlier access than planned to the qv prime zone at bagassi south the production benefit of access to qv prime will be in 2023 and 2024 as activities through the second half of 2022 will focus primarily on development to the ore body and preparation for mining caylloma remains on track to achieve cost guidance liquidity total liquidity available to the company as at june 30 2022 was 136 1 million the company s 200 0 million revolving credit facility was fully available as at the end of june 2022 and 20 0 million remained

operations for the three months ended june 30 2022 was 21 9 million compared to 19 2 million in q2 2021 the increase was driven by positive changes in working capital and lower taxes paid compared to q2 2021 construction and exploration expenses at s√©gu√©la were 25 3 million for q2 2022 and 68 1 million year to date lindero mine argentina three months ended june 30 six months ended june 30 2022

impact on production experienced at the beginning of 2022 has been greatly mitigated by strong production in the second quarter in the second quarter of 2022 a total of 1 502 074 tonnes of ore were placed on the heap leach pad averaging 0 74 g t gold containing an estimated 35 784 ounces of gold gold production for q2 2022 totaled 29 016 ounces representing a 49 increase year over year higher gold production is explained by an increase in performance of the three stage crushing and stacking circuits which delivered 99 of the 1 5 million tonnes of ore placed on the pad in the quarter compared to 46 or 0 7 million tonnes of the 1 47 million tonnes placed in the comparable quarter a year ago mine production was 2 2 million tonnes of mineralized material with a strip ratio of 1 1 the operation experienced a positive reconciliation for ore sent to the leach pad during the second quarter with grades sampled at the plant being 17 higher than estimated from the reserve model as part of the continuous measures to improve productivity management has implemented various high impact optimization initiatives to capture efficiencies at both the processing plant and the mining operation some of which were implemented during the second quarter these initiatives include the optimization of cyanide recovery at the sart plant to significantly reduce fresh make up cyanide consumption lowering the consumption of sulfuric acid at the sart plant whilst maintaining its efficiency rate and copper balance and optimizing the mining strategy by implementing additional temporary ramps to significantly decrease trucking distance improve truck productivity and ultimately reduce trucking hours and total fleet diesel consumption supporting the company s carbon footprint reduction strategy cash cost per gold ounce sold was 687 for q2 2022 compared to 644 in the second quarter of 2021 cash costs per ounce of gold was higher due to higher consumable prices mainly related to diesel explosives cyanide and cement higher service costs related to equipment rentals and higher labor costs due to foreign exchange and inflation this was partially offset by the higher volume of gold sold all in sustaining cash costs per gold ounce sold was 1 151 during q2 2022 compared with 1 168 in the second quarter of 2021 all in sustaining costs for the second quarter of 2022 were impacted by the

washington reuters slowing us inflation may allow federal reserve policymakers to downshift their most aggressive round of monetary policy tightening in decades when they meet next month though data on tap in the coming weeks could still change the picture after a us labour department report on wednesday aug 10 showed that consumer prices did not rise at all in july compared with june traders of futures tied to the fed s benchmark interest rate slashed bets that the central bank would enact a third straight 75 basis point hike at its sept 20 to 21 policy meeting and instead would opt for a half point increase but fed policymakers left no doubt that they will continue to tighten monetary policy until price pressures are fully broken the fed is far far away from declaring victory on inflation minneapolis federal reserve bank president neel kashkari said at the aspen ideas conference despite the welcome news in the consumer price index cpi report mr kashkari said he has not seen anything that changes the need to raise the fed s policy rate to 3 9 per cent by year end and to 4 4 per cent by the end of 2023 the rate is currently in the 2 25 per cent to 2 5 per cent range mr kashkari is to be sure the fed s most hawkish member most of his 18 colleagues believe a little less policy tightening may be enough to do the trick to bring prices under better control calling inflation unacceptably high chicago fed president charles evans said he believes the fed will likely need to lift its policy rate to 3 25 per cent to 3 5 per cent this year and to 3 75 per cent to 4 per cent by the end of next year in line with what fed chair jerome powell signalled after the fed s latest meeting in july still he said the cpi report marks the first positive reading on inflation since the fed began raising interest rates in march in increasing increments a quarter of a percentage point to start then half a point and then three quarters of a percentage point in both june and july traders now expect increases in the fed s policy interest rate to top out in december at 3 25 per cent to 3 5 per cent united states stock markets took a similar cue on the hope for a less aggressive central bank with the s p 500 rallying 2 1 per cent on wednesday whether those hopes are warranted will be clearer in the coming weeks for the fed to scale back subsequent inflation data will need to confirm the idea that price increases are slowing the cpi rose 8 5 per cent in july from a year earlier wednesday s report showed while that marked a drop from june s 9 1 per cent rate prices are still rising at levels not seen since the high inflation era of the 1970s and early 1980s food prices in july were up 11 per cent from the year before devastating for lower income families in particular for the moment however analysts focused on the fact that after months in which accelerating price pressures pushed fed policymakers to tighten credit conditions faster than at any time since the 1980s inflation data finally surprised in the other direction
lower prices offer americans slight reprieve from inflation washington ap falling prices for gas airline tickets and clothes gave americans a little bit of relief last month though overall inflation is still running at close to its highest level in four decades consumer prices jumped 8 5 in july compared with a year earlier the government said wednesday down from a 9 1 year over year increase in june on a monthly basis prices were unchanged from june to july the first time that has happened after 25 months of increases but the reprieve offered no certainty that prices would stay on the decline inflation has slowed in the recent past only to re accelerate in subsequent months and even if price increases continue to weaken they are a long way from the fed s 2 annual target there s good reason to think inflation will continue to slow said michael pugliese an economist at wells fargo what i think gets lost in that discussion is slow by how much even if it were to fall to 4 less than half its current level pugliese suggested that the federal reserve would need to keep raising interest rates or at least keep them high much of the relief last month was felt by travelers hotel room costs fell 2 7 from june to july airfares nearly 8 and rental car prices a whopping 9 5 those price drops followed steep increases in the past year after covid 19 cases eased and travel rebounded airfares are still nearly 30 higher than they were a year ago gas prices dropped from 5 a gallon on average in mid june to 4 20 by the end of last month and were just 4 01 on wednesday according to aaa oil prices have also fallen and cheaper gas will likely pull down inflation this month as well economists said last month s declines in travel related prices helped lower core inflation a measure that excludes the volatile food and energy categories and provides a clearer picture of underlying price trends core prices rose just 0 3 from june the smallest month to month increase since march compared with a year ago core inflation amounted to 5 9 in july the same year over year increase as in june all told the july figures raised hope that inflation may have peaked after more than a year of relentless increases that have strained household finances soured americans on the economy led the federal reserve to raise borrowing rates aggressively and diminished president joe biden s public approval ratings biden highlighted the flat monthly inflation figure i just want to say a number zero he told reporters wednesday today we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of july americans are still absorbing bigger price increases than they have in decades grocery prices jumped 1 1 in july and are 13 higher than a year ago the largest year over year increase since 1979 bread prices leaped 2 8 last month the most in more than two years rental and medical care costs rose though slightly less than in previous months a strong job market and healthy wage increases have encouraged more americans to move out on their own reducing the number of available apartments and pushing up rental costs wall street purchases of homes and trailer parks have also lifted monthly payments average paychecks are rising faster than they have in decades but not fast enough to keep up with inflation as a result some retirees have felt the need in recent months to return to the workforce among them is charla bulich who lives in san leandro california for the past six months bulich 73 has worked a few hours a week caring for an elderly woman because her social security and food stamps don t cover her rising costs i go over my budget all the time that s why i had to go get a job bulich said i wouldn t even think about buying hamburger meat or a steak or something like that now she worries that she will lose her food stamps in the coming months because of her extra income michael altfest director of community engagement at the alameda county community food bank in oakland said his organization now provides about 4 5 million pounds of food a month up from below 4 million in january the group has also budgeted for a 66 increase in fuel costs that s mostly because of higher gas prices but also because it s now using more trucks to keep up with the demand for food altfest s own rent recently jumped 14 he said forcing him to recalibrate his budget all these costs are going up all at once he said the people here were stretched already last month s modest slowdown in inflation might enable the fed to slow the pace of its increases in short term rates when it meets in late september a possibility that sent stock prices jumping how quickly and how far the fed raises borrowing costs has significant effects on the economy sharper hikes tend to reduce consumer and business borrowing and spending and make a recession more likely if the fed doesn t have to raise rates as high to restrain prices it has a better chance of engineering an elusive soft landing whereby growth slows enough to curb high inflation but not so much as to cause a recession still fed chair jerome powell has emphasized that the central bank needs to see a series of lower readings on core inflation before it will pause rate hikes the fed has boosted its short term rate by 2 25 percentage points in the past four meetings the fastest series of increases since the early 1980s biden has pointed to declining gas prices as a sign that his policies including large releases from the nation s strategic oil reserve are helping lessen the higher costs that have hurt household finances particularly for lower income americans and black and hispanic households republicans are stressing the persistence of high inflation as a top issue in the midterm congressional elections polls show that elevated prices have driven biden s approval ratings down sharply there are other signs that inflation may fade in coming months americans expectations for future inflation have fallen according to a survey by the federal reserve bank of new york likely reflecting the drop in gas prices that is highly visible to most consumers inflation expectations can be self fulfilling if people believe inflation will stay high or worsen they re likely to take steps such as demanding higher pay that can send prices higher in a self perpetuating cycle companies then often raise prices to offset higher their higher labor costs but the new york fed survey found that americans foresee lower inflation one three and five years from now than they did a month ago supply chain snarls are also loosening with fewer ships moored off southern california ports and shipping costs declining prices for commodities like corn wheat and copper have fallen steeply stubborn inflation isn t just a u s phenomenon prices have jumped in the united kingdom europe and in less developed nations such as argentina in the u k inflation soared 9 4 in june from a year earlier a four decade high in the 19 countries that use the euro currency it reached 8 9 in june compared with a year earlier the highest since record keeping for the euro began associated press writer zeke miller

adjusted ebitda as a key financial metric to evaluate adcore s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations adjusted ebitda excludes significant items that are non operating in nature in order to evaluate adcore s core operating performance against prior periods adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for net earnings overall change in cash or liquidity of the business as a whole management believes the use of adjusted ebitda allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the company and its subsidiary by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on adcore s results for a particular period management s method of determining non gaap financial measures is evaluated periodically and may differ from other companies methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies the following table reconciles the non ifrs measure to the most comparable ifrs measure for the three months ended june 30 2022 and 2021 this measure does not have any standardized meaning

adcore s results during the second quarter which can be sent in advance to use of non ifrs measures management uses adjusted earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda as a key financial metric to evaluate adcore s operating performance and for planning and forecasting future business operations adjusted ebitda excludes significant items that are non operating in nature in order to evaluate adcore s core operating performance against prior periods adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for net earnings overall change in cash or liquidity of the business as a whole management believes the use of adjusted ebitda allows investors and analysts to understand the results of the continuing operations of the company and its subsidiary by excluding certain items that have a disproportionate impact on adcore s results for a particular period management s method of determining non gaap financial measures is evaluated periodically and may differ from other companies methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies the following table reconciles the non ifrs measure to the most comparable ifrs measure for the three months ended june 30 2022 and 2021 this measure does not have any standardized meaning

let s be clear sushi has never been nor will ever be a cheap food its quality is inextricably tied to price the more you pay the better the experience there is however a threshold at which your money stops paying for the sushi and starts paying for the atmosphere location and whether the chef has been on tv this list trims all unnecessary fat to reveal three of the most affordable orange county sushi restaurants where you can order omakase choose your meal from a menu or pluck it from a sushi conveyor belt not included are all you can eat sushi restaurants which exist and thrive but whose value proposition works only if you have a bottomless stomach and guiltless soul read on to find the best sushi meals without getting into deep sushi debt inside kaigen where chefs prepare sushi for customers at the orange eatery on tustin street edwin goei advertisement most affordable omakase kaigen 1736 n tustin st orange when you say omakase at a sushi bar it gives your itamae sushi chef a blank check to give you a multicourse sushi meal with the best he has to offer the average rate at sushi noguchi in yorba linda one of the best places for omakase is 70 to 150 per person a reasonable rate considering the chef s skills the quality of the fish and the quantity of food nobu in newport beach charges between 150 to 200 per person at ootoro in irvine omakase will set you back 300 to 500 per person the omakase plate from kaigen a sushi eatery on tustin street in orange edwin goei by comparison kaigen s 39 sushi omakase for a nine piece nigiri one hand roll a bowl of miso soup and salad is an anomaly not only is it on the lower end of the price spectrum for omakase in today s inflationary times it would ve been considered cheap 10 years ago kaigen s chefs slice good quality fish but just as important is the rice which is prepared perfectly not mushy not dry exactly the right consistency it doesn t fall apart on your chopsticks yet melts in your mouth a bowl of miso soup at kaigen in orange edwin goei as with all omakase what you will be served will vary from visit to visit but there will likely be thick cuts of scallops sprinkled with black pepper and the coveted piece of fatty tuna belly called toro all pieces will be dolloped with a topping or dosed with a sinus clearing amount of wasabi to get the most of kaigen s omakase it is best to sit at the sushi bar in front of a chef not at the tables not only will the nigiri come out at a prescribed pace prolonging the enjoyment there is a better chance that your itamae might slip in an extra piece at no additional charge even though it opened in 2016 kaigen is presently enjoying a boost in popularity on instagram where its 39 omakase price caught the attention of local influencers who descend upon this strip mall eatery to document it on their own social media feeds it still however exists in relative obscurity waits longer than 15 minutes are uncommon an empty bar is the norm at eat s sushi in costa mesa the eatery has some of the best bargains on sushi in orange county writes restaurant critic edwin goei edwin goei most affordable for ordering from the menu eat s sushi 1175 baker st e25 costa mesa though eat s sushi has a bar counter no one sits there this isn t the kind of sushi joint where you can toast a cup of warm sake or build a rapport with your sushi chefs instead you will be seated at a table or booth surveying the picture menu and then marking your order on a sheet of paper what you see pictured in the photographs is what you get on your plate there are no surprises here except for the prices which are at bargain rates salmon skin rolls at eat s sushi in costa mesa edwin goei since it opened late last year eat s sushi is out to build customer loyalty the service is obsequious but the prices are quite possibly the most affordable in o c for a non conveyor belt sushi restaurant a four piece california roll currently stands at under 5 other four piece rolls range from 5 75 to 7 an amazing four piece jumbo scallop sashimi plate with truffle oil and yuzu is offered at 8 but the real deals lie in their nigiri which starts at 1 75 a piece for morsels that fetch higher costs at comparable restaurants the madai is topped with a pinch of yuzukosho a paste made from yuzu and chilies the unagi is burnt with a caramelized edge and the bay scallops are creamy a yelp check in even entitles you to a free can of soda salmon skin salad at eat s sushi in costa mesa edwin goei don t ignore the cooked foods though the tempura and fried soft shell crab are rushed to your table crispy hot and greaseless if you order a salmon skin salad you get a big bowl of greens with crunchy pickled carrots cucumbers and shards of salmon skin that affirm it s the best crouton ever invented salmon collar the boomerang shaped piece from near the gills with meat as soft as whipped cream is broiled delicately and served with a ponzu sauce amped up with chili twenty five dollars per person is all you need to budget to have a filling meal here but be warned with the prices and the dizzying selection of japanese dishes eat s sushi even offers ramen and udon it is far too easy to overorder the conveyor belt delivers affordable sushi options at kaisen in santa ana edwin goei most affordable revolving sushi kaisen 3855 s bristol st santa ana many conveyor belt sushi restaurants have come and gone in orange county over the past decade but after more than 15 years kaisen still brings in its loyalists who might remember that once upon a time its cheapest plate cost 99 cents though those days are gone the lowest priced nigiri plate is still 1 25 while its higher tiers tick at 4 50 this may explain kaisen s longevity and enduring appeal the value if you re still unfamiliar with the concept of conveyor belt sushi picture sitting in front of a miniature baggage carousel while plates of sushi ride by in plastic domes you see something you like you take it and at the end a server comes by to tally up your stacks of color coded empty plates to get your total oysters are among the offers one can order at kaisen in santa ana edwin goei all told since each nigiri plate comes with two pieces you can feast on potentially 24 pieces of sushi after having only spent 15 for comparison at kura in irvine arguably the most popular conveyor belt sushi in o c at present all plates are 3 35 more than double kaisen s price for its lowest tier and though kaisen isn t as popular as kura where the wait can exceed three hours there s always a constant flow of diners to ensure turnover of the stock you should not however limit yourself to what s pre prepared for the conveyor belt pick up an order sheet scribble your table number on top and order the live oysters the salmon skin hand roll and the scallop nigiri a plate of nigiri at kaisen a sushi eatery in santa ana edwin goei if there s anything that s changed over the years other than the plastic sheets that now separate the booths and the sushi chefs it s that the conveyor belt offerings tend to lean on salmon and california roll based pieces you may never see the delicate anago nigiri or fish roe sushi

for a secure energy supply has led to a structurally tight global commodity complex while ongoing volatility is expected in global economies and commodity prices enerflex is strategically positioned

focused on expanding its gross margins while profitably investing in energy infrastructure to grow its recurring revenue profile recurring revenue from enerflex s energy infrastructure and service product lines continues to stabilize the company s cash flows and recent growth in engineered systems bookings and backlog should continue to improve the company s financial position enerflex continues to actively manage supply chain and inflationary pressures across its regions and will continue to do so through the balance of 2022 most inflationary pressures experienced to date pertain to the availability of materials and escalating operating expenses the company continues to be strategic in its inventory planning based on the bid pipeline working closely with customers to mitigate significant cost exposures and delivery delays financial results revenue the company s revenue increased by 15 to 372 million compared to first quarter 2022 revenue of 323 million the increase in

million or 17 1 up 10 million from first quarter 2022 gross margin of 54 million the positive trend in gross margin is primarily due to the increased volume of work in the quarter the gross margins for service and engineered systems product lines improved increasing to 15 4 and 10 0 respectively as margins for the two product lines continue to trend positively towards pre pandemic levels the gross margin for the energy infrastructure product line was relatively unchanged at 39 4 reflecting the stability of the revenue and cost profiles associated with the company s long term build own operate maintain solutions infrastructure leases and contract compression solutions net earnings enerflex recognized net earnings of 13 million or 0 15 per share during the second quarter of 2022

compensation expenses adjusted ebitda during the second quarter of 2022 enerflex delivered an adjusted ebitda of 45 million compared to 39 million in the first quarter of 2022 an expanding gross

measures the company reports its financial results in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles or gaap however management believes that in order to understand the company s short term and long term financial and operational trends investors may wish to consider the impact of certain non cash or non recurring items when used as a supplement to financial performance measures in accordance with gaap these items result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and or impact on continuing operations management also uses results of operations before such items to evaluate the operating performance of the company and compare it against past periods make operating decisions and serve as a basis for strategic planning these non gaap financial measures provide management with additional means to understand and evaluate the operating results and trends in the company s ongoing business by eliminating certain non cash expenses and other items that management believes might otherwise make comparisons of the company s ongoing business with prior periods more difficult obscure trends in ongoing operations or reduce management s ability to make useful forecasts management believes that these non gaap financial measures provide additional means of evaluating period over period operating performance in addition management understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the company s financial and operational performance and comparing this performance to its peers and competitors management defines non gaap adjusted ebitda as the sum of gaap net loss before provisions for interest expense other income stock based compensation expense depreciation and amortization tax expense severance gain on sale of assets loss on disposal of assets acquisition and litigation related expenses management considers this non gaap financial measure to be an indicator of the company s operational strength and performance of its business and a good measure of its historical operating trends in particular the extent to which ongoing operations impact the company s overall financial performance the non gaap financial measures do not replace the presentation of the company s gaap financial results and should only be used as a supplement to not as a substitute for the company s financial results presented in accordance with gaap the company has provided a reconciliation of each non gaap financial measure used in its financial reporting and investor presentations to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure management excludes each of the items identified below from the applicable non gaap financial measure referenced above for the reasons set forth with respect to that excluded item interest expense the company excludes interest expense which includes interest from the facility agreement interest on capital leases and interest on the convertible debentures from its non gaap adjusted ebitda calculation stock based compensation expense excluded as these are non cash expenses that management does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing the performance of the company s business and also because the total amount of expense is partially outside of the company s control as it is based on factors such as stock price volatility and interest rates which may be unrelated to our performance during the period in which the expense is incurred amortization and depreciation purchased assets and intangibles are amortized over a period of several years and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after they are acquired accordingly these non cash items are not considered by management in making operating decisions and management believes that such expenses do not have a direct correlation to future business operations thus including such charges does not accurately reflect the performance of the company s ongoing operations for the period in which such charges are incurred loss on fair value of convertible debentures the company excludes this non cash item as it is not considered by management in making operating decisions and management believes that such item does not have a direct correlation to future business operations litigation related these expenses consist primarily of settlement legal and other professional fees related to litigation the company excludes these costs from its non gaap measures primarily because the company believes that these costs have no direct correlation to the core operations of the company loss on extinguishment of debt the company excludes this non cash item as it is not considered by management in making operating decisions and management believes that such item does not have a direct correlation to future business operations on occasion in the future there may be other items such as loss on extinguishment of debt significant asset impairments restructuring charges or significant gains or losses from contingencies that the company may exclude if it believes that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors and management

was 1 7 million compared to 16 2 million in q2 2021 the change in net income was mainly driven by lower sales at san jose of 20 7 million due to declining silver prices and corresponding negative concentrate sales adjustments and lower production additional items impacting the quarter were a 4 0 million write down of low grade stockpile inventory at yaramoko and higher g a expenses the increase in g a was related to 1 2 million of non recurrent items and higher expenses associated with the roxgold acquisition other items contained in net income were a foreign exchange loss of 3 1

million in q2 2021 sales by mine in the three months ended june 30 2022 were as follows lindero recognized adjusted sales of 57 2 million from 30 546 ounces of gold ounces sold a 68 increase from the same period in 2021 higher gold sales were the result of increased performance at the three stage crushing and stacking facility yaramoko recognized adjusted sales of 45 9 million from 24 598 ounces of gold sold san jose recognized adjusted sales of 39 6 million a 34 decrease from the 60 3 million reported in the same period in 2021 lower sales were driven by a 13 decrease in the volume of silver and 16 decrease in the volume of gold ounces sold which was driven by lower mined grades and lower realized silver prices caylloma recognized adjusted sales of 25 2 million a 3 decrease from the 26 0 million reported in the same period in 2021 the decrease in sales was the result of lower realized prices for silver as well as a decline in gold production which is in line with plan outlook on cost and inflation inflationary pressures continued in the second quarter of 2022 as a result of geopolitical events supply chain constraints and increases in the cost of energy and commodities these inflationary pressures were realized in the company s cost structure as prices increased for several key consumables including diesel reagents explosives and steel the impact of inflation has been the most pronounced at the lindero mine the inflation situation remains dynamic and the company expects higher input costs to remain for the second half of the year and beyond to mitigate inflationary pressure on its cost structure the company will continue to focus on operational efficiencies and cost optimization across all mining operations however even with these efforts it is expected the continued cost pressure will push the san jose and lindero mines towards the upper end of our cost guidance yaramoko s all in sustaining cost for the year is expected to be at the upper end of guidance as a result of additional capital development to provide earlier access than planned to the qv prime zone at bagassi south the production benefit of access to qv prime will be in 2023 and 2024 as activities through the second half of 2022 will focus primarily on development to the ore body and preparation for mining caylloma remains on track to achieve cost guidance liquidity total

operations for the three months ended june 30 2022 was 21 9 million compared to 19 2 million in q2 2021 the increase was driven by positive changes in working capital and lower taxes paid compared to

impact on production experienced at the beginning of 2022 has been greatly mitigated by strong production in the second quarter in the second quarter of 2022 a total of 1 502 074 tonnes of ore were placed on the heap leach pad averaging 0 74 g t gold containing an estimated 35 784 ounces of gold gold production for q2 2022 totaled 29 016 ounces representing a 49 increase year over year higher gold production is explained by an increase in performance of the three stage crushing and stacking circuits which delivered 99 of the 1 5 million tonnes of ore placed on the pad in the quarter compared to 46 or 0 7 million tonnes of the 1 47 million tonnes placed in the comparable quarter a year ago mine production was 2 2 million tonnes of mineralized material with a strip ratio of 1 1 the operation experienced a positive reconciliation for ore sent to the leach pad during the second quarter with grades sampled at the plant being 17 higher than estimated from the reserve model as part of the continuous measures to improve productivity management has implemented various high impact optimization initiatives to capture efficiencies at both the processing plant and the mining operation some of which were implemented during the second quarter these initiatives include the optimization of cyanide recovery at the sart plant to significantly reduce fresh make up cyanide consumption lowering the consumption of sulfuric acid at the sart plant whilst maintaining its efficiency rate and copper balance and optimizing the mining strategy by implementing additional temporary ramps to significantly decrease trucking distance improve truck productivity and ultimately reduce trucking hours and total fleet diesel consumption supporting the company s carbon footprint reduction strategy cash cost per gold ounce sold was 687 for q2 2022 compared to 644 in the second quarter of 2021 cash costs per ounce of gold was higher due to higher consumable prices mainly related to diesel explosives cyanide and cement higher service costs related to equipment rentals and higher labor costs due to foreign exchange and inflation this was partially offset by the higher volume of gold sold all in sustaining cash costs per gold ounce sold was 1 151 during q2 2022 compared with 1 168 in the second quarter of 2021 all in sustaining costs for the second quarter of 2022 were impacted by the production issues described above and offset by lower sustaining capital related to timing effects sustaining capital for the quarter primarily consisted of spending on leach pad expansion and mine

lower prices offer americans slight reprieve from inflation morry gash ap washington falling prices for gas airline tickets and clothes gave americans a little bit of relief last month though overall inflation is still running at close to its highest level in four decades consumer prices jumped 8 5 in july compared with a year earlier the government said wednesday down from a 9 1 year over year increase in june on a monthly basis prices were unchanged from june to july the first time that has happened after 25 months of increases the report offered welcome news for congressional democrats and president joe biden heading into the midterm elections biden highlighted the flat monthly inflation figure i just want to say a number zero he told reporters today we received news that our economy had zero percent inflation in the month of july republicans who have made inflation a top campaign issue stressed that prices are still painfully high texas gop rep kevin brady highlighted grocery costs and said americans continue to struggle under president biden s cruel economy with shrinking paychecks a shrinking economy and a shrinking workforce the reprieve offered no certainty that prices would stay on the decline inflation has slowed in the recent past only to re accelerate in subsequent months and even if price increases continue to weaken they are a long way from the fed s 2 annual target there s good reason to think inflation will continue to slow said michael pugliese an economist at wells fargo what i think gets lost in that discussion is slow by how much even if it were to fall to 4 less than half its current level pugliese suggested that the federal reserve would need to keep raising interest rates or at least keep them high much of the relief last month was felt by travelers hotel room costs fell 2 7 from june to july airfares nearly 8 and rental car prices a whopping 9 5 those price drops followed steep increases in the past year after covid 19 cases eased and travel rebounded airfares are still nearly 30 higher than they were a year ago gas prices dropped from 5 a gallon on average in mid june to 4 20 by the end of last month and were just 4 01 on wednesday according to aaa oil prices have also fallen and cheaper gas will likely pull down inflation this month as well economists said last month s declines in travel related prices helped lower core inflation a measure that excludes the volatile food and energy categories and provides a clearer picture of underlying price trends core prices rose just 0 3 from june the smallest month to month increase since march compared with a year ago core inflation amounted to 5 9 in july the same year over year increase as in june all told the july figures raised hope that inflation may have peaked after more than a year of relentless increases that have strained household finances soured americans on the economy led the federal reserve to raise borrowing rates aggressively and diminished president joe biden s public approval ratings americans are still absorbing bigger price increases than they have in decades grocery prices jumped 1 1 in july and are 13 higher than a year ago the largest year over year increase since 1979 bread prices leaped 2 8 last month the most in more than two years rental and medical care costs rose though slightly less than in previous months a strong job market and healthy wage increases have encouraged more americans to move out on their own reducing the number of available apartments and pushing up rental costs wall street purchases of homes and trailer parks have also lifted monthly payments average paychecks are rising faster than they have in decades but not fast enough to keep up with inflation as a result some retirees have felt the need in recent months to return to the workforce among them is charla bulich who lives in san leandro california for the past six months bulich 73 has worked a few hours a week caring for an elderly woman because her social security and food stamps don t cover her rising costs i go over my budget all the time that s why i had to go get a job bulich said i wouldn t even think about buying hamburger meat or a steak or something like that now she worries that she will lose her food stamps in the coming months because of her extra income michael altfest director of community engagement at the alameda county community food bank in oakland said his organization now provides about 4 5 million pounds of food a month up from below 4 million in january the group has also budgeted for a 66 increase in fuel costs that s mostly because of higher gas prices but also because it s now using more trucks to keep up with the demand for food altfest s own rent recently jumped 14 he said forcing him to recalibrate his budget all these costs are going up all at once he said the people here were stretched already last month s modest slowdown in inflation might enable the fed to slow the pace of its increases in short term rates when it meets in late september a possibility that sent stock prices jumping how quickly and how far the fed raises borrowing costs has significant effects on the economy sharper hikes tend to reduce consumer and business borrowing and spending and make a recession more likely if the fed doesn t have to raise rates as high to restrain prices it has a better chance of engineering an elusive soft landing whereby growth slows enough to curb high inflation but not so much as to cause a recession still fed chair jerome powell has emphasized that the central bank needs to see a series of lower readings on core inflation before it will pause rate hikes the fed has boosted its short term rate by 2 25 percentage points in the past four meetings the fastest series of increases since the early 1980s biden has pointed to declining gas prices as a sign that his policies including large releases from the nation s strategic oil reserve are helping lessen the higher costs that have hurt household finances particularly for lower income americans and black and hispanic households there are other signs that inflation may fade in coming months americans expectations for future inflation have fallen according to a survey by the federal reserve bank of new york likely reflecting the drop in gas prices that is highly visible to most consumers inflation expectations can be self fulfilling if people believe inflation will stay high or worsen they re likely to take steps such as demanding higher pay that can send prices higher in a self perpetuating cycle companies then often raise prices to offset higher their higher labor costs but the new york fed survey found that americans foresee lower inflation one three and five years from now than they did a month ago supply chain snarls are also loosening with fewer ships moored off southern california ports and shipping costs declining prices for commodities like corn wheat and copper have fallen steeply stubborn inflation isn t just a u s phenomenon prices have jumped in the united kingdom europe and in less developed nations such as argentina in the u k inflation soared 9 4 in june from a year earlier a four decade high in the 19 countries that use the euro currency it reached 8 9 in june compared with a year earlier the highest since record keeping for the euro began ___ associated press writer zeke

maturity date of july 12 2025 second quarter 2022 overview the second quarter of 2022 was a record for step delivering the best financial results in the company s history both the canadian and u s geographic regions experienced strong demand for services generating 273 0 million of revenue and 38 1 million of net income a significant improvement on a sequential and year over year basis the company also generated 55 3 million in adjusted ebitda and 33 2 million in free cash flow in the quarter also higher on a sequential and year over year basis second quarter activity levels experienced the typical bifurcation between canada and the northern u s regions that are affected by seasonal spring break up break up conditions and the southern u s region which is not affected by break up according to the baker hughes rig count the canadian land rig count averaged 115 in q2 2022 down 40 sequentially due to break up but up 62 on a year over year basis the u s land rig count averaged 704 rigs in q2 2022 up 11 sequentially and 61 on a year over year basis in line with the lower rig count utilization canada and the northern u s experienced periods of low utilization from mid april to mid may with some areas experiencing more pronounced break up conditions strategic positioning with clients that had large multi well pads provided step s canadian and u s fracturing service lines with highly efficient operations through the second quarter with canadian results bolstered by several clients moving work from the third quarter into the second quarter to capitalize on high commodity prices the company pumped 697 thousand tonnes of sand across 279 operating days in canada and 229 operating days in the us utilization was up year over year in both regions although canada was down sequentially due to break up the coiled tubing division was more affected by break up conditions in canada and the northern u s region and had sequentially lower utilization declining 17 from q1 coiled tubing had 371 operating days in canada and 542 operating days in the u s pricing remained largely steady relative to the first quarter of 2022 in canada and continued to improve on a pad by pad basis in the u s with additional margin earned in the u s from the supply of proppant and chemicals for a higher proportion of our clients inflation continued to advance through the second quarter of 2022 with the effect most pronounced on proppant step was successful in passing these cost escalations through to its clients during the second quarter of 2022 net income of 38 1 million was affected by several notable items in the second quarter of 2022 in response to the strong year to date financial performance and the more constructive outlook the company reversed approximately 32 7 million of the general impairment of the canadian cash generating units cgu taken in the first quarter of 2020 step s total share based compensation expense was 9 5 million of which 8 9 million was for cash settled share based compensation reflecting the nearly 67 increase in the company s share price in the second quarter the company also accelerated depreciation expense in the second quarter of 2022 on certain assets as a result of changes in technology and operating conditions the strong financial results generated basic and diluted net income per share of 0 557 and 0 535 respectively in the second quarter of 2022 compared to a net income per share basic and diluted of 0 135 and 0 132 respectively in the prior quarter and a net loss per share basic and diluted of 0 156 in the prior same period of the prior year the company continued to focus on strengthening the balance sheet through the second quarter of 2022 working capital increased to 54 4 million from 52 8 million recorded at march 31 2022 net debt was reduced to 194 2 million at june 30 2022 from 214 3 million at march 31 2022 impacted slightly by slower collection of trade receivables at the end of the second quarter of 2022 the company had a funded debt to adjusted bank ebitda of 1 54 1 under the limit of 3 00 1 and remained in compliance with all other financial and nonfinancial covenants as at june 30 2022 subsequent to the end of the second quarter 2022 step amended and extended its credit agreement the amended and restated agreement provides step with more flexibility in managing its capital structure by converting the term loan facility into a revolving credit facility and provides longer term stability through an extension to july 2025 outlook step anticipates that the current strength in oil and natural gas prices will continue through the balance of the year and into 2023 the risk of near term volatility in the financial markets will continue to exist while concerns over recession persist but the fundamentals of the physical oil market continue to remain strong with industry reports showing that oil supply is expected to remain constrained through 2023 the dislocation between the financial markets and the physical market is supported by step s clients who have not messaged any pullback in their activity as a result of near term price volatility natural gas prices are expected to remain robust into 2023 buoyed by a geopolitical risk premium and storage levels that are at the low end of the five year averages the company has a constructive view on the second half of the year with utilization expected to stay steady the third quarter of 2022 has had a softer start allowing for maintenance work to be completed on equipment that was worked intensively through the second quarter of 2022 but activity is increasing as the quarter progresses the company anticipates that fracturing activity in the third quarter will see a higher proportion of annular fracturing and single well work relative to the second quarter of 2022 this shift in job mix is anticipated to keep utilization high although at margins that are modestly lower than those driven by the large multi well pads that step completed in the second quarter of 2022 due to reduced efficiencies there is improving visibility into the fourth quarter of 2022 and the company expects that clients will remain active through the fourth quarter and early client discussions are trending favourably towards adding to 2022 budgets to complete additional wells before year end as concerns continue to mount around equipment availability in 2023 the first half of 2022 saw pricing respond to the inflationary pressures and tightness in supply the company expects the rate of change to be lower in the second half of 2022 particularly in canada as competitors signal that more capacity is coming to the market however step believes the canadian pumping market is close to balance and does not anticipate bringing additional equipment to the market in 2022 until full cycle returns are achievable pricing in the u s is anticipated to increase through the balance of the year as the major market participants all signal that their fleets are sold out for the remainder of the year the outlook for 2023 is looking increasingly constructive rig count forecasts for 2023 are expected to increase over 2022 levels and the call on pressure pumping is anticipated to rise with it the industry may need to bring some capacity to market in 2023 to meet demand particularly in canada if the treaty negotiations with the blueberry river first nation are resolved in a manner that reopens their territory to continued development step believes that supply will remain tight as much of the idled capacity in the industry will likely require significant investment to move from parked to active status reactivations may be further complicated by the ongoing supply chain and labour constraints that are expected to persist into 2023 the company believes publicly traded service providers are also mindful of the fundamentals of profitability and free cash flow following the lead of the e p companies that are focused on deleveraging their balance sheets and delivering returns to shareholders step s focus for the balance of 2022 and into 2023 is on generation of free cash flow the strong results posted in the second

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video economists say it s way too soon to know for sure if the worst bout of inflation in four decades has possibly peaked some prices are almost sure to remain painfully washington consumers struggling with skyrocketing prices for food gas autos and rent got a tantalizing hint of relief last month when prices didn t budge at all from june after 25 straight months of increases with gas prices continuing to fall inflation is probably slowing further this month so has the worst bout of inflation in four decades possibly peaked economists say it s too soon to know for sure even if it has peaked it will likely remain high well into next year since inflation ignited early last year it has temporarily slowed before only to re accelerate in later months when that happened last fall federal reserve chair jerome powell was forced to jettison his description of higher prices as being merely transitory and to acknowledge that high inflation was proving to be chronic even if some prices should keep declining others housing costs for example are almost sure to remain painfully high and that means there s likely still a long way to go before inflation will get anywhere close to the 2 annual pace that the fed has targeted and that americans were long accustomed to on wednesday the government reported that consumer inflation jumped 8 5 in july from 12 months earlier that was an unexpectedly sharp slowdown from the 9 1 year over year inflation rate in june which was the largest in four decades but it was still quite high so called core prices which exclude the volatile food and energy categories to produce a better picture of underlying inflation also rose more slowly they increased 0 3 from june to july less than the 0 7 rise from may to june over the past 12 months core prices rose 5 9 the same as in june here are some questions and answers about inflation where is inflation headed that s hard to say because there are multiple signs pointing in both directions in addition to the ongoing drops in gas prices the cost of groceries a huge driver of inflation for the past year could soon rise much more slowly futures prices for dairy chicken and eggs have been falling in recent weeks according to capital economics a forecasting firm and costs for such farm commodities as wheat corn and soybeans are also well off their springtime peaks many supply chain snarls are loosening with fewer ships moored off southern california ports and shipping costs declining that should help reduce the cost of furniture cars and other goods prices for appliances are already falling in addition americans expectations for future inflation fell last month according to a survey by the federal reserve bank of new york likely reflecting the drop in gas prices that is highly visible to most consumers inflation expectations can be self fulfilling if people believe inflation will stay high or worsen they re likely to take steps such as demanding higher pay that can send prices higher in a self perpetuating cycle but the new york fed survey found that americans foresee lower inflation in future years than they did a month ago are there signs inflation could stay high plenty inflation is a byproduct of broad economic trends too much money chasing too few goods in the classic economic view not merely whether individual industries are struck by supply shortages or other problems one trend that may be keeping fed officials up at night is that companies are still hiring workers at a voracious pace and are willing to pay more to find the people they need in the april june quarter employees wages and salaries excluding government workers jumped 1 6 matching a two decade high that was reached last fall businesses typically pass on at least some of their higher labor costs to their customers in the form of higher prices but if workers become more productive if they use more technology say or a company streamlines operations a business can pay more and make up for the higher costs through greater efficiency rather than through higher prices for customers unfortunately for the first half of this year the opposite has happened productivity has tumbled and wages adjusted for declining efficiency have been growing at double digit levels economists say that means further pay increases would have to be passed on to consumers through higher prices and those price increases would fuel continued high inflation this is way above anything we ve seen since the high inflation of the early 1980s said peter hooper head of economic research at deutsche bank securities referring to labor costs the danger here is that you re entering into a wage price spiral that increasing wage costs are pushing up prices further and making it that much more difficult to actually bring down inflation to a more desirable level what s caused the spike in inflation good news mostly when the pandemic paralyzed the economy in the spring of 2020 and lockdowns kicked in businesses closed or cut hours and consumers stayed home as a health precaution employers slashed a breathtaking 22 million jobs everyone braced for more misery companies cut investment and postponed restocking a severe recession ensued but instead of sinking into a prolonged downturn the economy staged an unexpectedly rousing recovery fueled by vast infusions of government aid and emergency intervention by the fed which slashed short term interest rates suddenly businesses had to scramble to meet demand they couldn t hire fast enough to fill job openings or buy enough supplies to meet customer orders as business roared back ports and freight yards couldn t handle the traffic global supply chains seized up with demand up and supplies down costs jumped and companies found that they could pass along those higher costs in the form of higher prices to consumers many of whom had managed to pile up savings during the pandemic critics blamed in part president joe biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package with its 1 400 checks to most households for overheating an economy that was already sizzling on its own many others assigned a greater blame to supply shortages and some argued that the fed kept rates near zero far too long lending fuel to runaway spending and inflated prices in stocks homes and other assets how are higher prices affecting consumers it s hitting most people pretty hard even if they have received pay raises on average weekly paychecks adjusted for inflation fell 3 6 in july compared with a year ago for lower income families economic research shows that the hit is typically harder poorer americans are more likely to spend a greater proportion of their incomes on items that have increased the most in price in the past 18 months food gas and rent there are also subtler differences that can make inflation harder for those earning less many people can t afford the kind of bulk purchases of groceries that can help higher income households economize paola becerra 40 who lives in stamford connecticut has started to miss doctor s appointments to use the money instead for groceries or gas

tis a fearful thing to love what death can touch for your life has lived in me your laugh once lifted me your word was gift to me to remember this brings painful joy tis a human thing love a holy thing to love what death has touched rabbi chaim stern our beloved neighbor and treasured friend duncan henderson recently passed away from pancreatic cancer his memorial was held at the broad theater in santa monica this past sunday funerals and memorials can often be sad affairs leaving participants with grief loss and regrets while losing duncan is tragic beyond words to describe still this memorial left us motivated upbeat and oh so happy to have known duncan shining a spotlight on duncan s remarkable family and singularly spectacular career duncan s memorial left all attendees with a renewed commitment to live our best lives do our best work to stand up for what s good and to intensely love those around us getting pumped up from a memorial oh yes duncan lived that kind of a bigger than life life his story is that of a boundless self determined life that was as impressive in accomplishments as duncan would often say lucky indeed duncan would often respond to how are you doing with the answer i m feeling lucky i was born lucky i m lucky today and i ll be lucky tomorrow duncan s trademark quip reflects both his confidence in his abilities as well as his self aware humility to know he d been blessed through his life unabashed optimism blended with opportunity and unlimited work ethic drove duncan to achieve great things most can never even imagine his memorial not only celebrated his life per se but also celebrated the art and habit of living life well duncan s life exemplified a life lived very well a socal native duncan attended public schools culminating in his attending ucla where he led the crew team to two west coast championships after graduating duncan continued to usc earning an advanced business degree thereafter duncan worked as a stockbroker for a period when either an itch or an epiphany drove him to pursue a more rewarding career in hollywood filmmaking jumping from stocks to major motion picture producer might seem too wide a chasm for most everyone but it was a challenge duncan confidently took on the legacy of his hollywood achievements led to duncan receiving the frank capra lifetime achievement award from the directors guild of america duncan had just returned from a long stay in south america producing his last motion picture when he received the unfortunate diagnosis of advanced pancreatic cancer duncan was a young 72 full of vitality with new offers always on the table through his long hollywood career duncan rose through the ranks to produce some of america s most favorite movies harry potter dead poets society master and commander and an a list of others that could fill this page duncan would tell us during talks on the driveway or by the mailbox or at an occasional couples dinner about much of the silliness and politics of hollywood none of which he suffered or tolerated duncan was cut and dry about right and wrong he was consummately ethical and loyal and his unique commitment to high personal principles made him an esteemed producer to keep movies on time on budget crafted to highest standards his work took him and often his whole family to points throughout the globe to iceland with tom cruise to the galapagos islands with russell crowe to filming mice with gina davis in stuart little and to that famous fight scene where rocky battled that threateningly dangerous russian duncan got to see experience and create experiences the rest of us can only hope to imagine all this success might have knocked lesser individuals off their values and principles not so with duncan a straighter arrow perhaps never flew duncan and his wife michelle became neighbors across the driveway 33 years ago despite fame duncan never moved from the home where he raised his kids never needed glitz and self aggrandizement instead of vanity duncan was known both on and off the set simply as that tall guy with the suspenders he had his own signature look slacks button collared shirt and suspenders fun but all business when business was on characteristically direct about five months ago duncan stopped carrie and i by the sidewalk as we pulled out of our driveway with teary eyes he approached us and explained his cancer diagnosis he was stoic and well understood the implications of his disease but he wasn t there to burden us with his problems instead in duncan fashion he straightforwardly shared his appreciation for our neighborhood for us being neighbors and friends and especially that our kids were able to grow up together so tightly duncan knew he had lived a blessed and full life a life very much of his own effort and doing yet also blessed so much by those who loved and cared for him at the memorial his oldest daughter shared that even late into the disease duncan said he had no regrets and no resentment for having fallen to cancer instead duncan used his last four months to more closely bond with and love his family and he also lived long enough to meet his new grandson also duncan i m the luckiest man on earth shared duncan before his passing a motivational memorial absolutely duncan has everyone there wanting to live better do better and to find joy and meaning in the unknown time we have remaining the unknown time we have remaining we will all leave legacies of the lives we ve lived duncan henderson s legacy is astonishingly incredible and motivational hearing more of his life made me want to make more of mine to do better be better and to live more meaningfully thank you duncan you were an amazing man from the first time we met and your influence will

inflation seems to be slowing down after the recent report from the labor department but prices remain incredibly high compared to this time last year after months and months of record breaking spikes in the cost of living better than anticipated numbers sent the stock market soaring the good news in today s report mainly comes from a drop in gas prices and while this month s rate is a bit better than economists expected there s still a long way to go today s quick start podcast biden s zero inflation claim trump s surging odds in 2024 i came here because the prices are a lot cheaper than other places and it s going to be going down a lot more too said one california driver looking for relief not only are gas prices dropping but this month s inflation report also points to lower costs for new and used cars travel and clothing still inflation remains a big concern up a whopping 8 5 in july compared to a year ago although the biden administration is trying to paint a rosy picture today we received news that our economy had zero inflation in the month of july zero percent president biden said here s what that means the price of some things went up last month while the price of other things went down by the same amount the result zero inflation but people are still hurting biden s touting the zero percent number deals with what s known as core inflation one of several lenses used to view the economy that figure ignores food and energy prices which can often be more volatile mark hamrick sr an economic analyst with bankrate doesn t agree with biden s take on the inflation numbers politicians do politics what we do is economic analysis here he told cbn news if you look at the year over year increases the consumer price index is up 8 5 on the headline level not the 9 1 we saw last month hamrick said the core rate excluding food and energy is up 5 9 from last year so we re coming down in these headline numbers but we re not at zero with respect to where we are a year to date or over the past year food prices are still up big time hamrick points out in fact they re still reaching highs not seen since the 1970s the bill at a restaurant rose 0 7 over last month and grocery store prices rose 1 3 eggs alone jumped 47 after months of turmoil the best economic news remains in the labor market i think the good news we ve had on the job market meaning we are still hiring a lot of people and the unemployment rate matching the 50 year low and 3 5 hamrick said inflation may have peaked but we don t have full confirmation on that because we need several more months worth of data there s reason for hope but any sort of relief in our pocketbooks and bank accounts i think that s welcome news there s still another month s worth of data before the federal reserve s next policy meeting which is around the third week in september hamrick says they might look directionally good with hope coming from dropping gas prices which should permeate the food category next month please sign up for cbn newsletters and download the cbn news app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly christian perspective

study items and or possible votes on the agenda and talk to people in my district i will always vote with the greater good being at the heart and soul of my decisions but what defines the greater good can you cite an example of a recent policy or land use decision where something other than the greater good as you see it prevailed let s look at cell towers in the city it is something needed for safety and communication of the city there are those who are against it but the greater good is what is needed 4 cite three issues or concerns that in your view the city is addressing poorly or not at all and explain how you intend to convince the council to change course 1 communication 2 housing and 3 council image communication it has been said to me that people feel like talking to the council is like talking to five paintings i would work toward healing the communication between the citizens and the council at the meetings we need to improve our image housing the need for affordable housing is not being address there are counties and city forming task force to deal with it we need to look it this issue now the problem is all over and we will have to deal with at sooner or later council image we have to learn how to leave our ego at the door we are elected to work for the city not to fight and argue with each other get up and walk out or disrespect one another we are suppose to be about the business of the city needs not wants is an interesting concept and phenomenon i will make the decisions i need to again with the specific issues that come up on the agenda when elected that need to be voted upon to answer regarding two or three specific things right now simply whatever i feel is in the best interest of the people in the city of palm coast that doesn t give prospective voters much to work with you re not in other words giving us an idea either of your understanding of specific problem issues at or confronting the city do you consider the city to be perfectly run or how you d go about tackling them can you be more specific i think the city in running ok but can be better i feel that we need more follow through some things are taking to long like the splash park we need to deal with it before moving on to other thing again we need follow through 6 the city s budget like all local government budgets will likely face revenue shortfalls in an expected recession how will you make up the lost revenue where do you stand on property tax increases including adopting tax rates that are not at rollback which amounts to a tax increase under florida law short of new sources of revenue and if you intend to stick to a rolled back tax rate which nearly limits any growth in the budget what city programs would you eliminate and what service levels would you reduce to achieve that lost revenue right now can be made up by making the developers paying up front in order to continue this building boom at the very least also the increase in property values will add extra funds to the coffers of the city yet we must curtail our spending and learn to be thriftier with our city tax dollars i am not certain as to how people feel about elimination of programs or level of service so this will take a little time for me to decide upon make the developers pay what up front that they do not already pay if you are referring to impact fees the issue of up front payments or proportionate share mitigation applies only to school impact fees with which the city has nothing to do other than collection but all impact fees that the city does collect go to specific development projects not to the general fund how would you address a shortfall in the general fund the scenario you describe means that you support tax increases by way of keeping the property tax rate where it is to reap the benefits of increasing values is that the case would you increase the tax rate in the absence of improving values i don t want to raise taxes on residence but again we need to bring in businesses to improve out tax base regarding pickle ball tennis golf course and pools there is a total complete review that must be done on the basis of the people s needs and requests or needs not wants we must face the realities of the diversities within our city and the needs of everyone must be considered on equal comparative footings we must balance spending on the basis of use and actual needs for everyone versus the few with special interests would you have voted against the recent approval of the expanded regional racquet center into a community center focused amenity with a trailhead and an expanded tennis center with pickle ball courts no i believe it is a good idea for the citizen of palm coast something for the community 8 palm coast s population has grown over 30 percent in the past decade and a half a certain amount of nimbyism not in my back yard is a recurring theme of existing residents opposing further development and not just apartment complexes do existing residents have a right to close the development gates behind them when palm coast as itt envisioned it in the late 60s was planned for 600 000 residents how do you define overdevelopment and how do you define smart growth with existing examples in the city what percentage of our housing stock should be single family homes as opposed to apartments population growth and a long time food crisis made more immediate with all of the recent events pending on us and the world forces us and therefore we must seek out sincere compromise in these very areas percentages i cannot determine alone and would have to be evaluated by the council through professionals as to all the specifics regarding housing yes we do need affordable housing for our essential workers this is an obvious reality yes citizens also have a need and right to have a true voice in the further development of the city the numbers have been and are more and more astounding we have been growing exponentially too long overdevelopment and smart growth need to have more research and planning done in terms of where that actually stands here in this wonderful city of palm coast we must retain our natural environment trails parks bike paths natural trees fauna and our overall environment more closely and serve them with great stewardship more carefully waterways included of course in the very same sentence you say that overdevelopment needs more research while also referring to this wonderful city how do you square the two and isn t the stewardship you refer to what the the city s planning staff is providing through its analysis ahead of developments do property owners not have the right to develop land already slated for development are you supportive of council member eddie branquinho s automatic no votes against development i think we need to be careful of overdevelopment because of infrastructure water and traffic and i don t agree with eddie branquinho on housing we need more affordable housing real estate is up about 25 percent home ownership is becoming more difficult yet again for many due to inflation of the market and increased cost for loans and mortgage costs especially we must find a middle ground and again come to a compromise on how to proceed on this issue government is for all the people with the consent of the governed government is not for and by the few for power and developing their special interests this is what must change and must be heard in the city council general principles aside the question is specific to affordable housing apartments and density rules focusing on the latter two would there be any criteria by which you d reject apartments and do you support higher density rules including relaxed height restrictions to enable additional apartment complexes sims jones did not answer the question 10 palm coast s saltwater canals may need dredging it s never been done in the 50 year existence of the city and its itt antecedent but the canals like those recreational amenities mentioned above are limited to a few neighborhoods if and when it comes to that who should pay for the dredging and through what taxing mechanism the dredging of the salt water canals is a very sensitive issue for many reasons financially this will have to be done at a huge cost and there is also the environmental impact and so on and so forth the municipality certainly has responsibilities but i believe we really need to think out of the box on this in order to find an acceptable solution to taking care of this big problem with the canals and ultimately to all the citizens of palm coast bipartisanship is not dead and the city council needs to communicate better within the body itself and with all of its citizens 11 evaluate the managerial style and effectiveness of city manager denise bevan where does she shine how can she improve i choose to stay neutral on determining a rating of denise bevan since i am not able to ascertain my position at this time the question goes to your attendance at meetings and observations of the city manager in action or your meetings with her if you have had any can you assess ms bevan from that perspective my observation is that she is doing a good job and i have not seen anything bad concerning her the relationship for today and in the future relative to the sheriff s department needs to stay under constant review i do believe spending needs to be controlled the future population growth will determine if a private municipal police department might become reality if we do continue at the current numbers of people moving into palm coast then yes i see that as potentially occurring nevertheless planning strategy and execution will determine the outcome 13 have you

norwegian cruise line holdings ceo and president frank de rio has made it clear he is not interested in filling up ships if that will devalue his three brands the comment from the ceo of the third largest cruise company in the united states is a significant step away from what the competition has been doing recently focussing on creating a long term strategy of offering steady pricing and a competitive onboard environment is the way forward del rio said in his second quarter earnings call this is why guests sailing onboard nclh s ships will likely not be seeing discounted cruises while paying up to 20 more for a voyage compared to 2019 past experiences forming future strategy in the second quarter earnings call held yesterday norwegian cruise line holdings made it clear it will not be sacrificing profitability in the long term for a short term effect norwegian cruise line holdings has been sailing at around 65 occupancy levels but filling up the ships at all costs is not something the ceo will be considering frank del rio ceo and president of norwegian cruise line holdings i ve managed cruise companies in good times and in bad times and i am convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that you don t sacrifice the long term pricing power of your brand in order to achieve short term load factor gains i m not willing to mortgage the company for 10 plus years in order to window dress the next quarter s results i just won t do it we re here for the long term we re managing the business on a long term basis photo credit stepniak shutterstock com that long term plan means nclh and its three brands norwegian cruise line regent seven seas and oceania cruises will not be offering guests any discounted cruises to be able to bring occupancy levels to 100 that strategy could just be the right call to make looking back at events in the past during the financial crisis of 2009 cruise companies went all out to get people to sail the effects of those strategies took some companies more than ten years to recover from del rio i remind you what happened back in 08 and 09 when the great recession certain cruise companies did drop their prices to ridiculous levels and it took them in some cases 10 plus years and in some cases they ve not yet reached those pre great recession yields long term bookings looking stronger than ever for nclh looking at the long term the strategy that nclh is looking at seems to be the right call as long as the company can survive with lower occupancy rates in the near term del rio our guiding principle has been a focus on the long term profitability of the company particularly for 2023 and beyond by protecting our long term brand equity and building on our industry leading pricing this means making intentional tactical sacrifices in the short term in favor of long term sustainable results photo credit jhvephoto shutterstock bookings for 2023 are looking stronger than ever even with 20 more capacity across the fleet norwegian cruise line holdings is looking at a 40 increase in bookings for the coming year built up by the relaxing of covid 19 measures and the upcoming maiden voyage of norwegian prima with ships currently sailing at 65 increasing to 85 lately the 40 increase will mean that ships will be sailing full next year and nclh is making those bookings with prices that are 20 higher than they were in 2018 and 2019 de rio continued in the second quarter our load factor was approximately 65 in line with our expectations and a significant improvement versus the prior quarter of 48 we expect load factors to increase to the low 80 range in the third quarter with july already coming in at 85 this steady sequential ramp is expected to continue until we reach historical 100 plus levels beginning for the second quarter of 2023 what does it mean for those looking to book pricing strategies aside the fact of the matter remains that the financial markets are showing record inflation numbers a volatile currency exchange market and a fuel market that is reaching record highs photo credit darryl brooks shutterstock put all that together no matter what cruises will be more expensive the only thing that frank del rio is saying is that his company will not be lowering prices to get more guests onboard companies that lower pricing forfeit profitability while this may seem a good idea short term guests will inevitably pay the price somewhere whether through onboard purchases tour pricing or other additional costs at a minimum while sailing onboard the nclh ships guests know what they paid for and why there will always be discounted cruises available just not at norwegian cruise line regent seven seas or oceania and that may well be a good thing for the company and guests alike

asx and suggested this likely implied a big sell order was set to hit the market in the morning or maybe it just reflected some squaring up ahead of the critical us cpi result due last night essentially we saw both the futures said down 36 and in the first 15 minutes the asx200 was down 44 the buyers immediately stepped in and by 12 30pm the index was back to square the afternoon then saw anticipated squaring up and by the close the index was down 37 well done early buyers the futures are up 70 points this morning we closed slightly below 7000 yesterday but now we re back on track for

off top having risen 1 3 month on month in june the us cpi rose by 0 0 in july the annual rate fell to 8 5 from 9 1 omg buy everything the headline cpi was always expected to come down mainly due to lower oil prices economists had forecast 8 7 so in a converse way this was a beat there was concern that the core cpi which doesn t include energy might still tick up but on a 0 3 month on month gain compared to 0 7 in june the annual rate remained unchanged at 5 9 breaking down the headline numbers energy prices fell 4 6 in july and gasoline 7 7 used car prices and airfares saw meaningful falls overall goods inflation fell 0 5 but services inflation rose 0 3 rents rose 0 5 and food inflation rose a significant for one month 1 1 wages rose 0 5 in other words we can t afford to see another spike in the oil price back over us 100 bbl or worse again if inflation can truly be said to have peaked unfortunately in current geopolitical circumstances anything could happen and food prices are beholden to the russians and rents don t go down in any hurry the s p500 has now bounced 15 off the june low about as far as your common or garden bear market rally typically achieves the index is back to a level last seen in may has recovered half of the 2022 fall and is approaching its 200 day moving average september is historically the worst month of the year for stocks and october the scariest fear of another 75 point fed rate hike driven by the strong july jobs report have now receded and the market expects only 50 in september there ll be another jobs report and cpi report before then rate rises aside the fed s quantitative tightening will ramp up from september as more bonds and mortgage backed securities are not replaced on the balance sheet the last time the fed tapered its balance sheet in 2014 it started long before the first post gfc rate rise this time it s a double whammy so suffice to say the cpi result has done nothing to sway those who insist that while the s p500 could still close higher than its june low this year it may still need to go back and test it first history is on their side there is also a suggestion 8 5 is not nearly low enough to stop the

provide investors with information in addition to our results as determined by gaap we disclose adjusted revenue adjusted net income loss adjusted diluted earnings loss per share and adjusted ebitda collectively our non gaap financial measures as non gaap measures which management believes provide useful information to investors we believe that the presentation of our non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because each measure assists both investors and management in analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of our business our non gaap financial measures are not calculated in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as a substitute for revenue net income or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap other companies may define our non gaap financial measures differently and as a result our measures of our non gaap financial measures may not be directly comparable to those of other companies our non gaap financial measures provide indicators of performance that are not affected by fluctuations in certain costs or other items accordingly management believes that these measurements are useful for comparing general operating performance from period to period and management relies on these measures for planning and forecasting of future periods additionally these measures allow management to compare our results with those of other companies that have different financing and capital structures we define adjusted revenue as total revenues net of the change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights msrs due to valuation assumptions net of hedges we define adjusted net income loss as tax effected earnings before share based compensation expense the change in fair value of msrs due to valuation assumptions net of hedges a litigation accrual career transition program change in tax receivable agreement liability and the tax effects of those adjustments as applicable we define adjusted diluted earnings loss per share as adjusted net income loss divided by the diluted weighted average number of class a common stock outstanding for the applicable period which assumes the pro forma exchange and conversion of all outstanding class d common stock for class a common stock we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest and amortization expense on non funding debt income tax and depreciation and amortization net of the change in fair value of msrs due to valuation assumptions net of hedges share based compensation expense a litigation accrual career transition program and change in tax receivable agreement liability we exclude from each of our non gaap financial measures the change in fair value of msrs due to valuation assumptions net of hedges as this represents a non cash non realized adjustment to our total revenues reflecting changes in assumptions including discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions mostly due to changes in market interest rates which is not indicative of our performance or results of operation we also exclude effects of contractual prepayment protection associated with sales of msrs adjusted ebitda includes interest expense on funding facilities which are recorded as a component of interest income net as these expenses are a direct cost driven by loan origination volume by contrast interest and amortization expense on non funding debt is a function of our capital structure and is therefore excluded from adjusted ebitda our definitions of each of our non gaap financial measures allows us to add back certain cash and non cash charges and deduct certain gains that are included in calculating total revenues net net income attributable to rocket companies or net income however these expenses and gains vary greatly and are difficult to predict from time to time in the future we may include or exclude other items if we believe that doing so is consistent with the goal of providing useful information to investors in the first and second quarter of 2022 we revised our definition of adjusted net income loss and adjusted ebitda to also exclude the cash portion of share based compensation expenses and the career transition program respectively as these expenses do not directly affect what we consider to be our core operating performance comparative periods presented to the extent impacted were updated although we use our non gaap financial measures to assess the performance of our business such use is limited because they do not include certain material costs necessary to operate our business our non gaap financial measures can represent the effect of long term strategies as opposed to short term results our presentation of our non gaap financial measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items our non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap because of these limitations our non gaap financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations some of these limitations are a they do not reflect every cash expenditure future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments b adjusted ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payment on our debt c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or require improvements in the future and adjusted revenue adjusted net loss income and adjusted ebitda do not reflect any cash requirement for such replacements or improvements and d they are not adjusted for all non cash income or expense items that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows we compensate for these limitations by using our non gaap financial measures along with other comparative tools together with u s gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of operating performance see below for reconciliation of our non gaap

new york aug 11 slowing us inflation may have opened the door for the federal reserve to temper the pace of coming interest rate hikes but policymakers left no doubt they will continue to tighten monetary policy until price pressures are fully broken a us labour department report yesterday showing consumer prices didn t rise at all in july compared with june was just one step in what policymakers said would be a long process with a red hot job market and suddenly buoyant equity prices suggesting the economy needs more of the cooling that would come from higher borrowing costs the fed is far far away from declaring victory on inflation minneapolis federal reserve bank president neel kashkari said at the aspen ideas conference despite the welcome news in the cpi report advertisement kashkari said he hasn t seen anything that changes the need to raise the fed s policy rate to 3 9 per cent by year end and to 4 4 per cent by the end of 2023 the rate is currently in the 2 25 per cent 2 5 per cent range kashkari is to be sure the fed s most hawkish member most of his 18 colleagues believe a little less policy tightening may be enough to do the trick to bring prices under better control advertisement calling inflation unacceptably high chicago fed president charles evans said he believes the fed will likely need to lift its policy rate to 3 25 per cent 3 5 per cent this year and to 3 75 per cent 4 per cent by the end of next year in line with what fed chair jerome powell signalled after the fed s latest meeting in july still he said the cpi report marks the first positive reading on inflation since the fed began raising interest rates in march in increasing increments a quarter of a percentage point to start then a half a point and then three quarters of a percentage point in both june and july after yesterday s cpi report traders of futures tied to the fed s benchmark interest rate pared bets on a third straight 75 basis point hike at its september 20 21 policy meeting and now see a half point increase as the more likely option equity markets took a similar cue on hopes for a less aggressive central bank with the s p 500 rising 2 1 per cent financial markets are currently pricing a top fed funds rate of 3 75 per cent by year end with rate cuts to follow next year presumably as policymakers move to counter economic weakness kashkari called that scenario unrealistic and said fed policymakers are united in their determination to bring interest rates down to the fed s 2 per cent target the risk of recession will not deter me from advocating for what s needed to do so he said data on tap for the fed to scale back fresh inflation data will need to confirm the idea that price increases are slowing the consumer price index rose 8 5 per cent in july from a year earlier yesterday s report showed while that marked a drop from june s 9 1 per cent rate prices are still rising at levels not seen since the high inflation era of the 1970s and early 1980s food prices in july were up 11 per cent from the year before devastating for lower income families in particular for the moment however analysts focused on the fact that after months in which accelerating price pressures pushed fed policymakers to tighten credit conditions faster than at any time since the 1980s inflation data finally surprised in the other direction the fed needs a lot more evidence of slowing inflation but this is a good start said karim basta chief economist with iii capital management data on august consumer inflation will be released on september 13 the week before the fed meets and given recent trends in energy and some other prices the report should also be friendly to the disinflation path and should make a 50 basis point hike the preferred option still the fed s battle with high inflation is far from over the core consumer price index which strips out volatile gas and food prices and is seen as a better predictor of future inflation rose 0 3 per cent from june and 5 9 per cent from a year earlier the fed targets 2 per cent inflation based on a different index that is rising at a lower but still high rate of more than 6 per cent an alternative measure of consumer prices compiled by the cleveland fed known as the median consumer price index and considered a good view of the breadth of prices pressures in the economy rose 6 3 per cent on an annual basis in july compared to 6 per cent in june overall prices remain uncomfortably high wrote high frequency economics rubeela farooqi who stuck with her call for a 75 basis point rate hike next month coupled with strength in job growth and wages the data support the case for another aggressive rate hike in september reuters

the fourth quarter of 2021 the remaining 140 0 million available under the ddtl is available until july 15 2023 subject to certain terms and conditions david afshar chief financial officer commented as we navigate our way through challenging macro trends and headwinds we continue to have ample liquidity to fund our operations and believe our credit facilities are appropriately hedged against the rising interest rate environment non gaap financial measures in addition to our results of operations prepared in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap we also evaluate our financial performance using ebitda adjusted ebitda field contribution field contribution margin adjusted corporate expense adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share given our determination of adjustments in arriving at our computations these non gaap measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to net income or loss revenue operating income or loss cash flows from operating activities total indebtedness or any other financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap ebitda and adjusted ebitda ebitda and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with u s gaap such as net income loss rather we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda as supplemental measures of our performance we define ebitda as net income loss before interest expense net income tax expense benefit and depreciation and amortization we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda adjusted for the impact of certain other items that are either non recurring infrequent non cash unusual or items deemed by management to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations including impairments of goodwill intangible assets and other long lived assets non cash share based compensation sponsor fees loss on extinguishment of debt fees related to debt modifications the effect of interest rate derivatives acquisition related and integration costs legal costs and settlements associated with acquisition matters covid 19 related costs and other system transition costs professional fees and other costs as non gaap financial measures our computations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may vary from similarly termed non gaap financial measures used by other companies making comparisons with other companies on the basis of this measure impracticable we believe our computations of ebitda and adjusted ebitda are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance in determining which adjustments are made to arrive at ebitda and adjusted ebitda we consider both 1 certain non recurring infrequent non cash or unusual items which can vary significantly from year to year as well as 2 certain other items that may be recurring frequent or settled in cash but which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance we use ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess operating performance and make business decisions we have incurred substantial acquisition related costs and integration costs in fiscal years 2022 2021 and 2020 the underlying acquisition activities take place over a defined timeframe have distinct project timelines and are incremental to activities and costs that arise in the ordinary course of our business therefore we believe it is important to exclude these costs from our adjusted ebitda because it provides us a normalized view of our core ongoing operations after integrating our acquired companies which we believe is an important measure in assessing our performance field contribution and field contribution margin field contribution and field contribution margin are non gaap financial measures and are not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap such as operating income loss rather we present field contribution and field contribution margin as supplemental measures of our performance we define field contribution as operating income loss prior to corporate expenses and other non field related costs including depreciation and amortization acquisition related costs and other operating expenses field contribution margin is field contribution as a percentage of revenue as non gaap financial measures our computations of field contribution and field contribution margin may vary from similarly termed non gaap financial measures used by other companies making comparisons with other companies on the basis of these measures impracticable we believe field contribution and field contribution margin are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance and evaluating trends in our branch and regional results which can vary from year to year we use field contribution and field contribution margin to make business decisions and assess the operating performance and results delivered by our core field operations prior to corporate and other costs not directly related to our field operations these metrics are also important because they guide us in determining whether our branch and regional administrative expenses are appropriately sized to support our caregivers and direct patient care operations additionally field contribution and field contribution margin determine how effective we are in managing our field supervisory and administrative costs associated with supporting our provision of services and sale of products adjusted corporate expenses adjusted corporate expenses is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended to replace financial performance measures determined in accordance with gaap such as corporate expenses rather we present adjusted corporate expenses as a supplemental measure of our performance we define adjusted corporate expenses as corporate expenses adjusted for the impact of certain other items that are either non recurring infrequent non cash unusual or items deemed by us to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations including non cash share based compensation sponsor fees acquisition related and integration costs legal costs and settlements associated with acquisition matters covid related costs net of reimbursement and other system transition costs professional fees and other costs as non gaap financial measures our computations of adjusted corporate expenses may vary from similarly termed non gaap financial measures used by other companies making comparisons with other companies on the basis of this measure impracticable we believe adjusted corporate expenses is helpful in highlighting trends in our corporate support function which can vary from year to year we use adjusted corporate expenses to make business decisions in determining whether or not our corporate expenses is appropriately sized to support our caregivers and direct patient care operations excluding the aforementioned items from corporate expenses that are either non recurring infrequent non cash unusual or items deemed by us to not be indicative of the performance of our core operations allows us to evaluate adjusted corporate expenses in relation to the support necessary for our caregivers and direct patient care operations adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share adjusted net income represents net income loss as adjusted for the impact of gaap income tax goodwill intangible and other long lived asset impairment charges non cash share based compensation expense sponsor fees loss on extinguishment of debt interest rate derivatives acquisition related costs integration costs legal costs covid related costs net of reimbursement aba exited operations other system transition costs professional fees and certain other miscellaneous items on a pre tax basis adjusted net income includes a provision for income taxes derived utilizing a combined statutory tax rate the combined statutory tax rate is our estimate of our long term tax rate the most comparable gaap measure is net income loss adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income on a per diluted share basis using the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period the most comparable gaap measure is net income loss per share diluted adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share are important to us because they allow us to assess financial results exclusive of the items mentioned above that are not operational in nature or comparable to those of our competitors conference call aveanna will host a conference call on thursday august 11 2022 at 10 00 a m eastern time to discuss our second quarter
