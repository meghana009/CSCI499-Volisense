opec and its allies will remain proactive as global oil markets face uncertainty saudi arabia s energy minister has said in face of a wide range of uncertainties opec has no choice but to remain pro active and pre emptive and this is not an easy task especially that the market has the tendency to overreact to news in both directions prince abdulaziz bin salman said in an interview with official news agency spa he also said the decision by opec in october to reduce output by 2 million barrels per day was the right one for the stability of oil markets the move which faced criticism from the white house resulted in oil prices surging past 94 a barrel briefly brent the benchmark for two thirds of the world s oil has since lost about 15 per cent of its value dragged down by concerns of an economic slowdown and slower growth in china the world s largest crude importer the decision by the bloc of 23 oil producing countries was described as very risky unfortunate and there were suggestions that it was driven by political motivations prince abdulaziz said again in retrospect the opec decision turned out to be the right one prince abdulaziz also spoke about serious inaccuracy in certain global estimates about oil demand earlier this year the international energy agency said that global oil stocks had plunged by more than 600 million barrels in 2021 however based on the agency s supply and demand assumptions they should have declined by 400 million barrels according to a bloomberg report opec has maintained its demand figures for 2021 while some others have grossly and consistently underestimated historical and current demand prince abdulaziz said it would not come as a surprise if the issue of missing barrels re emerges in early 2023 keeping up with the same pattern of underestimating demand yet again in 2022 last week the international energy agency raised its global oil demand growth estimate for this year and the next on rising crude consumption in india china and the middle east the paris based agency now expects demand to grow by 1 7 million barrels per day in 2023 up from its previous estimate of 1 6 million bpd at its december meeting opec stuck to its oil production targets amid uncertainty over sanctions on russian crude as opec we will not hesitate in handling any market situation prince abdulaziz said the more credible we are the easier our task is in bringing stability to markets and the more stability we bring the greater our credibility is cemented and recognised global economic growth is forecast to be as weak as it was in 2009 during the financial crisis as a result of the ukraine conflict and its impact on the world economy the institute of international finance said in a report this month the world economy is projected to grow by 1 5 per cent next year compared with 0 6 per cent in 2009 the iif said this assessment comes after the international monetary fund cut its global economic growth forecast for next year due to the effects of the ukraine conflict broadening inflation pressures and a slowdown in china the world s second largest economy the fund maintained its global economic estimate for this year at 3 2 per cent but downgraded next year s forecast to 2 7 per cent 0 2 percentage points lower than the july forecast source the national news

the end of password sharing is coming to netflix soon and it will be a challenge for both viewers and the streaming giant the company has put off this moment for years researchers inside netflix inc identified password sharing as a major problem eating into subscriptions in 2019 people familiar with the situation say but the company was worried about how to address it without alienating consumers then covid lockdowns hit bringing a wave of new subscribers and the effort to scrutinize sharing petered out netflix didn t pursue a plan to crack down widely on the practice until this year as subscriber losses mounted at a company gathering outside los angeles early this year co chief executive reed hastings told senior executives that the pandemic boom had masked the extent of the password sharing issue and that they had waited too long to deal with it according to people who were at the meeting more than 100 million netflix viewers now watch the service using passwords they borrow often from family members or friends the company says netflix has said that it will put an end to that arrangement starting in 2023 asking people who share accounts to pay to do so the company expects to begin rolling out the change in the u s early in the year ad supported disney subscription option rolls out in us netflix s crackdown risks squandering years of goodwill the company has built up over the years and angering consumers who have a crowd of other streaming services to choose from ticker security last change change nflx netflix inc 617 52 10 37 1 71 make no mistake i don t think consumers are going to love it right out of the gate netflix co ceo ted sarandos told investors in early december adding it was up to the company to make sure users see value in paying for the service netflix declined to comment it s a stark turnaround for a company that once tweeted love is sharing a password the effort is part of netflix s answer to slowing growth especially in the u s market netflix has also switched gears on showing ads in content after years of resisting it a 6 99 a month ad supported tier launched in november aiming to capture new users looking for a discount to more expensive ad free plans netflix s terms of service have long said that the person who pays for the account should keep control of the devices that use it and not share passwords but the company never enforced the rule strictly drawing a hard line on who should be allowed to share passwords has proved tricky should kids going off to college be allowed to share their parents password and what happens when users have a second home or travel a lot netflix has updated its customer help pages this year to say accounts are only to be shared by people who live together the company has said it would enforce its rules based on ip addresses device ids and account activity to mitigate consumer backlash netflix has discussed dialing up the pressure on password sharing gradually according to people familiar with the situation some product executives warned against making the service too complex and not consumer friendly a practice a few of them referred to internally as comcastification a dig at the cable giant according to people familiar with the situation netflix has always billed itself as the alternative to cable providers that tethered viewers to cable boxes and contracts ben affleck questions netflix s mass content strategy talks about new production company netflix considered allowing users to rent pay per view content through their subscriptions as amazon prime video customers can because it could make users wary of sharing their login information with others who might run up their bills people familiar with internal discussions said ultimately the company decided against that tactic in part because product executives were concerned it would take away from the simplicity of the service the people said ticker security last change change amzn amazon com inc 183 32 0 30 0 16 as the leader in the streaming video business with 223 million global subscribers and a market cap of about 128 billion netflix is the first in the industry to confront password sharing but likely won t be the last investors and media executives say other streaming rivals face losses as well and over time the pressure to make money and keep growing could push services like disney hbo max and paramount to take a hard look at password sharing as well ticker security last change change dis the walt disney co 113 89 0 93 0 82 wbd warner bros discovery inc 8 14 0 22 2 63 para paramount global 10 43 0 47 4 31 analysts at cowen inc estimate that netflix s effort could generate an additional 721 million in revenue next year in the u s and canada where there are about 30 million sharers the estimate is based on a survey asking consumers who share the account of a person they don t live with how they would respond if netflix required them to pay 3 a month to keep sharing and factors in people who would pay more to start their own new accounts it s a boost and it can definitely help but it s also a one time boost said neil macker senior equity analyst at morningstar he said he thinks the company is underestimating the degree to which the change will spur customers to cancel netflix subscriptions gina mazzulla 53 years old and a longtime netflix subscriber who lives in southeastern pennsylvania shares an account with her parents since the 9 99 a month plan only allows a single stream at a time they text each other to coordinate she said she might pay a few dollars more for sharing if netflix forces the issue but it would depend on the cost if i were to stop watching netflix is my life going to be dramatically impacted or different no she said while netflix hasn t announced its plans for the u s it has been running tests in latin american countries one of the regions where password sharing is most prevalent in those tests netflix lets subscribers pay to share accounts with up to two people outside of their homes rather than blocking password borrowers from accessing someone else s account netflix prompts them to enter a verification code for their device the code is sent to the primary account owner and must be entered within 15 minutes the password borrower can watch netflix after entering the code but might keep getting prompts until the account owner pays an additional monthly fee to add a sharer according to people familiar with the tests netflix is weighing similar plans for the u s the people said netflix has received complaints from consumers about the effort in latin america but many users are nevertheless opting to pay for sharing according to some of the people one major challenge is that it is difficult for netflix to determine when an account holder is traveling and accessing the service from another location like a second home or hotel versus when another individual is borrowing their password said people familiar with internal discussions netflix also debated how to address families in which children split time between two parents homes the people said one approach the company has discussed is allowing subscribers to let netflix know if they are shifting to a different geographic location for a period of time in markets such as india people often watch netflix on their mobile phones and stream it over cellular networks people familiar with the matter said that makes it harder for netflix to determine who lives in a household compared with when users stream over shared wi fi or wired broadband connections click here to get the fox business app netflix saw the warning signals on password sharing in 2019 the company reported a rare loss in u s subscribers in the second quarter of that year and while top executives felt it was a blip they asked researchers to investigate why growth was slowing that team found that password sharers were among the culprits mr hastings was eager to restrict the practice but it quickly became clear that doing so would be difficult according to people familiar with the discussions the company for years has dealt with organized fraudulent password sharing in countries such as colombia according to current and former employees in those operations people sell cards showing passwords that were stolen or are linked to accounts set up for the scheme netflix executives realized that any crackdown to be effective would also have to address the large amount of more benign sharing between family members and friends the effort waned as a concern as the pandemic supercharged the company s growth in 2020 when shutdowns of movie theaters arenas and restaurants left users looking for at home entertainment netflix added nearly 16 million new subscribers in the first quarter of that year alone company leaders attention turned to covid related workforce safety and production shutdowns in early 2021 netflix began to test messaging with some members that said if you don t live with the owner of this account you need your own account to keep watching the language spurred negative press coverage and consumer blowback netflix never rolled out the messaging across its whole user base netflix hasn t announced a date or pricing for its password sharing plan in the u s in 2023 the company s ad supported tier could factor into the effort to stem password sharing mr sarandos said in december the lower priced ad tier was a softer landing for people who have to pay for netflix for the first time or those who are financially strained he said executives have discussed charging account sharers in the u s a sum that is only slightly below the cost of its 6 99 ad supported plan according to people familiar with the situation that could encourage password borrowers to sign up for their own subscription and have full control over the account rather than asking the account owner to pay a sharing fee netflix s initial goal is to help users cut back on sharing themselves without the company forcing the issue for borrowers who want to sign up for their own subscription the company is making it possible to transfer existing profiles which include their viewing history and preferences to a new account netflix said this would help during life changes the company has already given primary account owners a dashboard that tells them which devices are logged in at any given time some users aren t aware of everyone who is sharing their account the dashboard allows them to spot unusual logins and log out anyone who shouldn t have access sauro artusi who is 36 and owns a small it business in puerto cabello venezuela checked the new dashboard recently and was surprised to find 26 devices logged in including his tv and computer his sister s computer and many others he didn t recognize mr artusi who has been a subscriber since 2016 didn t want his account to be flagged for sharing too much once netflix began enforcing limits he sent messages to some friends he suspected were borrowing it to let them know he was going to change the password later that night he got a call from his uncle they were asking what had just happened to their netflix account he said bob bornfriend 77 years old lives in the suburbs of chicago and shares the cost and use of a netflix account with his daughter who lives in a different town mr bornfriend who also has cable tv said he watches netflix primarily when he is traveling or if he gets hooked on a compelling show netflix s approach to limiting sharing will dictate his next steps mr bornfriend said i m waiting to see how rigorously they do that and if it becomes an issue for me i ll just drop it he said inti pacheco contributed to this article

mergers and acquisitions m a activity globally fell well short of the high water mark set last year as debt financing markets collapsed and stock market volatility decimated valuations and dealmakers are predicting a slow path to recovery in 2023 the total value of m a had fallen 37 to 3 66 trillion by dec 20 according to dealogic data after hitting an all time high of 5 9 trillion last year investment bankers and deals lawyers said the activity levels of 2021 were unsustainable and that a correction was inevitable but blamed macroeconomic uncertainty for hampering several potential tie ups in the latter half of 2022 some sellers are still hoping for the price of yesterday and some buyers are still hoping to get the financing of yesterday although these things are no longer available this is why we have seen less activity said dirk albersmeier co head of global m a at jpmorgan m a volumes in the united states fell by about 43 to 1 53 trillion while europe and asia pacific saw a 27 and 30 drop respectively with volumes hovering just above the 900 billion mark in the fourth quarter there has been a 56 contraction in global m a to 641 2 billion partly caused by a 66 drop in private equity activity we had the twin evils of geopolitical tension and inflation resulting in rising interest rates rearing their ugly heads and the two of them together had a really adverse impact on the market said tim lalonde chief operating officer of global investment banking at evercore the financing market for leveraged buyouts seized up in 2022 as central banks raised interest rates forcing large private equity firms to either write larger equity checks or abandon their takeover ambitions but there is reason for some optimism ahead despite the macro and geopolitical environment well capitalized strategics are still going to do deals that are important for their long term business strategy said ivan farman co head of global m a at bank of america even with macroeconomic headwinds there were 39 deals worth over 10 billion announced in 2022 m a is the best house in a pretty tough neighborhood in investment banking right now said mark shafir co head of global m a at citigroup which advised on three of the year s largest transactions including broadcom s avgo o 61 billion takeover of vmware vmw n eamon brabazon co head of emea m a at bank of america forecast a subdued first quarter but said deal volumes will start growing in the second quarter kroger s kr n 25 billion acquisition of albertsons aci n and amgen s amgn o 28 billion buyout of horizon therapeutics hznp o were the largest deals of the fourth quarter for both the buyers were able to readily lean on banks for financing as investment grade rated corporations had easier access to corporate debt to execute large tie ups ceos are feeling a little more positive about the longer term even though they see rocky days in the short term said faiza saeed partner at cravath swaine moore llp top rainmakers expect a pickup in cross border m a activity it is likely that we are going to see significant m a activity in the u s in 2023 not only u s companies making acquisitions but also european and other international buyers making acquisitions in the u s said frank aquila sullivan cromwell s senior m a partner lorenzo corte a london based partner at skadden said dealmaking in the energy industry is expected to pick up due to the war in ukraine as europe has to replace an enormous amount of energy that came from russia with alternative sources great deceleration several megadeals worth tens of billions of dollars fell apart in 2022 as market volatility and a tougher antitrust climate gave companies pause i characterize 2022 as the great deceleration from running well above trend to well below said paul taubman founder of pjt partners the reality is deals can still get done but the bar has been raised on difficulty banks which backed several sponsor led buyouts before the markets choked up were faced with hefty losses on debt they failed to sell to investors going forward private equity funds are expected to kickstart the recovery as they seek assets at a discount despite the challenges of raising acquisition financing private equity funds remain confident as they are sitting on a lot of dry powder and the market is coming to them said alvaro membrillera head of the london office at paul weiss but before taking action they want to see the real impact of the recession as geopolitical and economic uncertainty persists deal activity in early 2023 may mirror the latter half of this year if you flashback to a year ago none of us probably would have predicted the market sell off to quite the degree that it happened we were probably more optimistic a year ago said david denunzio global head of m a at wells fargo still most dealmakers struck a positive note as they prepare for 2023 the increased interest rates and the specter of an economic slowdown does make you look at the base case for companies with a finer lens said michal katz head of investment and corporate banking for mizuho americas but we are very much open for

world into a tailspin on tuesday was apparently just a one day wonder the asx200 dropped 100 on tuesday and made it almost all the way back yesterday underscoring that the market is very pre holiday thin right now the trigger was the fact wall street did not join in with everyone else on tuesday night and rather found some support from both a technical and oversold view has the us recession fear pullback ended last night showed some signs it may have beijing also came up yesterday with a brilliant excuse to support the complete about face on zero covid change the definition of covid death if you have a pre existing condition to make you vulnerable to covid and die that s no longer death by covid only if there s nothing otherwise wrong with you and you die that s death by covid the change will mean china will vastly under report covid fatalities even more so than to date in which a death count of 5421 in a population of 1 4bn is a little at odds with the rest of the world despite a vaccine that doesn t work this will provide justification for further reopening which sadly is good news for the rest of the world unless a runaway death count shuts down the economy anyway late in the session the us futures markets started to rise thanks to pre released earnings reports from nike and fedex that beat expectations it was pretty much a buy everything session on the asx yesterday

wallflower flat after the accc knocked back the proposed merger of telstra s tls and tpg telecom s tpg regional networks there will now be an appeal having not fallen on tuesday night wall street took off last night on all of the above plus some domestic news confident once more nike and fedex have both suffered this year from the end of the lockdown driven online shopping binge and in nike s case ongoing lockdowns in china and excess inventory built up during supply shortages both thus surprised last night with solid earnings beats fedex rose 3 4 and nike a whopping 12 3 which is a lot for a dow stock with wall street having found tenuous support on tuesday night these results helped to spur greater confidence that maybe the recession if there is one won t be too bad even more confidence was garnered from confidence itself the conference board s monthly index of us consumer confidence bounced back this month after two consecutive falls a reading of 108 3 was well ahead of expectation this result allowed wall street to overlook a 7 7 fall in existing home sales in november compared to a 5 2 forecast to be down 35 year on year investors are more heartened that the average 30 year mortgage rate is now around 6 3 having peaked earlier at 7 2 put it altogether and wall street sees hope the fed will not have to push as hard as it has suggested next year combine that with technical

many people in their 40s are well into their careers and looking forward to a retirement that s less than two decades away with that said it s wise for people in this age bracket to review their finances and ensure they re on track for retirement and other financial goals here are four ways people in their 40s can be money smart 1 work with a financial advisor when someone is young and in their 20s they can invest aggressively in stocks and ride out the ups and downs of the market however individuals in their 40s may need to be more strategic about how they invest with retirement getting closer the last thing they want to do is jeopardize the integrity of their nest egg this is where working with a financial advisor can be a smart move a good financial advisor will take a holistic view of their client s entire financial situation and make customized recommendations this won t just be for portfolio growth but also for other long term benefits like wealth preservation and tax efficiency 2 start maxing out retirement plans depending on how long a person in their 40s plans on continuing to work they may have a solid 20 years or so of saving opportunities in front of them that s a long time to continue making contributions and leverage the compound interest effect so that those investment gains multiply several times over the best possible way to do this is for a person to max out the retirement plans because retirement accounts like a 401 k and ira are tax advantaged they ll pass less to the irs and keep more in their nest eggs 3 become debt free as someone in their 40s starts thinking down the road toward retirement it will be helpful to eliminate as many debts as possible one of the biggest heavy hitters to focus on is their mortgage for example an individual who pays off their mortgage early might reduce their monthly living expenses by 1 500 that one effort can allow them to reduce their nest egg savings target by as much as 450 000 using the 4 rule as a guideline 4 get a life insurance plan people in their 40s who don t already have life insurance should consider getting a plan soon life insurance plans become increasingly more expensive the older people get on top of that individuals may find that as they start to develop health problems this may lead to even greater premium increases or potentially not getting approved at all this is why someone who s in relatively good shape should apply for a policy lock into the best rate possible and help give peace of mind all the way into retirement 5 plan for the next phase although people in their 40s may not be completely ready for retirement just yet they can start to see it on the horizon in this situation it can make sense to start thinking about how they will replace their working income and begin making withdrawals from their retirement accounts in the most tax efficient way at the same time this can also be a good opportunity to begin taking steps toward solid estate planning these might be actions such as setting up a revocable living trust so that assets can be passed on to beneficiaries outside of probate again a good financial advisor should be able to help provide proper guidance the bottom line people in their 40s are getting closer to retirement and so that means taking steps to make sure they re ready good steps to take are to max out their retirement accounts become debt free and get life insurance if they haven t already at the same time they should also connect with a good financial advisor and start making some serious plans for that next big phase of life coverage is underwritten by aflac in arkansas idaho oklahoma oregon pennsylvania texas and virginia policies icc1368100 icc1368200 icc1368300 icc1368400 and riders icc1368050 icc1368051 icc1368052 icc1368053 icc1368054 icc1368055 this is a brief product overview only coverage may not be available in all states including new york benefits premium rates may vary based on plan selected optional riders are available at an additional cost the policy has limitations and exclusions that may affect benefits payable refer to the policy for complete details limitations and exclusions for costs and complete details of the coverage please contact your local aflac agent the content herein is provided for general informational purposes and is not provided as tax legal health or financial advice for any person or for any specific situation employers employees and other individuals should contact their own advisers about their situations wwhq 1932 wynnton road columbus ga 31999 z2201191 exp 12 23 see campaign contact information name keyonda goosbyemail keyonda goosby iquanti comjob title consultant tags reportedtimes
listen to this article listen to this article chicago pollock cohen llp filed a class action lawsuit tuesday in federal court in chicago against defendant groupon inc the plaintiffs in the case are two hair salons that seek to represent tens of thousands of small businesses across the country they say have been victimized by groupon the lawsuit alleges that groupon has created unauthorized webpages for tens of thousands of small businesses these pages look and feel like regular groupon pages potentially confusing customers into believing that the listed businesses have relationships with groupon but these businesses are not groupon partners and they did not consent to appear on the groupon platform the lawsuit states the federal class action complaint further alleges that groupon uses these fake business listings to expand its own customer base by diverting search engine traffic when potential customers search google for these salons restaurants or gyms the results often include a groupon link clicking on that link the customers may be met by a large pop up ad prompting them to sign up for groupon and receive a discount once the customer closes the pop up and reaches the unauthorized page they find that the business does not actually offer any groupon deals they can only search for deals at nearby businesses according to the lawsuit groupon uses poorly written stock language on these landing pages that inaccurately describes small businesses for instance one plaintiff is a high end hair salon that takes only a limited number of clients on an appointment only basis yet groupon describes the salon as a day spa that happily accepts walk in appointments big businesses cannot misappropriate the hard earned reputation and goodwill of small businesses said raphael janove who is leading the case along with adam pollock and george krebs of manhattan based pollock cohen llp krebs added groupon must stop profiting off of small businesses and it must cease falsely and inaccurately describing these businesses on the groupon website

a new federal law requiring that sesame be listed as an allergen on food labels is having unintended consequences increasing the number of products with the ingredient food industry experts said the requirements are so stringent that many manufacturers especially bakers find it simpler and less expensive to add sesame to a product and to label it than to try to keep it away from other foods or equipment with sesame as a result several companies including national restaurant chains like olive garden wendy s and chick fil a and bread makers that stock grocery shelves and serve schools are adding sesame to products that didn t have it before while the practice is legal consumers and advocates say it violates the spirit of the law aimed at making foods safer for people with allergies it was really exciting as a policy advocate and a mom to get these labels said naomi seiler a consultant with the asthma and allergy foundation of america whose 9 year old daughter zoe is allergic to sesame instead companies are intentionally adding the allergen to food the new law which goes into effect jan 1 requires that all foods made and sold in the u s must be labeled if they contain sesame which is now the nation s ninth major allergen sesame can be found in obvious places like sesame seeds on hamburger buns but it is also an ingredient in many foods from protein bars to ice cream added to sauces dips and salad dressings and hidden in spices and flavorings advocates for families coping with allergies lobbied for years to have sesame added to the list of major allergens congress in 2004 created labeling requirements for eight milk eggs fish shellfish tree nuts peanuts wheat and soybeans more than 1 6 million people in the u s are allergic to sesame some so severe that they need injections of epinephrine a drug used to treat life threatening reactions cases of sesame allergy have been rising in recent years along with a growing number of foods that contain the ingredient said dr ruchi gupta a pediatrician and director of the center for food allergy asthma research at northwestern university sesame is in so many things that people don t really understand said gupta who called the move to add sesame to products so disappointing in families that do have a sesame allergy it is truly challenging she said under the new law enforced by the food and drug administration companies must now explicitly label sesame as an ingredient or separately note that a product contains sesame in the u s ingredients are listed on product packaging in order of amount sesame labeling has been required for years in other places including canada europe australia and new zealand if the ingredients don t include sesame companies must take steps to prevent the foods from coming in contact with any sesame known as cross contamination food industry experts said the new requirements aren t simple or practical it s as if we ve suddenly asked bakers to go to the beach and remove all the sand said nathan mirdamadi a consultant with commercial food sanitation which advises the industry about food safety some companies include statements on labels that say a food may contain a certain product or that the food is produced in a facility that also uses certain allergens however such statements are voluntary not required according to the fda and they do not absolve the company of requirements to prevent cross contamination instead some companies have taken a different approach officials at olive garden said that starting this week the chain is adding a minimal amount of sesame flour to the company s famous breadsticks due to the potential for cross contamination at the bakery chick fil a has changed its white bun and multigrain brioche buns to include sesame while wendy s said the company has added sesame to its french toast sticks and buns united states bakery which operates franz family bakeries in california and the northwest notified customers in march that they would add a small amount of sesame flour to all hamburger and hot dog buns and rolls to mitigate the risk of any adverse reactions to sesame products although such actions don t violate the law the fda does not support them the agency said in a statement it would make it more difficult for sesame allergic customers to find foods that are safe for them to consume the statement said some large companies previously have added other allergens to products and updated their labels in 2016 kellogg s added traces of peanut flour to some cookies and crackers prompting protests that s frustrating and scary for parents like kristy fitzgerald of crookston minnesota she learned last spring that pan o gold baking co which supplies breads to schools health centers and grocery stores across the midwest was adding small amounts of sesame to its products including those served at her daughter s school six year old audrey in the meantime has outgrown her allergy to sesame bob huebner food safety quality assurance manager for pan o gold told fitzgerald in a string of emails that the company was forced to add sesame to the product and the label the unfortunate reality is that our equipment and bakeries are not setup for allergen cleanings that would be required to prevent sesame cross contamination and was not an option for us huebner wrote in an email to fitzgerald huebner replied to an email from the ap but did not respond to questions about the company s practices fitzgerald started an online petition protesting the move to add sesame at some point someone is going to

out bid kevin lederer says he realized they re currently priced out of the housing market so he and his wife paused their search for a starter home kevin it just made sense to continue to rent and try to save to where eventually hopefully things do interest rates may come down and prices will come down to where what i want is affordable again are you hopeful yes and no yeah that s that s a tough

district but across central florida sheehan warns the repercussions are dire there is a loss of affordability that we need to address and it can t just be market rate homeowners drowning in debt service industry workers and young people leaving the area and lost is the opportunity to build wealth through real estate like previous generations we cannot ignore this problem and now it s gotten

neighborhoods while at the same time diversifying available housing it could be anything from single family homes but also accessory dwelling units like granny flats and tiny homes to duplexes

community grows up burton says they re working to make sure homeownership is attainable in some form in orlando even if it looks different than the single family home of decades past but for some buyers it s not happening fast enough hypothetically let s say it s a year from now and you still can t afford anything in this area would this housing crisis make you leave central florida it would

become aware of a new and mysterious disbursement taking place in the city and had requested a staff report from the finance director ondrea starzhevskiy the report detailed the disbursements for the period of november 29 through december 10 2022 the report mentioned that the disbursements were within the budget and presented to the city council at its first meeting after delivery but the council

designed to make smart investments in the stock market and had been reaping huge profits in the process the council was stunned by the revelations and discussed the implications of having an ai making decisions that could affect the city s finances after much debate the council decided to commission a committee to study the implications of having an ai making financial decisions and to come up with a plan for how to regulate and manage the ai s investment decisions the committee was given a year to study the implications of ai and to come up with a plan for regulating and managing its financial decisions in the end the committee s research proved invaluable and provided the city council with the tools it needed to regulate and manage the ai s investments thanks to the committee s work the city council was able to establish guidelines and regulations for how ai can be used in financial decision making this ensured that the ai s investments were responsible and beneficial to the city and its citizens the ai was then able to make smart investments that provided the city with much needed revenues in the end the ai s investments proved to be a great success and the city council was able

zelenskyy s first known trip outside his home country since the war began in february biden and first lady jill biden greeted zelenskyy who wore casual army green attire as he got out of his vehicle he shook hands with biden before they went inside for their oval office meeting followed by a news conference in the evening zelenskyy will address congress i am in washington today to thank the american people the president and the congress for their much needed support zelenskyy posted on his official instagram account after he landed and also to continue cooperation to bring our victory closer he said the visit would strengthen resilience and defense capabilities of ukraine the highly sensitive trip is taking place after 10 months of a brutal war that has seen tens of thousands killed and wounded on both sides of the conflict along with devastation for ukrainian civilians ust before his arrival the us announced its largest single delivery of arms to ukraine including patriot surface to air missiles and congress planned to vote on a spending package that includes about us 45 billion in emergency assistance to ukraine zelenskyy headed abroad after making a daring and dangerous trip tuesday to what he called the hottest spot on the 1300 kilometre front line of the conflict the city of bakhmut in ukraine s contested donetsk province he praised ukrainian troops for their courage resilience and strength as artillery boomed in the background in a statement tuesday night white house press secretary karine jean pierre said biden looks forward to the visit and that the address to congress will demonstrate the strong bipartisan support for ukraine the visit will underscore the united states steadfast commitment to supporting ukraine for as long as it takes including through the provision of economic humanitarian and military assistance she said us and ukrainian officials have made clear they don t envision an imminent resolution to the war and are preparing for fighting to continue for some time biden has repeated that while the us will arm and train ukraine american forces will not be directly engaged in the conflict ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy awards a serviceman at the site of the heaviest battles with the russian invaders in bakhmut photo ap biden and zelenskyy first discussed the idea of a visit to washington during their most recent phone call on december 11 and a formal invitation followed three days later said a senior us administration official briefing reporters on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the visit zelenskyy accepted the invitation on friday and it was confirmed on sunday when the white house began coordinating with house speaker nancy pelosi to arrange the congressional address the white house consulted with zelenskyy on security for his departure from ukraine and travel to washington including the risk of russian action while zelenskyy was briefly out of the country the official added declining to detail the measures taken to safeguard the ukrainian leader the official said the us expected russia to continue its attacks on ukrainian forces and civilian infrastructure targets despite the trip the tranche of us funding pending before congress would be the biggest american infusion of assistance yet to ukraine even more than biden s us 37 billion emergency request and is meant to ensure that support flows to the war effort for months to come on wednesday the us was also set to announce that it will send a major package of us 1 8 billion in military aid to ukraine that will for the first time include a patriot missile battery and precision guided bombs for its fighter jets us officials said the aid signals an expansion by the us in the kinds of advanced weaponry it will send to ukraine to bolster its air defences against what has been an increasing barrage of russian missiles in recent weeks the package will include about us 1 billion in weapons from pentagon stocks and us 800 million in funding through the ukraine security assistance initiative officials said the decision to send the patriot battery comes despite threats from russia s foreign ministry that the delivery of the advanced surface to air missile system would be considered a provocative step and that the patriot and any crews accompanying it would be a legitimate target for moscow s military it s not clear exactly when the patriot would arrive on the front lines in ukraine since us troops will have to train ukrainian forces on how to use the high tech system the training could take several weeks and is expected to be done in germany to date all training of ukraine s forces by the us and its western allies has taken place in european countries the visit comes at an important moment as the white house braces for greater resistance when republicans take control of the house in january and give more scrutiny to aid for ukraine gop leader kevin mccarthy has said his party s lawmakers will not write a blank check for ukraine us president joe biden welcomes ukraine s president volodymyr zelenskyy at the white house photo ap biden and zelenskyy frequently have talked by phone as the white house arranges new tranches of military assistance for ukraine the calls have been mostly warm with biden praising ukraine for remaining steadfast against the russians and zelenskyy thanking the us president for support the one exception was a june phone call soon after biden notified zelenskyy that an additional us 1 billion package was headed to ukraine zelenskyy didn t miss a beat in ticking off the additional assistance he said ukraine needed that irked biden who underscored to zelenskyy the american people s generosity but the brief moment of tension hasn t caused any lasting difficulty according to officials familiar with the episode pelosi who visited zelenskyy earlier this year in kyiv encouraged lawmakers to be on hand for wednesday evening s session we are ending a very special session of the 117th congress with legislation that makes progress for the american people as well as support for our democracy pelosi wrote tuesday in a letter to colleagues please be present for a very special focus on democracy wednesday night local residents watch as a bombed building is dismantled in borodyanka kyiv region on

provinces of donetsk kherson luhansk and zaporizhzhia remain fiercely contested with the fighting in the east at a stalemate moscow has used missiles and drones to attack ukraine s power equipment hoping to leave people without electricity as freezing weather sets in in a video released by his office from the bakhmut visit zelenskyy was handed a ukrainian flag and alluded to delivering it to us

people are braver and need more powerful weapons we will pass it on from the boys to the congress to the president of the united states we are grateful for their support but it is not enough it is a hint it is not enough for his part putin on tuesday hailed the courage and self denial of his forces in ukraine but he did so at a ceremony in an opulent and glittering hall at the kremlin in moscow

economic policy leaders and researchers were kept busy in 2022 by high inflation a volatile labor market crypto crashes and major legislation like the inflation reduction act we asked five economic studies scholars about important developments this year in their fields of study and developments that they expect in 2023 use the links below to explore their perspectives health care richard frank what were the most important developments in health care from the last year the past year has seen dramatic developments in both mental health care and drug pricing concerns over mental health in the united states has taken center stage for example the prevalence of mental illnesses increased over the last decade for the first time since the 1950s that was largely driven by illness in children that more than doubled from 2010 to 2019 president biden drew attention to the problem and sketched a vision of how to address it the u s congress enacted the inflation reduction act that established the ability of the federal government to negotiate prices for prescription drugs and established catastrophic protection against the costs of prescription drugs these are historic changes in u s policy that will save american consumers and taxpayers tens of billion dollars what brookings work have you done on these issues our work on mental health policy during 2022 has focused on three specific issues the mental health of children the system for dealing with mental health crises and the challenges of integrating behavioral health into general medical care some key points made in that work are as follows the growth in mental illnesses in children pre dates the pandemic and the factors driving that change are not well understood nevertheless there are numerous evidence based interventions that can prevent and treat mental illnesses in children and adolescents we propose that schools can play a greater role in identifying need and engaging children in treatment treatment services can be delivered by a range of providers by integrating behavioral health services into a variety of settings facilitated by improved support from the medicaid program our work on prescription drugs has focused on two key issues the first is on claims made regarding the impact of policies that negotiate drug prices on innovation and the supply of â new cures â our analyses highlighted several points we showed that concerns over the impact of the inflation reduction actâ s impact on new cures was exaggerated and that the congressional budget officeâ s estimate of a very modest impact was consistent with existing evidence in addition we examined various complementary policy measures that could be taken to promote innovations that would boost the health of americans including greater investments in the nih and other science agencies and government seeding of venture investments the second area focused on regulatory impediments to competition we offered a series of possible modifications to fda regulations that would promote greater price competition in prescription drug markets that would generate savings to consumers and taxpayers and invigorate the emerging market for biosimilar products how do you see these issues evolving in 2023 the attention and initial steps towards addressing the complex array of issues related to the american struggle with mental illnesses have provided a general direction for policy in the coming year the details of the strategies for implementing policies at all levels of government and civil society will need to take shape our work will focus on both the development of federal policy and addressing barriers at the state and local levels that will be necessary to realize the vision that developed over the past several years there are a variety of critical implementation issues related to the prescription drug provisions of the inflation reduction act that must be developed in 2023 several of those will turn on the answers to analytical questions regarding how markets will respond to policy guidance that will guide the development of a price negotiation process we intend to focus on some of those analytical issues in addition the president has called for ideas for addressing drug prices and competition beyond the provisions of the inflation reduction act we will be conducting several research projected specifically on those issues back to top monetary policy david wessel what was the most important development in monetary policy from the last year this past year was one of the most unusual in recent federal reserve history â as inflation proved unexpectedly virulent the fed took interest rates from zero to over 4 a faster pace of rate increases than any time since paul volcker â this triggered a sharp decline in both stock and bond prices that eroded the value of americansâ retirement accounts a spike in mortgage rates that hit new home buyers hard and brought long sought relief for those with savings in the bank or in market funds what brookings work have you done on these issues for the fed to make policy that will bring inflation under control they first have to know how high it is and measuring inflation is no easy task weâ ve published several explainers to help reporters average americans and even policymakers understand how the federal governmentâ primarily the bureau of labor statistics bls â does it measuring the price of housingâ both rental and owner occupied â turns out to be particularly messy and housing plays a big role in the official inflation measures as we explain here in the second half of 2022 we hosted an illuminating series of discussions alongside the monthly releases of the bls consumer price index report guests including wendy edelberg the hamilton project justin wolfers brookings nonresident fellow jason furman harvard neil irwin axios and betsey stevenson university of michigan joined me to share their perspectives on the drivers of inflation the fedâ s response and the road ahead you can read takeaways from the latest discussion here how do you see these issues evolving in 2023 we hosted fed chair jerome powell in december and he made it as clear as anyone has that we will continue to face challenges from inflation well into the future we will be watching closely to see how quickly inflation comes down and how far the fed raises rates in 2023 â and whether as i expect the u s economy will slide into recession during 2023 â weâ ll also be thinking about the questions the fed needs to address when it reviews the monetary policy framework it adopted in august 2020 in light of the recent bout of inflation back to top the labor market wendy edelberg what was the most important development in labor market policy from the last year a combination of factorsâ long covid excess retirements high demand for labor among othersâ has contributed to a volatile labor market in 2022 some observers have focused on the low unemployment rate compared to the job opening rate and concluded that the unemployment rate will likely have to rise to startling high levels just to stabilize the labor market and get rid of the upward pressure on inflation instead the fill rate the ratio of job openings to hires shows that firms looking to hire large numbers of workers are indeed expanding employment at a rapid pace itâ s a complex and unique situation what brookings work have you done on these issues in this piece i argued with some of my colleagues at the hamilton project that in order for the economy to return to more stable footing the labor market needs to soften but not at much as some think what squares the circle between the unemployment rate and the fill rate is that right now the unemployment rate is doing a relatively poor job of capturing the pool of potential workersâ many are coming straight into jobs from outside the labor force how do you see these issues evolving in 2023 we show that the labor market dynamics since 2021 suggest that getting the job openings rate back to a more sustainable pace means we need the pace of hiring to return to roughly 2015 levels such a labor market in the year or so ahead would be softer than todayâ s but not startling so back to top finance aaron klein what were the most important development in finance from the last year bank overdraft fees exploded over the last twenty plus years growing by some estimates to over 30 billion a year overdraft penalizes people who run out of money with fees typically 35 each time that directly flow into bank profit this year most of americaâ s largest banks and many smaller ones announced major changes to their overdraft programs that will reduce the high cost to be poor by my estimate changes from the largest banks alone will result in 5 billion a year back in the accounts of those living paycheck to paycheck digital assets and crypto currency exploded and imploded with a series of high profile losses and bankruptcies regulating crypto will likely be front and center before congress and financial regulators who spent last year writing reports requested by president bidenâ s executive orders earlier this year what brookings work have you done on these issues in 2022 many banks changed their overdraft policies absent any new regulation or legislation as highlighted at this brookings event focused on early adopters new research public name and shame and potential competition from financial technology fintech firms finally forced major changes across the industry president biden claimed some credit for this as part of his crack down on â junk feesâ but regardless of why banks changed their way the reality is a major win for working families who run out of money which sadly is by some estimates half of all americans on the crypto side brookings was glad to host among others the commodity futures trading commission chairman acting federal deposit insurance corporation chairman and the new york state banking superintendent in a series of events discussing how they are regulating crypto we recently created a resource for people interested in digital asset markets with key takeaways from a number of these events along with summaries of recent research on crypto regulation how do you see these issues evolving in 2023 while the voluntary progress on overdraft fee policies was welcome can and must take action there are still banks and likely some credit unions operating on unsafe and unsound business models reliant exclusively on overdraft i outlined a series of steps regulators should take stopping any bank from relying on overdraft fees for a majority of their profit in consecutive years fixing americaâ s real time payments system and a requirement for all financial institutions to offer a no overdraft low cost basic bank account i hope congress will consider these important measures in 2023 one key question likely to be discussed in 2023 on crypto will be whether the federal reserve can or should issue its own central bank digital currency cbdc america already runs on commercial bank digital currency credit debit cards digital banking etc so it remains to be seen whether swapping the first c in cbdc from commercial to central will unlock benefits for the american economy or whether it is more in reaction with countries like china which are rolling out cbdcâ s for their own reasons which are often very different than ours back to top climate policy sanjay patnaik what was the most important development in climate policy in the last year the inflation reduction act ira signed into law in august of this year is the most significant piece of climate legislation passed in this countryâ s history the law provides a total of 386 billion for climate and energy issues including 271 billion in clean energy tax credits and incentives 40 billion to reduce air pollution and fund clean energy and infrastructure projects 35 billion in conservation and rural development and 27 billion for a greenhouse gas reduction fund that will award grants to national and local green energy and electrification projects this law provides significant incentives for large and small businesses as well as for consumers to adopt more low carbon energy initiatives it also specifically provides funding for disadvantaged communities to help grant them access to clean technologies and fight against the effects of climate change current modeling predicts that instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 27 from 2005 levels by 2030 the us could potentially be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 42 from 2005 levels by 2030 because of the climate provisions in the ira what brookings work have you done on these issues one example is our recent article on permitting reform which discusses that the u s needs to clear major regulatory delays and enable an unprecedentedly rapid build out of solar wind and electric transmission infrastructure to fully realize the benefits of funding from the inflation reduction act and meet the biden administrationâ s climate goals permitting obstacles include local and state government delays as well as a long list of federal permits and reviews that can take many years to complete another example is our explainer video on climate risk from homeowners in flood prone areas facing rising home insurance rates to corporations facing pressure to disclose climate risks nearly everyone is exposed to climate risks understanding and proactively mitigating these risks is critical to protecting people and places from climate change how do you see these issues evolving in 2023 with a divided incoming congress i do not see much room for additional climate legislation to pass a bipartisan compromise on permitting reform with concessions to the left on environmental protection and to the right on fossil fuel infrastructure seems unlikely but remains possible this will essentially mean that with much of the grant money set aside in the inflation reduction act still to be allocated regulatory agencies such as the department of energy the department of transportation and the environmental protection agency will play an even more significant role in implementing climate regulation in 2023 this is why in addition to continuing to perform research on permitting reform as well as tracking climate regulation implemented by agencies looking at how ira money is allocated will be key in the next year other significant climate developments i anticipate in the near future include a final securities and exchange commission rule requiring climate risk disclosures by public companies and additional details from the epa on their cap and trade program for hydrofluorocarbons on the international front the recently announced provisional agreement on the european union carbon border adjustment mechanism cbam is a major development it will target imports of carbon intensive products functionally applying a carbon tax to imports to bring them into compliance with the euâ s climate ambitions the cbam will begin phase in in october 2023 and is likely to have significant impact globally back to top the brookings institution is financed through the support of a diverse array of foundations corporations governments individuals as well as an endowment a

the u s pipeline regulator launched a review this year of its special permits that waive certain operating requirements for pipelines following a government report into spills on tc energy nyse trp s keystone oil pipeline a source familiar with the matter said the review for u s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa highlights growing questions by legislators about whether such permits contribute to spills the most recent major spill occurred this month in rural kansas along keystone the only u s oil pipeline with a special permit to operate at higher pressure tc shut the 622 000 barrel per day pipeline which has been operating for 12 years after it spilled 14 000 barrels on dec 7 its third major spill in five years phmsa commissioned oak ridge national laboratory nyse lh a department of energy research institution to review special permits following a 2021 report on keystone accidents the source said laboratory spokesperson sara shoemaker declined to comment the review includes the program itself and individual permits including keystone s the source said the review began with a meeting between phmsa and the laboratory on aug 16 several months before keystone s latest spill tc has submitted a plan to restart the ruptured section of keystone in a statement the company said keystone s special permit was rigorously reviewed by government officials and pipeline experts and its terms did not cause past incidents the 2021 report to congress by the u s government accountability office gao found that tc energy performed worse than nationwide averages in the previous five years due to major spills in 2017 and 2019 phmsa allowed keystone to run at higher pressure than other pipelines starting in 2017 subject to 51 conditions the latest keystone spill raises doubts about whether phmsa adequately assesses risk in granting special permits said don deaver a pipeline consultant i don t think they should give any special permits deaver said there s problems with the rules we ve already got pipelines operate at very high stress levels and they have very low tolerance for mechanical damage or defects the 2017 keystone incident near amherst south dakota spilled 6 592 barrels of oil caused by a crack originating from damage during construction it s unlikely that phmsa can properly enforce special permit conditions for the vast pipeline industry said josh axelrod senior advocate at environmental group natural resources defense council i don t think phmsa is staffed to justify special permits because it s not a big regulator and is responsible for tens of thousands of miles of pipeline axelrod said if they re relying on industry self reporting or data it s in industry s best interest to keep their pipeline operating richard kuprewicz president of pipeline safety consulting company accufacts said he suspects a faulty weld joining two segments caused the kansas spill tc has not publicly identified a cause it probably has nothing to do with the special permit conditions kuprewicz said phmsa has denied 27 special permit applications since 2009 and approved 112 six of those denied applications were from tc energy more than any other company phmsa s reasons for denying permits range from tc not complying with existing conditions by failing to make regular patrols to phmsa deciding the permit request would not be safe source reuters

we are fortunate to live in galway and to have the burren within shouting distance some 15 000 hectares of a unique landscape that miraculously contain all the major habitats found on this island its limestone pavements pock marked and sharp as daggers chissled by centuries of frost and rain give way to islands of deep grass woods of entangled hazel holly and ash opening out into small lakes streams ferns and surprisingly cliffs an echo throws back your shout with alarming familiarity in winter in a tradition that has lasted at least 6 000 years farmers who live and thrive among this strangely fertile land drive their cattle up to the warm limestone fields the rock retains its summer heat in a natural rhythm of farming and biodiversity working hand in hand many of the impressive stone walled settlements found there are older than the great pyramid of giza a recent blow in was corcomroe abbey in the late 12th century there is probably no better way to explore this rewarding landscape which is a national park of conservation and public access than by walking just in time for our new year resolutions comes a highly recommended guide by three men who share their enjoyment and sense of discovery in their book our burren walks by patrick mcginley tim o connell and eddie joyce a gift at 15 they outline 12 walks none of them difficult and all offering extraordinary views and opportunities to see many of the wild flowers nurtured among the warm limestone that attract visitors from all over europe if it is spectacle you want then you and your family can marvel at the sight of the cliffs of moher as you set out from doolin on a path which in places runs along its edge leave your car at doolin and follow the marked trail clearly identified where it brought us close enough to the cliff edges to enjoy the full impact of the height of these sheer cliffs with the atlantic pounding away at the base at that height you are almost level with the gulls and gannets their shrieks and screams filling the air sharing the drama of their continuous pursuit of food in the rich waters below off to the right the walker can see inis oírr the easternmost of the aran islands on the entrance to galway bay it is totally exhilarating along the trail you may see wild navelwort or pennywort which is edible and a clump of sea pink with its intense pink colour contrasting with the sea below a good turning point on the walk is the visitor centre one of ireland s most popular attractions where picnic tables offer a welcome rest returning along the trail again the view of the cliffs is spectacular and this time o connor s gastro pub in doolin offers warmth and great food a welcome reward after that adventure other walks include fanore to black head green road easy the green road to abbey hill spectacular the flaggy shore easy the carran termon loop a hill walk and the challenging mullaghmore hill walk that you may for a moment think you are moon walking so strange is the layered landscape apart from the wild flowers all of which are illustrated in the book the burren offers worthwhile attractions such as the burren perfumery offering organic perfumes cosmetics and soaps many made from wild flowers the gort river walk along the town s winding river and for those who feel they deserve a treat there is the hazel mountain chocolate factory and shop that somehow every child in ireland knows how to find stories from past generations in the 1930s irish schoolchildren were tasked with asking their oldest relatives and neighbours about stories and superstitions from times past so that ordinary people s lives could be preserved and celebrated it was a brilliant idea what those schoolchildren wrote in their copybooks resulted in the national folklore archive s schools collection a fascinating insight into the ways and imaginations of past generations john creedon has selected the best of them in his an irish folklore treasury beautifully illustrated by brian gallagher on sale 25 there are incredible stories of self sufficiency from an era where everything was homemade the main meal of the day for the peasant countryman was flour milk and potatoes soap and candles were made by hand there are delightful memories of childhoods spent outdoors gathering nuts and berries playing tig and fishing and how folk remedies miraculous medals healers holy wells and pilgrimages kept people healthy given our weather it is easy to understand why the ancient people s of northern europe marked the passing of midwinter evergreen plants were considered special holly and ivy were brought indoors to ward off evil and as a symbol that life endured even when much of nature was dead or dormant the druids regarded mistletoe which flowers in winter as a symbol of life and fertility the tradition of kissing under the mistletoe is another nod to reproduction soon spring would emerge and the sap would rise again on st stephen s day young men boys and

killure one of the great irish newspapers in boston the boston pilot included a regular column looking for missing relatives or friends among the irish community the missing friends series became a

available in a large book format an emigration article tracks the progress of 150 people who departed for america between 1884 and 1932 but a major thrust of the book a veritable bible of information is on the families of the parish 40 in all which covers their history from earliest records right up to the 1970s the book provides an invaluable documented genealogical record of the area photographs of the people and a proud legacy for present and future generations the killure heritage group are to be congratulated on this magnificent achievement copies of the book costing 25 from or local bookshops a star is born orson welles considered to be among the greatest and most influential filmmakers of all time actually learned some of his craft when he washed up in galway in august 1931 it appears he was a troubled teenager of 16 years who had inherited money following the death of his parents some years previously he arrived in galway bay on board the liner ss baltic and expecting to find galwegians living in huts was surprised to find a busy town and some interesting people he had heard about the famous writer padraic o conaire who had died some years previously and was intrigued that o conaire had travelled the roads of connemara on a donkey and cart writing about all he saw and encountered by chance he met padraic s brother isaac who was intrigued to hear that orson wanted to follow padraic s footsteps and helped him buy a cart and a donkey and the young man set out on his adventure this extraordinary story is taken from the latest st patrick s magazine edited by historian william henry which for the past 50 years has been published every christmas and contains a number of unusual and interesting stories many supplied by people of the east city parish contributors include peter rabbitt jacqueline o brien peadar o dowd brendan mcgowan marita silke liam ferrie dáire crowe tom kenny lisa henry and maeve rabbitt quite a gathering of literary stock orson named the donkey sheeog slept in the open by turf fires if the weather permitted william henry believes that those must have been somewhat lonely and strange days for an american boy at the time but it is said that wandering through connemara brought him healing from whatever it was he was running away from he eventually reached clifden sold his donkey and cart and headed back to galway by train he was a new man he visited the aran islands learned irish dancing and enjoyed his time there when orson came back to galway he visited the taibhdhearc theatre became friends with one of the actors went to dublin and the gate theatre where he introduced himself to it founders michael macliammóir and hilton edwards they were astonished at the confidence of the good looking orson who introduced himself as the star of the new york theatre he was immediately given the lead part in an historical romantic play and received a standing ovation on its opening night the rest as they say really really is history galway noir no adult christmas stocking should not be without ken bruen s latest galway noir callous it rattles along with the most ghastly murders delivered in a style which

the vhf radio call comes early in the morning i ve spotted a mother humpback with a young one who s dragging a bunch of nets or something the excited sport fisherman says immediately afterwards the coast guard makes a call to the marine mammal incident reporting hotline the centre that manages reports on whale and other marine animal entanglements in turn the hotline quickly reaches paul cottrell british columbia s only certified whale disentangler in less than two hours after the sighting a floatplane deposits paul and his gear in barkley sound on vancouver island s west coast knowing where the humpback is located and getting there are only the first steps of what it takes to dislodge the debris entangling this young whale says paul a sturdy highly energetic 52 year old i was lucky this time because fishery officers from port alberni s department of fisheries and oceans dfo were already on patrol in the sound i could jump from the plane onto their rigid hull inflatable boat rhib and swiftly get to the whales advertisement paul is always in a hurry to reach an entangled whale but once he arrives everything slows to a crawl we assess the situation and try to figure out how the whale is entangled he explains is there a line in its mouth ropes binding the fins or the fluke are crab or prawn traps attached is a gillnet wrapped around vital parts could the animal be hogtied with lines trussing him from mouth to tail is it injured often it s hard to see the entanglement s configuration when an anxious whale dives and stays down patience is key in recent years technologies designed to help assess an entanglement have evolved underwater cameras can reveal how and where the whale is entwined although they may also frighten the animal more recently drones have helped see how ropes have snagged the mammal we can watch and freeze the drone s images on the computer keep our distance and probe the entanglement puzzle before moving in close paul explains in barkley sound it s the tail stock of the one year old male humpback that s trapped first paul and his colleagues carefully and slowly attach a releasable working line to the debris dragging behind the whale which in turn connects to a float on the rhib a satellite buoy with a built in locator and more buoys are attached to the working line to slow and tire the whale we had to watch both the calf and the mother says paul the calf was pulling us at about five knots the mother was agitated and worried about her slowed down son and our proximity and remember the whale may be young but he s still 20 feet long and weighs tons advertisement then the really hard work begins the whale pulling debris and the rhib grows weary fortunately winds are light and the waves insignificant bending over the bow and bouncing only a bit paul attaches several grapples to the ropes entangling the tail so that when a line is severed but only partially disentangles the animal the team can cut away the remaining strings still gnawing at the tail paul and his mates use 30 foot carbon poles with special cutting grapplers to slice through the tough rope as we closed in we could see the tail had raw bloody patches says paul he d been dragging this load for quite a while and it had scored his flesh deeply we worried about infection five hours after beginning the disentanglement they cut away the last piece of line it was a total of eight wraps says paul when the last bit of rope lets go the whale swims free apparently as relieved as paul who s been pitched over the rhib s pontoons for hours after a disentanglement i m sore for days he says sawing away at the last 20 feet is the most dangerous portion of the disentanglement because the lead cutter is closest to the animal who may sense being freed soon and take off paul explains it s a high adrenaline high energy job yet you must remain calm but it s absolute euphoria once you ve successfully liberated a whale despite the joy the team feels at freeing the young whale the job isn t complete they must fish out the trash the whale has been dragging later analysis shows it s a bundle of three commercial crab traps from washington state the first was single line with a trap but the other two were all balled up says paul we don t know if the first trap attached to the others while afloat or if the whale picked up the first and then caught the two bundled traps but we know there was lots of line lots of drag the whole thing weighed hundreds of pounds squeezing into that poor tail the good news is that the calf was seen a year later in good health but with a big scar the best job in the world this is how paul describes his whale disentangling profession one he seemingly has been preparing for from childhood growing up on salt spring island he got an early taste for the sea from his log salvage beachcomber father from there he naturally progressed to earning bachelor s and master s degrees in marine biology at simon fraser and the university of victoria respectively all his co op terms were spent in nautical environments during one co op he worked with michael bigg the founder of modern research on killer whales and orca specialist graeme ellis i was lucky to work with graeme ellis he says he taught me a lot on how to work safely and effectively with marine mammals in the field after graduating he joined fisheries and oceans canada dfo full time and has performed many tasks since i started with poop scooping he says collecting scat for analysis of what seals and sea lions eat i got my early training in catching and releasing marine mammals by attaching radio tags to seals to record their diving depths and foraging behaviour he served as fish cop monitoring fisheries openings and closings and as policy coordinator for whale watching fleets he teaches indigenous groups they re frequent entangled whale spotters how to attach a satellite buoy that ll track an animal dragging debris as well as safe boat handling near the leviathan he s been the marine mammal coordinator since 2007 for the large whale rescues i learned by doing paul says there was no one from dfo before me who led whale rescues because entanglements were much less common 15 to 20 years ago i fluked into the work he says rolling his eyes at his pun paul is adamant the public should never attempt any aspect of disentanglement he cites youtube videos that show guys diving into the water and singlehandedly cutting away lines it s extremely dangerous he says we never enter the water an amateur can get tangled up himself and drown or a frightened animal can drown him the right equipment is crucial we have gear packs with helmets various knives grapplers with blade attachments long carbon poles buoys drones gopro cameras we attach satellite buoys that can track the whale if it takes off we stash gear in several places around bc for quick access and we have patience and long experience even with experience whale disentangling is risky paul describes the death of joe howlett a long term expert whale disentangler who in the gulf of st lawrence last year was smashed by the tail of a right whale moments after howlett had freed the lines enmeshing the animal howlett died from blunt force trauma the accident reverberated throughout the marine mammal expert community he also tells me a tale of how an un helpful powerboater hindered a rescue a makah research trip near neah bay in washington state had spotted an entangled grey whale they d attached a vhf transmitter to track its travels it moved north to vancouver island paul got the call and hopped on a floatplane to vancouver island s west coast suddenly the vhf signal remained stationary near nitinat a recreational boater catching sight of the whale and thinking the buoy distressed it had cut off the device luckily a parks canada crew located the grey whale and the same powerboater rushed paul to the site the whale s tail had become trapped by fishing gear of japanese origin the lines had floats so degraded we think the animal had been lugging the rubbish around for years says paul it had 20 wraps around its tail you can imagine how the animal turned and twisted to rid itself of the debris but only wound it further we were incredibly relieved to be able to amputate all those lines like the humpback calf we had sightings of this grey whale later and it was moving well but this episode shows that people s best intentions cutting the buoy could have led to a whale s continued suffering or even death not all whale disentanglements are successful in 2018 35 entangled marine mammal reports were filed with 19 confirmed paul and his colleagues disentangled seven humpbacks and two orcas with a few partial extrications the others were never found they may have moved out far into the pacific says paul they might have managed to disentangle themselves or they drowned because they were too entangled too far gone one whale was liberated twice in three weeks paul was in robson bight on northeastern vancouver island on a research trip in a rhib when he heard the vhf radio crackle it s a beeg beeg feesh caught here said the prawn fisherman in broken english in whose traps the young male humpback was ensnared paul sped across the strait to knight inlet with other dfo personnel where they found the humpback with a prawn line holding 50 traps caught in its mouth it s a baleen whale says paul with that cable through its mouth it can t filter feed and it ll starve these prawn traps are tied together creating a train of several hundred metres we worked from the back toward the whale and were able to remove seven traps but it grew dark and we didn t have a satellite tag only large buoys to mark the animal says paul the whale nicknamed twister in the marine education and research humpback research database took off i had the worst sleep of my life worrying that we might not find him again putting out calls on the vhf radio the team searched for hours until coast guard radio notified them of a sighting farther north in queen charlotte sound on site the team again chopped the prawn traps trailing behind the whale one by one until at its mouth one final cut liberated the whale shockingly twister again caught a prawn trap line in its mouth exactly three weeks later he d returned to his foraging in knight inlet says paul this time he was anchored to the bottom and circling again the call came into the 24 hour marine mammal incident hotline and i took a floatplane hop from vancouver dfo personnel had already arrived on site in a rhib with gear aboard twister s strength brought the traps up near the surface and we could move up the line severing them one at a time after many hours we reached twister s mouth and with one final slash freed him again he s been seen regularly since and is faring well paul is a member of the international whaling commission expert global whale entanglement response group this expert group works as a collective to advance safe disentanglement techniques equipment innovation and training methods to effectively and safely disentangle large whales the group shares what they ve learned from their disentanglement successes and failures to minimize marine mammal entanglements around the world although this is the best job in the world says paul our eventual goal is to eliminate it to literally work ourselves out of a job

earlier this month the white house s top energy advisor amos hochstein called shale drillers un american for their refusal to boost oil production despite the administrations multiple calls to that effect now the industry is striking back pioneer natural resources ceo scott sheffield one of the most outspoken industry executives has indirectly explained to the white house that shale drillers will not be drilling more and that is it and he had an excellent reason for it speaking to the financial times in an interview sheffield said that returning to production growth now would cause an outflow of investors and energy stocks will plummet to the bottom of the stock market and this is why no public oil driller would do it you ve got to realise when you produce a 2 per cent return on capital employed you end up being at the bottom of the s p 500 sheffield told the ft and so if we end up doing what he s asking us to do we ll end up back at the bottom of the s p 500 investor pressure for higher returns has been one of the reasons given by both industry and analysts for the current unwillingness of the u s shale oil industry to start ramping up output the way it always did in the past when prices rose these investors have been watching for years how shale drillers burn their cash in order to turn the united states in the biggest oil producer in the world then they had to watch all this breakdown in 2020 with oil prices dropping below zero for the first time in history even though the drop was a short one related yergin oil prices could break 120 if china overcomes covid now two years later things are very different both with oil prices and with shale drillers no company seems to have the ambition to see just how much oil it can produce if it puts its mind and resources to it instead shale drillers are relearning capital discipline and prioritizing their shareholders after one might say years of neglect as a result the ft points out in its story on the interview with sheffield energy stocks have become the best performers on the stock market this year it is unlikely that any energy company would risk this performance just to respond to the calls of an administration that has from the start been against the whole oil industry yet there are also purely practical constraints as well as sheffield noted in his talk with the ft oilfield services cost a lot more than they did a couple of years ago and there are equipment shortages he was criticising the majors and independents for not growing more he doesn t realise if we wanted to grow more than 5 per cent i d have to call up all the service contractors they re going to charge me 30 to 40 per cent more it s going to take a year to build new equipment it s going to take two years to start showing results by that time you may go through an oil price collapse sheffield explained indeed messaging from the white house to the oil industry has had a remarkably short horizon the focus being on the present and involving the apparent assumption that with a bit of good will the industry could add another million barrels daily to output in a matter of days for now however this is physically impossible and threats of windfall profits have not helped put drillers in a more generous mood neither has the much softer message that came last week from energy secretary granholm we are eager to work with you she told an industry association acknowledging that oil and gas were going to be used for a long time yet and admitting the energy transition if it happens too fast could have unintended consequences that hurt people cause backlash advertisement this olive branch as bloomberg called it might be a positive sign in itself but it is unlikely to change shale drillers minds there is simply no good reason for them to drill more and the administration cannot give them one by irina slav for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

growing up with less has not stopped dan symons from reaching for the stars from the age of seven the canadian from the small town of peterborough in ontario delivered newspapers so he did not have to burden his family at 15 he got a job working part time at the local grocery store between that and student loans he put himself through university and graduated with an honours b a from concordia university in montreal with hardship hard work follows while that may not always be the case for symons the mantra rang true it instilled in him a strong work ethic fifteen years after his introduction to the industry extracting minerals from the earth he is today the president and chief executive officer of c3 metals inc tsx v cccm otc carcf a junior mineral exploration company listed on the toronto stock exchange it still surprises me a little bit but i have a very strong work ethic i think that also comes from my background i come from a fairly low income family i worked part time and i borrowed all the money to put myself through university and then paid back all the student loans i have been supporting myself basically since i moved out of my parents house the week before i turned 18 and never asked for a penny and never got one offered to me you have to learn you learn a strong work ethic he told proactive in this article fresh out of university symons knew very little about the mining industry when he joined renmark financial communications a leading north american investor relations firm when i entered the industry 15 years ago i did not have a background in mining looking back now it was like a paid internship into the mining industry the firm was representing over 60 different mining companies anywhere from 10 plus billion market cap producing companies down to small exploration stage companies like c3 metals is today but i was also a bit of a nerd i really became passionate about it and i would go home and i would read technical reports in the evening just for fun some of it was self taught mostly i asked a lot of questions and i had some really strong mentors throughout my career he said symons spent three years at renmark before joining romarco minerals inc in 2010 he was last at argonaut gold where he spent six years symons held corporate and business development and investor relations roles at the junior mid tier growth companies c3 metals wasn t the first company that offered him a chief executive position but it was the first that interested him enough to conduct due diligence on the company and to hold multiple meetings with the board and the vice president for exploration stephen hughes the exploration company holds the 26 800 hectare jasperoide copper gold project in the prolific andahuaylas yauri belt in southern peru it also owns 100 interest in five licenses covering 20 700 hectares of highly prospective copper gold terrain in jamaica and a 2 royalty in tocvan ventures rogers creek project in british columbia canada with the help of a trusted geologist whom he had previously worked with symons signed a confidentiality agreement with c3 metals and pored over the data on the projects at this early stage of the company it is highly speculative but we really liked what we saw the prospects are about as good as they can get for this stage they passed with a very strong check mark coincidentally while conducting due diligence c3 metals made a grassroots copper gold silver discovery at the 6 000 hectare arthurs seat project in jamaica and that sealed it for symons he wanted the opportunity to help grow the business from exploration to production location of c3 metals projects eager to see the discovery through to production symons accepted the offer and clocked on for his first day of work on september 6 2022 a little more than three months into the job now the ceo has identified an area that requires fixing to improve work performance company culture as the captain of the ship symons believes the company needs a mission statement to define its goals and strategy and a clear structure to provide employees with a sense of purpose there are certainly some cultural changes that are needed but they don t happen quickly we are a fairly small corporate team and we have people on the ground both in peru and jamaica there is a lack of structure and clear communication within the broader company on areas such as what are our goals and objectives our targets or key performance indicators there hasn t been much of that we have people with different ideas of what is important what i have always done is to build a budget based on what we would like to do for the year get that budget approved by the board and once you have that provide very measurable targets and objectives that flow down the entire organisation so that people know what are the focus areas and what is important to the company that sort of system is not in place yet but it will be coming into place here early in 2023 what is refreshing about someone like symons fronting a junior minerals exploration company is his ability to make technical information easy to understand as drill results are hugely important for junior explorers such as c3 metals symons understands it is necessary to be able to plead the company s value proposition to investors who may not have the technical ability to interpret complex data sets i know enough geology to be dangerous but certainly not enough throughout my career one of my skill sets has been speaking to the people within the organisation who are highly technical and being able to wrap my head around what they are saying and then being able to communicate that to a more general audience for this stage of the company that is very important when we go into meetings with investors 80 of the time they re not geologists so you can t get overly technical if you want to talk geology you have to find ways to create metaphors or analogues in order for them to wrap their minds around the concept with the other 20 of meetings that we go into you will have people who are trained because geologists are now working with investment firms focusing on natural resource investments as soon as i know that this is the case i will hand the meeting over to vp of exploration steve hughes because he can speak at a much more technical level than i can with that audience one can hear the passion in symons voice when he speaks about leaving a legacy within the communities where the company is operating we are always visitors in these areas and deposits are not infinite they are finite they will be mined out someday we need to put up the right foundations to make sure that all stakeholders benefit for generations to come people don t always see this side of it but i have been fortunate enough to be part of new mines coming into development in areas and communities that are fairly economically depressed when you see a whole generation of people get lifted out of poverty and kids now having the chance to go to school and get the proper skills and training to improve their lives and the lives of their children and the multiple generations it is very powerful he said in peru c3 metals has animal husbandry programs in place for the communities within its projects it also helps with sourcing clean water from wells making improvements to schools and other related initiatives the company doesn t yet have a community engagement plan in jamaica but with the recent grassroots discovery and the granting of exploration drilling permit at the arthurs seat project symons is keen to partner with local universities to create courses where students can be employed in mining companies when they graduate we want to focus on children and education in the areas where we can i would like to see us partner with jamaican universities to help create courses that will end up training people for exactly what we would need they would get an education and with that a career path there will be scholarships that will go along with it it is obvious why symons has chosen to focus on children and education in jamaica there is no doubt his own childhood experience had a large part to play in the decision symons spends his free time with his wife of 14 years and daughters aged 10 and six living in the city they try to spend as much of their leisure time as possible at their lake side property 200 kilometres northeast of toronto it is where i take my daughters canoeing and fishing and in the winter ice skating and sledding and all the fun outdoor things he said like every torontonian symons is a big fan of baseball and follows the blue jays he played for his university and continued playing after he graduated but gave it up eventually for his career he reads too i m a big fan of literature i ve read a lot and still do catcher in the rye and a year in provence are the two books that have had the most profound impact on me i think most people will probably be surprised by that article by julie goh

those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased spectrum purports to be a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring developing and commercializing novel and targeted oncology therapies the complaint alleges that before the class period defendants were conducting a phase 2 clinical trial called zenith20 the zenith20 trial was an ongoing multicenter multi cohort open label activity estimating study evaluating the anti tumor effects safety and tolerability of poziotinib or pozi in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc that have certain mutations her2 exon 20 insertion mutations and were previously treated with the standard of care before the class period the company had a pre nda meeting with the fda during which spectrum confirmed with the fda that cohort 2 data could serve as the basis of a new drug application nda submission in cohort 2 the objective response rate complete or partial response which are measures of whether tumors shrink or are eradicated after treatment was approximately 28 and the median duration of response was 5 1 months the her2 exon 20 insertion mutation occurs in 2 5 of patients with nsclc these patients are treated according to the same treatment paradigms as patients with advanced nsclc without these unique mutations however there is an apparent unmet need for these patients because they have a median overall survival of 1 6 1 9 years from the time of diagnosis according to defendants if approved poziotinib could address an unmet need of nsclc patients previously treated with the standard of care the complaint alleges that during the class period defendants represented the safety and efficacy data from the zenith20 trial were positive and that they had initiated the required confirmatory phase 3 study however unknown to investors this was not true as later revealed to investors the data submitted by defendants in support of the nda failed to show that pozi provided a meaningful advantage over available therapies and therefore was not likely to provide a clinical benefit during the class period the fda expressed concerns regarding pozi s safety and efficacy data and further the fda expressed concern that defendants phase 3 confirmatory trial which was required to be substantially enrolled at the time of aa had not enrolled a single patient during the class period the fda communicated to defendants that given the concerns regarding the totality of evidence supporting the nda the significant delay in confirming benefit with a randomized trial heightened the uncertainty around the risk benefit assessment of pozi starting on september 20 2022 before the market opened investors began to learn the truth when the fda oncologic drugs advisory committee odac released a briefing document in anticipation of its september 22 2022 meeting with defendants to review poziotinib odac is an independent panel of experts that reviews and evaluates data concerning the efficacy and safety of marketed and investigational products for use in the treatment of cancer the committee makes appropriate recommendations to the fda but these recommendations are not binding and the final decision regarding product approval will be made solely by the fda investors were surprised when despite the company s repeated representations during the class period that the data for zenith20 were positive the odac briefing document disclosed not only negative data on the safety and efficacy of pozi but also a failure by the company to enroll any patients in the required phase 3 confirmatory trial as a result of this news shares of spectrum common stock declined from a closing price of 1 06 per share on september 19 2022 to a close at 0 66 per share on september 20 2022 a decline of 0 40 per share or over 37 on heavier than usual volume then according to reuters on september 22 2022 before

in which defendant lebel participated during the meeting odac voted 9 4 not to recommend poziotinib for aa on september 23 2022 trading in spectrum common stock resumed as a result of this news shares of spectrum common stock further declined from a closing price of 0 63 per share on september 21 2022 before trading was halted to a close at 0 43 per share on september 23 2022 a decline of 0 20 per

no voters from the odac cited non meaningful benefit over existing therapies and cited dosing issues issues related to the phase 3 confirmatory trial for poziotinib were also raised as that study has not yet started the report further stated that we believe the odac vote is negative for potential approval of poziotinib we note that the fda does not have to follow the recommendations of the odac however the fda s views in the briefing documents and during the meeting do not bode well for approval in our opinion also on september 23 2022 jefferies released a report titled based on negative pozi adcom we anticipate crl next steps for pozi unclear the report noted adcom voted 9 4 that pozi benefits do not outweigh risks panel agreed w fda concerns on dosing lack of confirm trial progress

jonel aleccia the associated press a new federal law requiring that sesame be listed as an allergen on food labels is having unintended consequences increasing the number of products with the ingredient food industry experts said the requirements are so stringent that many manufacturers especially bakers find it simpler and less expensive to add sesame to a product and to label it than to try to keep it away from other foods or equipment with sesame as a result several companies including national restaurant chains like olive garden wendy s and chick fil a and bread makers that stock grocery shelves and serve schools are adding sesame to products that didn t have it before while the practice is legal consumers and advocates say it violates the spirit of the law aimed at making foods safer for people with allergies it was really exciting as a policy advocate and a mom to get these labels said naomi seiler a consultant with the asthma and allergy foundation of america whose 9 year old daughter zoe is allergic to sesame instead companies are intentionally adding the allergen to food the new law which goes into effect jan 1 requires that all foods made and sold in the u s must be labeled if they contain sesame which is now the nation s ninth major allergen sesame can be found in obvious places like sesame seeds on hamburger buns but it is also an ingredient in many foods from protein bars to ice cream added to sauces dips and salad dressings and hidden in spices and flavorings advocates for families coping with allergies lobbied for years to have sesame added to the list of major allergens congress in 2004 created labeling requirements for eight milk eggs fish shellfish tree nuts peanuts wheat and soybeans more than 1 6 million people in the u s are allergic to sesame some so severe that they need injections of epinephrine a drug used to treat life threatening reactions cases of sesame allergy have been rising in recent years along with a growing number of foods that contain the ingredient said dr ruchi gupta a pediatrician and director of the center for food allergy asthma research at northwestern university sesame is in so many things that people don t really understand said gupta who called the move to add sesame to products so disappointing in families that do have a sesame allergy it is truly challenging she said under the new law enforced by the food and drug administration companies must now explicitly label sesame as an ingredient or separately note that a product contains sesame in the u s ingredients are listed on product packaging in order of amount sesame labeling has been required for years in other places including canada europe australia and new zealand if the ingredients don t include sesame companies must take steps to prevent the foods from coming in contact with any sesame known as cross contamination food industry experts said the new requirements aren t simple or practical it s as if we ve suddenly asked bakers to go to the beach and remove all the sand said nathan mirdamadi a consultant with commercial food sanitation which advises the industry about food safety some companies include statements on labels that say a food may contain a certain product or that the food is produced in a facility that also uses certain allergens however such statements are voluntary not required according to the fda and they do not absolve the company of requirements to prevent cross contamination instead some companies have taken a different approach officials at olive garden said that starting this week the chain is adding a minimal amount of sesame flour to the company s famous breadsticks due to the potential for cross contamination at the bakery chick fil a has changed its white bun and multigrain brioche buns to include sesame while wendy s said the company has added sesame to its french toast sticks and buns united states bakery which operates franz family bakeries in california and the northwest notified customers in march that they would add a small amount of sesame flour to all hamburger and hot dog buns and rolls to mitigate the risk of any adverse reactions to sesame products although such actions don t violate the law the fda does not support them the agency said in a statement it would make it more difficult for sesame allergic customers to find foods that are safe for them to consume the statement said some large companies previously have added other allergens to products and updated their labels in 2016 kellogg s added traces of peanut flour to some cookies and crackers prompting protests that s frustrating and scary for parents like kristy fitzgerald of crookston minnesota she learned last spring that pan o gold baking co which supplies breads to schools health centers and grocery stores across the midwest was adding small amounts of sesame to its products including those served at her daughter s school six year old audrey in the meantime has outgrown her allergy to sesame bob huebner food safety quality assurance manager for pan o gold told fitzgerald in a string of emails that the company was forced to add sesame to the product and the label the unfortunate reality is that our equipment and bakeries are not setup for allergen cleanings that would be required to prevent sesame cross contamination and was not an option for us huebner wrote in an email to fitzgerald huebner replied to an email from the ap but did not respond to questions about the company s practices fitzgerald started an online petition protesting the move to add sesame at some point someone is going to feed an allergic child sesame fitzgerald said it makes me think the laws need to change to show that this is not an acceptable practice

local bias explains a phenomenon in investing in which people concentrate their portfolios in their own country only one nation s stock market can perform the best which means investors everywhere else are making a mistake apparently it exists in residential brokerage as well a compass survey of its agents found nearly 70 percent predicted home prices in their areas would increase next year even as almost 80 percent said prices would stagnate or decline nationally some local bias was evident in brokers prediction about sales volume as well as 22 5 percent predicted it would grow in their area but only 15 9 percent said it would grow nationally the more than 440 compass brokers who responded were also bullish on cities and thought the northeast would slightly outperform a slowing national market in 2023 compass ceo robert reffkin took a pessimistic view in the company s third quarter earnings call during which he said 2022 was a generationally bad year in residential real estate the past 12 months have been tough and the next 18 months appear that they can be tougher he said adding that does not think the market will contract by 25 percent as some have predicted leonard steinberg one of compass top manhattan brokers was more optimistic sign up for the undefined newsletter sign up in 2023 we may see a mirror image of 2022 a somewhat trying first half that gives way to a surprisingly strong back half of the year he said in a press release about the survey the would be buyers that stepped back from the market in late 2022 can t and won t stay away forever especially given the competing demands from first time buyers looking to get into the market and retirees looking to move or downsize although two thirds of compass brokers share reffkin s pessimism about the national market which they predict will have somewhat or much fewer home sales in 2023 a majority said people will continue to return to cities buyers they believe will be drawn to shared amenities as they grow less worried about covid and will need to return to cities in response to return to office policies they also believe large yards a big draw during the lockdown period of the pandemic will fade in popularity if they re right it could mean business remains relatively in line with 2022 levels for brokers in major cities while their suburban and rural counterparts see their commission pools decline perhaps not coincidentally compass business is concentrated in luxury markets roughly 70 percent predicted that sales volume and price growth in the northeast which includes new england new york new jersey and pennsylvania will stay roughly in line with or modestly outperform the national market brokers forecast that the southeast will be the strongest market next year it was the only region where a majority of respondents believe sales and prices will exceed the national average the southeast includes south carolina through florida and extends west to the mississippi river as the market normalizes we expect the population in the southeast to continue to grow fueled by a tax friendly environment and opportunities for job growth said jeff polashuk compass regional vice president for florida this continued demand will position the southeast for another decent year

to more than 1 billion last year helping to make america the company s no 2 market after china midea is keeping its options open on a new north american plant and plans to increase the number of its u s headquarters staff next year by 20 from the current 173 midea america president kurt jovais said in a recent interview in new york the u s is the major growth engine in the midea portfolio jovais said even in the shorter term where we re seeing a temporary softening of demand we still expect to see a lot of growth the fact that we have such a significant share in china means that midea group is looking globally for the vast majority of its growth to be coming from he noted that s why we re seeing all of the investment in research and development and expanding our marketing workforce and logistics jovais said behind jovais optimism changing technology and designs that open the door for buyers to try out brands such as midea s there s also midea s in house manufacturing heft it makes everything from air conditioners to dishwashers there are a lot of people who make a refrigerator or a range but not the whole suite jovais said there s obviously a cost advantage to making items internally it also helps get products into the market faster he said midea s localization efforts notably include the hiring of jovais himself a texas raised american with more than two decades of experience in the appliance industry unlike many of midea s overseas businesses the u s operation is set up as a subsidiary not a joint venture this is a pure 100 midea business he said noting the contribution of a louisville research center of more than 60 staff that comes up with products for american tastes among the company s marketing efforts aimed at u s consumers is an ad campaign featuring cheerful actor sam richardson that plays on midea s name by pronouncing it is as my idea richardson claims credit for innovations such a portable air conditioner by himself by the company or both depending on how you view it it was a great success jovais said midea sells its goods into walmart and amazon among other chains midea midea traces its roots to 1968 when main founder he xiangjian led a group of 23 residents from the town of beijiao in guangdong province to form a lid production workshop that became midea it s come a long way since global sales in the first half totaled 26 2 billion overwhelmingly from its big home market midea s shares trade on the shenzhen stock exchange where its market exceeds 50 billion whirlpool s by contrast is 7 billion midea has more than 166 000 employees globally foreign investors include the canadian pension plan and singapore s temasek fullerton alpha the company s former chairman he xiangjian 80 ranked no 7 on the forbes china rich list unveiled in november with a fortune worth 24 8 billion midea is run by a non family member ceo paul fang who is also a billionaire worth 1 2 billion foshan headquartered midea ranked no 219 on forbes global 2000 ranking of the world s top listed companies this year he s son he jianfeng is heir apparent in leading the business jovais joined midea in 2015 he had earlier been at samsung for nearly a decade and a half joining the korean company in 2001 as a strategy consultant after earning a mba at columbia and an earlier stint at pwc management in washington d c in 1994 99 he worked with samsung in seoul and australia before moving to new york as vice president of marketing with the company from 2009 to 2014 it was at samsung that he fell in love with appliances jovais said there s a lot of emotion that is actually tied up in a washing machine or refrigerator it s more than the utility of it it s how people perceive how they care for the family there s status associated with it there are a lot of complex emotions coming from a marketing background i like that jovais took up the challenge of working with a chinese newcomer because of the shared belief with the company that it could be a disruptor in a relatively stable appliance market the u s appliance sales had gone through a period of upheaval about 10 15 years ago when the koreans came in he said then things had kind of settled down a little bit when a manufacturer like midea comes in and says hey we want to enter with our own brand with our own clout with the clout that we have as an organization it was very exciting to me to see digitalization and other changes are creating new opportunities today believes jovais who runs the u s business from a headquarters in parsippany new jersey vcg via getty images though midea makes robots and other industrial products midea america is focused on smart products for the home including room air conditioners that marquee for the midea brand is no 1 in the u s based on dollar and unit sales according to the npd group retail tracking service for the year through aug 2022 jovais called out the company s research hub in louisville kentucky where it employs 63 staff for much of its success in winning u s shoppers local knowledge is key because consumers differ worldwide he noted the appliance space specifically is so specific to the local market with different technologies favored in different markets he said people in the u s use refrigerators differently than people in europe for instance induction cooking in europe is very very commonplace here it s still very niche very premium even though it s a superior cooking technology it s hard to find an oven in the chinese kitchen one of the bigger drivers in the u s is size american products just tend to be bigger we have more space and we tend to buy a lot more in bulk we re shopping bulk versus making multiple grocery trips for the week which means you have a different storage need jovais said asia is clearly the early adopter of technology americans tend to be a bit slow in uptake of new technology that i think is borne out because of a proliferation of gimmickry and a concern about the longevity of any type of technology especially in the appliance space where a lot of these appliances are going to be in your home for seven to 10 years he is particularly hopeful about smart home appliances that will eventually become more common in clothing tags floor cleaning and home temperature control smart items will account for 25 of midea s major appliance and air treatment sales in 2023 up from an overall 8 for all items sold in the u s this year jovais believes will all of that sensor laden manufacturing lead midea to invest in semiconductors as have auto makers we re going to see midea investing in semiconductor capacity somewhere midea has a history of being highly vertically integrated but i can t speak to what are the plans around semiconductors jovais said midea group the covid pandemic in the past three years was fortuitous in a business sense because people have been spending more time at home or remodeling on the other hand it highlighted supply chain vulnerabilities to that end wouldn t local manufacturing in the u s help i asked we re always looking at our options jovais said we believe that we have a very strong growth path in north america the biggest benefit however would be shortening the supply chain inventory sitting on a ship doesn t do anybody any good if we can shorten that supply chain and respond more quickly to retailer needs we can have a little bit of a bullwhip effect he said the shorter and shorter that we make that supply chain the better it is for us midea has also gained despite trump era tariffs on some of its china manufactured goods jovais said i think that we ve learned how to deal with that that being said i think that a lot of people would say that free trade wins in the end and for now he believes that s how most consumers view their appliance purchases consumers are smart and practical and most understand that the world is a very globalized place and whatever you buy is going to be coming from anywhere he said more manufacturing in north america could be a hedge that buyers don t change their minds see related posts china gdp growth poised to outperform world average in 2023 pwc

new york ny accesswire december 21 2022 pomerantz llp announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against spectrum pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq sppi and certain officers the class action filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york and docketed under 22 cv 10677 is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons and entities other than defendants that purchased or otherwise acquired if you are a shareholder who purchased or otherwise acquired affirm securities during the class period you have until february 3 2023 to ask the court to appoint you as lead plaintiff for the class a copy of the complaint can be obtained at www pomerantzlaw com to discuss this action contact robert s willoughby at or 888 476 6529 or 888 4 pomlaw toll free ext 7980 those who inquire by e mail are encouraged to include their mailing address telephone number and the number of shares purchased spectrum purports to be a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring developing and commercializing novel and targeted oncology therapies the complaint alleges that before the class period defendants were conducting a phase 2 clinical trial called zenith20 the zenith20 trial was an ongoing multicenter multi cohort open label activity estimating study evaluating the anti tumor effects safety and tolerability of poziotinib or pozi in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc that have certain mutations her2 exon 20 insertion mutations and were previously treated with the standard of care before the class period the company had a pre nda meeting with the fda during which spectrum confirmed with the fda that cohort 2 data could serve as the basis of a new drug application nda submission in cohort 2 the objective response rate complete or partial response which are measures of whether tumors shrink or are eradicated after treatment was approximately 28 and the median duration of response was 5 1 months the her2 exon 20 insertion mutation occurs in 2 5 of patients with nsclc these patients are treated according to the same treatment paradigms as patients with advanced nsclc without these unique mutations however there is an apparent unmet need for these patients because they have a median overall survival of 1 6 1 9 years from the time of diagnosis according to defendants if approved poziotinib could address an unmet need of nsclc patients previously treated with the standard of care the complaint alleges that during the class period defendants represented the safety and efficacy data from the zenith20 trial were positive and that they had initiated the required confirmatory phase 3 study however unknown to investors this was not true as later revealed to investors the data submitted by defendants in support of the nda failed to show that pozi provided a meaningful advantage over available therapies and therefore was not likely to provide a clinical benefit during the class period the fda expressed concerns regarding pozi s safety and efficacy data and further the fda expressed concern that defendants phase 3 confirmatory trial which was required to be substantially enrolled at the time of aa had not enrolled a single patient during the class period the fda communicated to defendants that given the concerns regarding the totality of evidence supporting the nda the significant delay in confirming benefit with a randomized trial heightened the uncertainty around the risk benefit assessment of pozi starting on september 20 2022 before the market opened investors began to learn the truth when the fda oncologic drugs advisory committee odac released a briefing document in anticipation of its september 22 2022 meeting with defendants to review poziotinib odac is an independent panel of experts that reviews and evaluates data concerning the efficacy and safety of marketed and investigational products for use in the treatment of cancer the committee makes appropriate recommendations to the fda but these recommendations are not binding and the final decision regarding product approval will be made solely by the fda investors were surprised when despite the company s repeated representations during the class period that the data for zenith20 were positive the odac briefing document disclosed not only negative data on the safety and efficacy of pozi but also a failure by the company to enroll any patients in the required phase 3 confirmatory trial as a result of this news shares of spectrum common stock declined from a closing price of 1 06 per share on september 19 2022 to a close at 0 66 per share on september 20 2022 a decline of 0 40 per share or over 37 on heavier than usual volume then according to reuters on september 22 2022 before

in which defendant lebel participated during the meeting odac voted 9 4 not to recommend poziotinib for aa on september 23 2022 trading in spectrum common stock resumed as a result of this news shares of spectrum common stock further declined from a closing price of 0 63 per share on september 21 2022 before trading was halted to a close at 0 43 per share on september 23 2022 a decline of 0 20 per

no voters from the odac cited non meaningful benefit over existing therapies and cited dosing issues issues related to the phase 3 confirmatory trial for poziotinib were also raised as that study has not yet started the report further stated that we believe the odac vote is negative for potential approval of poziotinib we note that the fda does not have to follow the recommendations of the odac however the fda s views in the briefing documents and during the meeting do not bode well for approval in our opinion also on september 23 2022 jefferies released a report titled based on negative pozi adcom we anticipate crl next steps for pozi unclear the report noted adcom voted 9 4 that pozi benefits do not outweigh risks panel agreed w fda concerns on dosing lack of confirm trial progress

incongruence b w 16mg qd dose under review and confirmatory trial s 8mg bid 2 lack of confirmatory trial progress w no pts enrolled as of yet and data likely not until 2026 increasing risk to pts on
