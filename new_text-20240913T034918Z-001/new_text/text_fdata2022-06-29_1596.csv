san francisco bloomberg tesla laid off hundreds of workers on its autopilot team as the electric vehicle ev maker shuttered a california facility according to people familiar with the matter surprisingly the majority of those who were let go were hourly workers said the people as recently as last week chief executive officer elon musk had outlined plans to cut 10 per cent of salaried staff but said he d be increasing hourly jobs teams at the san mateo office were tasked with evaluating customer vehicle data related to the autopilot driver assistance features and performing so called data labeling many of the staff were data annotation specialists all of which are hourly positions one of the people said about 200 workers were let go in total according to the people prior to the cuts the office had about 350 employees some of whom were already transferred to a nearby facility in recent weeks tesla didn t immediately respond to a request for comment tesla is trimming its ranks after a surge in hiring in recent years the company now based in austin texas had grown to about 100 000 employees globally as it built new factories in austin and berlin mr musk caught workers by surprise earlier this month when he said layoffs would be necessary in an increasingly shaky economic environment he clarified in an interview with bloomberg that about 10 per cent of salaried employees would lose their jobs over the next three months though the overall headcount could be higher in a year the ev market leader s downsizing efforts have focused on areas that grew too quickly some human resources workers and software engineers are among those who have been laid off and in some cases the cuts have hit employees who had worked at the company for just a few weeks those affected by the latest move worked on one of the higher profile features in tesla vehicles in job postings tesla has said that labeled data is the critical ingredient for training powerful deep neural networks which help drive the tesla vehicles autonomously staffers in buffalo new york and san mateo spent hours labeling images for cars and the environment they navigate such as street signs and traffic lanes in buffalo tesla has continued to expand its autopilot data labeling teams a person familiar with the matter said but staff at that location who are doing the same role are paid a lower hourly rate than in san mateo the person said tesla s shares fell less than 1 per cent in late trading the stock tumbled 34 per cent this year through tuesday s close compared with a 20 per cent decline in the sp 500 index
even the most wild optimists are starting to sound like doom and gloomers in fact even the most optimistic woman on wall street is now telling us that the u s economy is in a recession right now at one time cathie wood seemed like she could do no wrong many of her wildly optimistic stock predictions kept coming true and she gained hordes of internet followers that hung on her every word in 2020 her ark innovation fund outperformed the s p 500 by a very wide margin and pundits such as jim cramer were calling her a genius in 2020 wood s predictions appeared to be on their way to coming true she was riding high atop the fed driven bull market her ark innovation fund often known by its ticker as arkk returned some 157 percent during that first year of the pandemic compared to just 18 percent for the s p 500 as a whole it was a legendary performance that drew accolades from various market watchers including cnbc s jim cramer who in february of last year tweeted cathie wood is a genius but these days cathie wood sounds like she could be writing for the economic collapse blog the value of her ark innovation fund is down 67 percent over the past year and she just did an interview with cnbc in which she stated that she believes that the u s economy has already plunged into a recession ark invest ceo cathie wood said tuesday that the u s is already in an economic downturn and she admitted that she underestimated the severity and lasting power of inflation we think we are in a recession wood said on cnbc s squawk box tuesday we think a big problem out there is inventories the increase of which i ve never seen this large in my career i ve been around for 45 years of course she is far from alone economist stephen moore also believes that the u s economy has entered a recessionary period economist stephen moore warned on monday that the united states is already in a soft recession noting that the real question is now whether the federal reserve can achieve a soft landing moore a visiting fellow at the heritage foundation provided the insight on varney co monday reacting to former treasury secretary larry summers contradicting president biden on sunday by saying that a recession was almost inevitable in the next two years peter schiff is even more pessimistic in fact he is using the word crash to describe what is ahead for our economy stockbroker peter schiff the chief economist and global strategist of euro pacific capital went a step further a couple of weeks ago by tweeting that most citizens have given up on the thought of a soft landing for the economy after the fed s interest rate hikes and now expect a harder fall the only landing possible is a crash where everyone on board dies schiff tweeted that s why the fed won t even attempt to land and give up its pretend inflation fight sadly all three of them are correct at the moment what we are currently experiencing could definitely be described as a soft recession and it will inevitably get a whole lot worse and u s consumers certainly are not hopeful about the future at this point on friday we learned that u s consumer confidence has now dropped to the lowest level ever recorded a closely followed university of michigan survey released friday found that us consumer sentiment hit a new record low in june the lowest recorded level since the university started collecting the data 70 years ago the june index saw a 14 4 drop since may as consumers became increasingly alarmed about inflation about 79 of those consumers said they expected bad times for business conditions in the upcoming year the highest level for that metric since 2009 just think about that for a moment in 70 years u s consumers have never been more pessimistic than they are right now that is incredible unfortunately most consumers are also highly vulnerable one recent survey found that 58 percent of all americans are living paycheck to paycheck so when harder times come and many start losing their jobs a lot of them are going to be in financial trouble very rapidly the pace at which things are now changing really is breathtaking exactly one year ago it seemed like the u s economy was riding high and stock prices would keep going up forever but now it appears that the first half of 2022 will end up being the worst first half of a year for the stock market since 1970 stocks are about to turn in the worst first half in fifty years when the second quarter wraps on thursday as inflation sits at a 40 year high the s p 500 the broadest measure of stocks is down nearly 18 this year the worst since 1970 as tracked by dow jones market data group that makes 2022 the fifth worst half performance on record trillions upon trillions of dollars of paper wealth has already been wiped out and we continue to get more bad economic news with each passing day and now that the federal reserve has decided to foolishly raise rates just as an economic downturn is picking up speed there is no hope that things will turn around any time soon the reckless optimists on wall street didn t see this coming in advance if cathie wood had understood which direction things were about to go her fund would not be down 67 percent over the past year but of course there are countless others on wall street that have been hit extremely hard as well the end of a party can often come very abruptly in this case many investors that didn t get out in time are now feeling an extraordinary amount of pain unfortunately a lot more pain is coming for wall street and for the economy as a whole it is finally here michael s new book entitled 7 year apocalypse is now available in paperback and for the kindle on amazon about the author my name is michael and my brand new book entitled 7

a new study lays out how bad home prices got over just one year around boston it s not just you the income needed to afford a home in greater boston has increased a lot over the last year sign up for our weekly home and property newsletter featuring homes for sale neighborhood happenings and more owning a home in the boston area has long come with a hefty price tag but lately it seems like everyone has a story about getting priced out of the market how bad has it gotten really the stories may seem exaggerated but the numbers don t lie things have gotten worse according to numbers from the joint center for housing studies of harvard homeowners need to make 48 000 more than they did even a year ago just to afford the average greater boston home the jchs released a report last week on the state of the nation s housing and found that the median home price in greater boston was 659 161 as of april 2022 this includes homes in boston proper cambridge newton and surrounding suburbs assuming you have a 3 5 percent down payment a 30 year mortgage and are spending no more than a third of your income on said mortgage you d need to make 181 254 to make that monthly payment to put this into perspective in 2021 you needed to make about 133 295 to afford your typical boston area home which had a median price of 570 742 if you do the math this means the median home price increased by 89 000 over the course of one single year census data shows the median household income in the area is 93 537 so basically this jump in home prices represents almost an entire household s yearly income and worse greater boston s median income is 1 4 times the median income for the u s yet it s still not enough to keep up with rising home prices here even more sobering is looking at how this data has evolved over the last few years in 2019 the median home price was 489 340 requiring a household income of 125 402 to afford your average place even when the median home price increased to 507 597 in 2020 the average income needed went down to 121 096 thanks to a dip in interest rates between 2019 and 2020 alexander hermann a lead author of the report and senior researcher for the jchs says interest rates affect affordability which is why it was more affordable to buy a home in 2020 than it was 2019 despite home prices going up but when interest rates dropped many decided to leap at the chance to lock in that rate leading to fierce competition over the limited available housing stock and as we all know money talks leading to people paying high prices to get a home they call their own we ve been experiencing a rapid and robust home price growth for most of the pandemic and even before the pandemic hermann says but it s record low interest rates for 2020 and most of 2021 that allowed buyers to keep payments relatively affordable we weren t seeing the rapid rise in costs that we re seeing now things changed to some extent when interest rates rise they can take a toll and help deteriorate affordability there s some cold comfort to be taken from the report it s not just us hermann said at least two thirds of the nation s top housing markets experienced record high appreciation over the last year and while prices might not go down hermann said rising interest rates might help slow growth and if you didn t increase your household income by a breezy 48 000 over the last year you might find some relief looking elsewhere for the home of your dreams the income needed for a home in the providence metro area including southern mass suburbs is still around 121 000 while households in worcester only need about 115 000 to afford the average abode there costs are even cheaper in the western part of the state where you only need a household income in the five figures to afford a home imagine just don t go looking on the cape where you need to make about 188 000 to afford one of those dreamy coastal homes in short it s not you it really is brutal out there

turkey agreed tuesday to lift its opposition to sweden and finland joining nato ending an impasse that had clouded a leaders summit opening in madrid amid europe s worst security crisis in decades triggered by the war in ukraine after urgent top level talks with leaders of the three countries alliance secretary general jens stoltenberg said that we now have an agreement that paves the way for finland and sweden to join nato he called it a historic decision among its many shattering consequences president vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine has prompted sweden and finland to abandon their long held nonaligned status and apply to join nato as protection against an increasingly aggressive and unpredictable russia which shares a long border with finland under nato treaties an attack on any member would be considered an attack against all and trigger a military response by the entire alliance from left to right background nato secretary general jens stoltenberg turkish president recep tayyip erdogan finland s president sauli niinisto sweden s prime minister magdalena andersson turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu finnish foreign minister pekka haavisto and sweden s foreign minister ann linde sign a memorandum in which turkey agrees to finland and sweden s membership of the defense alliance in madrid spain on tuesday june 28 2022 bernat armangue ap nato operates by consensus and turkish president recep tayyip erdogan had threatened to block the nordic pair insisting they change their stance on kurdish rebel groups that turkey considers terrorists after weeks of diplomacy and hours of talks on tuesday finnish president sauli niinistö said the three leaders had signed a joint agreement to break the logjam turkey said it had got what it wanted including full cooperation in the fight against the rebel groups stoltenberg said leaders of the 30 nation alliance will issue a formal invitation to the two countries to join on wednesday the decision has to be ratified by all individual nations but he said he was absolutely confident finland and sweden would become members something that could happen within months swedish prime minister magdalena andersson said the agreement was good for finland and sweden and it s good for nato she said completing the process of membership should be done the sooner the better but there are 30 parliaments that need to approve this and you never know andersson told the associated press turkey hailed tuesday s agreement as a triumph saying the nordic nations had agreed to crack down on groups that ankara deems national security threats including the kurdistan workers party or pkk and its syrian extension it said they also agreed not to impose embargo restrictions in the field of defense industry on turkey and to take concrete steps on the extradition of terrorist criminals turkey has demanded that finland and sweden extradite wanted individuals and lift arms restrictions imposed after turkey s 2019 military incursion into northeast syria turkey in turn agreed to support at the 2022 madrid summit the invitation of finland and sweden to become members of nato details of exactly what was agreed were unclear amineh kakabaveh an independent swedish lawmaker of kurdish origin whose support the government depends on for a majority in parliament said it was worrisome that sweden isn t revealing what promises it has given erdogan andersson dismissed suggestions sweden and finland had conceded too much asked if the swedish public will see the agreement as a concession on issues like extraditions of kurdish militants regarded by ankara as terrorists andersson said they will see that this is good for the security of sweden u s president joe biden congratulated the three nations on taking a crucial step amid speculation about a u s role in ending the deadlock a senior administration official said washington did not offer any concessions to turkey to coax it to accept a deal but the official said the u s played a crucial role in helping bring the two parties closer together and biden spoke with erdogan tuesday morning at the behest of sweden and finland to help encourage the talks the agreement came at the opening of a crucial summit dominated by russia s invasion of ukraine that will set the course of the alliance for the coming years the summit was kicking off with a leaders dinner hosted by spain s king felipe vi at the 18th century royal palace of madrid top of the agenda in meetings wednesday and thursday is strengthening defenses against russia and supporting ukraine moscow s invasion on feb 24 shook european security and brought shelling of cities and bloody ground battles back to the continent nato which had begun to turn its focus to terrorism and other non state threats has had to confront an adversarial russia once again biden said nato was as united and galvanized as i think we have ever been a russian missile strike monday on a shopping mall in the central ukrainian city of kremenchuk was a grim reminder of the war s horrors some saw the timing as group of seven leaders met in germany and just ahead of the nato gathering as a message from moscow ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy who is due to address nato leaders by video on wednesday called the strike on the mall a terrorist act kyiv mayor vitali klitschko traveled to madrid to urge the alliance to provide his country with whatever it takes to stop the war wake up guys this is happening now you are going to be next this is going to be knocking on your door just in the blink of an eye klitschko told reporters at the summit venue stoltenberg said the meeting would chart a blueprint for the alliance in a more dangerous and unpredictable world and that meant we have to invest more in our defense stoltenberg said just nine of nato s 30 members meet the organization s target of spending 2 of gross domestic product on defense spain which is hosting the summit spends just half that stoltenberg said monday that nato allies will agree at the summit to increase the strength of the alliance s rapid reaction force nearly eightfold from 40 000 to 300 000 troops the troops will be based in their home nations but dedicated to specific countries on nato s eastern flank where the alliance plans to build up stocks of equipment and ammunition beneath the surface there are tensions within nato over how the war will end and what if any concessions ukraine should make to end the fighting there are also differences on how hard a line to take on china in nato s new strategic concept its once a decade set of priorities and goals the last document published in 2010 didn t mention china at all the new concept is expected to set out nato s approach on issues from cybersecurity to climate change and the growing economic and military reach of china and the rising importance and power of the indo pacific region for the first time the leaders of japan australia south korea and new zealand are attending the summit as guests some european members are wary of the tough u s line on beijing and don t want china cast as an opponent in the strategic concept nato is set to declare russia its number one threat russia s state space agency roscosmos marked the summit s opening by releasing satellite images and coordinates of the madrid conference hall where it is being held along with those of the white house the pentagon and the government headquarters in london paris and berlin the agency said nato was set to declare russia an enemy at the summit adding that it was publishing precise coordinates just in case
on june 10 while visiting los angeles president biden pointed at big energy companies as the culprits for rising gasoline prices he lambasted the industry by claiming they would rather use their record profits to buy back stock than to drill for oil he also pressured domestic companies to ramp up production while simultaneously threatening them with a windfall profits tax pressure ramped up again on june 14 with a series of letters by the president to various companies asking for concrete solutions to increase supply contrary to biden s claim that the industry isn t developing domestic leases some oil and gas companies are planning to boost output in the permian basin alone by 25 percent this year while expanding refining capacity by 250 000 barrels per day that s equivalent to building a medium sized refinery other major and independent domestic oil companies are also planning to boost production but this won t happen overnight especially in a regulatory and policy environment that remains basically hostile to fossil fuels recent examples include the curtailment of new leases for drilling regulatory and legal obstacles for new pipeline development increased mandates for ethanol blending and environmental social and corporate governance esg regulations designed to discourage new financing of fossil fuel projects in addition oil and gas companies face the same supply chain constraints and rising costs as other industries against this backdrop on june 14 senate finance committee chair ron wyden d ore announced he would soon introduce legislation setting a 21 percent surtax on the excess profits of oil and gas companies with more than 1 billion in annual revenue and use those revenues to provide a gasoline subsidy for american consumers proponents of the tax allege it s time for the industry to pay its fair share of the nation s tax bill what s more argue supporters the current windfall is the result of geopolitical events e g russia s war in ukraine and not an outcome of strategic company investment decisions those advocating for a windfall profits tax need to take a hard look at economic and fiscal realities forgotten in the debate is the fact that the oil and gas industry already contributes mightily to federal and state coffers prior to the pandemic the industry paid 160 million in federal corporate income taxes along with another 4 2 billion in royalties from production on federal lands that represented 19 3 percent of net income compared to 10 6 percent on average for all industries what is more in some states the energy industry is the single largest taxpayer for example oil and gas companies paid 15 8 billion in state and local taxes and royalties to the state of texas in 2021 here are some more inconvenient facts in 2021 u s energy firms were the 10th most profitable sector of the u s economy out of 11 according to s p global iq energy firms listed in the s p 500 stock index posted an 8 3 percent profit margin in 2021 that was below the median for all 11 sectors which was 10 6 percent furthermore prior to the recent run up in oil prices the average net profit for oil and gas drilling was only 4 7 percent in short high profits are an exception not the rule for the oil and gas industry in practice imposing a tax on the earnings of energy companies likely would backfire leading to less not more oil and gas production this was the case after enactment of the crude oil windfall profit tax act in 1980 u s public law 96 223 under the jimmy carter administration in response to the opec oil embargo and the iranian revolution of the previous decade that led to sharply higher gasoline prices and growing profits for domestic and international oil companies it went into effect at a time when the american economy was on the verge of a recession much like today and the law s implementation was expensive and revenues proved to be well below expectations domestic production dropped from 8 7 million barrels per day in 1980 to 7 5 million barrels per day in 1988 proving that if you want less of something tax it the tax was repealed in 1988 by which time oil imports had risen by almost 1 million barrels per day after focusing for more than a decade on the need to reduce carbon emissions we now face a new paradigm as the war in ukraine has returned energy security to center stage though still pushing renewable energy and electric vehicles biden says he wants more domestic oil production while consumers and businesses are demanding lower energy prices a revived windfall profits tax won t get us there instead it likely would raise prices increase our reliance on imports and do nothing to stimulate more domestic production if the past is prologue it will actually diminish america s energy security first published at the hill

with the s p 500 officially entering close to bear market territory last week down 20 from its january 3rd record finish many investors are becoming concerned as of today many of the banks have already said that the market has bottomed and is poised to return higher now that some of the froth has been shaved off just last week dubravko lakos global head of equity research at jpmorgan told cnbc people are basically positioned for a recession our base case is that this is not going to be a recession in the next 12 months and we think from that angle the portfolios are wrong footed however financial artificial intelligence is saying that those banks may be completely wrong john anthony radosta an artificial intelligence engineer and finra investment law advisor gives us another perspective shown by machine learning models run by the financial media provider synvestable last month we saw something that we haven t seen in awhile affect our machine learning models explains radosta on june 7 9 we saw some pretty concerning systematic risk entering the market that is reminiscent of around march 2020 what we re seeing is a correlation happening across assets that are historically uncorrelated moves that have not been seen since march 2020 continued radosta the phenomena he describes is that in march 2020 assets from stocks to gold began moving together in tandem instead of independently and crashed downwards 26 in total leaving investors with no alternative safe harbors according to radosta those correlations are starting to show up again as assets that typically move independently are starting to move together again what we think is happening when uncorrelated assets start to move together is that it s a sign of market structure breaking down and a sign of onset systematic risk you cannot diversify away systematic risk and there could be some further downside to every asset class until market structure can right itself again back in april 2022 the 2 year and 10 year treasury yield curves inverted which historically has been a sign of broken market structure and a 100 correct predictor of a substantial downturn within one year radosta declined to call a bottom for the stock market however cautions that investors need to tread carefully right now and focus on watchlists for the time being the good news is that this can be an excellent opportunity to start researching what companies you want to own when we finally reach market stability because we think all these great companies are about to go on sale radosta said we ll continue covering the market as things further develop media contact company name synvestable contact person jacquelyn dowd public relations manager email send email country united states website

hong kong june 28 every few generations hong kong transforms itself evolving from a swampy fishing village to 19th century colonial port to capitalist outpost and factory after china s 1949 revolution to 21st century financial center as the former british colony marks the 25th anniversary of its return to china reeling from pandemic curbs that devastated business and a crackdown on its pro democracy movement hong kong leaders say it is time to transform again they say the city should become a leader in technology that relies more on its ties with nearby chinese factory cities than on global trade chief executive elect john lee s government is under pressure to generate new sources of economic growth looking beyond covid outbreaks and anti virus controls that have devastated tourism and business and uncertainty about the legal climate after a crackdown on the city s pro democracy movement in april during his election campaign lee promised to start a new chapter for the city better known as one of asia s busiest ports and biggest stock markets and strengthen its competitiveness in technology and innovation as well as trade and finance lee gave no details but pointed to the greater bay area a chinese government initiative to link hong kong with neighbouring mainland cities including the technology and finance hub of shenzhen and the manufacturing powerhouses of dongguan and foshan there are great opportunities in the greater bay area that haven t been realized yet said david graham executive director of the british chamber of commerce in hong kong it is a big opportunity for hong kong and it will be very hard to replicate in other cities like singapore or dubai adding to the urgency for lee to roll out a long term strategy executives frustrated with hong kong s travel controls are leaving the city business groups say some companies are moving for good to singapore bangkok dubai or other business centers hong kong s strength as a global connector has been greatly reduced said joseph armas chairman of the american chamber of commerce in hong kong executives have left for cities where travel is feasible armas appealed to lee for a concrete roadmap to revive hong kong which remains together with mainland china and taiwan one of the few places that still requires inbound travelers to serve mandatory quarantines for michael chan who manages a fashion goods manufacturing business the restrictions have extended what used to be one week trips to factories in bangladesh or china to a month or two since it makes no sense to spend weeks in quarantine for a short work trip chan has considered temporarily relocating to singapore whose controls are much less strict when i meet government officials i often have to meet them face to face and talk about things said chan a veteran of multiple quarantines it s not like in the us where i can just use zoom for a video call hong kong lost nearly 90 000 of its 7 5 million population in 2021 according to government figures more than 100 000 people left in february and march of this year during the city s worst covid wave the angst over hong kong s travel controls presents an opportunity for others to dip into our talent pool said sally wong ceo of the hong kong investment funds association activists and foreign governments complain the ruling communist party is chipping away at the 50 years of autonomy beijing promised after 1997 the freedoms afforded to hong kong and its leeway for self governance had helped it keep its status as a center for asian headquarters of global companies even as rent and other costs soared to record levels and levels of inequality grew ever wider hong kong still has a skilled workforce an efficient port and a western style legal system considered to be impartial and reliable but its status as a global hub for trade and business center is waning one in 20 companies surveyed by the american chamber of commerce in hong kong plan to move their global or regional headquarters out of hong kong the chamber reported in january it said half were uncertain about whether to go some businesses are watching to see how law enforcement and the free flow of information and people that are crucial to commerce and finance might change two out of five companies surveyed said they worry they will lose free internet access vital for a trading center that relies on the flow of information there is a perception that foreign businesses are less welcome the report said more than half our respondents feel the government is unconcerned or dismissive about business concerns until now hong kong has been largely free of the censorship on the mainland where internet barriers known as the great firewall are used by the ruling party to block china s public from seeing foreign websites run by news outfits governments and human rights activists but the territory s leading pro democracy newspaper apple daily was shut down during the crackdown and its publisher jimmy lai sentenced to prison kurt tong a former us consul general in hong kong who is managing partner of the asia group a consulting firm said that so far the city s national security law though used to stifle dissent has not had much impact on business and finance but the effect of the law and beijing s overhaul of the territory s political system bear watching he said people who care about the hong kong financial system need to think about that tong said hong kong thrived as the trade gateway to china for decades but it was eclipsed as the world s busiest container port in 2000 by facilities in the chinese mainland two decades later with cargo volume barely 10 per cent above its 2000 level hong kong s port ranks 8th in the world shanghai shenzhen and three other chinese ports are bigger hong kong s stock market once asia s biggest outside japan also has grown steadily but has slipped behind regional rivals companies traded in hong kong have a total market value of usd 5 4 trillion compared with usd 8 2 trillion for the shanghai stock exchange companies on china s second exchange in shenzhen are worth usd 6 2 trillion according to the world federation of exchanges tong is among those who believe hong kong s recent setbacks are only temporary the current status is that hong kong is a very significant global center one of the most important in the world and it plays a unique and critical role in linking the chinese economy with the rest of the global economy and channeling finance in both directions said tong the city is meanwhile nurturing its role as a center for innovation setting up research centers that have helped incubate dozens of start up companies a vice chancellor of the chinese university of hong kong rocky s tuan pointed to medical and biotechnology research as one of the city s less well known strengths writing in the newspaper south china morning post he said hong kong offers access to capital expertise global regulatory recognition of its clinical trial data and a network of world class universities that could lend the city an edge over regional rivals other cities in the region notably singapore perhaps will be more of an asia hub or southeast asia hub said tommy wu of oxford economics hong kong s business will be mainly focused on greater china ap

on the evening of november 9 1989 thousands of east germans including a 35 year old chemist named angela merkel peacefully crossed into west berlin amid chaos and the confusion at the berlin wall within hours the gates of the most notorious symbol of the cold war opened for good as champagne flowed and jubilant germans with pickaxes began to lop off large chunks of the wall it was midafternoon at the white house when brent scowcroft the national security adviser walked into the oval office to tell george h w bush that initial reports suggested the wall had been opened but any public jubilation was tempered by the guiding principle of bush s career prudence as bush biographer jon meacham recounts in destiny and power borrowing a phrase from scowcroft bush was determined not to gloat meeting with reporters in the oval office bush struck a tone so subdued that cbs reporter lesley stahl said this is a sort of great victory for our side in the big east west battle but you don t seem elated bush s response at this epic turning point in modern history i m not an emotional kind of guy even when the president met with mikhail gorbachev in malta in december of that year to symbolically ratify the end of the cold war bush s words were muted for more than four decades through proxy wars in korea and vietnam and an eyeball to eyeball nuclear confrontation during the cuban missile crisis the world had teetered on the brink but throughout his presidency bush never displayed half the enthusiasm over the collapse of communism that he had as a yale first baseman every time his team defeated harvard bush s restraint has been praised by foreign policy experts but it also deprived americans of a stirring moment of national unity over the end of the cold war and the fears of nuclear armageddon in the current era of pandemic polarization insurrection war in ukraine dramatic climate change and the fraying of democracy it is difficult to conjure up what the united states was like during the glorious nearly 12 year period that began on november 9 1989 with russia on the ropes and china still emerging from its maoist slumber the united states dominated the world as michael mandelbaum an emeritus professor at the johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies asserts in his new book the four ages of american foreign policy the international position that the united states assumed in the wake of the cold war was one that no other country held or had ever held and yes that includes ancient rome and the british empire this period also brought with it for the most part boom times at home despite a short recession in 1990 and a dot com stock market collapse in 2000 the era was marked by a steadily declining unemployment rate which hit 4 percent in 2000 the lowest figure in three decades the millennium ended with balanced budgets in fact bill clinton bequeathed george w bush a 236 billion surplus and widespread talk of paying off the entire national debt in april 2001 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan no fan of irrational exuberance predicted in a major address while the magnitudes of future federal unified budget surpluses are uncertain they are highly likely to remain sizable for some time

and municipal capital markets at oppenheimer co inc said if sentiment and conviction can hold course we suspect that interest will be strong with orderly deal placement benefitting from long awaited strengthening momentum municipals according to lipton have the potential to recover barring any obstacles we suspect that some of the hardest hit areas can be standouts along the way such as lower coupon structures longer duration bonds and select high yield securities lipton suggested any sustained containment of bid wanted activity may very well be a telling sign that the market has altered both sentiment and perception potentially catalyzing a brighter outlook for the second half of 2022 matt fabian a partner at municipal market analytics also noted that there has been limited demand for lower coupon structures of late customers selling prices for such held at deeply de minimus distressed levels last week he said this dynamic likely followed continued outflows by the mutual funds which are the prime supporters of lower coupons and similar volatility trades fabian said mutual funds have lost 45 7 billion in asset under management since the start of the year according to refinitiv lipper lipton said withdrawals could subside and even turn positive should a cyclical shift emerge from a sustained bond market rally in general as well as municipal momentum driven by the technicals of lower supply and active reinvestment needs we are at or near cyclical highs in long term muni yields a likely reflection of oversold conditions and so the rate environment portends a nearing conclusion to the extended period of negative flows he added fabian noted that demand seems to have favored higher coupon and higher grade structures he said this is an appropriate trade as economic growth is increasingly likely to slow and many most states have undermined their resilience to such via tax cuts lipton said the municipal backdrop is well positioned to emerge in a better place by year end fiscal austerity has been buoyed by more conservative assumptions multiple infusions of fiscal stimulus and outperforming revenue collections given the wholesale reopening of the u s economy he said strong reserve balances could be used to offset revenue disruptions should the economy enter a contractionary period given that we have revised downward our quarterly growth forecasts it makes sense to scale back our estimates for state and local tax receipts yet we still assign a favorable outlook to overall revenue performance throughout the foreseeable future he wrote with the elevated yield levels and cheaper valuations municipal credit spreads have widened from significantly tighter levels that were present throughout 2021 he noted as the economy slows and overall growth

opinion hey there time traveller this article was published 27 06 2022 658 days ago so information in it may no longer be current somewhere in the ragtag collection of images that compose my childhood memory images that circle through my mind like slides in an old carousel projector there are pictures of the one fourth of july spent in the united states we must ve been in california on one of our many trips there to visit family i don t remember how old i was but i remember the fireworks glistening in the sky illuminating a nighttime garden of folding chairs and suburban dads in star spangled t shirts and flip flops most of all i remember the songs because there were so many not just the u s anthem ambitious and bombastic but a whole anthology of tunes that oozed a sticky and earnest sort of patriotism that was the night i heard for the first time country singer lee greenwood s 1984 hit god bless the u s a even then at my young age it struck me as curiously foreign we didn t have songs like that in canada i watched the suburban dads sing it with teary eyed gusto which seared it into my brain to my later dismay i never forgot either the melody or the lyrics and i m proud to be an americaaaan where at least i know i m freeeeee what i didn t know then was five years after greenwood released that tune which became as ubiquitous a soundtrack to american patriotic display as the anthem the singer recorded a canadian version god bless you canada the melody was the same but the lyrics were tweaked into a laundry list of canadian locations yes there s a shout out to winnipeg that version never made anything like the same impact on its target nation today it circulates in a few enthusiastically amateur youtube videos set to stock photography of the rocky mountains or the nova scotia coast and to be sure judging from the comments of those videos many canadians do know and love it yet the song never entered our national consciousness the way its original version did in america in fact until writing this column i d never even heard of it for most of my life canada could never quite muster the same hegemonic patriotism that was draped on the united states it s notable some of what we do have in that style has been imported this isn t to say patriotism including in its harmful iterations hasn t shaped the canadian experience only as compared to our neighbours it has been different canada has never been able to assemble much in the way of foundational myths it had no battle for independence which it could massage into a puffed chest fable of its own greatness by exposure alone i can name all of the so called founding fathers i can name far fewer early canadian politicians earlier this year on a work trip to poland i made friends with a peruvian american journalist who had grown up largely in california he d never been to canada he asked me to tell him about it i ran through the basics canadians always do jokes about poutine and hockey and moose i played him clips of old muchmusic videos and the tragically hip those are things canadians tend to mention because they re for the most part benign and inoffensive it s telling none of these reflect the indigenous cultures that still thrive here but which were for the longest time kept out of canada s bigger picture it s also telling none of them speak to a unifying identity that runs any deeper than superficial so then i told him about the painful public debates of a country that is incredibly young and rapidly changing i told him about how canada struggles to come to terms with a colonialism that is ongoing about how the fraying myth of the polite canadian conceals far thornier and more nuanced questions about the country its history its role in the world i told him about how canada struggles to come to terms with a colonialism that is ongoing about how the fraying myth of the polite canadian conceals far thornier and more nuanced questions about the country its history its role in the world i told him about what it s like to belong to a place that finds much of its identity in the ways it is unlike the united states i did it myself in this column and how that can keep us in a sort of stasis unable to wrestle with our own problems in an honest way consider how many canadians firmly believe racism or police brutality are uniquely american blights the thing about canada i said is that it s still trying to figure out what it is i thought that again when the forks announced it was reimagining this year s canada day celebrations crafting instead a july 1 event that was more inclusive reflective and indigenous led a debate sprung up about whether this was an attempt to cancel canada day although for the most part it seemed a little forced most local politicians including winnipeg mayor brian bowman mayoral candidate coun scott gillingham and manitoba premier heather stefanson wisely stayed out of it affirming the forks is free to program its events as it sees fit mayoral candidate jenny motkaluk led the charge stating in a tweet she loves the country unconditionally and would go to actual canada day parties i think it s very important that as canadians we have an opportunity to celebrate canada day every single year without undue influence or people trying to make us feel like there s something wrong with celebrating canada day motkaluk said in a statement if history has shown us just one thing it s unconditional love of country is a dangerous drink to sip it s not good to love the state regardless of what it does beyond that the idea one shouldn t have to encounter ideas that make them feel bad about canada day seems an unreasonable expectation one doesn t have to engage the discussion but it will take place that this brief spat was happening just one week after a retired residential school priest 92 year old arthur masse was arrested and charged with abuse only underscored why a flag waving iteration of the holiday ought not be sheltered from criticism after all there are as many different images of canada as there are perspectives from which to see it the country may look very different to a first nations person for whom canada is a recent arrival forcibly imposed on their nations than it will to a descendant of mennonite farmers invited here by the state so as to rapidly fill the plains with european settlers it will look different again to a new canadian excited to dive into the culture after years pursuing a professional visa and to an asylum seeker who walked over the border hopeful and relieved but also dislocated in a nation which receives them with suspicion it will look different again to me viewing it from my own vantage point yet we are all here together and we are all part of what canada is becoming to me that fact has always been the source of what love i bear for the country i am canadian in the simple ways culturally inscribed i say eh a lot i love curling i sing along loudest when gord downie gets to the part about hallways hung with pictures of our parents prime ministers the fond familiarity of the image bearing a bittersweet sort of grace i don t wave a flag i don t need a song i don t love the state i don t think i need to it isn t a child but a concentration of power hung on an idea always shifting i love that we are all here together having these debates trying to carve out the space to for all these perspectives on what canada is what it can be and what it is becoming a holiday that s always a good thing it doesn t have to be the same for everyone melissa martin freepress mb ca
region the impacts of a baby formula shortage in america have touched down locally renee whitley from franklin county children s task force fcctf said that the organization s supply of baby formula which is donated to parents is dwindling by the day fcctf is a child abuse and neglect prevention agency for franklin county that does so by mobilizing community resources whitley said in an interview alongside baby formula parents in need the organization provides after school programming and summer programs for kindergarten through grade eight diapers free clothing supervised visitation parent education and home visiting she explained whitley said the baby formula shortage came on fcctf s radar in mid april when they were getting more requests from parents for specific formulas they were unable to find in stores and then it became very quickly a widespread situation whitley said the shortage first began when abbott the nation s biggest infant formula maker recalled several products earlier this year and halted production at its michigan manufacturing plant for several months after bacteria was found at the site that gave infections to four infants and killed two cnbc reports advertisement more so america s strict formula import regulations and a nutritional program for low income families may have contributed to the disaster according to cnbc u s food and drug administration commissioner robert califf has since admitted the fda s response to the shortage was too slow and there were decisions that were suboptimal along the way more than 40 of baby formula in the u s was out of stock at the beginning of may according to cnbc as a result prices of baby formula have shot up with cbs news reporting that the average cost of the most popular baby formula products is up as much as 18 over the last 12 months whitley said fcctf realized in may we were not going to be able to meet the need of people that were calling for formula fcctf tried ordering in bulk ordering from other areas and have been unable to access any more formula whitley said advertisement at the beginning of june fcctf was down to eight cans of baby formula which are very specialized and not suitable for all babies whitley said it wasn t a priority at the time thinking about the shortage the priority was thinking about contamination because children had died from drinking contaminated formula and when children die that s going to be the focus whitley explained but she added the fda didn t realize the supply chain was so short and needed to find an alternative whitley said the shortage has caused a state of panic for fcctf and the families it serves she explained that not everyone plans wants or has the physical ability to breastfeed for those parents those who have recently given birth or nearing due dates the shortage has caused stress and resentment that they re having to breastfeed if they don t want to or can t physically do so whitley said fcctf families are turning to their pediatricians to learn about alternatives that are not going to harm the baby s digestive track our family visitors who are working with prenatal moms are having to talk to them about additional resources talk to them about planning for their shortage talk to them about breastfeeding even if they weren t planning to whitley explained find ways to bridge the gap until there s more formula available while the white house is now responding to the shortage whitley anticipates it will still be some time before local families and fcctf are able to find that supply chain that we can actually order in bulk from going to be difficult for families to get formula she said send questions comments to the editors filed under
u s department of justice doj deputy attorney general lisa monaco presented a new policy at a securities industry and financial markets association event that requires chief compliance officers cco to certify that compliance programs have been reasonably designed to prevent anti corruption violations 1 the policy is an outgrowth of a settlement involving us 1 billion in criminal and civil penalties imposed on mining giant glencore international ag glencore after it pleaded guilty to bribery and market manipulation charges 2 according to monaco this new policy is meant to ensure that ccos stay in the loop on potential company violations and have the necessary resources to prevent financial crime 3 while the expressed intention of this new policy is to empower ccos it has raised concerns about potential liability for ccos glencore settlement glencore is among the largest companies that dominate global trading of oil fuel metals minerals and food 4 in 2018 glencore was subject to a multi year investigation by the doj for violations of the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and a commodity price manipulation scheme 5 according to admissions and court documents filed in the southern district of new york glencore acting through its employees and agents engaged in a scheme for over a decade to pay more than us 100 million to third party intermediaries in order to secure improper advantages to obtain and retain business with state owned and state controlled entities a significant portion of these payments were used to pay bribes to officials in nigeria cameroon ivory coast equatorial guinea brazil venezuela and the democratic republic of the congo 6 glencore resolved the government s investigations by entering into a plea agreement plea agreement 7according to the plea agreement glencore admitted to one count of conspiracy to violate the fcpa 8 shaun teichner the general counsel for the company told a federal judge in new york that glencore knowingly and willingly entered into a conspiracy to violate the foreign corrupt practices act by making payments to corrupt government officials 9 glencore expects to pay about us 1 billion to u s authorities after accounting for credits and offsets payable to other jurisdictions and agencies and about us 40 million to brazil 10 a related payment by glencore to the united kingdom will be finalized after a hearing next month 11 the plea agreement requires that glencore among other things 1 implement two independent compliance monitors one in the united states and one abroad to prevent the reoccurrence of crimes 2 retain a compliance monitor for three years and 3 have its chief executive officer ceo and cco submit a document certifying to the doj s fraud section that the company has met its compliance obligations the cco certification requirement or the certification 12 why the cco certification requirement has raised concerns the cco certification requirement has raised concerns in the compliance space over potential increases in cco liability 13 specifically compliance officials worry that this policy transfers corporate liability into potential individual liability for the cco the certification form asks the ceo and cco to certify that the compliance program has been reasonably designed to prevent future anti corruption violations 14 critics worry that these new certifications may discourage ccos from taking jobs at companies that are or may be parties to agreements with the doj 15 the doj stated that liability will depend on the facts and circumstances of the case but that the new policy is not aimed at going after ceos or ccos 16 assistant attorney general kenneth a polite jr stated if there is a knowing misrepresentation on the part of the ceo or cco then that could certainly result in some form of personal liability 17 depending on the circumstances the doj may consider it a breach of the corporation s obligations under the plea agreement if there is either a misrepresentation in one of these certifications or a failure to provide the same 18 polite added that the certification memorializes the company s commitment to take its compliance obligations seriously 19 critics question how realistic the cco certification requirement is for large multinational companies 20 they also question the due diligence required to actually ensure that compliance programs are reasonably designed especially for companies operating in over 50 countries would it be realistic to expect a cco or ceo to keep tabs on compliance across their company with that level of specificity 21 what the c suite and board should consider moving forward the questions to consider are 1 where will the expressed policy lead and 2 how do we best prepare for the certification the doj has specifically stated its intention to prosecute the individuals who commit and profit from corporate malfeasance 22 regardless of monaco s comments the certification appears to create potential for an extension of that policy the fact of the policy gives rise to a number of subsidiary questions is the certification which targets foreign corrupt practices a harbinger for other such certifications in areas such as health care fraud defense contractor fraud money laundering etc and is doj gearing toward providing its prosecutors with more tools for individual culpability at the highest corporate levels consistent with its expressed policy moving forward in house counsel should work with the ceo and cco to consider areas of corporate business practices that are specifically subject to compliance programs they should develop practices including auditing tracking training and reviewing to ensure the programs are reasonably designed to prevent future wrongdoing further they should be sure to document their corporate business practices obviously these programs become much more complex when operations include foreign jurisdictions and foreign laws with respect to matters such as privacy and employee rights although this process may not be new to protect corporations from criminal charges the newly announced policy will certainly focus the spotlight on ceos and ccos in the fcpa context and arguably beyond footnotes 1 al barbarino doj defends new cco certifications amid industry worry law360 may 26 2022 2 id 3 id 4 chris strohm chris dolmetsch jack farchy glencore pleads

bond default and impairment is famously low in the municipal bond market but the case of paradise california offers an example of the rising financial risks posed by climate and management decisions after the town was nearly destroyed in 2018 by california s deadliest wildfire to date the state stepped in to help the successor to the paradise redevelopment agency continue to make twice annual payments on 2009 bonds that were backed by tax increment revenues but the state s help ended earlier this year and on june 1 the successor agency reported an unscheduled draw on reserves to cover a payment on its 2009 bonds successor agencies manage the obligations redevelopment agencies incurred before the state abolished them in 2012 the next day s p global ratings dropped its rating to ccc with a negative outlook from bb bond prices dipped impacts of the 2018 camp fire which burned out the entire town of paradise california linger for holders of the town s default threatened redevelopment bonds bloomberg news s p noted that the town s management had declined to tap other revenues like settlement funds utility pg e paid for causing the fire to make the payment a decision that the ratings agency said it considers a risk captured under our environmental social and governance factors which is a key credit driver of the rating action the bond prices which before the fire hovered around 105 cents on the dollar had tumbled to a low of 54 the month after the fire before climbing back up to around the high 90s after the town reported its unscheduled draw on reserves the price dropped to 94 cents on the dollar the upcoming december payment will largely drain the reserve fund and it s unclear whether the bonds some of which go out to 2043 will remain whole the fresh risk of the bond default even years after the fire is a reminder of why disclosure related to environmental social and governance factors is increasingly important to investors but the rapidly evolving esg landscape coupled with the immense variety of municipal issuers and bond pledges as well as the market s voluntary disclosure regime hinders the development of uniform standards even the terms of the debate have sparked confusion with participants urging regulators and standard setting bodies to more clearly delineate between esg related risk disclosure on traditional bonds and disclosure on esg labeled bonds like green bonds social bonds environmental impact bonds and sustainability bonds on the labeled bond side there remains a lack of clear pricing benefit in the tax exempt primary market regardless of the level of disclosure but primary market esg labeled deals with greater disclosure do attract more investors compared to vanilla bonds and a slight greenium is becoming apparent in the secondary market listen to barry fick executive director of the minnesota higher education facilities authority who discusses a recent green bond versus plain vanilla deal and how it fared in a bond buyer podcast on the risk disclosure side the debate falls into familiar territory issuers push back against additional mandates and investors and analysts want more than a template paragraph in the official statement despite the disagreements most in the market agree that regulatory action is on the horizon the securities and exchange commission and the municipal securities rulemaking board have dialed up their focus and the development of some type of standards seems likely enforcing standards sec chair gary gensler in march unveiled long anticipated proposed rules for reliable and relevant esg related disclosure for certain companies the commission lacks any explicit authority to mandate the content of disclosure by muni issuers but many market participants have predicted that the corporate rules will in some way trickle down into the muni market the sec can indirectly impose standards on muni issuers through regulation of underwriters and also through the enforcement of the anti fraud provisions of the federal securities laws a tool that could be used to shape a new disclosure regime there s a pattern of behavior said lisa washburn chief credit officer and managing director at municipal market analytics referring to the sec s past enforcement actions on hot topic issues like pension disclosure or timeliness they have in the past taken some actions to assist the market in understanding what the expectations are she said if there were an event that impaired not necessarily a default the value related to a bond and that bond issuer either knew of or discussed climate change and didn t disclose it in their official statement i could envision a scenario where a similar type of action could take place in june speaking at the government finance officers association s annual conference the sec s oms director dave sanchez told issuers that they should consider esg related risks the same way they weigh other risks namely whether they pose a material risk to the revenue stream backing the debt when we re talking about climate risk and general disclosure this is an area where there s a lot of noise and discomfort sanchez said the point right now is using the same principles you should use for other disclosure you re just looking at these like do they have a credit impact a financial impact on revenues used to pay back the bonds the rules have not changed you re just applying it to a different topic what the issuer knows about its esg risks is a key question as an issuer preps a deal said kevin civale a shareholder at stradling yocca carlson rauth who acts as disclosure and underwriters counsel if issuers are not aware of specific risks tied to climate change they are not required to speculate by federal securities law said kevin civale a shareholder at stradling yocca carlson rauth stradling yocca carlson rauth issuers particularly in civale s california based practice are well aware of climate risks he said but they often lack specific information relating to the impacts severity or timing of climate change or how they could affect their credit or financial position if they lack that information federal securities laws don t require them to speculate civale said but if they have more specific information if they have commissioned studies for example then the issuer needs to carefully consider whether more specific climate change disclosure is warranted he said familiar tensions the msrb in december 2021 issued a request for information on esg practices in the muni market as part of a broader engagement on esg trends in the municipal securities market to give all interested stakeholders an opportunity to provide their feedback the responses revealed some themes across the market and many respondents seem to support development of voluntary best practices the government finance officers association in 2021 unveiled best practices that recommends issuers disclose material esg risks or factors having a nexus to credit or the ability to repay bonds as timothy ewell chair of the gfoa committee on governmental debt management said in an october bond buyer guest commentary the msrb s role in developing standards remains unclear as it lacks authority over issuers and it s uncertain what the board plans to do if anything with the rfi the msrb said it will be releasing a comprehensive summary of the comments in july with a board member saying the group is not looking to lead with a regulatory foot the msrb declined to comment for this article whatever the msrb s actual role is the 52 responses it received for its rfi illustrates how the esg debate is part of long standing tension in the market between investors who would like to see more disclosure and issuers who argue it s costly and possibly irrelevant the state of utah leading a coalition of 23 states put it bluntly the msrb has no business seeking information that it cannot put to any lawful use on the other side nuveen one of the market s largest investors said in its response that it supports expanded disclosure we believe all investors stand to benefit from expanded access to reliable comparable esg data from municipal issuers the firm said labeled bonds during his gfoa speech sanchez said disclosure issues may be more complicated for bonds that carry an esg label either by the issuer or a third party vendor one of the fastest growing sectors in the muni market green social and sustainability labeled bonds totaled just under 10 of muni issuance in 2021 for a total of 46 5 billion according to the climate bonds initiative that s up from 5 5 in 2020 the sec s proposed changes to its names rule will force muni issuers to conduct further analysis on how their investments are achieving the esg outcomes they say they are which may eventually bring some standardization to issuers of esg labeled municipal debt while any proposal that the commission puts forward won t have a direct effect on the municipal bond industry market participants still believe the proposed amendments will serve as a precedent for proposals the sec s office of municipal securities is considering for the future the names rule was codified into law in 2001 and generally requires that any investment fund whose name suggests a certain type of investment invest at least 80 in that type of asset the sec is proposing to expand its 80 requirement to include esg related fund names making it so fund managers are required to provide proof that 80 of the portfolio adheres to its stated methodology but the proposal will also touch all those that fund managers deal with which often include muni bond issuers this places more of an impetus on issuers as they ll have to provide specific analysis as to how a specific muni bond would fit into a fund folks that want to be included in those funds whether that s an equity issue or a bond issue will need to start identifying measuring and disclosing the criteria that would qualify them for inclusion in the fund said april hamlin a partner at ballard spahr and co leader of the firm s esg and agribusiness team to me it s all designed to prevent greenwashing by changing the behavior of those that are promoting investment in esg or greener or sustainable investments hamlin said whether it s bond funds or equity funds it s the same consequence the sec established an esg task force within its enforcement division with the enforcement of these types of cases its primary objective the greenwashing cases that group has already brought shines some light on the approach the commission is hoping to establish days before the proposed changes to the names rule were introduced the commission charged bny mellon for misstatements and omissions made about its esg considerations in investment decisions for designated esg muni bonds the key disclosure is a discussion of the use of proceeds said candace partridge cbi s social and sustainability bond data manager social bonds that finance affordable housing development is an example of how disclosure regularly falls short partridge said i usually have at most a paragraph to go off of it s usually just one or two sentences and when you re doing something like affordable housing there s a lot more nuance we need to unpack she said like impact on property values gentrification or if it will actually help disadvantaged communities green bonds make up nearly 70 of esg labeled muni bonds according to cbi meanwhile the market this year saw its first and only issuance of a so called sustainability linked bond when the arizona industrial development authority issued 200 million of unrated taxable sustainability linked revenue bonds in february the financing was on behalf of newlife forest restoration llc a wood product manufacturing company for a forest restoration project the bonds yields are tied to the company s ability to meet sustainability goals the 2028 bonds carried 9 coupons and the 2047 bonds had 11 coupons and the interest rates will rise by 150 basis points or more if the company fails to meet certain sustainability targets according to the official statement despite the growing appetite for esg linked bonds a pricing advantage remains unclear particularly in the tax exempt primary market a clear pricing advantage would help to develop the sector

manager for the san francisco public utilities commission during a june 16 webinar on green social and sustainable municipal bond opportunities hosted by the cbi if we re saying projects are green and making those statements to the investor community they really need to be green projects brown said the sfpuc annually discloses project spending as well as project impacts he said there s a lot of opportunity for u s munis because there are projects that are being financed by the bonds but often there are other kinds of benefits being accrued to the community like new jobs or arts and education outcomes it s an opportunity to showcase all the positive things you re doing for the community the heterogenous nature of the muni market with 50 000 issuers of all sizes and resource levels complicates the landscape but increasingly issuers want to step up their disclosure because they realize it s important civale said issuers very frequently say this is something that our stakeholders care about and at the end of the day most folks will do it because they frankly think it s the right thing to do he said

article turkey agreed tuesday to lift its opposition to sweden and finland joining nato a breakthrough in an impasse clouding a leaders summit in madrid amid europe s worst security crisis in decades triggered by the war in ukraine after urgent top level talks alliance secretary general jens stoltenberg said we now have an agreement that paves the way for finland and sweden to join nato russia s invasion of ukraine has prompted sweden and finland to abandon their long held nonaligned status and apply to join nato but turkish president recep tayyip erdogan had blocked the move insisting the nordic pair change their stance on kurdish rebel groups that turkey considers terrorists related russia ukraine war could last years nato chief warns finnish president sauli niinistö said the three countries leaders signed a joint agreement after talks on tuesday turkey said it had got what it wanted including full cooperation in the fight against the rebel groups the agreement comes at the opening of a crucial summit dominated by russia s invasion of ukraine u s president joe biden and other nato leaders arrived in madrid for a summit that will set the course of the alliance for the coming years the summit was kicking off with a leaders dinner hosted by spain s king felipe vi at the 18th century royal palace of madrid stoltenberg said the meeting would chart a blueprint for the alliance in a more dangerous and unpredictable world to be able to defend in a more dangerous world we have to invest more in our defense stoltenberg said just nine of nato s 30 members meet the organization s target of spending 2 of gross domestic product on defense spain which is hosting the summit spends just half that related finland brewery s nato beer has taste of security top of the agenda for leaders in meetings wednesday and thursday is strengthening defenses against russia and supporting ukraine biden who arrived with the aim of stiffening the resolve of any wavering allies said nato was as united and galvanized as i think we have ever been moscow s invasion on feb 24 shattered european security and brought shelling of cities and bloody ground battles back to the continent nato which had begun to turn its focus to terrorism and other non state threats has had to confront an adversarial russia once again ukraine now faces a brutality which we haven t seen in europe since the second world war stoltenberg said diplomats and leaders from tuekey sweden and finland earlier held a flurry of talks in an attempt to break the impasse over turkey s opposition to expansion the three countries leaders met for more than two hours alongside stoltenberg on tuesday before the agreement was announced erdogan is critical of what he considers the lax approach of sweden and finland toward groups that ankara deems national security threats including the kurdistan workers party or pkk and its syrian extension american support for syrian kurdish fighters in combatting the islamic state group has also enraged turkey for years turkey has demanded that finland and sweden extradite wanted individuals and lift arms restrictions imposed after turkey s 2019 military incursion into northeast syria ending the deadlock will allow nato leaders to focus on their key issue an increasingly unpredictable and aggressive russia a russian missile strike monday on a shopping mall in the central ukrainian city of kremenchuk was a grim reminder of the war s horrors some saw the timing as group of seven leaders met in germany and just ahead of nato as a message from moscow ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy who is due to address nato leaders by video on wednesday called the strike on the mall a terrorist act related european union makes ukraine a candidate for eu membership kyiv mayor vitali klitschko traveled to madrid to urge the alliance to provide his country with whatever it takes to stop the war wake up guys this is happening now you are going to be next this is going to be knocking on your door just in the blink of an eye klitschko told reporters at the summit venue stoltenberg said monday that nato allies will agree at the summit to increase the strength of the alliance s rapid reaction force nearly eightfold from 40 000 to 300 000 troops the troops will be based in their home nations but dedicated to specific countries on nato s eastern flank where the alliance plans to build up stocks of equipment and ammunition beneath the surface there are tensions within nato over how the war will end and what if any concessions ukraine should make to end the fighting there are also differences on how hard a line to take on china in nato s new strategic concept its once a decade set of priorities and goals the last document published in 2010 didn t mention china at all the new concept is expected to set out nato s approach on issues from cybersecurity to climate change and the growing economic and military reach of china and the rising importance and power of the indo pacific region for the first time the leaders of japan australia south korea and new zealand are attending the summit as guests some european members are wary of the tough u s line on beijing and don t want china cast as an opponent in the strategic concept nato is set to declare russia its number one threat russia s state space agency roscosmos marked the summit s opening by releasing satellite images and coordinates of the madrid conference hall where it is being held along with those of the white house the pentagon and the government headquarters in london paris and berlin the agency said nato was set to declare russia an enemy at the summit adding that it was publishing precise coordinates just in case associated press writers aritz parra ciaran

imagine this scenario that untold numbers of women find themselves in each year maybe you had unprotected intercourse or the condom broke or maybe you accidentally missed taking a birth control pill or two you don t want to get pregnant so you rush to the pharmacy for emergency contraception all the while the clock is ticking these medications are incredibly time sensitive says dr sonya borrero a professor of medicine at the university of pittsburgh who focuses on reproductive health equity she says emergency contraception pills need to be taken within five days after unprotected sex but the sooner the better surveys show that roughly a quarter of american women have at some point in their lives used emergency contraception pills to prevent an unintended pregnancy this type of contraception is effective safe and legal throughout the united states and yet researchers are finding it s not always available when people need it take for example levonorgestrel a form of emergency contraception better known under the brand name plan b although it s also available in generic versions with names including my way take action and my choice to name a few borrero says plan b is supposed to be available over the counter on the shelf stocked for all ages but when borrero sent a team of medical students to pharmacies across western pennsylvania to see what these stores actually had on hand they found a third of pharmacies didn t stock plan b at all and when they did have it most of the time it wasn t really on the shelf it was either behind the counter or in one of those locked boxes which means a customer would have to ask someone to hand them the emergency contraception she says that could be a real deterrent for some people you can imagine especially for a teen going and asking for one of these products and being concerned about potential judgment can be a significant barrier to purchasing borrero says pharmacists say there are good reasons for putting plan b under lock and key don downing a clinical professor at the university of washington school of pharmacy spent many years as a retail pharmacist and he also helped develop plan b he says many pharmacists have told him over the years that plan b is frequently a target of theft and a lot of pharmacies are struggling financially and can t afford to cover the losses he says he d rather see it locked up in the store than not available at all if they could make it available by keeping it behind the counter that may be ultimately more helpful to a woman than not stocking it at all downing says noah rosenthal is a merchandising analyst with hamacher resource group which provides analysis and consulting for retail pharmacies he notes that plan b and its generics retail for about 40 to 50 and this cost is a key reason why some retailers may stock emergency contraception in a locked box or behind the counter in an email to npr he noted that before 2006 plan b could only be dispensed by a pharmacist so some pharmacies may not have moved it even after the fda cleared it for over the counter sale he added some pharmacists may elect to place these items behind the counter for religious or other personal views borrero s findings were even bleaker for the other form of emergency contraception pill sold in pharmacies ella which requires a prescription the study found only 5 of pharmacies had it available for immediate purchase so 5 was abysmal i really was very surprised borrero says i was really thinking it would be something like 50 5 was crazy it s a nationwide problem and the problem isn t just confined to pennsylvania studies conducted in pharmacies across the u s have found similar problems with emergency contraception access and availability when it comes to ella the prescription form of emergency contraception pill lack of knowledge is a big obstacle says rebecca stone a clinical associate professor at the university of georgia college of pharmacy who has conducted similar studies ella is not very well known by prescribers meaning physicians nurse practitioners any type of traditional prescriber nor by pharmacists stone says and if providers aren t prescribing it pharmacies are less likely to keep it in stock that s kind of chicken and the egg stone says that s really concerning because ella is more effective says kelly cleland executive director of the american society for emergency contraception evidence shows plan b works best in the first 72 hours after unprotected intercourse then its efficacy wanes over five days in contrast ella is effective throughout the five day window it s also more effective for women who are overweight or obese there is an issue with plan b and its generics potentially not working for people who weigh more than 165 pounds cleland notes and for those folks it seems like ella is more effective up to 195 pounds so it s important that ella is available in stock and that people know about it for women heavier than the recommended weight for ella a copper iud is the recommended choice for emergency contraception but it needs to be inserted by a trained clinician cleland says pharmacies will often offer to order ella overnight but that s not good enough for such a time sensitive product it might be ok for your antibiotic but it s not ok for something that you need to take as soon as possible people who work in reproductive health want to see more education on emergency contraception for pharmacists for women and for health care professionals whom surveys show aren t always well versed in all the emergency contraception options available advocates say expanding access and education will become more critical in a post roe v wade america training for providers laura bellis is already on the case she s the executive director of take control initiative a contraception access program in tulsa county okla this month the program rolled out training for doctors and other providers it works with after many of them said they had lots of questions about emergency contraception sometimes clinicians are like can i just hand this to anyone and the answer is yes says bellis noting that confusion persists about whether emergency contraception pills are age restricted they re not if someone is you know of reproductive age there s nothing precluding giving this to them it s safe to have on hand they could put it in their medicine cabinet at home bellis says having emergency contraception on hand is especially critical in places like her home state in may oklahoma adopted the nation s most restrictive abortion law it s now illegal in all but a few cases and so with that we know how critical it is that folks have access to last lines of defense like emergency contraception she says she says the take control initiative offers free kits with levonorgestrel pills that people can pick up at various community sites around tulsa county they usually cost around 40 to 50 at a pharmacy or can be found cheaper online the group has also been using social media to raise awareness about the weight considerations involved in choosing emergency contraception she says its help line has received more calls than ever before in recent months from people interested in getting iuds placed as a form of emergency contraception companies such as nurx simplehealth and prjkt ruby also offer telemedicine appointments for women who need a prescription for ella dr leah upton a family physician and medical director of a federally qualified health clinic in tulsa okla says she s seen what can happen when patients don t get emergency contraception in time she recalls one 15 year old patient who told upton she had trouble accessing both contraception and emergency contraception as we know there s a window of time that you have to get that in in addition there s the cost the patient upton says was in a turbulent time in her life she had been kicked out of her home and was living with a relative somewhere between transportation and costs and all of the other things she was dealing with in her life at the time she couldn t get that emergency contraception or contraception care in general and so i didn t see her as a family planning patient i saw her as a prenatal patient cynthia harper is a professor of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive sciences at the university of california san francisco and a longtime contraception researcher she helped develop the training that the take control initiative is offering which recommends that providers routinely offer patients advanced prescriptions for emergency contraception she s planning to make it available to providers across the country this is just going to become so much more important in those states where restrictions are imminent or have happened she says copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

trusts are shelling out record dividends to investors as interest grows in alternative ways of investing outside of stocks and shares amid recent turbulence in global stock markets that saw the us market the s p500 index lose more than a fifth of its value in just six months investors are seeking new ways of investing their cash new data suggests the typical investor portfolio usually includes mainly stock investments with the rest of money tied up in bonds that carry a fixed rate of interest translating into a steady return for investors the standard medium risk approach for an independent investor used to involve betting 60 of your capital in stocks and 40 in bonds according to investment bank arbuthnot latham however that may be changing as data from the bank shows investors in today s market are increasingly looking to diversify their investment portfolios through alternatives comprising anything that does not constitute stocks bonds cash or real estate according to investment bank arbuthnot internet searches for so called alternatives investments surged 88 this year the investment bank said last week that it had registered 35 000 internet searches among potential retail investors for different types of alternative investments for the year to date the data suggests retail investors are exploring alternative forms of investment such as private equity and ethical investments if google bing and other search engine data can be a guide of trends a more diversified approach to market turbulence is paying off for investors who are willing to put their money in trusts pay outs from investment trusts are at an all time high according to information provider link group s investment trust dividend monitor which analysed dividends paid out in the year to march investment companies are able to hold back some of the income they receive from their portfolios and use these reserves to maintain dividends when times are tougher said richard stone chief executive of the association of investment companies this helps explain why there are seven investment companies that have increased their dividends each year for 50 years or more and 17 in total that have increased their dividends every year for over 20 years known as the dividend heroes dividends from investment trusts are now nine times larger than they were in 2010 according to link group these trusts returned 5 5 billion in the form of dividends to shareholders between april 2021 and march 2022 a 15 4 increase on the equivalent period a year earlier the rapid rise in pay outs to trust shareholders was mainly driven by increased returns among venture capital trusts and other vehicles that invest in alternative assets according to the study pay outs from trusts that invest in alternatives rose by a quarter to 3 65bn and the amount vcts handed to investors shot up by nearly two thirds the amount paid out by trusts that invest in listed shares was meanwhile flat at 1 85 billion and the information provider expects pay outs from equity investment trust to rise 4 by the end of march 2023 property was the largest dividend paying sector in the alternatives segment link group said amid uk house prices that continue to rise unabated according to the halifax index house prices rose for the eleventh consecutive month in may with a 1 increase suggesting that annual growth may be beginning to slow arbuthnot s data suggests that ethical investing has taken a front seat amid the current volatile climate while real estate stocks may not be at the forefront of investors minds searches for real estate investments fell by more than a fifth 23 36 this year arbuthnot said however the hunt for ethical investments is now on as retail investors seeking environmental social and governance related investments rose by a third this year according to arbuthnot latham the bank s data showed a 32 6 increase in internet searches for ethical investment for the year to date compared to the equivalent january to june period last year suggesting investors are increasingly conscious to put their money away in non contentious and ethical investments the rise in the number of potential investors exploring ethical ways of investing could be a response to the maelstroms faced by listed companies such as electric vehicle maker tesla inc nasdaq tsla which was kicked out of the s p s esg index earlier this year following allegations of racism at its california plant private equity was another popular area of enquiry for potential retail investors with searches for the asset class rising by 14 75 as firms attempt to spend an almost 2 trillion dollar war chest of capital collected from institutional investors this type of equity investment is not typically widely available to many retail investors with the exception of high net worth individuals but with online asset management platforms increasingly available to independent investors that balance is shifting after a couple of years of lower travel overheads due to the covid 19 pandemic and with interest rates now rising which could in turn increase savings put away during lockdowns arbuthnot said searches for family investments grew by 4 26 in its view people are seeking to make financially sound decisions and stretch their pounds a little further while struggling to meet the rising price of everyday goods a great way to do so is to take a look into your investments or if you are not yet investing look at where you can start to the bank said

helped lift the mood on tuesday travel firm stocks rose pre market boosted by the china move energy companies were also positive features pre market as oil prices rose with brent crude adding 1 3 to 112 44 a barrel weakening economic data have recently provided investors with some hope that the federal reserve might become less hawkish as it tries to tackle sky high inflation but the overall mood remains fragile richard hunter head of markets at interactive investor commented markets in the us drifted lower after a recent run of gains opening up the debate as to whether the spike was something of a relief rally rather than a conviction rally investor confidence takes time to build but is easily shattered and as such volatility is never far away even so the losses were shallow in the absence of any strong catalysts with volumes light suggesting that there could be an element of calm before the next set of challenges arrive he added the main test over the following weeks is likely to come in the form of the second quarter and half year reporting season where the current state of the economy on the ground will become apparent at this early stage pre announced company data is suggesting that almost twice as many corporates are likely to show weaker rather than stronger numbers this would represent an improvement from the first quarter of this year but a decline from the same period a year ago in the meantime losses were capped by some economic data for durable goods in the us which showed a strong increase in may implying a continuation of business spending this in turn could vindicate the federal reserve s insistence that the economy remains robust enough to withstand the current round of rate rises although of course such data cannot be taken in isolation further releases today on consumer confidence and house prices will add further colour to the state of the nation hunter concluded the main indices therefore remain entrenched in negative territory for the year with the dow jones having lost 13 5 the s p500 18 and the tech heavy nasdaq continuing to bear the brunt of a higher interest rate environment losing 26 so far in 2022 contact the author at jon

the jury is chosen five women and seven men have been selected to decide the fate of a man who took it on himself to end the lives of 17 students and staff at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland on feb 14 2018 prosecutors defense lawyers and broward circuit judge elizabeth scherer were in the middle of selecting 10 alternate jurors to step in if any of the original 12 are unable to complete the trial the selection of alternates will be completed wednesday morning confessed gunman nikolas cruz 23 pleaded guilty last october to 17 counts of first degree murder and faces the death penalty for each of them jury selection began on april 4 and lasted over weeks of scheduled and unscheduled breaks while the judge and attorneys assessed hardship for a trial that is expected to continue through october the jury s sole task will be whether to recommend a sentence of life in prison or death for cruz without a unanimous recommendation of death scherer cannot impose that sentence cruz would spend the rest of his life in prison without the possibility of parole the jurors chosen were two banking executives and two tech workers a probation officer a human resources professional and a walmart store stock supervisor also included are a librarian a medical claims adjuster a legal assistant an immigration officer and a retired insurance executive the drama surrounding jury selection was not unusual for a death penalty trial but it was magnified by a media presence that turned routine motions into breathless breaking news updates when the defense moved to recuse the judge from the case for her handling of numerous controversies for example it employed a tactic that defense lawyers and prosecutors resort to often without fanfare and except on rare occasions without success scherer had originally hoped to start opening statements and testimony in late may when it became clear that target would not be met she pushed it to early june more than once mini controversies threatened to undo the progress that had been made each was significant because death penalty cases are closely scrutinized by appellate courts and the defense is sure to raise numerous issues for consideration if cruz is sentenced to death even on tuesday s final day of selection a debate raged over whether one potential juror was completely forthcoming about her memberships in civic organizations that could reveal a bias against cruz scherer allowed lead defense lawyer melisa mcneill to question the potential juror about the issue despite the judge s frustration with having to spend more than 30 minutes on a single juror at the 11th hour during questioning the juror who has a civic connection to broward but works with the miami school district testified that she once wore an msd t shirt on the job in 2018 to show solidarity with the parkland high school community judge elizabeth scherer participates in a sidebar discussion via headset during jury selection in the penalty phase of the trial of marjory stoneman douglas high school shooter nikolas cruz at the broward county courthouse in fort lauderdale on tuesday cruz previously pleaded guilty to all 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the 2018 shootings amy beth bennett south florida sun sentinel the juror was ultimately excused at the discretion of the defense each side was allowed 10 such peremptory challenges for any reason not based on race or gender the jurors chosen were two banking executives and two tech workers a probation officer a human resources professional and a walmart store stock supervisor also included are a librarian a medical claims adjuster a legal assistant an immigration officer and a retired insurance executive the panel will have a task never faced by a u s jury no american mass shooter who killed at least 17 people has ever made it to trial nine others died during or immediately after their shooting attacks killed either by police or themselves the suspect in the 2019 slaying of 23 at a walmart store in el paso texas is awaiting trial the next step for the parkland case is for scherer to clear out all remaining pre trial motions including one debate over the admissibility of expert testimony that is likely to last the rest of this week and part of next scherer had hoped to hold opening statements and start the trial on july 6 but she conceded last week that the target date was optimistic hinting that another delay on the start date is likely information from the associated press was used in this report rafael olmeda may be reached at rolmeda sunsentinel com call or text him at 954 356 4457 follow him on twitter rolmeda

at 30 269 while the broader s p 500 index lost 1 0 and the tech laden nasdaq composite shed 1 7 fawad razaqzada market analyst with city index and forex com noted earlier today there was a bit of optimism in the air with european equity markets rising noticeably investors were showing resilience in the face of rising interest rates inflation and recession risks granted some indices and individual names were bouncing back from severely oversold levels which should have been expected but as i have been consistently warning let s not underestimate the big macro risks facing investors it is far too early to be optimistic that this latest recovery will hold in fact the markets were starting to break lower after the early advance in the us session was rejected at the time of writing the renewed weakness was triggered fresh data showing plunging consumer confidence he added last week we saw the university of michigan s consumer sentiment survey crash to record lows thus the bar was set very low ahead of today s publication of the conference board s cb barometer even so the cb s consumer confidence index tumbled more than expected the headline figure fell to 98 7 from a downwardly revised 103 2 and well below expectations of around 100 0 the slump in confidence was driven by a plunge in expectations sub index as the present situation sub index fell only marginally business confidence was not great either judging by the latest read on the richmond fed manufacturing index it fell to 19 compared to 5 previously to reach its lowers level since may 2022 the height of the pandemic new orders plunged big time while expectations for conditions in the future worsening sharply the analyst concluded against this backdrop it is difficult to justifying buying stocks on the hope that the fed will ignore inflation and start cutting back interest rates from as early as next year i am therefore of the view that the markets will remain in the sell the rallies rather than buy the dip mode 4 05pm pound mixed as sturgeon lays out proposal for new independence referendum sterling is has fallen back against the dollar as the prospect of a new vote for independence in scotland comes closer first minister nicola sturgeon has published a new bill on a referendum and has called on prime minister boris johnson not to block the move scotland s first minister nicola sturgeon says the independence referendum bill will propose a vote on scottish independence to take place on 19 october 2023 for more on this and other news visit sky news breaking skynewsbreak june 28 2022 the pound is down 0 4484 against the dollar at us 1 2212 but has edged up 0 785 against the euro to 1 1602 as earlier talk of a 50 point basis interest rate rise from the european central bank faded following comments from president christine lagarde in portugal in a report last year on a possible referendum capital economics said the interactions between brexit the deterioration in scotland s fiscal situation and the continued lack of an easy option for the currency have made the economics of scottish independence even more challenging than at the time of the first referendum in 2014 this doesn t mean an independent scotland couldn t be an economic success but it would require scotland to put in place credible plans to cut the budget deficit the resulting fiscal squeeze would restrain economic growth and mean that in its first 5 10 years an independent scotland is more likely to fall further behind the rest of the uk than catch it up on the reaction to a vote for independence it said the experience after the uk voted to leave the eu is a useful precedent although the moves would surely be on a smaller scale if scotland voted to leave the uk after brexit the pound fell by 15 and stayed weak until the uk eu negotiations concluded nearly five years later it may be reasonable to expect the initial moves to be a third or half as big if scotland voted for independence for example the pound may weaken by 5 7 3 52pm footsie off its peak but remains well in the green leading shares remain in positive territory heading into the close albeit slightly down

investors with some hope that the federal reserve might become less hawkish as it tries to tackle sky high inflation but the overall mood remains fragile richard hunter head of markets at interactive investor said markets in the us drifted lower after a recent run of gains opening up the debate as to whether the spike was something of a relief rally rather than a conviction rally investor confidence takes time to build but is easily shattered and as such volatility is never far away even so the losses were shallow in the absence of any strong catalysts with volumes light suggesting that there could be an element of calm before the next set of challenges arrive he added the main test over the following weeks is likely to come in the form of the second quarter and half year reporting season where the current state of the economy on the ground will become apparent at this early stage pre announced company data is suggesting that almost twice as many corporates are likely to show weaker rather than stronger numbers this would represent an improvement from the first quarter of this year but a decline from the same period a year ago in the meantime losses were capped by some economic data for durable goods in the us which showed a strong increase in may implying a continuation of business spending this in turn could vindicate the federal reserve s insistence that the economy remains robust enough to withstand the current round of rate rises although of course such data cannot be taken in isolation further releases today on consumer confidence and house prices will add further colour to the state of the nation the main indices therefore remain entrenched in negative territory for the year with the dow jones having lost 13 5 the s p500 18 and the tech heavy

the bank s monetary policy and would lead to the first rise in rates in 11 years in july it plans a 25 basis point rise at next month s meeting with a possible larger increase in september she blamed the current problems on an extraordinary series of external shocks with global supply chain disruptions combining with increased demand and all exacerbated of course by the war in ukraine we will go

telling us president joe biden at the g7 meeting that a call to the uae had informed him that both they and saudi arabia were maxed out on production capacity given that the two gulf states had been thought of as the only two countries in opec cabal with spare capacity to boost global deliveries and so could reduce prices that is probably the last thing the world needs to hear right now said

dialing in today this is chuck fisher and iâ ll make a few opening comments it has been a busy four months since our last investor conference call on february 14 2022 before i hand the call over to dr steven larosa our chief medical officer who will provide an update of our clinical trials in infectious diseases i would like to make some brief remarks about the current monkeypox outbreak as we receive numerous inquiries about that outbreak from investors and reporters we previously commissioned battelle memorial institute in 2008 to run a monkeypox virus about mpv in vitro study using a miniature version of our hemopurifier this study demonstrated that high concentrations of monkeypox virus approximately 35 000s gpus per mil were rapidly depleted from cell culture fluids when circulated through the hemopurifier the study indicated that the hemopurifier removed 44 of infections monkeypox virus in the first hour of testing 82 after six hours and 98 after 20 hours the studies were conducted in triplicate and data verification was provided by real time pcr given the recent outbreak of monkeypox virus we continue to monitor the caseload and disease severity weâ ve had recent communications with the fda to discuss what process would be should we be reached out to by a hospital requesting a single patient emergency use for our hemopurifier monkeypox has not yet been declared an emergency by the department of health and human services secretary and as such there is not an emergency use authorization process in place however the world health organization has described the outbreak as unusual and has said that the virusâ s continuing spread was worrying enough to convene its expert committee on thursday june 23 2022 to decide whether the disease should be declared a public health emergency of international concern the international health regulations emergency committee met on 23 june of this year regarding the multi country monkeypox outbreak to advise the who director general on whether it should be constituted a public health emergency of international concern or so called pheic the committee advised the who director general that the outbreak should not constitute a public health international emergency concern event at this present time however the committee acknowledged that the emergency nature of the event and that controlling the future spread of this outbreak requires intense response efforts they advised that the event should be closely monitored and reviewed after a few weeks where additional information about the current unknowns for instance incubation period as well as sexual transmission et cetera become available to determine if significant changes have occurred that may warrant a reconsideration of their advice it is worth noting that the npr wrote a piece expressing concern regarding the inadequate testing on 25 june 2022 inadequate testing for monkeypox virus additionally nature medicine made the observation that there are far more mutations than would be expected in this particular outbreak with double stranded dna mutation rates being significantly elevated now let me turn the call over to steven larosa our chief medical officer dr steven larosa hello everyone and thanks for listening to our presentation iâ m dr steven larosa the chief medical officer at aethlon first i would like to give you an update on our u s clinical trial investigating the hemopurifier for the treatment of patients with severe sars cov 2 or covid known as covid 19 infection this trial is conducted under the open investigational device exemption or ide for the hemopurifier in life threatening infections the trial is designed to allow for up to 40 patients to be treated under an early feasibility study protocol and up to 20 clinical sites in the united states as you may recall we entered into an agreement with ppd a leading global contract research organization or cro to oversee our u s clinical studies investigating the hemopurifier for critically ill covid 19 patients we continued to make progress in our severe covid trial during the march 2022 quarter under our open investigational device exemption for the hemopurifier for life threatening viral infections we now have nine hospitals activated for patient enrollment and they are actively screening patients for the trial these hospitals include lsu shreveport valley baptist medical center in texas loma linda medical center hoag irvine and newport beach in southern california university of california davis university of miami medical center cooper medical and thomas jefferson medical center we are in the site activation process with additional u s medical centers as well in june 2022 lsu shreveport enrolled the first patient in the clinical trial the patient completed the hemopurifier treatment phase of the study and is now in the 28 day follow up period the patient tolerated all the hemopurifier treatment patients all the hemopurifier treatments without adverse events also on the covid 19 front during our recent earnings call i noted that we had recently obtained ethics review board approval and entered into a clinical trial agreement with medanta medicity hospital a multispecialty hospital in delhi india for a covid trial covid 19 clinical trial at that location we have previously conducted multiple clinical trials with the principal investigator as well as a previous clinical trial with medanta medicity hospital in hepatitis c patients our goal with this trial in indiaâ s to help covid 19 patients there and also generate supporting patient data that we expect will be submitted to the fda along with our u s clinical trial data this site in india is now open for enrollment and has treated one patient and is actively screening for additional covid 19 patients we are also in the process of selecting additional clinical sites for this study now let me turn the call back over to chuck fisher chuck fisher thanks steve iâ d also like to give an update on our head and neck cancer trial weâ ve enrolled two patients in the trial to date the team at the university of pittsburgh medical center has continued to actively screen for additional patients for this trial we are in the process of creating a protocol supplement to potentially increase the pool of subjects for the study we are also in discussions with additional sites and are designing a basket trial to examine the effect of our hemopurifier on exosomal removal in multiple tumor types we have an active preclinical research program where we are conducting experiments on additional targets for our hemopurifier as well as the ones to further define exosome bindings with that iâ ll turn it back over to jim for the financial discussion and then open up for questions jim frakes thanks chuck and good afternoon again everyone on march 31 2022 we had a cash balance of approximately 17 1 million our current cash position sets us up very well for conducting our planned clinical trials as steve larosa just noted and for the manufacturing of our hemopurifier for those trials during the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 we raised approximately 17 5 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and a combination of a registered direct financing and atm sales we recorded approximately 294 000 of revenue related to our government contracts with the nih and the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 compared to approximately 659 000 in the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 on march 31 2022 we had approximately 345 000 of deferred revenue related to those contracts as a result of not achieving certain milestones on those contracts our consolidated operating expenses for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 were approximately 10 72 million compared to approximately 8 55 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 an increase of approximately 2 17 million in the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 the 2 17 million increase in the 2022 period was due to increases in payroll and related expenses of approximately 1 17 million and in general and administrative expenses of approximately 1 million which were partially offset by a decrease of approximately 4 000 in our professional fees the 1 17 million increase in the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 in payroll and related expenses was due to an increase in cash based compensation of approximately 1 2 million which was partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation of approximately 29 000 the 1 2 million increase in cash based compensation was primarily due to increases of approximately 826 000 and 721 000 in g a payroll and in r d payroll respectively due to headcount increases and approximately 203 000 in relocation related compensation to senior executives that relocated to san diego california as a condition of their employment those increases were partially offset by the combination of a 452 000 accrual in the 2021 period related to the separation agreement with our former ceo with no comparable expense in the 2022 period and a net decrease of approximately 135 000 in cash bonuses the 1 million increase in the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 in g a expenses primarily arose from increases of 453 000 and clinical trial expenses 209 000 in rent expense and 195 000 in insurance expenses as a result of the changes in revenues and expenses i just described our net loss before non controlling interests increased to approximately 10 4 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2022 from approximately 7 9 million for the fiscal year ended march 31 2021 we included these earnings results and related commentary in a press release issued earlier this afternoon that release included the balance sheet for march 31 2022 and the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march 31 2022 and 2021 we will file our annual report on form 10 k following this call our next earnings call for the fiscal first quarter ending june 30 2022 will coincide with the filing of our quarterly report on form 10 q in early august and now chuck steve and i would be happy to take any questions that you may have operator please open the call for questions question and answer session operator we will now begin the question and answer session the first question is from marla marin with zacks please go ahead marla marin youâ ve done a lot of work outside of the ongoing clinical trials that youâ re conducting now a lot of work on researching the impact of the hemopurifier can you give us any color on how that enters into some of your conversations or interactions with the regulators as you try to move forward dr steven larosa marla this is steven larosa thank you for your question so we are we have a breakthrough designation in covid 19 and viral infections with the fda and are in close contact with them in terms of in our current clinical trials we noted that we enrolled our first patient so that data will be forthcoming we donâ t have that currently but we weâ ve had conversations with them about potential ways to adjust the study to so that we can continue the trial and enroll more patients i donâ t know if that answers your question marla marin well i was thinking about some of the data that youâ re getting outside of the trialâ steven larosa yes the data we have marla outside the trial is data that are from patients weâ ve treated as single patient emergency use criteria these were published in a peer reviewed journal in frontiers in medicine the data is very interesting in that in one patient who was not viremic we were able to show the removal of exosomes and exosomal micro rnas that are implicated in coagulopathy and acute lung injury and those exosomes micro rnas decreased with hemopurifier treatment at the same time the patientâ s oxygenation and coagulopathy were improving in a second patient who was in fact viremic with covid 19 weâ re able to show for the first time in vivo that the hemopurifier decreased the covid viral load by 58 during the first six hour hemopurifier treatment marla marin and when you speak to or interact with the fda does any of that come into play given that itâ s not actually the outcome of an ongoing clinical trial steven larosa they are aware of this data but they want to see obviously safety and efficacy data and a larger number of patients enrolled in the clinical trial marla marin okay thank you operator the next question is from vernon bernardino with h c wainwright please go ahead vernon bernardino i was wondering we still have over 100 000 at least a seven day average cases of covid recorded daily but a lot of them are not severe cases anymore just wondering what are the key challenges you think youâ ve what have you identified are the key challenges for enrolling patients in the study and perhaps a little differently what have your clinical sites or activated hospitals think may be the challenges or ways that they could perhaps enroll patients more quickly thank you steven larosa so as i think youâ ve picked up on there are still a number of fairly large number of covid 19 cases but what weâ ve noted as others have noted is that vaccines have been quite good at preventing severe infection so what weâ re seeing is although the cases are up the number of the sites are telling us the number of hospitalizations and icu admissions is still relatively low although it has increased recently is the feedback weâ ve received from hospitals so we still feel that the story is not over with covid and that there will likely still be cases that are eligible the other interesting the challenge is to get into our current trial you have to be on renal replacement therapy and that has decreased the need for renal replacement due to covid has decreased during the pandemic so weâ re also trying to work with the regulators to see if we can increase the potential pool of patients that would be eligible for the study vernon bernardino now pardon me if i donâ t remember this but as far as the patients are concerned how what is the length of treatment and as far as the design of the study is concerned the original number of patients that you were targeting for a complete study steven larosa so we were granted approval to conduct a trial of up to 40 patients in a safety and feasibility type trial so that is still the plan could you repeat the second part of your question vernon bernardino just wondering if the length of the treatment is still the same as originally designed steven larosa right so the design is that a patient will receive a four to six hour chemo purifier session once daily for four consecutive days during which time there would be blood drawn for both covid viral load measurements in the blood to see if the hemopurifier decreases viral load as well as biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation throughout the whole 28 day study period weâ d also be monitoring see if a patientâ s organ failures improve and what their clinical outcome is at the end of that time period so that our design has stayed the same throughout the trial weâ re not going to we donâ t plan on making changes to that follow up period or treatment period going forward vernon bernardino okay and sorry to jump back to the first question with the 40 patients can you either describe or provide some kind of insight as to what the fda thinks as to the number of patients that you plan to enroll those patients and are they open to a lower number of patients such that this study could be completed in a time in which perhaps the hemopurifier could be considered sooner rather than later as a treatment option for severe covid patients steven larosa so to answer your question they gave us approval to treat up to 40 patients as part of this approval a typical safety and feasibility study however typically is on the order of 10 to 15 patients so we would have the ability where this is an open label study to review our data as it comes in both safety and efficacy and then revisit the time point revisit that data with the fda especially given the breakthrough designation at any time so itâ s not a situation where we have to enroll 40 patients there is the latitude to examine the data as it comes in and then discuss with the fda vernon bernardino thank you for that and last question for me and sorry to keep on and on and on do you test are the patients tested for for example like pcr the type of variant that they have for example if b45 is now comprising 50 of the patients is that some kind of data that youâ d be able to collect steven larosa yes we will have multiple viral measurements in the blood from every patient and have the ability then to determine exactly which variant it is yes vernon bernardino terrific thank you for taking my questions and looking forward to more data chuck fisher and vernon i think itâ s worth noting that to date we also demonstrated binding of most known variants and we anticipate that that will continue vernon bernardino no exactly and thatâ s why i asked the question and looking forward to more of that kind of data thank you chuck fisher sure operator the next question is from anthony vendetti with maxim group please go ahead anthony vendetti so just following up on the keytruda trial so you have two patients so far if i remember from the last call chuck you mentioned about increasing the number of sites to try to increase enrollment to get up to 10 to 12 have you been successful in recruiting physicians and patients at these other sites and itâ s just taken longer to sign up or what can you give us an update on the additional sites chuck fisher sure good question thanks for calling obviously the first patient went very smoothly but that was at a time when the hospital was not hit by covid subsequently we were hit by covid pretty badly including running over to the cancer hospital and that embargoed use of patients or having patients would come in that could get the our treatment for covid subsequently where we are now is the same has tapered off a bit theyâ re not as severe which steve mentioned earlier and less in the icu sorry the head and neck patients are hard to come by at present and thereâ s been a lot of screening so what weâ re working with the university of pittsburgh as well is thinking more broadly than them to be adding other hospital sites with other physicians that specialize in head and neck to increase numbers in those trials steven larosa yes i would just comment that one of the challenges in head and neck is having patients who have enough reserve enough strength to tolerate the hemopurifier so there may be people who are eligible by their disease but because of their functional status that is thatâ s been a challenge as well as with covid well weâ ve had some recent discussions with the pi about some attempts that we can make any protocol supplement to broaden the inclusion criteria and weâ re going to pursue those additionally as chuck said weâ re also currently drafting a protocol for an additional trial which is more of a basket trial where youâ re looking at the effect of the hemopurifier upfront before keytruda in a number of different tumor types that where keytruda is indicated so weâ re rapidly pursuing getting that protocol draft written so that we could get that trial going anthony vendetti right because keytruda is used for a number of different cancers what do you think would be the logical next cancer to look at after head and neck with keytruda steven larosa well thereâ s a whole host that weâ re in a basket trial we would include a number of different tumor types and what we would particularly be interested in looking at is can we restore responsiveness to keytruda in people whoâ ve had a run in period and are showing signs of their failing because that is actually 70 of the people who get keytruda ultimately go on to fail so if we can actually restore their responsiveness in a number of tumor types that would be the next strategy anthony vendetti okay that makes sense just to chuckâ s point that some patients are not strong enough to withstand the hemopurifier how do you measure that how do you determine if is it a number of factors or is there a specific determinant steven larosa yes thereâ s a number of grading and scoring scales that describe someoneâ s functional status and you include those in your inclusion criteria to make sure that you have somebody who is not severely debilitated from their cancer to understand to grade that anthony vendetti okay thank you very much i appreciate it that was helpful chuck fisher thanks anthony operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to chuck fisher for any closing remarks chuck fisher weâ d like to thank everybody for joining us on this call today to discuss our fourth quarter results we look forward to keeping you up to date on future calls and thank you very much for joining and have a good day good bye operator the conference is now concluded thank you for attending todayâ s presentation you may

after throwing lifelines to troubled digital currency platforms blockfi and voyager digital sam bankman fried the 30 year old billionaire founder of ftx warns that some crypto exchanges will soon fail t he question on everybody s mind in the crypto world is whether we ve reached the market bottom nearly 2 trillion in crypto market value has evaporated since november two bellwether digital assets luna a 40 billion crypto asset associated with terrausd a 16 billion stablecoin designed to maintain parity with the u s dollar have collapsed earlier this month bitcoin traded for below 20 000 its lowest level since december 2020 but the fallout is far from complete earlier this month singapore based three arrows capital 3ac a highly levered crypto trading firm with 200 million of exposure to luna revealed that it was nearly insolvent three arrows had borrowed large sums from numerous crypto firms including new jersey s voyager digital and new york based blockfi in order to survive three arrows default the two digital asset exchanges turned to billionaire sam bankman fried founder of ftx and the richest person in crypto worth some 20 5 billion between ftx and his quantitative trading firm alameda he provided the companies with 750 million in credit lines there is no guarantee that bankman fried will recoup his investment you know we re willing to do a somewhat bad deal here if that s what it takes to sort of stabilize things and protect customers he says we re willing to do a somewhat bad deal here if that s what it takes to sort of stabilize things sam bankman fried bankman fried s cash infusions are far from altruistic he has emerged as a smart vulture capitalist in the beleaguered crypto market knowing full well that his own fortune depends on its healthy rebound and growth bankman fried has also bought into crypto brokerage robinhood where ftx has already accumulated a 7 6 stake and is rumored to be considering an acquisition bankman fried denies any active merger talks with robinhood but tells forbes that more crypto exchange failures are coming there are some third tier exchanges that are already secretly insolvent says bankman fried guerin blask for forbes fried s ftx along with coinbase kraken and binance are giants among digital asset exchanges they have millions of customer accounts and functionally they operate similarly to online stock brokerages but outside of these whales there are more than 600 crypto exchanges around the world operating in a largely unregulated frontier never heard of aax billance and hotbit you aren t alone but like coinbase they trade bitcoin ether and dogecoin and offer generous margin loans as much 20 times their initial capital to their clients lacking any meaningful regulatory oversight many crypto exchanges have been vulnerable to scammers and hacks japanese exchange coincheck was hacked for 530 million in crypto in 2018 seychelles based exchange kucoin lost 275 million in 2020 and then in december 2021 cayman island based bitmart was breached for 200 million back in 2016 bitifinex was hacked to the tune of nearly 120 000 bitcoin worth 2 5 billion now but despite the generous bailouts not even bankman fried is able or willing to throw good money after bad in perpetuity there are companies that are basically too far gone and it s not practical to backstop them for reasons like a substantial hole in the balance sheet regulatory issues or that there is not much of a business left to be saved says bankman fried who declined to name any specific crypto exchanges as forbes reported in its analysis of the world s best 60 crypto exchanges the digital asset exchange business generally lacks standards to certify a new entity before or after they start soliciting client funds the sec doesn t regulate the exchanges and the commodities futures and trading commission has oversight of only a handful of crypto derivatives markets in the united states there is no member organization like finra to self regulate crypto exchanges bankman fried is worried about continued failures because during the euphoria of rising crypto prices exchanges kept upping the ante to attract customers with generous yields for deposits blockfi or voyager were promising yield payments to customers upwards of 12 per year that had to be paid for either by charging at least that much more interest to borrowers or more likely by putting that money to work in decentralized finance defi applications that worked fine when crypto was going nowhere but up it looks disastrous now there are companies that are basically too far gone and it s not practical to backstop them sam bankman fried like j p morgan during the stock market panic and crash of 1907 bankman fried is taking advantage of the crypto chaos to expand his empire he recently closed the acquisition of liquid a troubled japanese exchange blockfi and voyager digital are in his grip and despite his denials robinhood may be next according to sources familiar with his loans to voyager alameda is likely to lose at least 70 million of the credit it has already extended in 2021 publicly traded voyager s digital had a market value of more than 3 billion today it shares trade for pennies and its market cap of 62 million points to an imminent bankruptcy filing despite the carnage bankman fried tells forbes that ftx remains profitable and has been for the past 10 quarters ftx s biggest rival coinbase lost 432 million in the first quarter of 2022 and its stock is down almost 90 from its all time high bankman fried also has his eye on crypto miners many of whom leveraged their balance sheet at breakneck pace to quickly scale and take advantage of this 21st century digital gold rush the stocks of publicly trading crypto miners including marathon digital holdings and riot blockchain are down more than 60 year to date one bellwether crypto asset bankman fried is not worried about is tether world s largest dollar pegged stablecoin with a market cap exceeding 70 billion many industry watchers have deemed it a ticking time bomb with questionable collateral whose failure would almost certainly be an existential threat to the entire cryptocurrency market tested during the luna collapse tether briefly lost its 1 peg and fell to a price 95 cents however it successfully processed over 10 billion worth of withdrawals and has since recovered says bankman fried i think that the really bearish views on tether are wrong i don t think there is any evidence to support them this article has been updated to reflect that kucoin is a seychelles based crypto exchange not singaporean more from forbes more from forbes meet the world s richest 29 year old how sam bankman fried made a record

i don t normally plan on doing two part pieces i can usually say what i need to say in a single post even if it runs a tad long however the bruen decision came out last week that means there s been a ton of deep dives into what the decision actually means including our own advertisement yet most of us are laymen we re not experts on the law over at scotus blog georgetown law professor randy barnett talks about the decision barnett has a washington d c carry permit and going into some of the discussion around this one will go into part 2 and so he s familiar with gun control and its impact he takes a look at bruen and his take is actually pretty interesting in particular looking at the text and history approach justice clarence thomas called for in his decision as he describes it thomas approach seems to base the existence of a right on a finding that the liberty in question here the right to carry arms outside the home had never been restricted what if a liberty was not prohibited or regulated until the 1930s say the use of marijuana for medical purposes does that mean it cannot be prohibited or regulated now i approve of the implication that it cannot be prohibited though i should think it may still be regulated what does the majority think conversely on this conception of rights if history reveals a long tradition of regulation not prohibition of a particular liberty does this mean it cannot be considered a constitutional right there is however an even more fundamental question raised by thomas text and history approach it seems to assume that once we use history to identify the outer contours of a constitutional right then any such right bars not only prohibitions on its exercise but also trumps any statutory regulation of it prior to the new deal however rights were not viewed as trumps on the regulatory power of government instead the existence of a right barred the complete deprivation of it that is a prohibition and statutes were strictly or equitably construed to avoid this result and the existence of a right also required that a regulation be within the power of a legislature to enact at the federal level this meant a power delegated to congress by the constitution at the state level this meant what is called the state s police power while broad the state police power was not unlimited to assess whether this is the case requires a court to evaluate whether there is a sufficient fit between the ends of the legislation and the means adopted to achieve it or as alexander hamilton put the matter congress has only a right to pass such laws as are necessary and proper to accomplish the objects intrusted to it and the relation between the measure and the end must be the criterion of constitutionality this sounds like a means ends analysis to me thomas seems to want to limit the original scope of a constitutional right by his historical inquiry and then the right so limited may not be restricted in any way if rights are this absolute however then we cannot afford to recognize very many if government is to function this would explain thomas apparent movement toward an enumerated rights only view of constitutional rights though he has not yet committed himself to this view but viewing rights as absolute in this way is quite modern and ahistorical and its invocation in a purportedly originalist opinion is therefore surprising advertisement it s an interesting take now admittedly i have the absolutist view on our rights and i m not sure i agree that it s ahistorical however it s not something i m interested in debating all things considered the truth is that while i personally hold that view i understand that i m in the minority what matters though is that the text and history standard has the potential to be huge in the long run after all there is no text or history banning a category of weapon in common use nor is there any for restricting how much ammunition a firearm can hold yet that may just be the tip of the iceberg banning accessories like bump stocks or pistol braces again no text or history suggests this was a practice when the second amendment was penned mandatory training before getting a permit hell there s no evidence of permitting at that time either in fact there are few gun control laws that can reasonably withstand such an examination which should well put all gun control enthusiasts on alert
remember when retail stores were limiting purchases of at home covid 19 tests following the reversal of roe v wade distributors are now limiting purchases of plan b emergency contraceptive pills due to increased demand on monday the wall street journal reported that cvs walmart walgreens and rite aid are all experiencing a surge in the purchase of plan b pills three of those companies are rationing the over the counter drugs either in store online or both with the june 24 scotus reversal of roe 13 states have already passed pro life laws and there has been a high demand for plan b pills in the case that women cannot use other methods to kill their babies in life affirming states big retailers are rationing over the counter emergency contraceptive pills as demand spikes following the supreme court ruling overturning the constitutional right to an abortion wsjwhatsnow pic twitter com h32eczseta the wall street journal wsj june 28 2022 a cvs spokesman told wsj that the company has implemented temporary purchase limits to ensure equitable access walmart claimed that it regularly rations high demand products and rite aid told wsj that it was limiting purchases of the pills both online and in stores due to increased demand walgreens boots alliance inc reportedly had a purchase limit on its website but claimed it was an error and that it would be soon corrected hmm sounds fishy plan b the top selling emergency contraceptive brand is a pill that does not need a prescription it is often referred to as the morning after pill and is to be taken within three days of unprotected sex if taken early enough the pill aims to stop the woman from ovulating but if that doesn t work or if the pill is taken later on it can stop a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus though these pills are scientifically different than chemical abortion pills the latter form is often considered an abortion for the pro life community as it terminates a fertilized egg even so birth control is still legal in the united states and this surge to retail sites and locations was an irrational decision wsj pointed out why there is an unnecessarily high demand in the days following friday s court decision social media filled with comments either encouraging or dissuading people to stock up on the contraceptive some users posted that they were buying as many as possible others argued against stockpiling for fear it would cut off access to people with an immediate need wsj also included planned parenthood s response to the surge planned parenthood on monday advised against stockpiling emergency contraceptives as they have limited shelf life and because hoarding supplies could limit access for women who have an immediate need ethics aside there have not been any reports of states that have halted the distribution of the plan b emergency contraceptive pills but in the case that they do perhaps chastity belts will reach high demand at some point too
samaha is a housing program manager for path people assisting the homeless she lives in hillcrest in 1985 san diego resident jill van cleve spoke to the city s planning commission regarding a proposed ordinance to protect single room occupancy sro units from demolition single room units often regarded as the housing of last resort are small rooms typically less than 250 square feet with shared bathrooms and common spaces commentary opinion art and music can help people get off the streets so can single room units homelessness in san diego can seem intractable but not all the stories are grim here the founder of a charity that helps homeless youth and one of the people the charity assists write about how art and music can help build trust and get people off the street also a homeless program manager writes about the urgent need to preserve single room units at the time downtown san diego s gaslamp district was experiencing a revitalization and van cleve had recently been evicted from her unit by a property owner who planned to redevelop when your option is a dempsey dumpster you re damn right we want to preserve the substandard she said sros are brilliant support networks they are the only choice we have except the streets advertisement our downtown community is again undergoing extensive change and housing options for the most vulnerable continue to shrink home prices in the 92101 zip code increased 29 9 percent over the past year tower cranes peak through the city skyline as developers scramble to meet the demand and once more the single room occupancy buildings are vulnerable to the wrecking ball homeless service providers estimate a loss of more than 300 units in the near future as several of the remaining buildings are being redeveloped or are currently for sale this is happening at a time when we are experiencing an unprecedented housing affordability and homelessness crisis according to the san diego downtown partnership the number of individuals experiencing homelessness in downtown has doubled in the past year in 2021 the university of san diego s urgent challenges collective conducted a survey and found that most single room occupancy residents are long term tenants relying on forms of government assistance such as social security or disability the average rental rate for a single room occupancy unit is 895 a month and nearly half of respondents reported spending more than 75 percent of their limited income on rent with the average rent for a studio in san diego hovering around 2 000 single room occupancy residents who are evicted have few if any alternative housing options so how did the city of san diego respond to similar challenges nearly four decades ago contrary to many other american cities during this time san diego not only put in place an ordinance to protect single room occupancy it made a commitment to building more affordable efficiency units this emphasized the city s understanding of the value of diversity in building healthy and dynamic communities the san diego housing commission has worked to enhance single room occupancy protections in recent years with amendments to the existing ordinance including increasing relocation costs for displaced single room occupancy residents and implementing a right of first refusal for single room occupancy which would grant the city or a community based organization preference in purchasing single room occupancy properties ensuring their ongoing affordability unfortunately these proposed changes have been stalled largely due to opposition from the sro alliance a small group of single room occupancy property owners who argue that these changes disincentivize owning single room occupancy properties and infringe on their property rights it is striking how our society was so easily able to enact eminent domain to carve freeways through black and brown neighborhoods upending lives business and communities but lack the courage to be so bold to take urgent and immediate action to prevent our most vulnerable renters from falling into homelessness there is however a road map on how to move forward in 2007 vancouver british columbia created the sro renewal initiative with the goal of acquiring and renovating 13 single room occupancy buildings over a 10 year period the initiative was successful in preserving 900 units of affordable housing in the city center the sro renewal initiative also released case studies that highlight challenges lessons learned and outcomes regarding key components of the initiative in hopes that cities that still retain this unique housing stock can follow suit we have also seen similar success with single room occupancy preservation in our own community in 2021 the san diego housing commission acquired the hillcrest inn and partnered with path people assisting the homeless to allocate rooms for individuals experiencing homelessness with high medical needs this can and should be replicated to save remaining single room occupancy properties access to all that san diego has to offer should not be exclusively for the affluent san diego residents including those with limited financial means have a right to the city and all the benefits that come with it recreation walkability and social connection we cannot continue to wait for more affordable units to be built while existing affordable options are lost to the profit driven market the most effective way to solve homelessness is by preventing it from happening in the first place in which case we must act quickly

c mon texas it s time to get with the 90s i say that because when i was in the navy in the 90s i discovered that texas was one of only a handful of states that still adhered to so called blue laws in case you re not in the know blue laws are laws that were put into place to ban the sale of certain items on sundays some were very random like banning the sales of nails and screws on sundays i m not sure why you couldn t sell nails or screws on the lord s day but thankfully that changed back in the 80s according to the austin american statesman get our free mobile app however the ban on liquor sales on sundays remained in place since blue laws only apply to sunday it s clear that they were put into place by christians who didn t want any extra temptations on the sabbath the thing is as a christian i like to do a little day drinking after i get out of church on sundays and that s coming from someone who s in church almost every sunday so i usually make sure to stock the liquor cabinet up on friday or saturday because if i forget i m out of luck on sunday thanks to that outdated law hopefully that s about to change khou is reporting that several texas distillers are pushing for liquor sales to be allowed seven days a week the goal is for the law to be changed during the next session of the texas legislature in 2023 my thing is that people are going to drink on sundays anyway so you might as well allow liquor stores to bring in some extra revenue and raise some more tax dollars that hopefully will be put to good use by the government best place to get a margarita in wichita falls whether it s cinco de mayo or just a sunday funday a margarita always hits the spot i decided to look up the highest rated mexican restaurants in wichita falls i made sure they had margaritas as an option because many in our city just offer food here are the top ten results ten things i hate about wichita falls no jokes here legit stuff that pisses me off about our city let me know what i missed or if you disagree
tesla has gutted the data annotation team working on autopilot laying off nearly 200 employees and shutting down the san mateo california office where they worked the layoffs first reported by bloomberg have been confirmed by sources who talked to techcrunch on condition of anonymity the cuts come amid a broader reduction of jobs at tesla however these layoffs targeted personnel once deemed critical to the company s autopilot advanced driver assistance system and more notably efforts by ceo elon musk to further develop automated driving functions through the 12 000 optional fsd system until today tesla had hundreds of data annotation employees working on the autopilot team in san mateo and buffalo new york the san mateo office had a headcount of 276 and after laying off 195 staffers from all ranks supervisors labelers and data analysts the team is left with 81 workers who sources say will be relocated to another office most of the workers were in moderately low skilled low wage jobs such as autopilot data labeling which involves determining if tesla s algorithm identified an object well or poorly according to one source the source noted layoffs of this team were rumored to be on the table for months and that the work would be offloaded to buffalo based on data from glassdoor jobs like data annotation specialists or data analysts at tesla pay less in buffalo than in san mateo it s unclear if tesla is shifting workers to the new york office to reduce costs or as a strategy to become eligible for new york state s many job incentives like the new york youth jobs program tax credit or the credit for employment of persons with disabilities that said it likely won t be a 1 1 replacement in buffalo where sources say tesla will probably just inundate the existing team as is the tesla way act now deal with the consequences later if tesla is indeed not going to be hiring more data labelers and others to work on autopilot which the company has said is a vital ingredient for training deep neural networks that can help improve the full self driving beta software then what will happen to that technology perhaps tesla will change course on its vision only approach to autonomy and start introducing lidar and radar to its vehicles layoffs or terminations while sources confirm the 195 autopilot team members who were let go tuesday were indeed laid off they also say most of the layoffs that began in the end of may were in reality terminations based on performance story continues terminating employees based on performance allows any company the chance to avoid going through certain legal requirements like the worker adjustment and retraining notification warn act which helps ensure advance notice in cases of qualified plant closings and mass layoffs indeed last week two former tesla employees filed a lawsuit against the automaker alleging the company did not provide the 60 days of advance notice required by federal law during its recent round of layoffs there is also a class action lawsuit being carried out against tesla that sources say recruits more spurned workers everyday tesla stock is down 5 on tuesday in after hours trading
much of the fossil fuel industry continued to hemorrhage jobs last year even as employment in the electric car sector increased dramatically according to a report today from the department of energy released yesterday the 2022 u s energy and employment report useer is compiled annually using public labor statistics and analyzes virtually every established energy sector from energy efficiency and electric power generation to motor vehicles fuels production and transmission distribution and storage this year s report considered how the nation s energy workforces fared in 2021 and found that most of them grew at a modest clip overall energy sector jobs were up 4 percent with electric vehicles being a standout employment in the electric car sector exploded 26 percent while jobs related to hybrid cars rose 20 percent in comparison electric vehicle jobs grew only 8 percent in the prior year s report still energy industries have yet to fully recover from the drubbing they took during the height of the covid 19 pandemic more than 840 000 energy related positions vanished by the end of 2020 in 2021 less than half of that total around 300 000 reappeared according to the report in many corners of the fossil fuel industry workforces grew slimmer jobs in coal and petroleum fuels including extraction manufacturing but excluding power generation fell by almost 12 percent and over 6 percent respectively in 2021 resulting in roughly 46 000 lost positions only natural gas saw a rebound with jobs growing 1 6 percent the shrinkage of coal and petroleum jobs last year was a continuation from 2020 according to doe coal lost 15 000 positions in 2020 and petroleum shed 120 318 natural gas lost almost 66 000 jobs in 2020 before last year s rebound the american petroleum institute and the american gas association did not provide comment on a press call yesterday energy secretary jennifer granholm emphasized that over 40 percent of the energy job growth last year was in net zero aligned areas ranging from clean energy and evs to energy efficiency and storage the jobs are growing in industries we need to support a 100 percent clean power sector granholm said noting whopping growth in ev jobs that is a key takeaway from this report with fossil fuels she said the jobs decline underscores the crucial nature of our investments in economic diversification and in high quality job creation within fossil fuel communities especially coal communities despite last year s decline in jobs doe is encouraged this year by an increase in u s fossil fuel production granholm added we expect that these numbers will probably modulate a bit she said in 2022 you ll see an increase in employment that corresponds to the increase in supply clearly the president has set forth a goal of getting to net zero by 2050 so there is a period of transition here and it s net so no one is suggesting that fossil fuel jobs that the fossil fuel industry is going to be completely eliminated even as the globe is transitioning to clean energy we need to have supply meet demand and that s the bottom line and it doesn t at this moment so we want to see an increase in supply but ultimately most project there will be a demand curve that comes down and this transition will happen she said clean energy groups react the biden administration has released two useer reports with the first emerging last year the obama administration produced a report in 2015 but the trump administration later halted further releases a group led by former energy secretary ernest moniz who served under president barack obama subsequently began producing a similar report greenwire may 16 2018 under the bipartisan infrastructure law signed last year doe is now required to produce the report annually last year s report largely took stock of the pandemic s effect on the energy sector finding that energy jobs had fallen 10 percent at the end of 2020 relative to the year before at the time granholm sought to raise expectations for clean energy growth if the biden administration s climate agenda were passed by congress it would result in unprecedented job growth in clean energy in 2022 s report along with every year after that she said then energywire july 20 2021 much of president joe biden s agenda including a clean energy standard for electricity has been stymied by congress in 2021 job growth in many renewables remained far below the rate that some experts say will be necessary to achieve the administration s goal of a carbon free grid by 2035 for wind job growth was 2 9 percent last year while for solar it was 5 4 percent hydropower bioenergy and geothermal positions increased anywhere in the 2 and 3 percent range and nuclear power generation jobs declined over 4 percent one advocacy group the american council on renewable energy acore praised the renewable sector for installing record amounts of new capacity the previous year a fact not represented in the doe report the groups said that energy growth translated to more high quality jobs for more americans in a statement gregory wetstone acore s president and ceo said that in the face of significant covid 19 headwinds and a largely unhelpful administration the renewable sector demonstrated its resilience with its growth acore is one of several renewable trade groups that disagreed with the administration over a commerce department probe into new tariffs on solar imports from four southeast asian countries energywire june 7 electric vehicle advocates meanwhile said they were pleased with the report s conclusions about battery vehicles joe britton executive director of the zero emission transportation association said the big growth in ev jobs showed that expanded tax incentives being discussed in congress could stoke a far larger emergence of a u s centered electric car industry this is just the front edge of what has potential to be a big boom he said the useer report also contained new breakdowns of the energy workforce s demographics across the energy sector women made up only a quarter of the energy workforce compared with 47 percent of the country s entire workforce and most industries had lower than average percentages of black and latino workers there are no technologies where black workers are represented proportionally to their overall representation in the u s workforce the report said for clean energy that picture often didn t change much in wind and solar for instance women made up only 30 percent of the workforce and although wind and solar workers were more likely to be either unionized or represented by a project labor agreement than workers in the wider economy their workforces had below average concentrations of black employees one progressive group jobs to move america expressed concern over the patchy levels of diversity in clean energy industries especially for people of color and women however we are encouraged by the strong initiatives that the doe has been taking to encourage companies to commit to good jobs and racial equity in u s clean energy infrastructure said paola rodelas the group s spokesperson in an email
