a piece in the vancouver sun looks at slumping property markets in several cities across the pacific while each city in the region has its own distinct characteristics there are a few common denominators rising borrowing costs increased government regulation and volatile stock markets there s also dwindling demand from a force so powerful it pushed prices to a record in many places chinese buyers in hong kong after an almost 15 year bull run that made hong kong notorious for having the world s least affordable property market home prices have taken a battering some experts attribute the slump to a slowing mainland chinese economy as well as the simmering trade war between china and the united states in singapore government policies are mainly to blame for falling prices with the luxury market particularly hard hit in sydney while prices are still about 60 per cent higher than they were in 2012 meaning few existing homeowners are actually underwater forecasts of a further 10 per cent fall making nervous investors think twice about extraneous spending and in shanghai and beijing values are down about 5 percent from their peak prompting developer giveaways one developer in september was giving away a bmw series 3 or x1 to anyone wishing to purchase a three bedroom unit or townhouse at its project in shanghai see also san francisco home construction expected to slump this year

advertisement the bid for the joint enterprise defense infrastructure jedi contract a 10 billion cloud contract with the pentagon that cloud giants are competing for might potentially be delayed because of the government shutdown some analysts say since the department of defense wasn t closed from the shutdown there won t be a direct impact on the jedi race however the shutdown could affect government cybersecurity the ability of companies to obtain government security certifications and the timing of the winner s announcement three weeks have already passed since the government shutdown began tying it for the longest shutdown in history while congress tries to settle the standoff there s one thing that cloud giants may have to worry about there s a race for a 10 billion cloud contract with the pentagon called the joint enterprise defense infrastructure jedi contract and it s a winner take all competition between amazon microsoft ibm and oracle an award is expected in april and the shutdown could potentially affect this match some analysts say the good news is the government shutdown has no direct impact on the race that s because the shutdown applies to agencies and functions outside the department of defense the defense department was not closed as a result of the shutdown advertisement still there could potentially be an indirect impact although analysts disagree to what extent government cybersecurity is already weakening as nearly 45 of employees at the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency have already been furloughed during the shutdown according to a duo security report renee murphy a principal analyst at forrester says that although the department of defense itself isn t shut down the agencies it works with are shutdown and this could lead to a delay i don t think for a second they would make a move on jedi without having an office and budget there murphy told business insider they can t keep going they re going to end up with a longer timeline it s just going to take longer to get it down right now amazon is the only company in the race with the highest security authorization to handle government data a major reason why it s the favorite to win the contract if the other contenders want to catch up they could face delays in getting the necessary certifications after all in the midst of the shutdown this isn t a top priority read more as bidding closes amazon s cloud is the favorite to win a 10 billion defense deal here s why everybody else is so mad about it advertisement potentially the situation could take a turn if the scope of the shutdown widens or if president donald trump decides he wants to use funds from the department of defense for the border wall says pund it principal analyst charles king but the chances are slim the chances of that happening seem remote since it would require the president removing jedi funds and would also be challenged in court king told business insider but with this administration you should never say never still the shutdown itself will likely have minimal impact on jedi there are bigger fish to fry members of congress have requested an investigation of the bidding process and oracle filed a formal complaint protesting the winner take all bidding process these are more likely to delay jedi than the shutdown itself king says in the past few months the contest for the jedi contract has had its fill of turmoil including google dropping out of the race an amazon smear campaign circulating in washington and both ibm and oracle filing official protests a government shutdown just adds a little more uncertainty from a timing perspective to when the deal could be announced daniel ives managing director of equity research at wedbush securities told business insider advertisement already as a result of the shutdown national parks are closed federal workers aren t getting paid food programs are losing funding and airplane lines are growing longer get the latest ibm stock price here

washington the partial shutdown of the u s government has begun to make it harder to assess the health of the economy by delaying or distorting key reports on growth spending and hiring government data on home construction and retail sales for example won t be released next week because staffers who compile those reports have been furloughed the retail sales report provides a snapshot of consumer spending which fuels more than two thirds of the economy with macy s and kohl s having said thursday that their holiday sales were weaker than expected a broader gauge of retail spending would have provided important clarity in addition the next report on the economy s overall growth set for jan 30 won t be released if the shutdown remains in effect even if the government has fully reopened by then federal workers won t likely have had enough time to produce the scheduled report on the nation s gross domestic product not all agencies are closed congress approved funding last year for the labor department so the government s next monthly jobs report will be released as scheduled on feb 1 but it s unclear how long the department will be able to issue jobs reports the most closely watched barometer of the economy after that advertisement article continues below this ad though the economy remains healthy in most respects there are rising concerns that growth could slow or even stall in coming months the trade war between the united states and china which has helped depress global growth is likely slowing business investment the stimulus from the trump administration s tax cuts is expected to fade and borrowing costs have risen since the federal reserve raised short term interest rates four times last year before rebounding this week stock markets had plummeted roughly 16 percent from their peak oct 2 fed officials are now stressing their flexibility on rate hikes emphasizing that they will be patient and their policy data dependent by this the fed means that the government s latest readings on hiring inflation and growth will factor heavily in its rate decisions yet much of that data will now be unavailable to the fed or anyone else for us one of the biggest effects of the shutdown has been around data raphael bostic president of the fed s atlanta regional bank said wednesday we re worrying about that advertisement article continues below this ad even some reports that are released on schedule are likely to be distorted by the shutdown for example the january jobs report may show an artificially high unemployment rate and low employment figure that s because up to 380 000 federal employees who aren t working or being paid during the shutdown but who will return to work afterward could be counted as unemployed for january if so that would raise the unemployment rate by 0 2 percentage point estimated ben herzon an economist at macroeconomic advisers a forecasting firm and the monthly job count could decline by 380 000 if the shutdown continues through the end of january herzon said that could push the monthly job figure into negative territory if all the federal workers eventually receive back pay as is expected and has occurred after previous shutdowns then the january jobs report would later be revised to restore those 380 000 jobs according to the labor department s bureau of labor statistics future jobs reports could be jeopardized too if the government remains shut down the census bureau conducts the monthly surveys that the bls uses to calculate the unemployment rate census is part of the commerce department which remains closed during the shutdown as a result it s unclear if future jobs reports will be released if the shutdown continues the bls said advertisement article continues below this ad other economic reports have already been missed they include a monthly report on factory orders that was scheduled for monday that report typically provides insights into how much u s companies are spending on large equipment inflation data will also be affected the consumer price index will be released friday morning as scheduled because it is prepared by the labor department but the fed s preferred inflation gauge is published by commerce s bureau of economic analysis which is closed and because the agriculture department is closed future reports on wholesale prices and import prices won t include farm related data the bls said thursday a report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits considered a nearly real time reflection of layoffs is still being published but it could be distorted by the shutdown nearly 5 000 federal employees sought benefits two weeks ago according to the latest data available roughly five times the usual figure advertisement article continues below this ad and only a portion of the government s report on productivity or output per hour worked will be released feb 6 the labor department said that s because that report requires data on the growth of gdp the broadest measure of the economy even after the government fully reopens weeks likely will be needed before all the postponed reports can be prepared and released it may take some time to get a clean read on the economy economists at bank of america merrill lynch said thursday

february 1992 and reached an all time high of almost 73 a share in mid 2015 but four of the five biggest one day plunges in its history have come in the last three years macy s announcement came as a

the stock market fell sharply in october and then took a dramatic drop over the first three weeks of december shortly afterward the federal government went into a partial shutdown that is still ongoing while large numbers retailers took steep losses thursday perkins said the market turmoil is a much bigger problem for companies like macy s because most stocks are owned by relatively wealthy

vehicle type pickup history description arriving in 2014 the 2015 gmc canyon and chevrolet colorado were corporate twin pickups that hit the road with new engines new tech and more compact and manoeuvrable sizing ideal for the shopper after plenty of pickup goodness with more compact sizing and a lower fuel bill these trucks offered up plenty of selection through a number of engines drivelines and body styles to suit any need taste or budget related stories look for onstar full multimedia compatibility the mylink system for smartphone remote control and monitoring of certain vehicle functions a large colour touch screen interface advanced safety features a standard back up camera automatic lights remote start and lots more a standard 2 5 litre four cylinder engine was offered and the up level 3 6 litre v6 was available the four cylinder generated about 190 horses while the v6 cranked out about 300 both engines used various fuel saving technologies to keep fuel use reasonable and both automatic transmissions six or eight speeds depending on the year and a six speed manual limited availability were on offer gm added a diesel engine to the powertrain lineup as well though late availability and limited reliability information at writing mean we ll focus on the much more popular gas engines here look for towing capacity at a maximum of about 7 000 lbs what owners like owners tend to report satisfaction from a comfortable ride traction to spare on 4x4 units and more high tech feature content than was previously available in this segment what owners dislike complaints included a sometimes rough ride from certain models a hard to see 4x4 selector dial and higher than appreciated levels of wind noise at speed further note that a strange bump beneath the rear seat floor may impede the carrying of certain types of cargo test drive to do list gmc canyons look relatively solid with most commonly reported problems being easy to detect on a test drive or via a pre purchase inspection justin pritchard when buying any used pickup truck consider two things to be mandatory before you fork over your hard earned cash first a full in the air inspection on a mechanic s hoist is highly advised as this affordable check can reveal a multitude of potential problems that may otherwise be difficult to detect simply a trained technician with a hoist and proper equipment can see and detect more possible problems than the average test driver kneeling down for a quick look beneath via flashlight a check like this often called a pre purchase inspection is the single best thing you can do to protect yourself from buying another s used truck problems next if the service history of the truck you re leaning toward isn t clear budget to have a full fluid change and tune up performed at the time of purchase or as soon thereafter as possible for added peace of mind and increased long term reliability just note if the truck you re considering doesn t have all service records available you may have difficulty obtaining any warranty repairs should they be required if the vehicle is still under warranty if feasible a 2017 or later version of the colorado or canyon may be best as this year saw revisions to the driveline to help improve performance and fuel mileage quadruple check the heater in the truck you re test driving and be sure it s able to quickly deliver useful powerful heat on demand at a range of temperatures if the heat seems to be weak or inconsistent further investigation is required sometimes the problem is a bad thermostat which is easy to address other times the problem lies deep within the guts of the climate control system s internal parts and out of warranty repairs will be pricey if the heater on the truck you re after shows any signs of funny business be sure to have a technician figure out why next confirm all advanced electronics including the parking radar backup camera onstar system navigation system all steering wheel mounted controls and all displays are in proper working order now is the time to see if any of these possibly pricey to repair systems or the components that power them need any attention note that a service 4x4 message in the instrument cluster may appear concerning though the problem causing the message is easily remedied in many cases the solution is to simply reprogram the computer that controls and monitors the 4x4 system s engagement and in some cases a replacement switch installed to the exterior of the transfer case any dealer should be able to address this problem quickly if you ll go with a unit that has the eight speed automatic introduced for model year 2017 be on the lookout for signs of hard shifting or a notable delay when switching between drive and reverse this problem may be more apparent while the vehicle is dead cold so insist on making your test drive only at a time when the vehicle has been parked for several hours a shudder or deep vibration through the vehicle at certain speeds may also be detectable along with otherwise clumsy or unrefined operation from the transmission some owners have had these issues fixed with updated transmission software while others have needed components or the entire transmission replaced almost exclusively under warranty gm dealers have access to technical service bulletin 16 na 364 which may help technicians diagnose and remedy this problem if detected finally avoid buying a used canyon or colorado that s been modified by past owners especially if you want full warranty coverage non factory electronics suspension parts engine parts or body parts may be fine though some modifications may void parts of the vehicle s warranty said warranty does not cover damage or wear caused by the use of non factory parts electronics or fluids either translation for maximum confidence be sure the unit you re considering is factory stock the verdict these trucks look relatively solid so far with most commonly reported problems being easy to detect on a test drive or via a ppi inspection

toronto jan 11 2019 cnw cobalt 27 capital corp cobalt 27 or the company tsxv kblt otcqx cbllf fra 27o a battery metals streaming and royalty company offering direct exposure to cobalt nickel and lithium integral elements in key technologies of electric vehicles and energy storage systems provides the following update to shareholders from its chairman and ceo mr anthony milewski as 2018 is now behind us i would like to take this time to review and reflect on cobalt 27 s achievements during our first full year of operations and provide some brief comments on the key physical markets that drive our business while we are unable to control equity market volatility and broader market sentiment we remain steadfast in our commitment to building a cash flowing dedicated electric vehicle and battery storage proxy a little over a year and a half ago cobalt 27 came to the market with an idea we wanted to build a battery metals streaming company seismic changes are underway in the energy and automotive industries electrification in the form of electric vehicles and battery storage systems are transforming our world the changes we witnessed from the day we went public have not slowed and if anything they are showing signs of acceleration to the point where the market is starting to tip past the point of return globally tens of billions of dollars is being spent by investors countries and some of the world s most important companies we don t know which automobile or energy company s will succeed in dominating the market but we stand at the cusp of global electrification adoption and it is our view that battery metals including nickel cobalt and lithium will act as proxies for the adoption of these new technologies the past year has been a time of tremendous growth and transition for cobalt 27 as we achieved our ipo objective of becoming a leading battery metals streaming and royalty company giving investors exposure to both cobalt and nickel as well as recently adding our first lithium royalty the pace of change since the ipo has been breathtaking and i wanted to take a moment to walk shareholders through our achievements in 2018 and thank you for your continued support first and foremost we delivered on our ipo promise to create a battery metals streaming and royalty company in june 2018 cobalt 27 acquired a us 300 million cobalt stream on vale s world class voisey s bay mine in canada cobalt 27 s acquisition of the world s first cobalt stream will result in cobalt 27 receiving 32 6 of voisey s bay s cobalt production starting on january 1st 2021 expected to result in deliveries of approximately 1 9 million pounds of high grade cobalt metal per year to cobalt 27 to be settled in physical delivery for the life of the mine cobalt 27 also announced that the company is working on a friendly deal to acquire highlands pacific and its low cost long life ramu nickel cobalt mine located in papua new guinea png the ramu nickel cobalt mine is majority owned and operated by metallurgical corporation of china ltd mcc which has a market capitalization of approximately us 9 billion the ramu mine was financed constructed and commissioned by mcc in 2012 at a cost of us 2 1 billion which at the time was china s largest overseas mining investment the ramu nickel cobalt mine is one of few vertically integrated operations that produce nickel cobalt hydroxide product which is prized as a raw material for the manufacture of lithium ion batteries as we look to 2019 we believe multiple value drivers exist for shareholders as investors recognize the strategic value of the asset portfolio that we have built all of cobalt 27 s core streams and royalties are on tier one assets with exceptional exploration and production upside and located outside of africa in addition our physical cobalt position of over 2 900 mt is comprised of ethically sourced metal stored in warehouses in north america and europe at some point there will be value in owning cobalt unimpaired by perceived and or real issues associated with cobalt of drc origin royalties in 2018 we acquired four royalties including several over some of the largest development projects in the world our 2018 portfolio acquisitions include a nickel cobalt royalty over the canadian based dumont project a nickel cobalt royalty over the canadian based turnagain project a nickel cobalt scandium royalty over the australian based flemington project and a scandium royalty over the australian based nyngan project equity debt financings in 2018 we were fortuned to have both the equity and debt capital markets open to cobalt 27 we closed two large equity financings in the form of a c 200 million private placement and a c 300 million public offering we also accessed the debt capital markets with an initial us 85 million revolver that was then later upsized to us 200 million c 200 million private placement led by credit suisse and td private placement led by credit suisse and td c 300 million public offering led by bmo credit suisse scotia and td public offering led by bmo credit suisse scotia and td us 85 million revolver led by nbf revolver led by nbf us 200 million revolver led by nbf as well as bmo and scotia management team enhancements at the time of the ipo cobalt 27 was run by justin cochrane and myself over the past year we have been fortunate enough to bring on a world renowned nickel cobalt expert martin vydra as head of strategy we have also hired conor kearns as our vice president of finance and betty joy leblanc as our head of corporate communications analyst coverage in particular we would like to thank the many banks that provide a variety of advisory corporate and other services we are grateful for the support of the top banks and boutiques in canada and europe cobalt 27 is covered by 10 analysts andrew mikitchook at bmo at bmo eric zaunscherb at canaccord macmurray whale at cormark david talbot at eight capital

addition to cobalt 27 s acquisitions and financings we listed the company on the otxqx and initiated a share buyback program which allows us to buy up to 9 9 of the company s outstanding shares in the open market finally a comment on the two primary drivers of our nav nickel and cobalt over the course of 2018 cobalt saw a price of over us 44 lb which has not been seen since 2008 and a nickel price that showed solid strength peaking at us 7 14 lb although cobalt prices retreated later in 2018 they remain above the long term average and in our view of supply and demand fundamentals for cobalt and our business remain strong the cobalt market remained energized in 2018 with strong demand for metal from the aerospace and alloy sectors coupled with continued demand growth from chemicals primarily driven by batteries and electrical storage systems however in 2018 we also witnessed the development of a bifurcated market as cobalt metal supply remained relatively flat in a growing market for these products while cobalt intermediate supply typically utilized for chemicals and batteries saw an increase in output from the democratic republic of congo drc driven by artisanal production and the anticipated ramp of up of glencore s katanga mine the congolese artisanal production is the swing supply that has resulted in a greater price differentiation between metal and intermediate products as cobalt metal prices remain at historically higher levels and cobalt intermediates which are priced against metal are seeing increased price pressure with surplus material available in the short term additionally at certain points in 2018 we saw selling pressure on cobalt with the re tightening of credit among chinese consumers impacting inventory management strategies the significant majority of cobalt 27 s value is derived from cobalt metal prices and therefore we are somewhat insulated from the price differentiation between metal and intermediates though not immune in addition our research indicates that as auto manufacturers ramp up deliveries and production of evs the demand response for batteries will close the current gap that exists between the availability of intermediates and the demand for them which is currently still playing catch up however what the supply response from the drc has highlighted is the precarious nature of the cobalt supply chain with roughly 70 of cobalt now coming from the drc and numerous reports calling into question both the environmental impact of the non mechanized mining and whether the material has been ethically sourced our view is that in the near future a kimberly style process for certifying cobalt origins will be necessary if battery makers are to be able to stand behind assertions that their cobalt has been ethically sourced this is evidenced by the indications from both the cobalt institute and london metals exchange lme that ethical and responsible sourcing is no longer something that will be left to unofficial self certification and more transparent and standardized certification systems are being contemplated in 2018 we also saw a glimpse of the issues associated with such a concentrated cobalt supply chain when a major mining company with operations in the drc announced it had to halt sales of cobalt due to uranium in the product while it would appear the issue will be resolved in the second half of 2019 we are reminded that should any unexpected events take place in the drc it could have a material impact on the market meanwhile fears persist around what election results and a transition of power may mean for the drc in 2019 like the cobalt market the nickel market too has seen big price swings in 2018 demand growth in both its primary market stainless steel and secondary uses remained strong while inventory levels on the lme and shfe continue to drop being down 46 y y in october nickel has appreciated from historical lows when it averaged less than 4 lb and reached a peak of us 7 14 lb in june 2018 only to fall again to its current price of approximately us 5 00 lb nickel remains a critical component in the manufacture of stainless and alloy steels as its importance in the battery sector shows signs of rapid growth while we see the ability of the nickel market to respond to improved demand from the stainless steel and alloy sectors in the form of npi production projections of supply response from class i supply required for applications such as batteries remain optimistic in our view unlike the stainless steel or alloy sector batteries require pure nickel currently in the form of nickel sulphate which is only available from a handful of global refineries the ability of nickel producers to bring this quality of production on stream at costs and schedules initially indicated has historically not been achieved our own research indicates that new announced projects targeting significant increases in supply of class i or chemical grade nickel by 2021 remain extremely optimistic despite challenging market conditions during the last half of the year for all commodities including battery metals we remain excited and confident in the changes underway and our ability to capitalize on these opportunities we are astonished by the breathtaking speed in the uptake of electric vehicles with recent reports indicating nearly 10 of new car

fed s powell briefly unsettles markets again federal reserve board chairman jerome powell warned that an extended government shutdown will show up clearly in economic data already jittery us stock markets temporarily shot lower on thursday following another remark from federal reserve chairman jerome powell the central bank chief has been unusually outspoken in recent weeks with comments that seemed to be geared at calming nervous investors but an offhand comment at an event thursday had the opposite effect on wall street after five days of gains the benchmark dow jones industrial average briefly dropped more than 250 points from the day s high after powell said the fed s large securities holdings should be substantially smaller than the current level of just under 4 trillion despite his largely upbeat view on the us economy and clear signals the fed will be patient about raising interest rates any higher statements that helped equities to recovery markets focused on those two words at the close wall street finished up for the day but it does not take much for investors to run for the exits with markets already on edge amid concerns the global economy is slowing just as interest rates are rising and uncertainty about the us china trade war investors worry about that selling off the fed s securities will tend to raise borrowing costs even if the fed s benchmark lending rate is unchanged however in prepared remarks released later thursday in new york fed vice chairman richard clarida reiterated the central bank s reassurance that if needed it could stop or slow the drawdown of its securities holdings the central bank will not hesitate to make changes to its balance sheet policy should the economic picture shift clarida said powell had roiled markets in early october when he indicated several more rate increases were likely and since then he and other senior officials have come out multiple times with more soothing comments the fed chief on thursday again stressed that policymakers could take time to evaluate the economy before deciding on any additional rate moves asked about the expectations for the fed s policy meeting later this month powell said you should anticipate we are going to be patient and watching and waiting and seeing starting after the january 30 announcement powell will hold a press conference after every meeting rather than just four times a year giving him many more opportunities to try to communicate with financial markets he remains upbeat about the us economy saying inflation is likely to hold near the fed s two percent target and does not see a risk of a us recession anytime soon however he acknowledged the concerns reflected in global stock markets and said the fed had the ability to be patient and figure out which of these two narratives is going to be the story of 2019 long shutdown hit he also warned the us economy could take a clear hit from the government shutdown if it continued for a long time us federal reserve chairman jerome powell unsettled stock markets with his comments once again while most previous shutdowns have been fairly short and have not affected the economy in the aggregate powell said if we have an extended shutdown i think that would show up in the data pretty clearly the us government has been partially shuttered since late december as president donald trump has refused to sign a budget agreement unless congress agrees to allocate more than 5 billion for a border wall about 800 000 federal workers including air traffic controllers and members of the coast guard have been without pay for three weeks in the short term if government shutdowns don t last very long they ve typically not left much of a mark on the economy powell said s p global ratings estimated that the shutdown will trim 0 05 percent off of us gdp each week advertisement powell also worried about the lack of key economic statistics during the government shutdown that the fed uses to take the temperature of the economy such as retail sales and gdp growth

an employee of chinese tech giant jd com shows an augmented reality system that allows customers to virtually try on clothing at shops part of the high tech retail marketplace at the 2019 consumer electronic show in las vegas with robots augmented reality displays and other advanced technologies traditional retailers are taking a cue from the online world to find new ways to connect and keep customers the 2019 consumer electronics show in las vegas featured dozens of exhibitors showcasing how brick and mortar sellers can ramp up competition against the likes of amazon and other online merchants and cope with what some call a retail apocalypse chinese retail giants jd com and suning each had a large presence at the show in search of partners for their retail as a service strategy to allow merchants to plug into new tech platforms we believe the future of retail is not about online or offline it s boundary less said jd communications manager yuchuan wang jd showed how retailers can use augmented reality screens that allow shoppers to use gesture control to virtually try on and buy clothing and beauty products with these systems a retailer might not need to stock all apparel products in all sizes enabling the consumer to simply click on an item in the store and have it delivered rapidly one of china s largest retailers jd also showcased the use of delivery robots and drones which are being used in china capable of reaching most chinese consumers within a day or two skip the cashier chinese retail giant suning s exhibit at the consumer electronics show shows a smart weighing counter that can enable consumers to pick up items and get them scanned automatically to skip the checkout line suning which claims to be china s largest omni channel retailer also showed augmented reality retail try ons as well as its cashier free store similar to the amazon go model i can pick up an apple and it tells me how much the price is said suning strategy director watson wat who was showing ces attendees how its technology can be applied and with my products i just walk out and it uses facial recognition to identify and charge me suning announced it was seeking partnerships with retailers for its brain of smart retail that could enable stores to use its technology i believe the technology is mature now it s affordable wat said smart mirrors chinese online retail and logistics company jd displays delivery robots and drones that are part of smart retail technology being offered to partners elsewhere procter gamble s booth at ces showed how customers can use of augmented reality and facial recognition built into mirrors to get personalized recommendations for skin care and beauty products we capture a unique identification for each person and deliver personalized results to them on the basis of artificial intelligence said p g s tina mccarthy softbank robotics demonstrated how retailers can use two different kinds of robots one to interact with customers and another to monitor inventory and store shelves to help improve bottom lines softbank is partnering with tally made by simbe robotics which scans store shelves to keep better track of what is available there is a massive problem in the retail space between what the system says is on the shelf and what really is there said steve carlin of softbank robotics a more accurate system can help deal with merchandise which is overstocked or understocked he added we can start to push the right type of advertisements or incentives to shop the things that are over inventoried he said getting to know you pepper of softbank robotics l and tally of simbe robotics r are teaming up to work with retailers pepper interacts with customers while tally scans shelves to monitor inventory in this demo from softbank at the consumer electronics show softbank s humanoid robot pepper is teaming up on the effort by interacting with customers including using facial recognition to greet customers by name and guide them to products for retailers they know a lot about you online but don t really know you at all in the store carlin said offering suggestions in the same manner as online retailers can make sense retailers are always trying to get one more item in the basket carlin said they can t get more foot traffic but they are hoping to get more items in the basket maeve duska of the consultancy usa technologies said many retailers are stepping up efforts to keep up with the amazon go concept where customers can walk out and pay automatically without waiting for checkout a concept known as unattended retail finally the brick and mortar retailer understands how much competition there is from online said duska who spoke at a ces panel on high tech retailing they are trying to duplicate the online experience with facial recognition to identify the customer and fingerprint and retina scans which can be used for payment retailers are discovering ways to speed up the retail experience often without interacting with a human we re very much a self service society she said for many younger shoppers they do not want to talk to people in the store tempered expectations analyst brendan witcher of forrester research another ces panel participant said some technologies like virtual and augmented reality can offer value for some goods that can help customers visualize clothing or other items but he cautioned against too much optimism about the use of data analytics and artificial intelligence to market in the manner of amazon most retailers still can t get a personalized email out the door he said if that s the case it s not time to put a robot in the store

washington ap federal reserve officials were worried about an adverse market reaction when they made their first tentative moves in 2013 to pull back on the massive support they had been providing to help the economy recover from the great recession transcripts of their discussions released friday show that then federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and his colleagues devoted considerable time debating the wording of the statement the fed ended up approving a proposal to trim its 85 billion per month in bond purchases by a small 10 billion both of bernanke s successors janet yellen and jerome powell backed his proposal with yellen saying existential angst over the decision was unavoidable the markets had reacted badly six months earlier in june when bernanke had first raised the idea of cutting bond purchases provoking what came to be called the taper trantrum bond yields spiked and the turbulence in the u s bond market sent shock waves around the globe that caused problems for a number of emerging market countries as investors took bernanke s comments as a sign the fed was going to immediately start pulling back on the purchases the 85 billion monthly purchases of treasury and mortgage bonds was the final phase of a process dubbed quantitative easing in which the fed sought to apply downward pressure on long term interest rates in an effort to boost the recovery from the 2007 2009 downturn the deepest recession since the great depression of the 1930s bernanke and other fed officials discussed how to avoid the turbulence caused by bernanke s june comments but there were worries that the markets might still react badly in part because the small 10 billion trimming of monthly bond purchases would be the first time the fed had removed support since the 2008 financial crisis had sent the economy into a tailspin the bond purchases had pushed the fed s holdings up four fold from just below 1 trillion to more than 4 trillion bernanke said he wanted to ask for everyone s help to push back on perceptions that the move to trim the bond purchases meant the fed was thinking about starting to raise short term interest rates the fed had slashed its benchmark rate to a record low near zero in december 2008 at the height of the financial crisis when that proved insufficient to battle a recession that saw millions of job losses it turned to buying bonds to push down long term borrowing costs one thing i am going to try to emphasize is that we have not abandoned accommodative policy and that we want to maintain a high level of accommodation bernanke said accommodation is the fed s term for low interest rates the fed began trimming its 85 billion per month in bond purchases with an initial reduction of 10 billion approved at the december 2013 meeting the fed followed that reduction with successive reductions before wrapping up the additional bond purchases at the end of october 2014 it then kept its bond holdings steady at around 4 5 trillion until late 2017 when it started trimming the holdings by not re investing all of the bonds as they mature the fed has not said what level it wants to reduce its bond holdings analysts believe the level will be around 3 trillion to 3 5 trillion however current fed chairman powell has raised concerns in recent comments that investors have interpreted as suggesting a potentially bigger reduction in the december 2013 transcript powell supported the move to begin trimming the bond purchases saying with strong jobs growth and unemployment falling the economy had dealt them a pretty good hand of cards the december meeting was the next to last meeting for bernanke with yellen set to succeed him as fed leader in february 2014 the transcripts of the fed s 2013 meetings released with the usual five year delay showed that fed officials expressed concerns about market reactions at other points in the year at the june meeting richard fisher president at the time of the fed s dallas regional bank said market traders were like feral hogs and if they scent weakness or lack of definition they will continue to test us and playing the fed for a patsy is the stuff of a money manager s dream

bill on back pay for federal workers as shutdown continues it s payday for federal workers in the united states but it s not as the u s government shutdown nears record territory after tomorrow this shutdown will be the longest in u s history president donald trump and his republican backers and their democratic party opponents appear to be no closer to ending the impasse mr trump continues to lobby for billions for his proposed border wall with mexico and continues to paint a dire and dangerous picture around illegal border crossings something his opponents have stressed is fabricated and exaggerated mr trump appears to be edging closer to declaring a national emergency in order to fund the wall and received backing to do so from a powerful republican senator lindsey graham of south carolina one small shred of a silver lining for the 800 000 federal employees not being paid today the house voted 411 7 on a bill requiring that all government workers receive retroactive pay after

staff writer telegram gazette washington the partial shutdown of the u s government has begun to make it harder to assess the health of the economy by delaying or distorting key reports on growth spending and hiring government data on home construction and retail sales for example won t be released next week because staffers who compile those reports have been furloughed the retail sales report provides a snapshot of consumer spending which fuels more than two thirds of the economy with macy s and kohl s having said thursday that their holiday sales were weaker than expected a broader gauge of retail spending would have provided important clarity in addition the next report on the economy s overall growth set for jan 30 won t be released if the shutdown remains in effect even if the government has fully reopened by then federal workers won t likely have had enough time to produce the scheduled report on the nation s gross domestic product not all agencies are closed congress approved funding last year for the labor department so the government s next monthly jobs report will be released as scheduled on feb 1 but it s unclear how long the department will be able to issue jobs reports the most closely watched barometer of the economy after that though the economy remains healthy in most respects there are rising concerns that growth could slow or even stall in coming months the trade war between the united states and china which has helped depress global growth is likely slowing business investment the stimulus from the trump administration s tax cuts is expected to fade and borrowing costs have risen since the federal reserve raised short term interest rates four times last year before rebounding this week stock markets had plummeted roughly 16 percent from their peak oct 2 many economists increasingly see the shutdown should it persist as a drag on the economy michael feroli of j p morgan has downgraded his forecast for growth in the first three months of 2019 because of the shutdown he now expects the economy to grow at a 2 percent annual rate down from his previous estimate of 2 25 percent the shutdown is costing the economy about 1 2 billion a week according to standard poor s some of that loss will be regained after federal workers eventually receive back pay for the time they missed but many government contractors won t be made whole and lost business such as scheduled hotel stays from trips to national parks that won t be taken may not be made up fed officials are now stressing their flexibility on rate hikes emphasizing that they will be patient and their policy data dependent by this the fed means that the government s latest readings on hiring inflation and growth will factor heavily in its rate decisions yet much of that data will now be unavailable to the fed or anyone else for us one of the biggest effects of the shutdown has been around data raphael bostic president of the fed s atlanta regional bank said wednesday we re worrying about that even some reports that are released on schedule are likely to be distorted by the shutdown for example the january jobs report may show an artificially high unemployment rate and low employment figure that s because up to 380 000 federal employees who aren t working or being paid during the shutdown but who will return to work afterward could be counted as unemployed for january if so that would raise the unemployment rate by 0 2 percentage point estimated ben herzon an economist at macroeconomic advisers a forecasting firm and the monthly job count could decline by 380 000 if the shutdown continues through the end of january herzon said that could push the monthly job figure into negative territory if all the federal workers eventually receive back pay as occurred after previous shutdowns then the january jobs report would later be revised to restore those 380 000 jobs according to the labor department s bureau of labor statistics future jobs reports could be jeopardized too if the government remains shut down the census bureau conducts the monthly surveys that the bls uses to calculate the unemployment rate census is part of the commerce department which remains closed during the shutdown the bls wouldn t say whether data collection will continue beyond january if the shutdown continues other economic reports have already been missed they include a monthly report on factory orders that was scheduled for monday that report typically provides insights into how much u s companies are spending on large equipment inflation data will also be affected the consumer price index was released friday morning as scheduled because it was prepared by the labor department but the fed s preferred inflation gauge is published by commerce s bureau of economic analysis which is closed and because the agriculture department is closed future reports on wholesale prices and import prices won t include farm related data the bls said thursday a report on the number of people seeking unemployment benefits considered a nearly real time reflection of layoffs is still being published but it could be distorted by the shutdown nearly 5 000 federal employees sought benefits two weeks ago according to the latest data available roughly five times the usual figure and only a portion of the government s report on productivity or output per hour worked will be released feb 6 the labor department said that s because that report requires data on the growth of gdp the broadest measure of the economy even after the government fully reopens weeks will likely be needed before all the postponed reports can be prepared and released it may take some time to get a clean read on the economy economists at bank of america merrill lynch said thursday

american history the primary concern will be how to pay bills rent and support their families but while many are struggling to make ends meet donald trump may be casting a worried glance towards wall street gloating about the economy has been one of mr trump s primary means of showing america his presidency is working ignoring the fact that many of the metrics used such as job growth were also on an upward trend under barack obama mr trump spent much of last year talking about record stock market numbers and the buoyant jobs figures wall street has had a volatile few weeks amid fears over mr trump s trade dispute with beijing and a slowing chinese economy the shutdown is another shock to the system alongside the border wall new jobs and a healthy economy were two of his biggest campaign promises the shutdown is starting to bite with some talking of the financial pain of the closure we think a deal will be reached to reopen the government but only after economic financial and or political pain is felt joseph song an economist at bank of america merrill lynch said in a note to clients every two weeks of a shutdown trims 0 1 from growth he added jp morgan has already lowered first quarter gdp estimate to 2 per cent from 2 25 per cent the primary reason for the downward revision it said is the economic impact of the ongoing shutdown of the federal government airlines are

tens of millions of dollars meant to help sonoma county and santa rosa recover from the october 2017 wildfires and prepare for future disasters is in limbo as the federal government shutdown continues with no end in sight of particular concern to santa rosa is the roughly 38 5 million the city expects to receive in federal grants to build apartments after fires wiped out 5 percent of its housing stock meanwhile sonoma county has submitted at least 20 different requests for roughly 24 million to fund fire hardening work seismic retrofitting and other disaster mitigation projects that s all been delayed as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown 20 days old thursday and still going strong with president donald trump threatening to yank wildfire relief funds from california and abruptly walking out of negotiations with house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer the shutdown brings plenty of uncertainty for local officials hoping to receive long awaited disaster funding the longer it goes obviously the more difficult it becomes for everyone said david rabbitt who chairs the sonoma county board of supervisors there s people that start to get a little anxious and rightfully so the shutdown means uncertain prospects for numerous wildfire related funding requests into which the city and county have invested months of work santa rosa expects 38 5 million in federal disaster relief money to build apartments as part of a 124 million grant from the u s department of housing and urban development to disaster afflicted parts of california but the shutdown has delayed hud s review of that offering said city spokeswoman adriane mertens it was unclear how much longer the city will have to wait for the money as a result of the shutdown mertens noted the california department of housing and community development had indicated hud would approve the state s plan by feb 1 the city expected funds would be received sometime in the spring but obviously the timing is unknown at this point she said santa rosa anticipates delayed reimbursement for at least three programs through which hud reimburses cities like santa rosa for expenses including the housing opportunities for persons with aids program mertens said however the shutdown would only have an impact on these programs if it continues into april the federal emergency management agency has also delayed its review of numerous public assistance projects for which the city wants reimbursement mertens said it was unclear whether the holdup was related to the recent holidays or the shutdown and the city expected clarity on monday she said for sonoma county s disaster efforts the shutdown means a delay in implementation in some really important projects that we have in the works said deputy county administrator michael gossner who heads the county s office of recovery and resiliency partial county data reflected 20 requests to fema for hazard mitigation projects totaling upward of 25 million gossner said the county faced the potential for those requests to be delayed as well as delays to 2 million in fema public assistance requests and the allocation of several million dollars through the county s portion of hud s disaster recovery grant offering employers like santa rosa and sonoma county also are not able to use the federal e verify system meant to prevent undocumented immigrants from illegally working in the u s because of the lapse in funding for the department of homeland security mertens said the city could continue to hire workers but would not be able to run the e verify background check until funding is restored the shutdown could mean potential local impacts to funding for federal rental assistance and food benefits money for those programs is anticipated to last through february but it s uncertain whether funding will be available past then it was unclear wednesday whether trump could or would make good on his pledge to cut off fema funding to california a threat he has made previously without follow through rabbitt questioned whether trump could legally shut off wildfire relief funding via fema mertens said city officials haven t received any information on what the president s threat might mean a call and email sent wednesday to fema s press office seeking clarification or context for the president s remark resulted in automated messages explaining that the agency couldn t return reporters inquiries due to the shutdown a call to the white house switchboard also proved fruitless because of the lack of federal funds you can reach staff writer will schmitt at 707 521 5207 or will schmitt pressdemocrat com
the past three days us and china negotiators have met in beijing to try one last time before a true trade war erupts between them in march 2019 higher level trade negotiators will follow up in washington in coming weeks what follows is the first of a 2 part history and analysis of trump trade strategy which addresses events from the initiation of trump s trade offensives in march 2018 to december 2018 with predictions for 2019 in part 1 us trade policy under trump in 2018 is compared with similar us trade offensives under nixon in the 1970s targeting europe and reagan in the 1980s targeting japan the historical parallels situate us trade policy as an important often over looked element in the evolution of us neoliberalism trade war trade war when trump pre announced on march 2 his plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports the mainstream press immediately began hyping the line that trade war was looming on the horizon panicking investors ran like lemmings over the stock market cliff after the steel tariff announcement us allies huffed and puffed promising tit for tat tariff responses on us agricultural goods or commercial aircraft trump s traditional elite advisors like gary cohn former ceo of goldman sachs investment bank and head of trump s economic council resigned later that week no doubt in part due to frustration and disagreement over trump s unilaterally announced tariff at week s end on march 8 2018 trump proposed to implement steel and aluminum tariffs universally across the board affecting all importers to the us 25 tariffs on steel imports and 10 on aluminum the big 5 us steel importers are canada mexico south korea brazil and germany collectively responsible for 15 billion a year in steel imports canada russia and the united arab emirates are the major aluminum importers worth noting for 2017 steel imports china is well down the pack tenth or eleventh on the list contributing only 2 2 of us steel importing in the millions of dollars annually not billion and mostly semi finished steel goods used by us manufacturers for fabricating final goods produced in the us when announced on march 8 trump argued there would be no countries exempted from the 25 tariffs on steel and 10 on aluminum that quickly changed by mid march canada and mexico were temporarily exempted from the tariffs even though they were among the top four largest steel importers to the us with canada largest and mexico fourth largest thereafter brazil second largest steel importer germany and others steel importers were exempted and canada by far the largest aluminum importer to the us accounting for 43 of us aluminum imports was exempted as well south korea the third largest steel importer last year was exempted from steel tariffs permanently as it quickly renegotiated its 2012 free trade deal with the us moreover no other significant tariffs were imposed on south korea as part of the bilateral treaty revisions what the us got in the quickly renegotiated us south korea free trade deal was more access for us auto makers into korea s auto markets and quotas on korean truck imports into the us korean auto companies kia and hyundai had already made significant inroads to the us auto market us auto makers have become dependent on us truck sales to stay afloat they didn t want korean to challenge them in the truck market as well except for these auto agreements there were no major tariffs or other obstructions to south korea imports to the us not surprising the south koreans were ecstatic they got off so easily in the negotiations clearly the us south korea deal had nothing to do with steel or aluminum if anything it was a token adjustment of us korea auto trade and little more so if the korean deal was a big nothing trade renegotiation and if virtually all the us major steel and aluminum importers have been exempted worldwide what s trump s new trade policy aggression all about us steel and aluminum imports combined make up only 47 billion a fraction of total us imports of 2 36 trillion in 2017 was the steel aluminum tariffs announcement just another example of trump bombast launched via tweets from the second story of the white house at 3am to be followed by a quick retreat was the south korean agreement a template and a big softball for later negotiations with us trade allies mexico canada europe was it trump shooting off his mouth and then retreating following pressure from his advisors and us business interests was the tariff announcement a stalking horse for something bigger perhaps the tariffs were a cover for domestic political objectives aimed either at agitating and mobilizing trump s political base in red state america in preparation for midterm us elections in november 2018 or even a trump decision to fire special investigator counsel mueller in coming weeks playing the economic nationalist card and mobilizing his base by initiating new tariffs and talking of a trade war would serve both trump domestic political objectives for polls show trump s steel aluminum tariffs announcement played well in the midwest the great plains states and the south and especially in those steel and mining towns of michigan ohio west virginia pennsylvania minnesota i e those key swing states that gave him the narrow margin of victory in the 2016 elections even if he quickly shelved the tariffs the media hype sent the message trump wanted to his base he was doing something about the decades long loss of steel and mining jobs in those regions since the 1980s in short how much of the steel aluminum tariffs were for domestic political consumption and how much not that question applies as well to the subsequent trade actions by the trump administration by the end of march given all the exemptions it became clear the real target of trump s trade offensive was china and not the rest of us allies a closer look at trump administration statements since march 2018 reveals that trump s anti china trade offensive has had less to do with china general imports to the us and more about us next generation technology transfer by us corporations to china next gen technologies like artificial intelligence ai g5 wireless networks and similar cyber security and militarily strategic tech now in development as trump s new chair of his economic council larry kudlow put it in march there s no trade war all we re trying to do is protect us technology kudlow added a month later in early april sometimes you have to use tariffs to bring countries to their senses tariffs are the tactic not the strategic policy objective and if trade deficits are not the primiary issue and tariffs are only the tactic then what is the strategic objective it s technology transfer and domestic politics perhaps the us defense sector in particular the nsa and trump s military generals heavy administration are playing a greater role in the us china trade war in the background than is thus far noted by the media and not enough attention is being given to the role of domestic political events as well put another way at the level of appearance the us trade deficit and china imports to the us may be the target for purposes of public opinion but behind the appearance it s more likely that us domestic politics plus us long term military planning are the two more important drivers behind trump s emerging trade war all of trump s tariffs and subsequent trade measures are being invoked based on an obscure national security clause in us trade legislation and china is increasingly the target as tariffs and other measures are suspended and reduced for us trading partners with the exception of china as the us pursues a soft trade offensive against all its other trading partners this

the gofundme fundraiser that promised to help privately fund president donald trump s plan for a wall spanning the length of the u s mexico border surpassed 20 million dollars in donations this week but the man behind it brian kolfage a rising conservative media star may have had another goal through his border wall campaign he claims to have gathered 3 5 million email addresses which are essential to his broader operation a wide ranging and multipronged effort to collect a list of trump supporters who have proven to be sources of donations for conservative efforts former employees told nbc news according to former employees and public records including website archives nevada business registrations and property records kolfage has repeatedly created gofundme campaigns and published inflammatory fake news articles pushing them both from websites that he sought to hide behind shell companies and false identities in part to harvest email addresses those addresses were then used to push people back to kolfage s websites to sell a brand of coffee he owns or to be stockpiled for future use by conservative campaigns kolfage a triple amputee air force veteran had mostly worked behind the scenes of this operation until the viral gofundme campaign made national headlines retired u s air force sr airman brian kolfage speaks to reporters during a 2016 groundbreaking ceremony for a new home he and his family were receiving through the gary sinise foundation s rise program at sandestin florida on jan 14 2016 devon ravine northwest florida daily news via ap file six days after the campaign was launched it was edited to include a new call after donating sign our petition we need 100 million signatures the text repeats four times at the top of the page before any description about the fundraiser itself a spokesperson for gofundme told nbc news that all donors would be refunded because kolfage had changed the language midcampaign erasing an earlier pledge to refund every single penny if the goal of 1 billion was not met those donors will also be offered a way to refuse the refund and instead have it routed to a new charity set up by kolfage the spokesperson said kolfage also used gofundme to solicit donations by check to a p o box in colorado manned by former freedom daily writer amanda shea the amount raised via checks is unclear though kolfage noted in a tweet that payments by check had put them over the record gofundme says it has no hand in refunding those funds we process refunds for donations made online through gofundme that does not include any offline donations the spokesperson said the campaign however is only the most high profile part of kolfage s email harvesting operation which former employees told nbc news extends back to his creation of far right news websites an effort that resulted in a facebook ban fake news real emails kolfage s email harvesting previously relied on two ultra conservative websites freedomdaily and right wing news that frequently trafficked in false and politically divisive news according to two former employees and two owners of competitor websites lindsey lowery a staff writer at freedomdaily from january 2017 to january 2018 shared a text message with nbc news in which kolfage discussed his email harvesting plans kolfage told lowery that we can make our own through the website to steal collect emails in september 2017 lowery said kolfage would create a petition or campaign related to an article she wrote on freedomdaily and then embed the email bait in that article people would get worked up about the subject matter so they d want to go sign the petition to add their name to the cause lowery said brian is referring to stealing the emails in this text because the people didn t sign up to get spammed with his news it was simply to be part of the petition i believe that s how he got his email distribution built up former u s air force senior airman brian kolfage center sits in a wheelchair next to his wife ashley right who holds their daughter paris during the national september 11 memorial and museum s salute to service tribute honoring u s veterans in new york on nov 10 2014 bebeto matthews ap file as soon as we would hit publish on an article we d immediately have about 200 300 people on the article because of the spike in traffic that those emails being blasted out would provide lowery said despite kolfage s repeated denials of owning the now defunct freedom daily former employees and competitors most of whom asked for anonymity out of fear of retribution provided company emails employment documents and company checks that show kolfage s home address as freedom daily s corporate business address kolfage told nbc news that he simply managed the finances and administration for freedom daily he said the operation s true owner lives in another country and is unwilling to talk about the website the one site kolfage does claim to be associated with right wing news features a chief operating officer on its website named steven smith whose headshot is a reverse image of a stock photo kolfage declined to provide biographical details or contact information for smith who former employees allege does not exist kolfage is listed as the site s social media strategist kolfage told nbc news that smith is real but operates the website anonymously for fear of threats to his family from the left freedomdaily was part of a network of websites operating under the umbrella of liberty alliance a christian online media empire that hosts and serves advertising on the websites of the far right s loudest and most partisan voices freedomdaily and other right wing content makers under liberty alliance would swap hyperpartisan content to attract readers and frequently trafficked in far right propaganda and false articles freedomdaily shut down in february 2018 the same month the site was sued for publishing an article that had falsely identified the driver of the car that killed a protestor during a unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia in august 2017 while several of the other defendants have paid settlements to the incorrectly identified person lawyers for the plaintiff told nbc news they were still trying to find the freedomdaily s owner to enforce a default entry against the site freedomdaily s owner failed to respond to the lawsuit kolfage and his editor in chief the conservative blogger jeff rainforth moved on to a new site right wing news kolfage bought already popular and verified facebook pages from the conservative commentator john hawkins who operated a right wing news site with a different web address according to former kolfage employees and hawkins public accounts just as his new business was growing kolfage claimed he spent 300 000 on ads to attract some 3 5 million followers facebook removed the pages associated with kolfage s websites in october as part of a crack down on inauthentic behavior cut off from the major source of his audience kolfage appeared to revert to a previous tactic tapping his growing list of email subscribers politics as usual after his facebook ban kolfage started a gofundme page imploring people to donate to help him stop social media censorship as the donations poured in he s raised 73 000 through the campaign and an undisclosed amount via a new landing page he set up to receive donations directly he urged supporters to sign his petition we need 1 million signatures to take to the white house his site stated as of friday the censorship campaign has collected over 31 000 emails a number dwarfed by 3 5 million signatures and emails he s collected with the campaign to build the wall joe trippi who is widely credited with pioneering campaign email lists on former new hampshire gov howard dean s presidential campaign in 2004 said that gofundthewall s tactics mirror email collecting projects he s seen from both parties he called 3 5 million signatures collected in less than a month a really big number even by current standards whether it was howard dean or rand paul or john mccain there s a pretty short period between 2003 and 2010 where this stuff tended to be pretty organic and idealistic trippi said they legitimately cared about the issues we looked it at as a real democracy building thing trippi said that the practice of building email lists has since been co opted by people looking to make money off politically active people pick your day in between there but somewhere it got commoditized he said what kolfage will do with the signatures isn t clear and he and his representatives declined to talk about them on the record but his options extend past the dissemination of fake news kolfage s ties to liberty alliance could prove useful in monetizing his email list during the rise of the tea party liberty alliance s owner brandon vallorani perfected the art of publishing conservative content alongside merchandise collecting one of politics most valuable email lists along the way vallorani and representatives for liberty alliance did not respond to requests for comment the selling of email lists in political circles has become standard practice as a residential candidate hillary clinton turned over her email list of about 10 million people to the democratic national committee in april 2017 the list was valued by the fec at 3 5 million trump s list of 20 million supporters is reportedly for sale problems have arisen when the lists are harvested by more free wheeling sources within liberty alliance three republicans who rented an email list from the far right news site big league politics another liberty alliance site came under fire last year reps devin nunes of california and steve scalise of louisiana and sen ted cruz of texas all paid for the ability to reach big league politics readers who had signed up for updates through the site but cruz and scalise both ceased using big league politics email list after one of the site s writers was tied to a secret message board driving harassment campaigns based on the fringe right wing conspiracy theory qanon big league politics founders former breitbart staffers dustin stockton and his wife jennifer lawrence are now working as gofundthewall s public relations contacts stockton and lawrence left big league politics in 2017 more fundraisers the wall isn t kolfage s first foray into online fundraising since 2013 he s used gofundme to finance professional projects and lawsuits and to buy land in june 2013 kolfage crowdfunded his wounded warrior mentor engagement program which he claimed to have launched in response to president barack obama s slashing the funds that used to pay for kolfage s trips to military hospitals my wife and i visit newly severely wounded veterans and their families at various military hospitals such as walter reed brooke army medical center and landstuhl regional medical center in germany kolfage wrote on gofundme please help keep this program alive by 2015 he had raised over 20 000 through the gofundme and an additional fundraiser a calendar sold on the hyperpartisan conservative news site 100percentfedup which netted an additional 4 000 according to a facebook post by kolfage and an interview with the site s owner 100 percent of those funds were used for these trips kolfage told nbc news in a text message but there is no record of kolfage visiting walter reed brooke army medical center landstuhl regional medical center or other veterans hospitals since 2013 according to representatives from each hospital contacted by nbc news buzzfeed news was first to report the details of kolfage s mentor progam no one on our staff that was here during that time period can recall working with mr kolfage robert whetstone deputy of communications at brooke army medical center wrote in an email to nbc news in 2014 kolfage launched a t shirt campaign to cover the legal fees associated with a lawsuit against people he said had defamed him on facebook calling him a plagiarist and a racist among other things in 2015 kolfage s wife started a fundraiser asking for 100 000 to buy land for a new home kolfage s most recent fight4freedom fundraising campaign newsletter came from his personal email address but spoke about him in the third person if you re ready to give back to a veteran who has given so much then this is your chance to directly impact him and his family as well as fighting for conservative values the email read to people who signed the petition and received the email the sender s name appeared as donald trump

think of laura kelly as the fix it governor as in she needs to fix what by most accounts is a state government in desperate need of repair jim mclean for the first year or two of her administration her biggest job will be restoring the capacity of state agencies crippled by budget cuts and the exodus of employees with the skills and institutional knowledge needed to keep the trains running on time or more to the point balance the state budget adequately fund schools and ensure that foster kids are placed in safe and stable homes analysis she may want to start with high profile initiatives to reduce the sales tax on food restore the budget cuts suffered by universities and reboot the multi billion dollar highway building program that former republican gov sam brownback abandoned because of self inflicted money problems reality demands a more cautious approach kelly must closely monitor spending while triaging needs and addressing the most urgent problems ensuring the safety of foster children in the custody of the department for children and families is likely at the top of that list expectations for a new road program run high but kelly needs to first give new secretary of the kansas department of transportation julie lorenz time to rebuild the agency so that it can do the basics plow snow and mend potholes without borrowing money from the bond market at the kansas department of commerce incoming secretary david toland must rebuild the rudderless agency s presence in the eco devo world it s one that s been systematically diminished by understaffed programs and the closing of most of the state s trade offices around the world some might argue that restoring a basic level of competency to kansas government sets a low bar for kelly but given the work that needs to be done it seems a fair measuring stick let s remember kelly was a reluctant candidate former democratic gov kathleen sebelius among others had to talk her into running perhaps that was because as a longtime member of the senate s budget writing committee she had a notion of how difficult the job would be still after some coercion and a lot of contemplation done during long walks along the wooded bluffs overlooking the kansas river and cedar crest the governor s residence kelly concluded she could handle the job then she got elected sitting through her first budget briefings she said it became apparent that the devastation was even worse than i thought regardless it s now kelly s job to fix things our first indication of how she plans to do that comes next week when she lays out her budget priorities in a speech to a joint session of the legislature we should all be paying attention jim mclean is the chief political reporter for the kansas news service he s covered politics and state government for more than 35 years you can reach him on twitter jmcleanks the kansas news service is a collaboration of kcur kansas public radio kmuw and high plains public radio covering health education and politics kansas news service stories and photos may be republished at no cost with proper attribution and a link to ksnewsservice org

purchased nvidia is a computer technology company founded in 1993 and is headquartered in santa clara california nvidia designs and sells graphics processing units gpus and software traditionally in the computer gaming market nvidia s business has since expanded to include gpus used in connection with inter alia cryptocurrencies nvidia s business in the cryptocurrency market infamous for its growth and volatility became especially integral to investors defendants represented to investors that nvidia could competently navigate the cryptocurrency market throughout the class period for example defendants assured investors that nvidia and its executives are masters at managing channel and understand the channel very well despite analysts increasing qualms regarding nvidia s inventory management in that market nvidia also consistently downplayed the company s growing reliance on cryptocurrency related sales representing to investors that the cryptocurrency market made up little of nvidia s revenue defendants also touted the strong demand for its computer gaming gpus assuring investors that nvidia s computer gaming customer base would compensate for any decline in revenue from cryptocurrency related sales nvidia s shares began to trade at record highs as analysts digested these repeated assurances to investors meanwhile nvidia s senior executives were concurrently selling their own shares in significant amounts including inter alia jen hsun huang huang nvidia s chief executive officer ceo huang sold 110 000 personally held nvidia shares during the class period profiting by over 18 million the complaint alleges that throughout the class period defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the nvidia s business operational and compliance policies specifically defendants made false and or misleading statements and or failed to disclose that i nvidia s growth in its gaming gpu revenue was driven as repeatedly denied by defendants in significant part by the spiked demand for those gpus among cryptocurrency miners ii nvidia did not have as defendants asserted visibility into its inventory channel iii nvidia was unable to adapt to the volatility of cryptocurrency markets iv as cryptocurrency prices dropped nvidia hid halting growth from cryptocurrency miners by continuing to push mid range gpus into the channel v this would foreseeably cause an oversupply of gaming card inventory levels on the market and ultimately lead to over three months of excess inventory in nvidia s channel and vi as a result nvidia s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times on november 15 2018 nvidia disclosed that its revenue would decline by over 7 for the fourth fiscal quarter sharply cutting its revenue guidance this was in marked contrast to the 17 growth defendants had previously led investors to expect nvidia blamed the poor financial results on lower demand from cryptocurrency related purchasers which resulted in an oversupplied inventory of midrange gpus this inventory of gpus had stored up in the channel before cryptocurrency related demand for nvidia s gpus rapidly declined on

from birch gold group in september 2018 we showed how faang companies were bracing for impact because of trade war tensions between the u s and china now it appears we have our first trade war casualty in the form of a major hit to projected q1 sales for apple cnbc has the scoop apple lowered revenue guidance to 84 billion down from the 89 billion to 93 billion it had previously projected the company lowered gross margin to about 38 percent from between 38 percent and 38 5 percent apple ceo tim cook blamed the shortfall on iphone sales and upgrades with most of the impact coming from greater china he shifted the blame to trade war tensions it s clear that the economy began to slow there for the second half and what i believe to be the case is the trade tensions between the united states and china put additional pressure on their economy apple stock has been seeing a massive downward trend from a high of over 225 per share and has struggled to recover since october 2014 see chart below tim cook tried to put a positive spin on the ordeal writing we are not taking our foot off of the gas in a letter to investors maybe they should slow down long enough to mitigate the lackluster performance in china whatever apple does the uncertainty in their future remains in spite of cook s optimism it may be a good idea for other businesses to heed apple s warning apple s revenue decline is the canary in the coal mine leading asian market authority stephen roach believes big corporations are underestimating the impact of the u s china trade war on their bottom lines in a cnbc article he continued saying there is more to come we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us apple is probably the canary in the coal mine there s likely to be more to come then he explained why thinking about what affects china has little bearing on in the u s economy would be ludicrous to think that what affects the chinese has no bearing whatsoever on an otherwise resilient u s economy i think is ludicrous this is a two way relationship the u s depends heavily on china it s our third largest and most rapidly growing export market over the last 10 years he also mentioned that he doesn t see any material evidence that the trade war between the u s and china would be ending yet mainly because of uncertainty over at forbes kenneth rapoza thinks the market fears a semi hard landing after this round of trade talks concludes the fed already raised rates in december but now the tension between china trade talks their credit bubble and future fed rate hikes present another challenge one that ties together with apple s profit shock according tomicrolens brian mccarthy the chinese credit bubble is like an electric fence keeping the fed from getting too tight the apple profit shock last week perhaps provided a little jolt the fed s monetary policy can t tighten too much or the risk of a full blown recession may increase apple s profit shock could be sign of things to come trade tensions shouldn t create retirement tensions apple may be feeling the effects from china s trade negotiations but that doesn t mean your retirement has to suffer along with them to help prevent your portfolio from becoming trade war collateral consider diversifying your assets to minimize exposure assets like physical gold and silver are historically known to perform well during turmoil similar to what could develop considering assets such as these can help protect you from the effects of a trade war while simultaneously relieving some retirement tensions

the upside the new odd couple dramedy starring kevin hart and bryan cranston begins with a police chase in an effort to cheer up his depressed friend phillip cranston convict turned caretaker dell hart races the white man s sleek black porsche through manhattan with the latter in the passenger seat his lead foot growing heavier as the siren pierces the night air when the cops finally catch up to dell they force him out of the car and push him face down onto the hood if you watched widows blackkklansman blindspotting or the hate u give last year or hell paid attention to the news sometime in the past few years you might find yourself bracing for the worst whether you define that as the prospect of yet another black man suffering state violence or a ham fisted lesson by a white filmmaking team on that subject in fact neither happens dell talks phillip who s paralyzed below the neck into faking a medical episode and off they go a pair of merry pranksters whose racial feel goodery has next to nothing to do with real world stakes if you ve seen the intouchables the remake actually makes for a fascinating document that opening scene is lifted from the upside s source material the 2011 french import the intouchables which is itself based on the real life friendship between quadriplegic aristocrat philippe pozzo di borgo and his former algerian attendant abdel sellou the highest grossing french language film of all time the intouchables sparked a mini firestorm when it opened stateside its comforting tale of a staid white upper cruster learning what s really important from a disadvantaged black service worker inviting comparisons to the help which also premiered that year movies like the intouchables the help and recent golden globe winner green book aggravate in part for their reduction of racial oppression to interpersonal biases if these two very different characters can get along why can t we all they seem to ask choosing to ignore the countless institutional and microaggressive ways racism exerts its hidden but felt power the enduring popularity of the race themed crowd pleaser makes one wonder what kinds of reassurances are being doled out by these insultingly rosy depictions of racism as limited to easily overcomeable personal prejudice advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement all that said the upside did not make me despair the way that green book did surprise if you ve seen the intouchables the remake actually makes for a fascinating document a project of cultural translation that attempts to make the least objectionable variation of an iffy premise within the parameters of studio filmmaking omar sy the french born actor of west african descent who played philippe s nurse in the intouchables became the first black winner of the best actor césar the french oscar for his performance in the intouchables but his barely sketched character a serial harasser of a white woman in philippe s employ has traveled and aged poorly in his first dramatic role a subdued dead eyed hart has nothing approaching sy s rascally charisma but director neil burger and screenwriter jon hartmere do make dell the film s protagonist edging him away from the stock character of the magical negro the selfless sexless black character who exists to improve white lives the recent parolee is endowed with an estranged son jahi di allo winston and former partner aja naomi king to win back and the character s not afraid to call out the self pity prone phillip on his various privileges featureless and familiar as it may be dell s redemptive arc helps the stereotypes in the french film graduate to hollywood archetypes advertisement advertisement cranston giving a performance that s uncharacteristically dialed somewhere below 11 acquits himself better though he is saddled with vague motivations and an entirely indistinct romance with nicole kidman s overqualified executive assistant who s clearly hanging around because she s smitten with phillip but too afraid to make a move if the upside improves the depiction of black domestic workers solely relative to the movie on which it s based it does a significantly better job of expanding depictions of disability if only because day to day existence with disability is so rarely depicted in cinema certainly the gajillionaire leads a charmed life compared with the millions of actual people living with disabilities paycheck to paycheck not everyone can afford that jumble of other people s hands that he resents his days have become but we feel it all the same when the guy behind the diner counter asks dell what phillip wants as if the rich man weren t already terrifyingly capable of realizing the smallest of his impulses other than a jarringly headline recalling line in which dell says he d rather kill phillip than change his catheter their bromance proceeds as steadily as a military march opera loving phillip learns to appreciate aretha while the brusque self centered dell finds his softer side compared with the streamlined intouchables the remake feels ungainly inexpertly suturing together the french source material with hollywood formula still the amalgamation lumbers along but its fairy tale might have soared more smoothly if it weren t made of so many recycled parts

time in recent years it dropped below the 50 point threshold dividing contraction and expansion it suggests that domestic entrepreneurs lack confidence in the market due to the burden caused by taxes and fees and difficulties in financing gong yuhang dean of the china enterprise finance research institute told the media to boost market confidence the priorities chinese policymakers unveiled at the economic conference included improving countercyclical adjustments cutting taxes and fees and supporting private enterprises since small micro and private enterprises play a key role in propelling economic growth and employment such companies will be offered more access to funds so that their debt default risks can be reduced the central bank said financial institutions will support privately owned small and micro companies through a range of financial tools including bonds bank lending and equity before the rrr announcement it already eased evaluation rules on january 2 to encourage inclusive financing for small and micro enterprises rural residents and low and middle income urban groups financial institutions can deposit less in the central bank as reserve money if they lend a certain share of their loans to small and micro firms each borrowing less than 10 million yuan 1 46 million the threshold was previously set at 5 million yuan 730 000 according to lian ping chief economist of the bank of communications bocom one of china s largest commercial banks more efforts are needed to make inclusive financing more effective the most prominent problem of inclusive financing in china is that the financial structure is not full fledged the direct financing system and banks targeting small and micro enterprises need to be improved lian told beijing review the central bank will continue to tighten its regulation on financial holding companies this year to defuse risks caused by shadow banking and internet financing in 2018 measures to regulate shadow bankingâ lending and other financial activities by unregulated institutions or under unregulated conditionsâ saw initial achievements in deleveraging and risk control but there was a downside as well small and private businesses funding resources became constrained since the shadow banking sector provides easier financing the authorities have now recognized the role of shadow banking and are trying to develop it under regulations the sector has facilitated the financing of private enterprises in recent years making it deserve more room to develop as long as appropriate regulation is in place xu xueming vice president of the postal savings bank of china said at a forum on december 23 2018 positive signals in 2018 the pbc cut rrr four times injecting a total of 2 3 trillion yuan 337 8 billion into the market the cuts this year a follow up move still focus on boosting the real economy while avoiding over escalation of monetary easing the rrr cuts were mostly launched later in the previous years boc s zong said but the early move this year signals determination to resolve prominent economic problems and boost the confidence of private enterprises laying a solid foundation for steady economic performances in 2019 he added besides supporting the private sector the move can also help ease the real estate market the fundamental policy of controlling speculation will remain consistent said yan yuejin research director of the e house china r d institute a property research agency bocom s lian said the rrr cuts this year may see a smaller margin and lower frequency than in 2018 and the possibility of cutting rmb benchmark interest rates for deposits and loans is slim as trade talks between china and the united states progress and the momentum of the dollar s strengthening weakens the depreciation pressure on the renminbi will ease a report by the guanghua school of management of peking university on january 3 said the central bank is expected to reduce rrr by around 2 percentage points altogether in 2019 and adopt various monetary policy tools to adjust liquidity with a focus on improving the monetary transmission mechanism to smooth funding channels lian said greater focus is needed to ensure capital flow into the real economy since large scale monetary easing may not exert considerable effect due to adequate liquidity in addition to the targeted rrr cuts measures such as improving the supply of low cost loans can be adopted to cut financing costs for domestic enterprises to inject more capital into the real economy the financial structure needs to be improved mainly in terms of direct financing especially boosting the stock market while stability of the domestic market needs to be maintained he added copyedited by sudeshna

politics fed officials feared adverse market reaction in 2013 file in this july 18 2013 file photo federal reserve chairman ben bernanke testifies before the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee hearing on the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress on capitol hill in washington federal reserve officials were worried about an adverse market reaction when they made their first tentative moves in 2013 to pull back on the massive support they had been providing to help the economy recover from the great recession transcripts of their discussions released friday jan 11 2019 show that then federal reserve chairman bernanke and his colleagues devoted considerable time debating the wording of the statement ap photo manuel balce ceneta file the associated press washington ap federal reserve officials were worried about an adverse market reaction when they made their first tentative moves in 2013 to pull back on the massive support they had been providing to help the economy recover from the great recession transcripts of their discussions released friday show that then federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and his colleagues devoted considerable time debating the wording of the statement the fed ended up approving a proposal to trim its 85 billion per month in bond purchases by a small 10 billion both of bernanke s successors janet yellen and jerome powell backed his proposal with yellen saying existential angst over the decision was unavoidable advertisement the markets had reacted badly six months earlier in june when bernanke had first raised the idea of cutting bond purchases provoking what came to be called the taper trantrum bond yields spiked and the turbulence in the u s bond market sent shock waves around the globe that caused problems for a number of emerging market countries as investors took bernanke s comments as a sign the fed was going to immediately start pulling back on the purchases the 85 billion monthly purchases of treasury and mortgage bonds was the final phase of a process dubbed quantitative easing in which the fed sought to apply downward pressure on long term interest rates in an effort to boost the recovery from the 2007 2009 downturn the deepest recession since the great depression of the 1930s bernanke and other fed officials discussed how to avoid the turbulence caused by bernanke s june comments but there were worries that the markets might still react badly in part because the small 10 billion trimming of monthly bond purchases would be the first time the fed had removed support since the 2008 financial crisis had sent the economy into a tailspin the bond purchases had pushed the fed s holdings up four fold from just below 1 trillion to more than 4 trillion advertisement bernanke said he wanted to ask for everyone s help to push back on perceptions that the move to trim the bond purchases meant the fed was thinking about starting to raise short term interest rates the fed had slashed its benchmark rate to a record low near zero in december 2008 at the height of the financial crisis when that proved insufficient to battle a recession that saw millions of job losses it turned to buying bonds to push down long term borrowing costs one thing i am going to try to emphasize is that we have not abandoned accommodative policy and that we want to maintain a high level of accommodation bernanke said accommodation is the fed s term for low interest rates the fed began trimming its 85 billion per month in bond purchases with an initial reduction of 10 billion approved at the december 2013 meeting the fed followed that reduction with successive reductions before wrapping up the additional bond purchases at the end of october 2014 it then kept its bond holdings steady at around 4 5 trillion until late 2017 when it started trimming the holdings by not re investing all of the bonds as they mature the fed has not said what level it wants to reduce its bond holdings analysts believe the level will be around 3 trillion to 3 5 trillion however current fed chairman powell has raised concerns in recent comments that investors have interpreted as suggesting a potentially bigger reduction advertisement in the december 2013 transcript powell supported the move to begin trimming the bond purchases saying with strong jobs growth and unemployment falling the economy had dealt them a pretty good hand of cards the december meeting was the next to last meeting for bernanke with yellen set to succeed him as fed leader in february 2014

the people s bank of china lowers the reserve requirement ratio for most banks by 1 percentage point on october 15 vcg on october 15 the reserve requirement ratio rrr for most banks in china went down by 1 percentage point the fourth such cut in 2018 the people s bank of china pbc the country s central bank announced the decision on october 7 saying the measure is mainly aimed at optimizing the structure of liquidity in commercial banks and the financial market so that the financial sector can better serve the real economy some of the liquidity unleashed by the reduction was used to pay back 450 billion yuan 65 22 billion of medium term lending facility mlf due on october 15 in addition the rrr cut also released another 750 billion yuan 108 7 billion of incremental capital according to pbc statistics the cut applied to the renminbi deposits of large commercial banks joint stock commercial banks city commercial banks non county rural commercial banks as well as foreign funded banks serving real economy better as more credit is granted financial institutions demand for medium and long term liquidity is also increasing moderately cutting the reserve requirement the amount of deposits that a bank must keep on hand at all times has stabilized funds within the banking system besides improving the liquidity structure in commercial banks and the financial market it will also allow financial institutions to access long term funds steadily and subsequently reduce corporations financing costs the 750 billion yuan incremental capital to be freed will enable financial institutions to better support small and micro sized enterprises private companies and innovation driven firms all this will enhance the innovative vigor and resilience of the economy and boost sound development of the real economy said a pbc statement on the rrr cut this time of rrr reduction conforms to the changes in the chinese economy lian ping chief economist of bank of communications one of china s largest commercial banks said in an interview with china national radio according to him china s prudent monetary policy remains neutral and the adjustments target specific circumstances in the banking system growth of debts has been slow for some time and compared with the increase of loans that of deposits has been slower the market demand for liquidity has been growing steadily considering the debt changes in the banking system and the fact that the rrr is still at a comparatively high level making appropriate adjustments is a targeted policy that can help commercial banks better support small and micro sized businesses private companies and innovation driven firms this was the second time that the central bank cut rrr to replace mlf operation this year this will expand the maturity structure of funds ultimately helping improve financing conditions of corporations said lu zhengwei chief economist of industrial bank in an interview with china national radio lu said previously both open market operations and mlf matured within one year but this rrr cut unleashed long term capitals which would make the maturity of assets and debts in commercial banks better matched this would encourage commercial banks to grant more loans and buy more medium and long term corporate bonds which would improve the financing conditions of private enterprises he added monetary policy unchanged according to the pbc statement the rrr cut is still a measure of targeted control with liquidity in the banking system as well as money supply staying stable and the orientation of monetary policy remaining unchanged some of the liquidity released by the rrr cut was used to pay back mlf which is a kind of replacement of two liquidity tools therefore while the liquidity structure is optimized the total amount of liquidity in the banking system remains unchanged the pbc will continue the prudent and neutral monetary policy refrain from using a deluge of stimulus and focus on targeted control in order to maintain sound and sufficient liquidity according to the statement the policy is also intended to promote reasonable growth of monetary credit and the total financing amount in addition it will create a suitable monetary and financial environment for quality development and supply side structural reform will the rrr reduction intensify the depreciation pressure on the renminbi the pbc said as the interest rate remains stable and the growth of broad money and total financing amount is suited to the nominal gdp growth the rrr reduction will not impose depreciation pressure on the renminbi instead it will facilitate economic restructuring boost high quality development and make economic conditions better support the renminbi exchange rate as a large developing economy china is very competitive in exports and its economic growth mainly relies on domestic demand with complete categories of manufacturing industries and a well developed industrial system the statement added there are sufficient conditions for the renminbi exchange rate to remain basically stable the pbc will continue to take necessary measures to stabilize market expectations and keep the foreign exchange market running smoothly it said however zhang ming a researcher with the chinese academy of social sciences and chief economist of ping an securities told economic information daily that given the backdrop of several interest rate hikes by the u s federal reserve the rrr cut will help narrow the interest rate spread between china and the united states bringing depreciation pressure to the renminbi against the u s dollar zhang added that the pbc statement shows the central bank is putting domestic targets before foreign related targets and is willing and able to keep the renminbi exchange rate at a certain level new counter cyclical factors have enabled the central bank to better influence the yuan s standard price zhang said adding with enhanced administration of cross border capital flows the pbc still has the ability to intervene in foreign exchange reserves and the offshore renminbi market copyedited by sudeshna sarkar

around christmas day karl krause and daan colijn started receiving emails from their fans telling them their pictures were being used to promote pedophilia in several viral posts on twitter they were outraged emails krause said they were saying how can that be you are not pro pedophilia i know that krause and colijn are gay travel bloggers who tell their followers of gay friendly and lgbtq owned businesses and communities throughout the world they had no idea their faces were being used to promote an idea they found abhorrent one of their pictures which features krause and colijn kissing in front of a rainbow flag had been stolen by a twitter troll who went by the name alex an account that was created in december the account then tweeted messages promoting pedophilia it s frustrating to see someone misusing our image for political purposes basically supporting an argument against the lgbtq community with our work krause said the account successfully spread across twitter the deliberately defamatory idea that pedophilia is an acceptable part of lgbtq life over the last half decade that concept has become a staple of far right internet trolls on websites like the fringe message board 4chan and the troll s message quickly gained internet traction some far right news websites wrote articles based on the tweet including the federalist papers which published a post with the headline resistance member says pedophilia is sexual orientation claims bigotry one tweet from the troll s account which used the handle vaceyi stated that pedophilia is a sexual orientation you bigots that tweet has drawn more than 16 000 replies and received attention on far right parts of the internet drawing scathing responses from right wing commentator and former major league baseball pitcher curt schilling and pizzagate conspiracy theorist jack posobiec among others they took the fake message seriously and used it to suggest that the lgbtq community supports the sexual abuse of children they are actually trying to argue that pedophiles are an oppressed minority posobiec wrote on twitter attaching screenshots of vaceyi s tweets many warned this day would come various efforts to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia have been linked back to 4chan including the creation of a fake rainbow flag for gay pride month that supposedly was designed to show acceptance of pedophilia the flag and a fake lgbtp acronym were debunked by the fact checking organization snopes in 2016 a 4chan post stated if they want to demand that society accept their horses identities then it s time we slip in one of our own and implored users to convince them pedos deserve rights too shortly after vaceyi s tweets went viral one 4chan user posted posobiec s tweet mentioning the account wondering if posobiec knew that vaceyi is a troll does know he s being trolled by you guys and just going with it to look good or does he think the person tweeting this is serious the user asked the user behind vaceyi did not respond to a request for comment the vaceyi account used strategies that have become common among efforts to spread misinformation and propaganda on social media building up a small following by tweeting pro lgbtq hashtags and retweeting gay and lesbian aid organizations before sending the pro pedophilia messages krause said he and his followers repeatedly reported the vaceyi account using his identity to twitter which insisted he provide proof of his identity the account later changed its profile picture to a stock photo of two black men kissing twitter permanently suspended vaceyi on thursday night after nbc news asked about the account twitter rules do not allow the promotion of child sexual exploitation the company s rules also bars impersonation and hateful conduct this type of deliberate attempt to undermine and disrupt the health of the public conversation has absolutely no place on our service a twitter spokesperson said in an emailed statement coordinated activity of this nature including running multiple accounts and adopting fake personae is a violation of the twitter rules we are aggressively taking action pursuant with our policies zeke stokes the vice president of programs for the lgbtq advocacy group glaad told nbc news that platforms need to work faster to cut down on this sort of defamation against the lgbtq community social media platforms have the right and the responsibility to protect their products from being weaponized and their users from being targeted by those who wish to spread hate misinformation and malicious rhetoric stokes said anti lgbtq leaders have long tried to surface these debunked lies about lgbtq people despite the fact that our culture knows these fear tactics are blatantly false smears that have attempted to tie the lgbtq community to pedophilia are decades old according to thomas g plante a psychologist and professor at santa clara university who has studied the psychopathology behind pedophilia for more than 30 years the critical thing is that sexual orientation in and of itself is not a risk factor for psychopathology for anything let alone pedophilia plante said in an interview the majority of people who are pedophiles are step fathers older brothers next door neighbors or others like that it has to do with access impulse control problems and other kinds of psychopathology the recent spate of anti science talking points about pedophilia from extremists drives me kind of crazy plante said you ve got plenty of people out there who are experts in this stuff who treat and evaluate people plante said all of that gets discarded because there s someone out there who has an anonymous twitter account who s much louder in the meantime krause said this experience has emboldened him to continue his work showing spaces gay travelers can go without harassment through out the world we see our work as activism said krause people should know about this part of our work don t fall for this other thing we try to tell people that we just want to be treated equally
it found that corporate reports are indeed repetitious but when the language in the current text varies a great deal from previous versions it frequently signals trouble that will become evident several months later three economists lauren cohen and christopher malloy of the harvard business school and quoc nguyen of depaul university downloaded every quarterly and annual corporate report of every publicly traded us company from 1995 to 2014 they then sifted through thousands of reports using a text analysis program we filtered out the reports that made a lot of wording changes over the previous year s version cohen said in an interview it turned out that when there are a lot of changes there s a good chance that something important is going on and most of the time it s negative among the reports that included many such changes the researchers found a high probability that the companies share prices would decline several months after the reports appeared subtle hints textual changes in the risk factors section were most likely to predict subsequent moves in share prices corporate earnings reports are rigidly formatted to comply with regulatory requirements and are divided into predictable sections when the researchers refined the analysis further differentiating between textual changes that were positive and negative the results were even more striking the vast majority 86 per cent of reports with substantial wording changes were primarily negative in tone but the minority that contained primarily positive language generally correlated with increases in share prices later that brings up another important point the stock market rarely responded to the subtle hints in the reports immediately in fact it typically took several months for whatever good or bad news was embedded in the reports to be widely understood and to move the stock market this delay means that there is a profit opportunity for those able to exploit it the researchers said when they constructed a hypothetical portfolio that shorted or bet against the companies with primarily negative word changes in the reports while buying shares of the companies with positive changes the portfolio outperformed the stock market by 22 percentage points per year what is perhaps most remarkable is that they selected these investments without actually reading any of the reports or analysing the stocks or the companies changes to the predict future earnings profitability future news announcements and even future firm level bankruptcies the researchers said that was the case even when the reports contained no outright announcements about such matters as a result they said we find no announcement effect associated with these changes with returns only accruing when the information is later revealed through news events or earnings suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firms loading risk factors to be fair the clues unearthed by the researchers approach are fuzzy and imprecise at best in november for example i asked cohen how i might make use of his insights he suggested two things first always download the previous version of a corporate report as well as the current version so you can compare the language focus on the differences from year to year second focus on one section the risk factors section i did just that looking mainly at the latest apple corporate report posted on its website on november 5 there was plenty of new language describing the risks that apple faced risks that apple executives discussed in november and disclosed more directly in a letter to shareholders on january 2 these risks included the possibility of an economic slowdown in a place like china the possibility of slowing iphone sales the threat of a trade war and the potential impact of unfavourable foreign exchange rates all of these risks have actually materialised and apple shares have sunk pulling down the overall stock market but based on the language changes in the corporate report alone was there a specific reason for investors to bid down apple stock or for a journalist to conclude that apple was in serious trouble
attorneys in san francisco representing an alphabet shareholder are suing the board of directors for allegedly covering up sexual misconduct claims against top executives the suit comes months after an explosive new york times report detailed how google shielded executives accused of sexual misconduct either by keeping them on staff or allowing them amicable departures for example google reportedly paid android leader andy rubin a 90 million exit package despite asking for his resignation after finding sexual misconduct claims against him credible similarly amit singhal was allowed to quietly resign after sexual misconduct claims were made against him too the original report spurred a massive protest during which thousands of google employees walked out of offices around the world in response the company ended its forced arbitration policy for sexual misconduct allegations and said it would start providing more transparency around sexual harassment investigations the new lawsuit filed in california s san mateo county asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty abuse of control unjust enrichment and waste of corporate assets the attorneys say the lawsuit is the result of an extensive original investigation into non public evidence and produced copies of internal google minutes from board of directors meetings the directors wrongful conduct allowed the illegal conduct to proliferate and continue the suit reads as such members of alphabet s board were knowing and direct enablers of the sexual harassment and discrimination the suit also accuses board members of employing contradictory standards if you were a high level male executive at google responsible for generating millions of dollars in revenue google would let you engage in sexual harassment and if you get caught google would keep it quiet let you resign and pay you millions of dollars in severance the suit reads on the other hand if you were a low level employee at google and were accused of sexual harassment or discrimination you would be fired for cause with no severance benefits in this way alphabet and the board were able to maintain optics and superficial compliance with its code of conduct internal rules and laws regarding sexual harassment by appearing to take decisive action against a significant number of low level employees and by concealing the blatant and widespread sexual harassment by senior google executives the board avoided a much bigger scandal in late october google ceo sundar pichai told employees that google had fired 48 employees for sexual misconduct over the past two years the shareholder plaintiff james martin has held alphabet stock since october 2009 google did not immediately respond to a request for comment
washington jerome h powell the federal reserve chairman says he still carries the scars of the fed s missteps in the spring of 2013 that june mr powell then a relatively new member of the fed s board joined colleagues in urging chairman ben s bernanke to announce that the fed finally planned to gradually reduce its economic stimulus campaign mr powell anticipated that markets might not like mr bernanke s message but he said he was even more worried about the consequences of extending the central bank s monthly purchases of treasury securities and mortgage backed bonds mr powell said the fed was stuck on the edge of a rooftop we ve got to jump he told his colleagues according to transcripts of the fed s 2013 meetings which the central bank published friday there is no risk free path mr bernanke s comments at a news conference later that day suggesting the economy was strong enough for the fed to begin tapering its monthly purchases before the end of the year triggered a minor panic in financial markets dubbed the taper tantrum
