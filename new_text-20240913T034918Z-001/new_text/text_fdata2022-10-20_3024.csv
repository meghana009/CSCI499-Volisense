compared to 2 80 for the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in the net interest margin during the quarter ended september 30 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to an

million increase in net loans non interest income for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest income totaled 282 thousand a decrease of 423 thousand or 60 0 from the quarter ended september

securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 as well as a 62 thousand gain on sale of securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 these decreases to non interest

non interest expense for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest expense totaled 5 6 million an increase of 696 thousand or 14 3 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 529 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to annual merit increases and a 351 thousand increase in employee stock based compensation expense associated with the company s 2022 equity incentive plan the increase in non interest expense can also be attributed to a 113 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment expense associated with new

quality metrics and continued low levels of net charge offs and non performing assets during the quarter ended september 30 2022 we received payment from a borrower for full satisfaction of our single

terry ward cnn for as long as she can remember isabella silvers has despised the taste of cilantro the 30 year old british punjabi journalist living in london says the herb has shown up in dishes served at family meals throughout her life among them naan dahl and mattar paneer i would have to awkwardly eat around it or pick it out silvers said about the green leaves that are part of the coriander plant and common in the cuisines of india mexico thailand and morocco among many others i can taste even the smallest amount of the fresh herb and it overpowers any dish i eat silvers said she sometimes wonders whether people around her think she s just being dramatic i love meeting other people who can t stand cilantro as it backs me up that i m not odd or weird silvers said cilantro is one of many polarizing foods with legions of fans and haters the list of disliked foods would likely be as long as there are people with opinions but cilantro is part of an informal subset of more divisive ingredients that often includes mushrooms olives blue cheese mayonnaise and avocado among others love it or hate it is pretty clear but the reasons behind what we like and don t like are not always so straightforward how you perceive food flavor has much to do with smell cilantro is a common food villain that people tend to either adore or revile and it can come down to genetics it usually has to do with the odor said julie mennella a biopsychologist at the monell chemical senses center in philadelphia explaining that scientists looked at olfactory receptors and discovered that individuals with a certain gene or6a2 are more sensitive to smelling cilantro that in turn affects how people perceive its flavor which many report has a soapiness to it our language is really limited when we say food tastes a certain way mennella explained it s actually your sense of smell that allows you to distinguish between something like strawberry and cherry jell o and it all comes down to something called volatiles says linda bartoshuk an experimental psychologist and professor of food science at the university of florida volatiles refer to chemicals evaporated into the air that are part of the retronasal olfaction process that produces flavor bartoshuk says this happens when smells make their way to the back of your nose from inside your mouth as you eat to understand them you have to understand the difference between flavor and taste taste is a very simple sense that can be broken down into the basic qualities of sweet salty sour and bitter bartoshuk says the biology of taste and taste biology is the same among all humans we like sweet and hate bitter bartoshuk said and the biological reasons for that are hardwired into our brains newborn babies like sweet tastes and not bitter ones bartoshuk says since bitter things can indicate poison not liking them is a built in defense mechanism genetic variation also comes into play when it comes to genes that let us sense bitter things and some people may be more sensitive than others to bitterness she says supertasters are people who experience particularly intense tastes a category of genetic variations she says and the intensity of bitter that a person experiences can certainly affect their preference for the related food but how sensitive you are to sweetness or bitterness doesn t always relate to whether you like a food or not says mennella you may taste cruciferous vegetables as more bitter but that doesn t mean you can t grow to like them she said a little salt and sugar go a long way in reducing the bitterness it s really the rules of cuisine when it comes to sensing flavor your olfactory system is doing the work when volatiles enter your mouth their compounds evaporate in the air and move up the back of your nose the retronasal olfaction process that helps you perceive flavor flavor has different properties than taste bartoshuk said and while taste is hard wired olfaction or odor which can include an endless range of aromas from chocolate and vanilla to rotting odors and the smell of blue cheese is something you have to learn to like your biology is not your destiny so can someone learn to like a food they ve long detested mennella says it s entirely possible your biology is not your destiny she said not to say genetics aren t important but when you re an omnivore and open to these foods you learn to like what you eat and perhaps as a surprise to some parents kids are particularly adaptable when it comes to learning to like new foods says mennella research has shown that after giving a child from eight to 10 tastes of a food they will become more accepting of it she said even people who hate cilantro may be able to learn to at least tolerate it if not like it eric ginsburg 35 a food writer in raleigh north carolina said he often encounters cilantro in meals and that it has always tasted soapy to him and everyone in his immediate family including his sister and parents think unscented hand soap he said the stems seem to offer particularly concentrated flavor but over time and through exposure ginsburg said he s built up his tolerance to the herb cilantro still tastes off to me but it doesn t bother me as much as it used to he said he grew more accustomed to it in a similar way that he learned to like beer which he couldn t believe anyone would drink voluntarily or for fun when he first tried it small amounts of cilantro especially in a curry or other dish where it s been cooked or blended don t bother me anymore he said bad experiences often stick while preferences can be conditioned usually after a few trials bartoshuk says negative experiences with foods especially when you re young can have a lasting effect mostly you learn to like and dislike food based on your body and what happens after you eat it bartoshuk said but associations can make you like or not like something too when it comes to food aversions just one bad experience or association can turn you off from something for life she said jasmine robinson 29 from long island new york said she was never really exposed to olives on the dinner table growing up but has bad memories of them from when she was young another child who wouldn t let her have a turn on a swing would mock her while eating olives from a jar and being condescending and mean robinson said i just remember the smell of the pickling juice and the sound of her lips smacking around them i have a cold sweat just thinking about it now said robinson she later tried olives as an adult but the damage was already done they were chewy and slimy and smelly and just a shade of green that wasn t ok she said culture plays a big role in what you like flavor and food preferences vary across cultures too but it has to do with familiarity and not biology and there will always be outliers a greek person who can t stand olives for example or a dutch person who hates cheese i would never eat a sandwich with just cheese like all the dutch people do because i don t like the smell of it said hilde kievit 48 from leusden in the netherlands and french blue cheeses are the worst every culture has something that s considered disgusting in other cultures said paul rozin a professor of psychology at the university of pennsylvania there are many anecdotal examples but the odoriferous durian fruit banned in some public places in asia comes to mind see also surströmming a salted and fermented baltic herring with a disarming odor that s eaten in sweden australia s beloved vegemite a tar colored spread made from brewer s yeast and the american penchant to put marshmallows atop sweet potato pies can come off as utterly revolting to people not familiar with them not to mention those of us who are and while chocolate is something that has far more universal admirers than haters said rozin it s naturally bitter when it comes off the bean it s a human created food created for humans to love he said we add the sugar we add the milk we build the aroma up bartoshuk says it s unsurprising that the flavors we like and dislike vary as much as they do some of it is biological and some of it is learned she said and when you put it all together looking at all the variability there why wouldn t you have people liking and disliking things when it comes down to food preferences in different parts of the world mennella said it has a lot to do with what s available and considered a food staple and that could mean okra in india and tamarind and durian in parts of asia as easily as fermented fish in scandinavia and yuca in cuba you can appreciate how personal the taste experience is because we are all living in different sensory worlds she said where we differ is our experiences and the values that are placed on these foods including the cost the teachings of how they re cooked and the availability the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights

airstrikes cut power and water supplies to hundreds of thousands of ukrainians on tuesday part of what the country s president called an expanding russian campaign to drive the nation into the cold and dark and make peace talks impossible president volodymyr zelenskyy said nearly one third of ukraine s power stations have been destroyed in the past week causing massive blackouts across the country no space left for negotiations with putin s regime he tweeted depriving people of water electricity and heat as winter begins to bite and the broadening use of so called suicide drones that nosedive into targets have opened a new phase in russian president vladimir putin s war the bombardments appear aimed at wearing down the notable resilience ukrainians have shown in the nearly eight months since moscow invaded meanwhile along the front lines things remained very difficult for russian troops in the southern region and city of kherson according to russia s new commander sergei surovikin he told reporters in moscow that the russian military would help evacuate civilians ahead of an expected ukrainian offensive kherson is one of four regions illegally annexed by russia last month regional head vladimir saldo said tuesday that residents of berislav belozersky snigiryovsky and alexandrovsky were to be moved across the dnieper river away from russian troops building large scale defensive fortifications saldo urged residents to stay calm and said they would remain under the reliable protection of the russian army on friday too saldo had urged kherson residents to evacuate russian authorities promise free travel and accommodations to those who leave for russia the only route out that they have offered across ukraine even far from front lines basic utilities are no longer certainties with daily russian strikes reaching far into the country and damaging key facilities the latest city shorn of power was zhytomyr home to military bases industries and leafy boulevards about 140 kilometers 85 miles west of kyiv the mayor said the whole city of 250 000 lost power and also water initially repairs quickly reconnected some homes but 150 000 people were still without electricity hours after the morning strike regional authorities said pavlo raboschuk a 33 year old computer repairman in zhytomyr said that only small shops that could get by without electricity were open on his route to work only swear words come to mind he said he s bracing for a tough and dark winter with dehydrated foods warm clothes and batteries already stockpiled at home city hospitals switched to backup power after the double missile strike tuesday on an energy facility said mayor serhiy sukhomlyn in the capital kyiv missile strikes damaged two power facilities and killed two people city authorities said the attack left 50 000 people without power for a few hours the facilities operator said missiles also severely damaged an energy facility in the south central city of dnipro and strikes hit the northeastern region of sumy russia is mixing up its modes of attack suicide drones set ablaze an infrastructure facility in the partly russian occupied southern zaporizhzhia region the regional governor said air defense s 300 missiles which russia has been repurposing as ground attack weapons as its stocks diminish were used to strike the southern city of mykolaiv in the eastern city of kharkiv eight rockets fired from across the nearby border with russia hit an industrial area the regional governor said in zhytomyr school director iryna kolodzynska had students back at their desks within 30 minutes of the air raid all clear without power for their computers they used the class board to work on math equations we must not break down she said there are regions that suffered much more from the war than we did waves of the explosives laden suicide drones also struck kyiv on monday one slammed into a residential building killing four people the iranian made shahed drones that hit kyiv have also been widely used elsewhere in ukraine in recent weeks an associated press photographer caught one on camera monday its triangle shaped wing and pointed warhead clearly visible though the kremlin refused to confirm their use the u n security council scheduled closed consultations wednesday afternoon on the iranian made drones at the request of the united states britain and france they contend that supplying them to russia violates the 2015 u n security council resolution that endorsed the 2015 nuclear deal between iran and six countries a western official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence said russia is pursuing a strategy of attempting to destroy ukraine s electricity network with long range strikes that are causing civilian casualties rather than degrading its military the official said the iranian drones are playing an increasingly significant role although we can see that ukraine is effectively neutralizing many of them before they hit their targets in a televised address on monday night zelenskyy said russia is using the drones because it is losing ground in the war russia doesn t have any chance on the battlefield and it tries to compensate for its military defeats with terror he said why this terror to put pressure on us on europe on the entire world zelenskyy s tweet ruling out talks with putin wasn t the first time he s said that he won t negotiate with the russian leader russia and ukraine held several rounds of talks in the first month after moscow s invasion but they fell apart the kremlin has said talks could only be possible if ukraine meets russian demands and accepts its land grabs of ukrainian territory ukraine has flatly ruled out talks on those terms in other developments ukraine s nuclear energy operator said russian forces have detained two more senior employees at the zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant energoatom said their whereabouts are unknown also unknown are the whereabouts of another executive who was detained earlier in october in russia the death toll from monday s crash of a russian warplane into a residential area rose to 15 the su 34

with president biden s approval rating hovering in the 40s he has not received a lot of invites to campaign with embattled democrats but that is not stopping him from spending the week touting policies that he hopes will resonate with voters though his stumping has mostly been in d c and without a candidate by his side on tuesday biden announced that he is releasing 15 million more barrels of fuel from the strategic petroleum reserve a move aimed at easing gas prices less than three weeks before the midterms but he brushed aside republican claims that the move was political noting that it was not the first time he d ordered such a withdrawal no it s not he said i ve been doing this for how long now it s not politically motivated at all it s motivated to make sure that i continue to push on what i ve been pushing on and that is making sure there s enough oil that s being pumped by the companies so that we have the ability to be able to produce enough gas that we need here at home oil we need here at home and at the same time keep moving in the direction of providing for alternative energy advertisement in the final stretch before election day on nov 8 with early voting already underway in some states biden s strategy seems to be to hit on one or two big campaign themes a day on tuesday he spoke about abortion rights saying that if democrats gain seats in the senate and maintain control of the house the first item on his legislative agenda will be codifying roe v wade a promise aimed at people incensed by the supreme court s decision in june to overturn the landmark 1973 case on thursday the president plans to tout the infrastructure law at the site of a collapsed bridge in pittsburgh and he will head to delaware on friday to talk about how his administration has canceled thousands of dollars in student loans midterm elections historically come in the midst of a dip in the president s popularity that creates a rough landscape for the party in power and this one is no exception george w bush is the only president in recent memory whose party gained house seats at the halfway point of his first term and that came as voters rallied behind him in the aftermath of the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks advertisement the 2022 version of those head winds is illustrated by biden s plans this weekend spending time in his vacation house in rehoboth beach del while other democrats campaign furiously in their home states still the white house has spent the week trying to show that biden is addressing issues close to voters hearts and their wallets most prominent in that effort is wednesday s announcement about the petroleum reserve polls regularly show that the economy inflation and the cost of living are top concerns for voters by a wide margin and biden sought to show the progress his administration has made on the issue while many economists are skeptical releasing the oil will have much of an impact on prices at the pump the white house hopes it at least helps persuade voters that biden is doing all he can to ease their pain without the steps we have taken over the past several months to ramp up production and lower prices and get relief to consumers gas prices would be higher than they are today biden said adding that he is acting aggressively to counter the damaging choices made by other countries we ll keep doing everything we can to keep it going to ensure our energy independence and security is available and to lower gas prices here at home and to give folks a little bit of breathing room he added advertisement but polls suggest republicans have made political headway blaming biden and the democrats for high gas prices on wednesday senate minority leader mitch mcconnell s office reissued comments he made recently on the senate floor saying democrats have long refused to take advantage of america s reserves of oil and natural gas share this article share families across america have felt the brunt of this all democratic government s failed energy policies said mcconnell r ky american families and small businesses know their electricity bills skyrocketed this spring and summer and they know that heating costs on democrats watch this fall and winter may be catastrophic over the past year biden has tried to pin higher gas prices on russia s unprovoked invasion of ukraine and the fuel shortages and supply disruptions that followed deeming the rising costs putin s price hike he has also faulted energy companies for raising prices quickly when oil prices spike but lowering them slowly when costs go down advertisement my message to the american energy companies is this you should not be using your profits to buy back stock or for dividends not now not while a war is raging biden said wednesday you should use those record breaking profits to increase production and refining the white house has released about 165 million barrels from the reserve since announcing a drawdown last spring of as many as 180 million barrels the largest ever release from the reserve on wednesday biden and white house press secretary karine jean pierre did not rule out that further releases could be coming depending on geopolitical events this month opec plus a coalition of oil producing nations led by russia and saudi arabia announced that it would slash oil production by 2 million barrels per day threatening further price increases in countries already grappling with high costs meanwhile europe is planning to implement a full ban of russian oil in early december a move administration officials worry will reverberate in energy markets around the globe advertisement while boasting of his administration s actions this week biden has also sniped at republicans or at least tried to draw contrasts between the two parties during a separate announcement about electric batteries on wednesday he said republicans who had vociferously opposed the infrastructure law were now asking for some of its funds to be diverted to their constituents you may have seen the news reports describing republicans who voted against the infrastructure bill and the democrats who passed it because it s socialism he said well now quietly they re sending me and the administration letters asking for money in the same bill talking about how important the projects would be for their districts if we just gave them the money i know i was really surprised to find out there are so many socialists in the republican caucus keeping a relatively quiet schedule as other people campaign busily is a new experience for biden he has been a top stand in for democrats during his five decades in politics including in areas where his party is not always welcome something he boasted about during the 2020 presidential primary advertisement as vice president he was a key surrogate for the obama administration in the tough 2010 midterms venturing into districts where president barack obama was not asked to go biden also spent the 1970s and 1980s traveling the country and keynoting democratic functions but this year according to a washington post analysis of more than 60 candidates in competitive races biden has been attacked more often in televised ads than obama was at the same point in 2010 or president donald trump was in 2018 candidates have announced scheduling conflicts when he comes to their states or openly asked him to stay away keeping his face and name off their campaign websites and twitter accounts

over the past couple of years wall street banks e p companies and investors have faced mounting pressure to disinvest in fossil fuels last year blackrock inc nyse blk the world s largest asset manager with 10 trillion in assets under management aum sent shockwaves through the fossil fuel sector after it vowed to double down on climate activism by backing more shareholder resolutions on climate change and social issues also last year new york city s mayor bill de blasio and comptroller scott m stringer jolted the sector after announcing that the city s 226b pension fund plans to divest majority of its fossil fuel investments over the next five years and also cut ties with other companies that have been contributing to global warming shortly thereafter rockefeller brothers fund a family foundation built on one of the world s biggest oil fortunes followed suit by announcing that it would ditch its oil and gas investments and cease making any new investments going forward the 5 billion foundation was initially carved from oil money in the 19th century by john d rockefeller s son of standard oil fame but russia s war in ukraine and the global energy crisis have completely flipped that playbook with oil and gas sectors now attracting big money especially from private investors according to preqin data so far this year private capital funds worldwide have raised a combined 27 9 billion for oil and gas investments compared with 19 4 billion raised in all of 2021 the fundraising environment for oil and gas is better than it was in the last five years it s all a juggling act in the sense that it is relative to other sectors and overall fundraising is down fraser van rensburg new york based co founder and managing partner of placement agency asante capital

year another surprising find the 10 largest private equity funds have 80 of their energy investments in fossil fuels the billions of dollars private equity firms have deployed to drill frack transport store refine fossil fuels and generate energy stand in stark contrast to what climate scientists and international policymakers have called upon to align our trajectory to the 1 5 degrees celsius warming scenario states a report cosigned by major climate groups including greenpeace natural resources defense project sierra club and the sunrise project related biden plans to refill the spr when oil prices fall below 72 these polluting assets are shifting from the public markets where there is greater amount of regulatory and public scrutiny into the shadows of our financial industry where private equity usually operates riddhi mehta neugebauer research director at the private equity stakeholder project has told cbs news private equity firms are emerging as pollution financiers of last resort oscar valdés viera research manager at afref has told cbs moneywatch the report notes that the blackstone group is not only one of the world s largest private equity funds but is also one of the worst polluters in 2020 blackstone backed power plants generated 18 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions the same as 4 million gasoline burning cars according to calculations by pesp the report reveals that carlyle group still maintains 24 billion in carbon based energy through ngp group in which it holds a stake despite earlier this year pledging to have net zero emissions by 2050 indeed the report notes that 60 of carlyle s profit in the first half of this year came from ngp it s going to be a lot harder to persuade these pe firms to stop financing fossil fuel projects if this year s happenings on the climate front are any indication back in april shareholders at citigroup wells fargo bank of america and goldman sachs voted on resolutions recommending the companies stop any additional financing for fossil fuel projects all the resolutions failed spectacularly managing to garner just over 10 of the vote in may nearly two thirds of investors in exxonmobil nyse xom and chevron nyse cvx rejected proposals for the oil giants to align their climate strategies with the paris agreement it was yet another resounding defeat for climate activist investors who are having a less successful proxy season this year than in 2021 as fossil fuel firms reap record profits fueled by the war in ukraine just last year activist investor engine no 1 managed to install three directors on the board of exxon with the goal of pushing the energy giant to reduce its carbon footprint that was despite the firm only owning 0 02 percent of exxon s shares but these companies their shareholders and pe firms simply are not going to pass up an opportunity to reap billions of dollars from the oil and gas boom it s a sentiment that was present in commentary by a carlyle executive who disagreed with the environmentalists timeline on how quickly it s possible to retire fossil fuel plants advertisement carlyle s approach to invest in not divest from the energy transition is a different one grounded in seeking real emissions reductions within portfolio companies over the long term in order to work toward meaningful progress on climate change we will continue to partner with companies across the energy spectrum to collect better data and strive for clear progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions the company said in a statement the fund says it s focused on energy security as much as sustainability which means keeping natural gas plants online longer than initially planned meanwhile there s an issue of accountability whereas banks and oil firms are accountable to their shareholders and to the public private equity firms are only accountable to their limited partners pe firms raise and manage investment funds on behalf of large investors including public pension plans thus making them more resistant to public criticism by alex kimani for oilprice com

equivalents decreased 17 1 million or 47 1 to 19 1 million at september 30 2022 from 36 2 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a 10 0 million

30 2022 the decrease in investments was primarily due to a 10 1 million increase in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities the increase in the gross unrealized loss on available

securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 as well as a 62 thousand gain on sale of securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 these decreases to non interest income were partially offset by a 35 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance due to the purchase of additional bank owned life insurance boli during fiscal year ended june 30 2022 non interest expense for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest expense totaled 5 6 million an increase of 696 thousand or 14 3 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 529 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to annual merit increases and a 351 thousand increase in employee stock based compensation expense associated with the company s 2022 equity incentive plan the increase in non interest expense can also be attributed to a 113 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment expense associated with new

quality metrics and continued low levels of net charge offs and non performing assets during the quarter ended september 30 2022 we received payment from a borrower for full satisfaction of our single

after refusing to divulge what they d do if they regain control of congress republicans have finally revealed their economic agenda unfortunately it involves provoking a global financial crisis gop congressmen plan to hold debt limit hostage next year the scariest part of the recently disclosed gop economic agenda however has largely gone under the radar it s the plan to hold the debt ceiling hostage next year which could easily precipitate a global financial catastrophe republicans have withheld their support from raising the debt limit before usually framing their hostage taking as a commitment to fiscal restraint but the debt ceiling has nothing to do with new spending rather it s a somewhat arbitrary statutory cap on how much the government can borrow to pay off bills that it has already incurred through tax and spending decisions that congress has already made refusing to raise the debt limit is like going to a restaurant ordering the lobster and a 500 bottle of wine and then declaring yourself financially responsible because you skipped out on the check actually it s worse than that if lawmakers dine and dash on behalf of uncle sam they tarnish the creditworthiness of the united states and can make it more expensive for the federal government to borrow in the future because investors don t trust us worse they might accidentally blow up every other financial market on earth too that s because u s debt is now viewed as the safest of safe assets virtually all other assets around the world are benchmarked against u s treasury securities if we default on our debt obligations or even come close to default that raises the question of the riskiness of everything else investors buy and can send shockwaves of panic through every other market boom financial crisis recall that when republicans held the debt limit hostage in 2011 the united states credit rating was downgraded for the first time in history because we came perilously close to default since then the gop has become more politically unhinged which means brinkmanship might well go further which makes a debt default even by accident more likely

september 30 2022 compared to 12 54 as of june 30 2022 the decline in both book value per share and tangible book value per share was primarily due to the payment of a 0 03 per share quarterly cash dividend in august 2022 totaling 419 thousand as well as a 7 8 million increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component on available for sale securities these decreases to book value per

equivalents decreased 17 1 million or 47 1 to 19 1 million at september 30 2022 from 36 2 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a 10 0 million

30 2022 the decrease in investments was primarily due to a 10 1 million increase in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities the increase in the gross unrealized loss on available

september 30 2022 net interest income was 6 2 million an increase of 979 thousand or 18 6 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase

securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 as well as a 62 thousand gain on sale of securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 these decreases to non interest

non interest expense for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest expense totaled 5 6 million an increase of 696 thousand or 14 3 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 529 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to annual merit increases and a 351 thousand increase in employee stock based compensation expense associated with the company s 2022 equity incentive plan the increase in non interest expense can also be attributed to a 113 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment expense associated with new

city receiving an award from the tennessee municipal league the recognition is for budgeting excellence and operating the government with a sound financial plan out of 346 municipalities in the state only 114 earned this recognition from the tennessee comptroller of the treasury mr alexander is preparing to make investments for the city by putting money into cds he said that 250 000 will be moved from excess funds in the general fund into a new short term cd for 3 6 months that will earn a little more interest and he will stagger others none for more than a year out this will allow for one cd to mature every month he said the bank with the best returns is rockpoint he said before he made the investments to be transparent he disclosed to the commissioners that he is a minor stock holder in the bank owning 2 500 shares which he said is 02 percent of the bank s assets this was discussed with the city s auditor and the city manager and city manager martin granum said he had no problem with the association because john has massive integrity he was also given approval for taking out a three year loan at the rate of 4 15 percent to purchase vehicles needed by the city the loan will be for 190 000 which is three quarters of the amount needed for four police vehicles and a pickup truck that will be used by the fire department the city will also be spending 18 000 for temporary office manager services for the public works department this will pay for a contract with total resource inc to fill the position during the maternity leave of an employee commissioner ruth jeno commented that this is not budgeted and in the past work during temporary vacancies was absorbed by the remaining staff the city has also recently purchased cloud based iworq software for that department which manages much of what the public works department deals with including managing facilities maintenance issuing permits and licenses and keeping track of them before the vote commissioner jeno said she was against taking 18 000 from reserves to pay for the temporary position and that she believes there are enough people already on staff that could fill in commissioner ed lecompte agreed saying it was not necessary the vote was three for and two against using reserves in his city manager report mr granum said red bank has been increasing engagement with the public on social media sites and is seeing more residents participating on the various platforms he said that the advisory service from mtas municipal technical advisory service is that digital engagement is critical for municipalities

be used for pickleball and another tennis court is being converted into three more pickle ball courts mr granum has been city manager in red bank now for a year and the council will soon be doing an evaluation of his performance he is also preparing to give a yearly evaluation to the six employees that report directly to him the city manager also prepared a list for the commissioners of over a dozen ideals and goals that the red bank beautification committee has created for the betterment of the city in their individual reports mayor hollie berry presented a state of the city address that showed the accomplishments and progress made by red bank during the past year vice mayor stefanie dalton said on saturday red bank will hold its octoberfest celebration at red bank city park from 11 a m until 6 p m there will be food beer live music and art vendors commissioner jeno who is on the beautification committee said some of the projects that they recommend will take time to implement but that one in particular could be done quickly that is to clean up vacant lots and buildings this could be done just by reaching out to the owners she said commissioner jeno also asked for an update to the signalization project taking place on dayton boulevard she said it is taking forever and appears to be done in an unprofessional manner the answer to when it will be finished is not known said the city manager but he will find out he said the work is being executed by another agency on behalf of red bank and the city is not in charge of it the longer it takes he said the lower the price because materials left over from other work the contractor is doing can be used the city has plans to add another position a project manager that could ensure doing work the right way this is the first of five intersections that will be improved commissioner pete phillips reported on this year s christmas parade he is requesting sponsors and volunteers for the event so the city will not have to be responsible for its cost

detroit ap tesla reported wednesday that its third quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago fueled by higher vehicle sales the austin texas electric vehicle and solar panel maker posted net income of 3 29 billion from july through september ceo elon musk said on the company s quarterly conference call that the tesla is considering a 5 billion to 10 billion stock buyback next year even if the economy stumbles and musk said tesla s full self driving feature won t be ready to be used without humans behind the wheel this year but it will be ready next year without question whatsoever in my mind excluding special items tesla made 1 05 per share beating wall street estimates of 1 per share according to data provider factset revenue rose 56 to a record 21 45 billion but fell just short of estimates averaging 21 98 billion tesla will fall short of its target of 50 annual growth in vehicle deliveries this year chief financial officer zachary kirkhorn said during the conference call but he was later contradicted by musk on the delivery side we do expect to be just under 50 growth he said blaming the shortfall to expected problems transporting vehicles at the end of the year musk later predicted 50 annual production and delivery growth but also pointed to logistical problems shipping vehicles then he reiterated the growth targets to the best of our knowledge we believe that tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50 or greater compound annual growth rate musk said qualifying his statement by adding that some years may be lower and some higher it will take a stellar fourth quarter sales performance to reach the 50 goal earlier this month tesla reported vehicle sales that rose 35 for the july september period compared to the second quarter as the company s huge factory in china got past supply chain issues and pandemic restrictions the company sold 343 830 cars and suvs in the third quarter compared with 254 695 deliveries made from april through june analysts have questioned whether tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles which in the u s start around 49 000 so far this year the company has delivered 908 573 vehicles last year the company delivered just over 936 000 vehicles to increase sales by 50 over last year which would amount to about 1 4 million vehicles the company would have to sell more than 490 000 vehicles in the fourth quarter but tesla said it had higher than usual numbers of vehicles in transit at the end of the third quarter that will count as sales once they reach customers the company said it s smoothing out its delivery pace tesla said its full self driving system will be available to everyone who has ordered it by the end of this year the system is being beta tested now by 160 000 selected drivers and will still need human drivers into next year musk said we re not saying it s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel he said but he added that humans almost never have to touch controls he said the company will be able to show regulators that the system is much safer than the average human driver musk has promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis would be in use during 2020 a deadline that has been missed for two years on the stock buyback musk said tesla s board has debated the idea and generally thinks it would make sense it s likely that we ll do some meaningful buyback he said tesla has the money to fund a buyback during the third quarter the company was sitting on 21 1 billion worth of cash and marketable securities it said musk also said he s confident tesla will meet u s government requirements so its buyers would get up to 7 500 in tax credits per vehicle the recently passed inflation reduction act includes a tax credit of up to 7 500 that could be used to defray the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle but to qualify for the full credit the ev must contain a battery built in north america with 40 of the metals mined or recycled on the continent tesla builds vehicles and makes batteries in the u s high prices for raw materials caused a hit to profits along with inefficiencies from ramping up the factories in germany and texas the company said still the company said initial deliveries of its semi truck will start in december shares in tesla inc fell 6 3 in extended trading wednesday after the company s third quarter sales missed wall street estimates the stock has lost 37 so far this year burdened by musk s 44 billion bid to buy twitter musk earlier backed out of the purchase contending that twitter misrepresented the number of fake spam bot accounts on its platform twitter sued and a delaware judge has given both sides until oct 28 to work out details otherwise there will be a trial in november musk conceded on wednesday s conference call that he and other investors are overpaying for twitter but he added that he believes the long term potential for twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value

equivalents decreased 17 1 million or 47 1 to 19 1 million at september 30 2022 from 36 2 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a 10 0 million

30 2022 the decrease in investments was primarily due to a 10 1 million increase in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities the increase in the gross unrealized loss on available

securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 as well as a 62 thousand gain on sale of securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 these decreases to non interest

non interest expense for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest expense totaled 5 6 million an increase of 696 thousand or 14 3 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 529 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to annual merit increases and a 351 thousand increase in employee stock based compensation expense associated with the company s 2022 equity incentive plan the increase in non interest expense can also be attributed to a 113 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment expense associated with new

services revenue was 106 7 million during the quarter compared to 72 3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2021 the 47 5 increase in revenue was mainly due to the increase in demand for our

or 23 2 of revenue compared to 17 3 million or 23 9 of revenue in the year ago quarter the decrease in operating margin percentage was mainly driven by higher transportation costs caused by extraordinarily high inflation and increased equipment rental costs president and ceo brian recatto commented while our operating margin percentage was down slightly compared to last year we are pleased that we were able to improve our operating margin percentage incrementally compared to the second quarter the improvement was primarily the result of price actions initiated during the latter

2021 the lower operating margin compared to the third quarter of 2021 was mainly due to an increase in transportation related expenses increased downtime at the re refinery and other inflationary pressures across the segment which offset an improvement in the spread between the netback sales price net of freight impact on our base oil sales and the price paid charged to our customers for the removal of their used oil recatto commented we continued to manage the spreads in our oil business effectively which allowed us to take advantage of high base oil prices during the quarter despite

to the florida condominium act condo act state lawmakers responded by introducing many condominium bills in the 2022 regular legislative session but none of them passed this failure was widely criticized in the media until suddenly during the 2022 third special session called for other purposes a new bill miraculously appeared passed with unanimous support and became law in less than a week on may 26 this was florida senate bill 4 d building safety at first glance s b 4 d makes a laudable attempt at addressing the physical issues facing florida s aging condominium stock its primary effect is to create two mandatory pillars of protection 1 periodic milestone inspections and 2 structural integrity reserve studies but after months of digesting the new legislation the prevailing consensus is that it may create more problems than it solves and ironically result in the elimination of many more florida condominiums the task force report florida recognized the condominium form of ownership of real property almost 60 years ago since then real estate developers have built thousands of condominium projects all over the state the longstanding perception was that a condominium unit provided a more affordable housing option than a single family residence this form of ownership however requires that the unit owners determine the operational and maintenance standards of the condominium perhaps practical in theory but as exemplified after champlain towers south residents of a condominium rarely agree on anything consequently dissension and apathy often impede important decisions including those related to building maintenance repair and replacement this common pitfall drives the underlying cynicism throughout the task force report it essentially proposed that government should shorten the leash on condominium self governance because unit owners as a whole are incapable of protecting themselves those who disagreed or initially preferred to wait until disclosure of the actual cause of the tragedy could not overcome the immense political pressure to change the law quickly with this in mind the task force identified 12 areas of inquiry that in its view establish the basis for future physical and financial stability of condominium buildings and associations the list included 1 board of directors obligation for maintenance repair and replacement 2 special assessments and borrowing 3 inspection reports and transparency 4 association compliance with inspection report requirements and remedies of unit owners 5 reserve studies reserve waivers and funding reserves 6 developer warranties and liability and design professional liability 7 termination of condominiums for economic waste obsolescence 8 dbpr division of florida condominiums timeshares and mobile homes trust fund 9 unit owner financing 10 community association managers and consulting professionals 11 local government accountability and 12 association insurance the task force s subsequent recommendations for changes to the condo act targeted many of these areas its primary challenge was striking a balance between the need for a safe structure and the associated economic burden on unit owners unfortunately thousands of condominium unit owners have limited or fixed incomes so when faced with the option to waive or reduce reserves for capital projects these individuals may choose their wallets over anything else the task force was aware of this dilemma but the predominant evaluation after the tragedy was that certain items should not be left to chance accordingly the task force report evolved into a comprehensive analysis of relative points that if implemented or improved might have prevented the champlain towers south tragedy but what it failed to acknowledge is that champlain towers south was built in 1981 and many older condominiums in florida with less reserves and the absence of structural repairs have had no major structural issues this suggests as alluded to above that the task force report may be a premature reassessment of existing regulation under the condo act and other relative policies surrounding condominium safety s b 4 d building safety the inability to resolve countervailing concerns by the legislature during the 2022 regular session resulted in the absence of any legislation in this area however facing criticism for the failure to act the legislature proposed s b 4 d during the 2022 third special session it took some of the recommendations from the task force report i e on mandatory inspections and reserve requirements but ignored consequences that concerned the task force and some of the legislators during the 2022 regular session the result is a slew of new obligations unrealistic deadlines and a complete disregard of whether the requirements are achievable or what the new measures may cost many thousands of floridians milestone inspections the first significant aspect of s b 4 d is not a change to the condo act instead it adds a section to the florida building code entitled mandatory structural inspections for condominium and cooperative buildings the new mandate referred to as a milestone inspection has two phases 1 a visual inspection of the building for substantial structural deterioration and 2 possible destructive or nondestructive testing and only required if substantial structural deterioration is found during phase one it is worth noting however that the milestone inspection is required only for condominium and co op buildings that are three stories or higher applicable buildings that received their certificate of occupancy co on or before july 1 1992 must complete the milestone inspection by december 31 2024 and then every 10 years thereafter all other applicable buildings must complete the milestone inspection by december 31 of the year in which the building reaches 30 years of age or 25 years if the building is located within three miles of the coastline as defined in f s 376 031 and then every 10 years thereafter one major flaw with these deadlines is that they fail to consider buildings that received their co after july 1 1992 but are already at or near the age triggering the milestone inspection requirement to illustrate a condominium or cooperative building within three miles of the coastline with a co issued between july 2 1992 and december 31 1996 would need to go back in time to complete its milestone inspection between 2017 and 2021 per the statute s formula similarly those within three miles of the coastline with a co issued between january 1 1997 and december 31 1998 would need to complete a milestone inspection before the end of 2022 or 2023 respectively this is an earlier deadline than for the thousands of older condominiums and co op buildings with cos issued on or before july 1 1992 which have until the end of 2024 to complete their milestone inspection apparently the legislature did not consider the impossibility real and practical of these requirements another constraint with the milestone inspections is the limited pool of individuals qualified to perform them f s 553 899 7 requires they be performed by a licensed architect or engineer authorized to practice in florida there are almost 25 000 condominiums with cos issued prior to july 1 1992 and this excludes any within three miles of the coastline that recently turned or are about to turn 25 years of age based on these numbers and presuming the existing architects and engineers will have additional work other than milestone inspections prior to december 31 2024 it appears unrealistic to believe there are enough days between now and the initial deadline for all affected condominiums to complete the necessary milestone inspections additionally the deadline for completing the milestone inspection fails to distinguish between the inspection portion and any potential remediation work this will definitely be a problem an association may be able to complete the milestone inspection well before december 31 2024 but if the report reveals substantial structural deterioration the subsequent time needed to obtain building plans and permits negotiate an agreement with a general contractor and complete the actual repairs could easily take more than a year in which case has the association then failed to meet the deadline further confusing the issue is the language in f s 553 899 5 upon determining that a building must have a milestone inspection the local enforcement agency must provide written notice of such required inspection to the condominium association or cooperative association by certified mail return receipt requested this raises the question of whether an association has to perform a milestone inspection if it does not receive notice to do so from a local enforcement agency the next provision f s 553 899 6 goes on to require the association to complete a phase one milestone inspection within six months from receipt of the written notice this suggests that if the local enforcement agency sends notice at any time before july 1 2024 it can reduce the association s time to complete the milestone inspection conversely if a local enforcement agency provides the written notice after july 1 2024 does the association have beyond december 31 2024 to comply finally f s 553 899 11 also empowers local boards of county commissioners to require associations to schedule or commence phase two repairs within a specified timeframe after the enforcement agency receives the association s milestone inspection report but the provision then provides that such repairs must begin within a year of receiving such report thus once again there is confusion in the statute whether authorized state action can shorten or lengthen the specified deadlines reserves the second significant aspect of s b 4 d is that after december 31 2024 associations with buildings three stories or higher can no longer waive reserves for certain building components deemed critical to structural soundness and safety applicable associations must also complete a structural integrity reserve study sirs for these components and they must establish reserves to fund them in full over their remaining useful life the immediate effect after january 1 2025 will be a dramatic increase in assessments for thousands of condominiums and co ops across the state associations will not only have to make up reserves waived in prior years but also provide new reserves for building components where reserves were not previously required some of the newly identified components under f s 718 112 2 g e g a building s foundation are questionable at best no one doubts that a foundation is vital to a building s overall structure but inspecting this component is extremely difficult or practically impossible without substantial destructive work the new legislation ignores this reality and arguably requires the inspector to assign it a useful life in the sirs so the association in turn can establish it as a reserve item what would one consider the useful life of the foundation of the empire state building or the colosseum in rome equally elusive may be determining the useful life of the condominium s floors load bearing walls or other primary structural members finally the legislature also added windows as a sirs item but in many condominiums unit owners are responsible for repairing and replacing their windows this means the new statute may require associations to assess unit owners for building components it has no obligation to maintain under its governing documents take a step further what if the architect or engineer cannot establish a useful life for one or more of the building components such as the foundation is the report inadequate to satisfy the mandate should the architect or engineer be sanctioned for not addressing the impossible if the foregoing were not enough of a morass the legislature also decided to impose personal liability on association officers and directors if they fail to comply with the milestone inspection and sirs requirements as many people know serving on an association s board of directors is typically a thankless job it is an unpaid position requiring constant communication with dissatisfied unit owners about why certain things regarding the building are either occurring or not occurring thus board positions were already difficult to fill in many cases and now it will likely be even harder to find volunteers willing to subject themselves to personal liability if the association fails or is unable to comply with the legislature s new directives other requirements under s b 4 d although the milestone inspections and new reserve requirements are attracting most of the attention s b 4 d also includes related disclosure mandates the legislature tasked the division of florida condominiums timeshares and mobile homes division with collecting data from condominiums with buildings that are three stories or higher in height associations existing on or before july 1 2022 will have until january 1 2023 to provide the division with the following 1 the number of buildings on the property that are three stories or higher 2 the total number of units in all such buildings 3 the addresses of all such buildings and 4 the counties in which all such buildings are located the division will then publish the foregoing information on its website and associations are obligated to notify the division of any changes s b 4 d also requires the milestone inspection report and sirs to be official records of the association which it must maintain for at least 15 years once received the association is required to disseminate the inspector prepared milestone inspection summary to unit owners in three separate ways 1 by personal delivery u s mail or electronic transmission as applicable 2 by posting a copy in a conspicuous place on the condominium property and 3 by publishing a copy on the association s website if a website is required per f s 718 111 12 g finally developers and non developer owners i e for resales are now required to provide copies of the most recent milestone inspection report and sirs or a statement that the association has not completed a sirs to prospective buyers of condominium units potential glitch bill aside from the systemic problems discussed above s b 4 d also contains technical issues that a future glitch bill may need to address nowhere in s b 4 d for example does it specify an intent to apply retroactively to existing condominiums one would think a fair reading would imply such an application but courts typically require an affirmative statement even if s b 4 d were permitted to apply to existing condominiums would it unconstitutionally impair existing declarations that currently allow unit owners to waive reserves on another note what is the magic of three stories in height as compared to four or five stories what if the first story is solely for parking and the inhabited portions of the building are only on the second and third stories further complicating this issue is that the statute s height requirement does not apply to a single family two family or three family dwelling with three or fewer habitable stories above ground so is a three story three unit condominium occupied by three different families with one on each floor subject to the new regulations unintended consequences the short and long term effects of s b 4 d are still unknown but if it remains in substantially the same form as it is now it may displace thousands from their homes and force statewide condominium terminations this is due to simple economics unit owners in older condominiums on limited or fixed incomes will be unable to afford the increase in assessments brought upon by the new mandates financing options may be limited or nonexistent any loss of affordable housing stock would also seem to exacerbate the existing lack of affordable housing in florida if unit owners are able to afford higher assessments they might equally elect to terminate their condominiums if there is no return on their investment champlain towers south presented this issue when estimated repairs were factoring out from 80 000 to over 300 000 per unit if unit owners in a comparable building end up paying these large amounts it is unlikely their units will see any significant increase in resale value the legislature surely did not intend for condominium unit owners to part with life savings or face financial ruin simply to keep their homes the status quo these consequences are also alarming considering the need for s b 4 d was predicated on a tragedy still under investigation while other condominium buildings far older than champlain towers south and which have not invested substantial sums in retrofitting have not experienced the same result conclusion ensuring the safety of florida s condominiums and co ops is unquestionably a laudable goal this is especially true in a world post champlain towers south but with s b 4 d the legislature was apparently so focused on protection that it ignored the corresponding price tag to existing owners as such the new legislation may only protect many unit owners by effectively forcing them out of

september 30 2022 compared to 12 54 as of june 30 2022 the decline in both book value per share and tangible book value per share was primarily due to the payment of a 0 03 per share quarterly cash dividend in august 2022 totaling 419 thousand as well as a 7 8 million increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component on available for sale securities these decreases to book value per share and tangible book value per share were partially offset by the repurchase of 397 352 shares at a cost of 4 6 million or 11 53 per share during the quarter ended september 30 2022 under the company s previously announced stock repurchase programs statement of financial condition total assets decreased 28 5 million or 3 2 to 851 5 million at september 30 2022 from 880 0 million at june 30 2022 primarily due to a 17 1 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and a 7 8 million increase in the unrealized loss on available for sale securities net of deferred taxes cash and cash equivalents decreased 17 1 million or 47 1 to 19 1 million at september 30 2022 from 36 2 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a 10 0 million decrease in advances from the fhlb of pittsburgh and a 6 4 million decrease in deposits total investments decreased 9 9 million or 3 5 to 277 2 million at september 30 2022 from 287 1 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in investments was primarily due to a 10 1 million increase in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities the increase in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities is due to current interest rate levels relative to the company s cost and not credit quality the company remains focused on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio that provides a steady stream of cash flows both in the current and in rising interest rate environments net loans decreased 3 0 million or 0 6 to 472 5 million at september 30 2022 from 475 5 million at june 30 2022 the interest rate environment has created a highly competitive market for lending the company maintains conservative lending practices and is focused on lending to borrowers with high credit quality within its market footprint deposits decreased 6 4 million or 1 1 to 600 2 million at september 30 2022 from 606 6 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in deposits was primarily due to a 13 5 million decrease in non interest bearing checking accounts partially offset by a 7 3 million increase in interest bearing checking accounts the interest rate environment has created a highly competitive market for deposits borrowings decreased 10 0 million or 15 4 to 55 0 million at september 30 2022 from 65 0 million at june 30 2022 stockholders equity decreased 11 1 million or 5 8 to 181 2 million at september 30 2022 from 192 3 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in stockholders equity was primarily due to a 7 8 million increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of the unrealized loss on available for sale securities the repurchase of 397 352 shares at a cost of 4 6 million or 11 53 per share and the payment of a 0 03 per share quarterly cash dividend in august 2022 totaling 419 thousand partially offset by 1 0 million of net income recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2022 book value per share measured 12 50 as of september 30 2022 compared to 12 91 as of june 30 2022 and tangible book value per share 4 measured 12 12 as of september 30 2022 compared to 12 54 as of june 30 2022 net interest income for the quarter ended september 30 2022 net interest income was 6 2 million an increase of 979 thousand or 18 6 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in interest income on investments and loans partially offset by an increase in interest expense on borrowings and deposits the net interest margin measured 3 19 for the quarter ended september 30 2022 compared to 2 80 for the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in the net interest margin during the quarter ended september 30 2022 compared to the same period in 2021 was primarily due to an improvement in asset mix during the twelve months ended september 30 2022 including a 108 8 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents a 109 5 million increase in investment securities and an 18 3 million increase in net loans non interest income for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest income totaled 282 thousand a decrease of 423 thousand or 60 0 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the decrease was primarily due to a 273 thousand unrealized loss on equity securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2022 compared to a 105 thousand unrealized gain on equity securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 as well as a 62 thousand gain on sale of securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 these decreases to non interest income were partially offset by a 35 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance due to the purchase of additional bank owned life insurance boli during fiscal year ended june 30 2022 non interest expense for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest expense totaled 5 6 million an increase of 696 thousand or 14 3 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 529 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to annual merit increases and a 351 thousand increase in employee stock based compensation expense associated with the company s 2022 equity incentive plan the increase in non interest expense can also be attributed to a 113 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment expense associated with new branch locations in doylestown pennsylvania and hamilton township new jersey that were opened during the quarter ended december 31 2021 during the quarter ended september 30 2022 the company made a strategic decision to close the bank s branch office located in collingswood new jersey and to consolidate the deposits from this branch office into the bank s audubon new jersey branch office after assessing the branch s profitability and its close geographic proximity to the audubon new jersey branch location income taxes for the quarter ended september 30 2022 we recorded a 67 thousand income tax benefit reflecting an effective tax rate of 7 0 compared to a 30 thousand income tax benefit reflecting an effective tax rate of 2 7 for the same period in 2021 the company recorded a 211 thousand and a 235 thousand income tax benefit related to refunds received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the cares act during the quarters ended september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively income tax benefit and the effective tax rate for the quarters ended september 30 2022 and 2021 were impacted by the previously discussed income tax benefit from refunds received associated with the carryback of net operating losses under the cares act asset quality during the quarter ended september 30 2022 we did not record a provision for loan losses due to improved asset quality metrics and continued low levels of net charge offs and non performing assets during the quarter ended september 30 2022 we received payment from a borrower for full satisfaction of our single largest non performing loan with a carrying value of 1 7 million the payoff of this non performing loan contributed to a significant reduction in our non performing assets and the company s ratio of

biden says us should boost domestic oil production washington united states president joe biden called wednesday on us energy companies to increase oil production and to lower retail gasoline prices as he announced a new release from strategic us reserves in a bid to dampen fuel prices families are hurting biden said in remarks from the white house high fuel prices are threatening the us economy and also feeding voter anger at the administration three weeks before midterm elections to decide control of congress biden has struggled to find solutions to a problem rooted in russia s invasion of ukraine and the recent decision by the saudi led opec cartel to cut its own oil production biden said his order to release the final 15 million barrels of a 180 million barrel pledge from the strategic petroleum reserve would continue to stabilize markets and decrease the prices at a time when the actions of other countries have caused such volatility however he also urged the us oil industry to get more oil out of the ground insisting this did not counter his presidency s priority of pushing the united states into a clean energy future we need to responsibly increase american oil production without delaying or deferring our transition to clean energy he said in addition to urging a boost in production biden repeated his frequent call for fuel companies to lower prices paid by motorists arguing that prices at the pump are not declining in step with overall drops in the price of crude oil my message to the american energy companies is this you should not be using your profits to buy back stock or for dividends not now not while a war s raging he said you should be using these record breaking profits to increase production and refining invest in america for the american people bring down the price 15 million barrels to market biden confirmed he was putting the final 15 million barrels on the market from a record release of us strategic oil reserves with more releases possible if energy prices spike we re going to continue to responsibly use that national asset he said the decision to make the biggest ever dip into the emergency oil reserves usually kept for responding to situations such as hurricane related shutdowns at oil refineries was one of the few tools biden has to make a direct impact on oil supplies about 400 million barrels remain in the strategic reserves officials say and this will be topped up when prices dip far enough major energy exporter russia was hit with us and european sanctions soon after it invaded ukraine in february causing turmoil on markets in addition the kremlin has threatened to use its leverage over energy supplies as an economic weapon against the west which supports ukraine s fight to repel the invasion for biden there are serious domestic concerns with gasoline prices at one point averaging more than 5 a gallon causing nationwide anger while prices have since moderated inflation remains the biggest factor driving republican hopes of defeating the democrats in november s midterm legislative elections
recent comments from high ranking u s officials indicate that beijing is speeding up its timeline for forcibly reuniting with taiwan china s military modernization is picking up speed at a pace that seems to favor a shortened timeline for reuniting with taiwan by force the u s navy believes that 2027 could be the year china wishes to launch an invasion china s just throwing so much money into military modernization and has already sped up its timeline to 2027 for when it wants the to have the capability to seize taiwan that we need to act with a sense of urgency to tackle that threat because that is something unlike anything we ve seen in modern history at least said rep mike gallagher r wi a member of the house armed services committee while china s navy is the largest in the world the u s navy is shrinking and indeed what the navy s proposing is to bottom out the force at 280 ships by 2027 at the worst possible moment the navy will be weakest when the pla is strongest vis à vis taiwan so it makes absolutely no sense gallagher said china s leader xi jinping recently and publicly reaffirmed beijing s desire to take taiwan and he didn t mince words in doing so there has been a change in the approach from beijing toward taiwan in recent years and instead of sticking with the status quo that was established in a positive way a fundamental decision that the status quo was no longer acceptable and that beijing was determined to pursue reunification on a much faster timeline secretary of state antony blinken said at an event hosted by the hoover institution and if peaceful means didn t work then it would employ coercive means and possibly if coercive means don t work maybe forceful means to achieve its objectives and that is what is profoundly disrupting the status quo and creating tremendous tensions blinken added american wargames have indicated that while china would currently struggle to overpower taiwan beijing s rapidly expanding stock of anti ship missiles could soon tip the balance in china s favor although the united states has taken the stance of strategic ambiguity preferring to keep its obligations to taiwan unclear to china president joe biden has recently clarified his position on the island democracy s defense explaining that if china attacked taiwan the united states would defend the country i think it would be dangerous to say okay because russia has encountered unexpected friction in ukraine that somehow let s say china is going to be deterred in a taiwan scenario gallagher said because one xi jinping is going to school on the russian failures in ukraine two some of the weapons systems that are relevant for ukraine are also relevant to taiwan and we re going winchester on those weapons systems caleb larson is a multimedia journalist and defense writer with the national interest a graduate of ucla he also holds a master of public policy and lives in berlin he covers the intersection of conflict security and technology focusing on american foreign policy european security and german society for both print and radio follow him on twitter calebmlarson image reuters

assume no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement definition of non gaap measures we believe that investors understanding of allstate s performance is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non gaap measures our methods for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes prior year reserve reestimates and amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles underlying combined ratio is a non gaap ratio which is computed as the difference between four gaap operating ratios the combined ratio the effect of catastrophes on the combined ratio the effect of prior year non catastrophe reserve reestimates on the combined ratio and the effect of amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles on the combined ratio we believe that this ratio is useful to investors and it is used by management to reveal the trends in our property liability business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses prior year reserve reestimates and amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles catastrophe losses cause our loss trends to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the combined ratio prior year reserve reestimates are caused by unexpected loss development on historical reserves which could increase or decrease current year net income amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles relates to the acquisition purchase price and is not indicative of our underlying insurance business results or trends we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance the underlying combined ratio should not be considered a substitute for the combined ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of our business the following tables

and losses business combination expenses and the amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles income or loss from discontinued operations gain or loss on disposition of operations adjustments for other significant non recurring infrequent or unusual items when a the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably unlikely to recur within two years or b there has been no similar charge or gain within the prior two years related income tax expense or benefit of these items net income loss applicable to common shareholders is the gaap measure that is most directly comparable to adjusted net income we use adjusted net income as an important measure to evaluate our results of operations we believe that the measure provides investors with a valuable measure of the company s ongoing performance because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services business that may be obscured by the net effect of net gains and losses on investments and derivatives pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses business combination expenses and the amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles income or loss from discontinued operations gain or loss on disposition of operations and adjustments for other significant non recurring infrequent or unusual items and the related tax expense or benefit of these items net gains and losses on investments and derivatives and pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses may vary significantly between periods and are generally driven by business decisions and external economic developments such as capital market conditions the timing of which is unrelated to the insurance underwriting process business combination expenses income or loss from discontinued operations and gain or loss on disposition of operations are excluded because they are non recurring in nature and the amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles is excluded because it relates to the acquisition purchase price and is not indicative of our underlying business results or trends non recurring items are excluded because by their nature they are not indicative of our business or economic trends accordingly adjusted net income excludes the effect of items that tend to be highly variable from period to period and highlights the results from ongoing operations and the underlying profitability of our business a byproduct of excluding these items to determine adjusted net income is the transparency and understanding of their significance to net income variability and profitability while recognizing these or similar items may recur in subsequent periods adjusted net income is used by management along with the other components of net income loss applicable to common shareholders to assess our performance we use adjusted measures of adjusted net income in incentive compensation therefore we believe it is useful for investors to evaluate net income loss applicable to common shareholders adjusted net income and their components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing and evaluating our performance we note that investors financial analysts financial and business media organizations and rating agencies utilize adjusted net income results in their evaluation of our and our industry s financial performance and in their investment decisions recommendations and communications as it represents a reliable representative and consistent measurement of the industry and the company and management s performance we note that the price to earnings multiple commonly used by insurance investors as a forward looking valuation technique uses adjusted net income as the denominator adjusted net income should not be considered a substitute for net income loss applicable to common shareholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of our business the following tables reconcile net income loss applicable to common shareholders and adjusted net income taxes on adjustments to reconcile net income loss applicable to common shareholders and adjusted net income generally use a 21 effective tax rate in millions except per share data three months

september 30 2022 compared to 12 54 as of june 30 2022 the decline in both book value per share and tangible book value per share was primarily due to the payment of a 0 03 per share quarterly cash dividend in august 2022 totaling 419 thousand as well as a 7 8 million increase in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component on available for sale securities these decreases to book value per share and tangible book value per share were partially offset by the repurchase of 397 352 shares at a cost of 4 6 million or 11 53 per share during the quarter ended september 30 2022 under the

equivalents decreased 17 1 million or 47 1 to 19 1 million at september 30 2022 from 36 2 million at june 30 2022 the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by a 10 0 million

30 2022 the decrease in investments was primarily due to a 10 1 million increase in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities the increase in the gross unrealized loss on available for sale securities is due to current interest rate levels relative to the company s cost and not credit quality the company remains focused on maintaining a high quality investment portfolio that provides a steady stream of cash flows both in the current and in rising interest rate environments net loans decreased 3 0 million or 0 6 to 472 5 million at september 30 2022 from 475 5 million at

securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 as well as a 62 thousand gain on sale of securities recorded during the quarter ended september 30 2021 these decreases to non interest income were partially offset by a 35 thousand increase in earnings on bank owned life insurance due to the purchase of additional bank owned life insurance boli during fiscal year ended june 30 2022 non interest expense for the quarter ended september 30 2022 non interest expense totaled 5 6 million an increase of 696 thousand or 14 3 from the quarter ended september 30 2021 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due to a 529 thousand increase in salaries and employee benefits due to annual merit increases and a 351 thousand increase in employee stock based compensation expense associated with the company s 2022 equity incentive plan the increase in non interest expense can also be attributed to a 113 thousand increase in occupancy and equipment expense associated with new

quality metrics and continued low levels of net charge offs and non performing assets during the quarter ended september 30 2022 we received payment from a borrower for full satisfaction of our single

chaudhrymali88 new york urdupoint news sputnik 20th october 2022 oil prices rose for the first time in three days as traders balanced the announcement of a new forthcoming sale from the us strategic petroleum reserve spr with data showing a weekly drop in crude stockpiles across the united states president joe biden announced the sale of an additional 15 million barrels from the spr to follow through with some 180 million released from the reserve over the past six months by his administration the releases created additional supply to refineries bringing down fuel prices that at one point hit record highs above 5 per gallon on wednesday a gallon of gasoline at the pump in the united states averaged 3 85 but oil bears counting on news of the 15 million barrel spr release to lead to a fresh price plunge in crude prices as well were disappointed on wednesday crude traded in both new york and london settled up for the first time since the start of the week as total us crude stockpiles outside of the spr fell by 1 73 million barrels last week after a gain of 9 88 million the previous week new york traded west texas intermediate crude the benchmark for us crude settled up 2 73 or 3 3 at 85 55 a barrel after dropping almost 7 over the past two sessions london traded brent oil the global benchmark for oil settled up 2 38 or 2 6 at 92 41 brent lost nearly 5 over the monday tuesday stretch with the november 8 midterm elections just about three weeks away president joe biden took the podium at the white house to announce another spr release aimed at bringing fuel prices down for americans biden lamented that the price of gasoline at pumps across the united states was not falling quickly enough adding if necessary extra oil could be made available for sale biden also hit out at us oil companies for spending money on buybacks of their stocks instead of investing on output oil companies can increase production by acting right now biden said the us president has somewhat pared back his administration s ambitious alternative energy agenda versus fossil fuels since the outbreak of the ukraine war which sent brent oil rallying to almost 140 a barrel at one point the additional spr release of 15 million barrels is expected to coincide with the 2 million barrels per day cut in global oil supply announced two weeks ago by producer alliance opec the cut announced by opec had initially triggered a sharp rally in crude prices bringing brent back near 100 from an eight month low of under 83 opec is led by saudi arabia with russia as its biggest ally the saudis have had a trying relationship with the united states since biden took office despite the two nations being long time strategic allies on energy and security us russia relations have also hit their lowest level in decades as biden approved sanctions against moscow over the ukraine conflict aside from trying to offset the impact of the opec production cut of 2 million barrels per day biden also appeared to be timing the announcement of the next spr before the november 8 us midterm elections in order to appease americans voters wary of high fuel prices it s a sign of how concerned traders are about the economic outlook and how serious the biden administration is about using the spr to drive prices lower ahead of the midterm elections craig erlam analyst at online trading platform oanda said it s such a huge political issue in the us and could swing the midterms one way or another with the margins in the house and the senate being so fine biden has taken much heat from rival republicans who have accused him of risking the nation s emergency oil reserves to defend his democrat party s control of the us congress and senate since november 2021 more than 200 million barrels have left the nation s emergency oil stockpile resulting in spr balances standing at their lowest since 1984 biden in response said alleviating the hardship of americans experiencing the worst inflation in 40 years contributed by high energy prices was his top priority
by tom krisher ap auto writer detroit ap tesla reported wednesday that its third quarter profit more than doubled from a year ago fueled by higher vehicle sales the austin texas electric vehicle and solar panel maker posted net income of 3 29 billion from july through september ceo elon musk said on the company s quarterly conference call that the tesla is considering a 5 billion to 10 billion stock buyback next year even if the economy stumbles and musk said tesla s full self driving feature won t be ready to be used without humans behind the wheel this year but it will be ready next year without question whatsoever in my mind excluding special items tesla made 1 05 per share beating wall street estimates of 1 per share according to data provider factset revenue rose 56 to a record 21 45 billion but fell just short of estimates averaging 21 98 billion tesla will fall short of its target of 50 annual growth in vehicle deliveries this year chief financial officer zachary kirkhorn said during the conference call but he was later contradicted by musk on the delivery side we do expect to be just under 50 growth he said blaming the shortfall to expected problems transporting vehicles at the end of the year musk later predicted 50 annual production and delivery growth but also pointed to logistical problems shipping vehicles then he reiterated the growth targets to the best of our knowledge we believe that tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50 or greater compound annual growth rate musk said qualifying his statement by adding that some years may be lower and some higher it will take a stellar fourth quarter sales performance to reach the 50 goal earlier this month tesla reported vehicle sales that rose 35 for the july september period compared to the second quarter as the company s huge factory in china got past supply chain issues and pandemic restrictions the company sold 343 830 cars and suvs in the third quarter compared with 254 695 deliveries made from april through june analysts have questioned whether tesla is experiencing waning demand for its vehicles which in the u s start around 49 000 so far this year the company has delivered 908 573 vehicles last year the company delivered just over 936 000 vehicles to increase sales by 50 over last year which would amount to about 1 4 million vehicles the company would have to sell more than 490 000 vehicles in the fourth quarter but tesla said it had higher than usual numbers of vehicles in transit at the end of the third quarter that will count as sales once they reach customers the company said it s smoothing out its delivery pace tesla said its full self driving system will be available to everyone who has ordered it by the end of this year the system is being beta tested now by 160 000 selected drivers and will still need human drivers into next year musk said we re not saying it s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel he said but he added that humans almost never have to touch controls he said the company will be able to show regulators that the system is much safer than the average human driver musk has promised a fleet of autonomous robotaxis would be in use during 2020 a deadline that has been missed for two years on the stock buyback musk said tesla s board has debated the idea and generally thinks it would make sense it s likely that we ll do some meaningful buyback he said tesla has the money to fund a buyback during the third quarter the company was sitting on 21 1 billion worth of cash and marketable securities it said musk also said he s confident tesla will meet u s government requirements so its buyers would get up to 7 500 in tax credits per vehicle the recently passed inflation reduction act includes a tax credit of up to 7 500 that could be used to defray the cost of purchasing an electric vehicle but to qualify for the full credit the ev must contain a battery built in north america with 40 of the metals mined or recycled on the continent tesla builds vehicles and makes batteries in the u s high prices for raw materials caused a hit to profits along with inefficiencies from ramping up the factories in germany and texas the company said still the company said initial deliveries of its semi truck will start in december shares in tesla inc fell 6 3 in extended trading wednesday after the company s third quarter sales missed wall street estimates the stock has lost 37 so far this year burdened by musk s 44 billion bid to buy twitter musk earlier backed out of the purchase contending that twitter misrepresented the number of fake spam bot accounts on its platform twitter sued and a delaware judge has given both sides until oct 28 to work out details otherwise there will be a trial in november musk conceded on wednesday s conference call that he and other investors are overpaying for twitter but he added that he believes the long term potential for twitter in my view is an order of magnitude greater than its current value

speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif on oct 18 brushed aside calls by a member of her caucus for new leadership the comments in question were made by rep elissa slotkin d mich who said during a tv appearance that the party needs new blood to lead it moving forward i have been very vocal including with my own leadership in the house that we need a new generation we need new blood period across the democratic party in the house the senate and the white house slotkin told nbc s meet the press i ve said i think we need new leaders i would love to see some midwestern leaders in there right that s been important to me is to reflect the middle of the country she said we re here too and i do think new blood is a good thing during a later appearance on msnbc s andrea mitchel pelosi acceded the need for some generational change but emphasized the importance of experienced leaders yes we need generational change pelosi said of course we do but in some cases there s no substitute for experience asked what she would tell members of her caucus particularly younger members agitating for a bigger role in the 118th congress pelosi replied win baby just win if that s what you have to say to win fine and we will not in any way do anything but totally supportive mobilization wise message wise money wise for those people to win their races she added younger members feel slighted slotkin is only the latest democrat to push for generational changes in leading the party forward at the end of september rep abigail spanberger d va another young relatively new face among congressional democrats made similar calls specifically spanberger blasted her party for what she called a failure of house leadership after majority leader steny hoyer d md postponed a scheduled vote on a bill that would ban stock trading by members of congress and their families the legislation was the newest iteration of a bipartisan push that has ballooned over the past year and spanberger indicated that the delay in considering the bill spoke to larger issues with the party s current leadership like slotkin spanberger called for new leaders to take over this moment marks a failure of house leadership and it s yet another example of why i believe that the democratic party needs new leaders in the halls of capitol hill as i have long made known spanberger wrote rather than bring members of congress together who are passionate about this issue leadership chose to ignore these voices push them aside and look for new ways they could string the media and the public along and evade public criticism she added it s apparent that house leadership does not have its heart in this effort because the package released earlier this week was designed to fail it was written to create confusion surrounding reform efforts and complicate a straightforward reform priority banning members of congress from buying and selling individual stocks all while creating the appearance that house leadership wanted to take action generational fractures between old guard democrats and young lawmakers who won their seats during the blue wave in 2018 have begun to emerge in the party democrats caucus includes three of the five youngest members of congress including reps alexandria ocasio cortez d n y sara jacobs d calif and ritchie torres d n y though the average age of house democrats is 59 years old according to data from fiscalnote party leadership has an average age of almost 72 years old including three octogenarians generational fractures between the party old guard and new democrats first emerged as early as 2018 when democrats extracted a pledge from pelosi that she would not serve as speaker again she later reneged on that promise being reelected speaker in the 117th congress pelosi also seems to be open to another term as house democrats leader asked by reporters if she would seek another term as speaker or minority leader pelosi refused to commit to her past promise to step down on the other hand slotkin and spanberger are not the only democrats to call for a changing of the guard among leadership reps angie craig d minn and dean phillips d minn are among the few in their caucus who have gone as far as calling for a new generation of democrats to take over from president joe biden and other current leaders calls to this end have grown gradually as younger democrats have found their footing in congress however it remains unclear how many in the party share the sentiment in preparation for a tough midterm battle most democrats have striven to avoid the appearance of disunity but after the election particularly if as observers expect republicans take back control of the lower chamber power struggles among aging leaders and ambitious young lawmakers could burst into the open
