three decades get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters in the past week stocks sold off on worries about the omicron variant and concerns the federal reserve will move away from its easy policies and raise interest rates sooner than anticipated fed chairman jerome powell told a congressional panel tuesday that the central bank will consider speeding up the taper of its 120 billion monthly bond buying program when it meets dec 14 and 15 the federal reserve put its bond purchasing program in place in early 2020 to prop up the economy during the pandemic it s going to be a somewhat turbulent december because we probably need to wait for earnings season to get regrounded back to fundamentals said jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset for as high as a lot of the ratios would suggest price to sales price to earnings when you throw it into the hopper with interest rates and everything else things aren t that bad i don t think we re teetering on the edge of a cliff but ablin did say the comments from powell were unnerving investors who fear the fed will also speed up interest rate hikes powell acknowledged he was wrong about inflation being transitory or temporary spooking investors the bond purchases are now scheduled to end in june i m not sure what investors read on inflation is do they think the fed is going to raise rates get ahead of it too early and everything is going to roll over ever since powell took transitory out of his talk investors have been somewhat off balance said

12 7 for the week most of the growth names in the fund plunged into bear market territory i think investors have to keep in mind that s not a 15 week strategy it s a 15 year strategy as far as we re concerned ablin said for the week the small cap russell 2000 was down nearly 4 while the s p 500 was off just 1 2 the worst performing major sector for the week was communications services which includes internet companies it was down 2 8 followed by consumer discretionary off 2 4 financials lost nearly 2 and the s p technology sector was down 0 4 for the week but on friday tech lost 1 7 the federal reserve should be quiet in the week ahead fed officials traditionally do not make major speeches in the blackout period which is the coming week ahead of their dec 14 and 15 meeting one exception is minneapolis fed president neel kashkari who speaks thursday at the center for indian country development research summit much of the focus will be on how the market itself is performing ever since the nov 22 outside bearish day all strength has been sold with lots of damage underneath the hood said scott redler of t3live com now finally some of the leadership names are showing faulty action he noted that both microsoft and apple were weaker money is not hiding in amazon google or facebook they haven t been special for weeks he said the s p closed below its 50 day moving average friday after closing below it wednesday the 50 day is at 4 544 that s a signal to some market technicians that the index is on the verge of breaking down the 50 day moving average is the average closing price over the past 50 days and is viewed as a momentum indicator basically it s effectively a retest of support because we had the relief rally said katie stockton founder of fairlead strategies she said the s p 500 needs to close below the 50 day for two consecutive days before the move is considered a breakdown the action in the high growth high multiple names is not a good sign

us federal reserve to discuss speeding up tapering this december uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus omicron variant is slowly receding eur usd is at risk of falling further as long as it holds below 1 1380 the eur usd pair corrected oversold conditions and traded as high as 1 1382 but could not retain its gains and is ending the week pretty much unchanged around 1 1300 the american dollar stands as the overall winner heading into the weekend notably stronger against its high yielding rivals but also higher vs the safe haven gold covid related concerns and powell market participants had to deal with loads of noise these last few days which flooded financial markets with risk off waves the first round of concerns was triggered by a newly discovered coronavirus variant named omicron south africa reported it on november 25 and global panic resulted in border closures and restrictive measures as time went by however authorities acknowledged that omicron had been circulating in western europe before the strain was identified fears that the new variant may slow economic progress sent equities sharply lower although there is a light of hope omicron seems more contagious but less aggressive as cases reported so far are mild jp morgan said the variant might be the end of the pandemic as the virus seems to be following the historical evolution pattern towards an endemic illness omicron could be a catalyst for steepening not flattening the yield curve rotation from growth to value the strategists said additionally experts believe that vaccines will still offer protection against severe cases and death the who remains cautious as there are a lot of unknowns surrounding the new strain with a clearer picture expected by mid december us federal reserve chair jerome powell and treasury secretary janet yellen meanwhile testified on the cares act before the senate powell noted that inflation had spread more broadly and that the risk of persistent inflation has risen he added that it s time to remove the term transitory to describe price pressures and the fed would discuss speeding up tapering in their december meeting to counter inflation covid related concerns and powell s testimony sent wall street nose diving and helped the greenback to retain its strength inflation and employment in the eye of the storm european data has kept reflecting the union s struggle to return to a path of growth as inflation keeps rallying to record levels according to preliminary estimates the german consumer price index reached a record of 6 yoy in november the figure only confirmed what market participants already knew as eu inflation stands at a multi year high and while the us federal reserve has finally shown signs of real concern the european central bank maintains its wait and see stand on thursday european policymaker fabio panetta said that inflation and the new pandemic wave is endangering the union s recovery at an early stage although earlier this week he noted that there s no need to tighten monetary policy to control inflation driven by temporary factors on friday the us published the nonfarm payrolls report which showed that the country added just 210 000 new jobs in november much worse than anticipated the unemployment rate contracted to 4 2 better than the 4 5 expected while the participation rate jumped to 61 8 the report put mild pressure on the greenback heading into the weekly close but the impact was quite limited the us is still 4 million jobs short of pre pandemic levels the second week of december will bring updates on already published data which means the macroeconomic calendar will likely have a limited impact on price action this could be even more the case considering the upcoming central bank decisions just before the winter holidays the eu will publish the final reading of q3 gross domestic product while germany will release the december zew survey on economic sentiment and november final inflation figures the us will also publish the november consumer price index which is expected to be downwardly revised to 5 8 yoy from 6 2 eur usd technical outlook the eur usd pair posted a lower low and a lower high during the week retreating from the 38 2 retracement of the 1 1691 1 1185 slide at 1 1380 a break above the latter could confirm an interim bottom and hint at further gains ahead although that s not the case at this stage the pair is hovering around the 23 6 retracement of the mentioned decline while technical readings in the weekly chart hint at persistent bearish strength eur usd is developing below all of its moving averages with the 20 sma heading firmly lower and about to cross below the 100 sma for the first time since august 2020 at the same time the momentum indicator heads south within negative levels as the rsi indicator consolidates around 30 the daily chart shows that bears retain control of the pair which has steadily retreated from a sharply bearish 20 sma the momentum indicator has extended its advance within negative levels but remains below its midline while the rsi indicator is flat at around 41 reflecting the absence of buying interest overall the pair is poised to extend its slump with a possible target at around 1 1160 a strong static support area a break below 1 1270 should open the door for such a decline the main resistance is 1 1380 the mentioned fibonacci resistance level followed by a long term static one at 1 1470 eur usd sentiment poll according to the fxstreet forecast poll eur usd is set to fall further in the near term as it is seen down by 47 of the polled experts on a weekly basis down to 1 1246 on average bulls become a majority in the monthly and quarterly views with the pair seen then above the 1 13 but below 1 14 the overview chart shows that moving averages maintain their bearish slopes despite the average higher targets the firmer bearish stance is the quarterly one with most targets accumulating

suggesting symptoms are less severe noted senior market analyst craig erlam at forex firm oanda higher levels of transmission are a worry but ultimately it will come down to the effectiveness of vaccines which is the overriding concern currently heading into the weekend when we could get more information on the new strain it s natural that we re seeing more caution a slew of negative data

a week of volatile swings on wall street ended friday with more losses for stocks as a mixed batch of u s job market data triggered another bout of dizzying trading the standard poor s 500 closed 0 8 lower after erasing a 0 7 gain in the early going the benchmark index was coming off a jolting stretch where it swerved by at least 1 2 in five straight days pounded by uncertainty about how badly the newest coronavirus variant will hit the economy and about when the federal reserve will halt its immense support for financial markets the dow jones industrial average slipped 0 2 and the nasdaq composite lost 1 9 the russell 2000 index of company stocks slumped 2 1 all the indexes also posted a weekly loss advertisement treasury yields fell rose and then fell again as investors struggled to square what the jobs report means the federal reserve will do on interest rates the erratic movements fit right in with a week where the s p 500 swung from a 1 9 gain to a 1 2 loss in one day we got some mixed messages on the data from the jobs report and that can make for some messy markets said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments the report which is usually the most anticipated economic data by wall street each month showed employers added only 210 000 jobs last month it was a disappointing result when economists were expecting much stronger hiring of 530 000 and it raised worries the economy may stagnate while inflation remains high that s a worst case scenario called stagflation by economists and the omicron variant s arrival makes its likelihood more uncertain but other areas of the jobs report showed better strength more people are coming back to the workforce and the unemployment rate improved to 4 2 from 4 6 those encouraging numbers helped treasury yields briefly climb during the morning but they also came from a section of the jobs report that usually takes a back seat in investors eyes to the jobs growth figure that s because they come from different surveys one of employers and the other of households and many investors see the job growth numbers as the more reliable ones historically today s non farm payroll report looks messy to me said jamie cox managing partner for harris financial group best to wait for the revisions next month before sounding the stagflation alarm too loudly advertisement some investors said the jobs report could ultimately push the fed to get more aggressive about raising short term interest rates off their record low others though said they expected the mixed report to have no effect and the wide differences in opinion helped lead to the day s sharp swings in the market what the fed decides is a huge deal for stocks because low interest rates have been one of the main reasons the s p 500 has roughly doubled since the early days of the pandemic low rates encourage borrowers to spend more and investors to pay higher prices for stocks the fed has already begun slowing or tapering its program to buy billions of dollars of bonds each month to support the economy and markets chairman jerome h powell jolted markets earlier this week when he said the fed could wrap up its bond buying program months before the june target it had been on pace for that would open the door for the fed to make the more impactful decision of raising short term rates with the headlines on omicron and then figuring out if a faster taper also means a sooner hike and investors worrying if the fed is going to make a mistake it s to be expected we re going to see some of this volatility said allspring global investments jacobsen consider the yield on the two year treasury which is heavily influenced by investors expectations for upcoming fed actions it fell then recovered briefly only to slide to 0 59 that s down from 0 63 late thursday the 10 year treasury yield which moves more on investors expectations for upcoming economic growth and inflation was likewise unsteady it zig zagged immediately after the jobs report s release and fell to 1 36 by late afternoon down from 1 44 thursday evening advertisement about 60 of the stocks in the s p 500 fell with some of wall street s biggest recent stars offering the heaviest weights microsoft fell 2 nvidia slid 4 5 and tesla dropped 6 4 they were part of a turnaround for high growth companies that earlier had led the

commission has moved to require that u s listed foreign stocks such as didi s disclose their ownership structures and audit reports which could lead to some of them being delisted advertisement markets around the world have swung through the week as investors struggle to handicap how much damage the newest coronavirus variant will ultimately do to the economy with few concrete answers about omicron investors have been groping and sending markets back and forth as minor clues dribble out still to be determined are whether current vaccines are effective against the variant whether people will be scared away from businesses because of it and whether already high inflation will worsen due to it associated press writer elaine kurtenbach contributed to this report

supplies domestic crushers should be the main customer this month canola on the ice futures platform hit fresh highs in many contract months during the last full week of november but showed signs of stalling out near the top with the thanksgiving holiday in the united states leading to some volatility and thin volumes while the underlying reality of tight supplies and the need to ration demand remained supportive that story has been propping up the market for some time now and bullish speculators will need fresh news to keep the trend pointed up especially as canola looks overpriced at these unprecedented price levels flood damage in british columbia hampered rail movement to the west coast during the week but there were already large supplies of canola in storage in vancouver and weekly export movement was solid in the latest canadian grain commission data that said total exports continue to run well off the previous year s pace with the domestic crush expected to be the main customer for what little canola is available this year agriculture and agri food canada released updated supply demand tables lowering its forecast for total canola exports in 2021 22 by a million tonnes to 5 5 million meanwhile the government agency raised its domestic usage estimate by the same amount to 8 7 million which would leave projected ending stocks at only 500 000 tonnes statistics canada releases the results of its production survey on dec 3 providing the first on the ground reading of this year s yields after previous reports relied on satellite imagery anecdotal reports would place canola production below the already low level of 12 8 million tonnes forecast in september which will lead to subsequent adjustments in the supply demand balance sheet the soybean harvest in the united states has wrapped up while farmers in south america are busy planting their next crop if any weather issues materialize in brazil or argentina during the growing season that could be the spark north american futures need to stage another move higher however good conditions and yield projections could just as easily provide the catalyst for a sell off time will tell on that front more pressing in the near term may be bigger swings in global financial and energy markets in response to ever shifting developments on the pandemic front a new covid 19 variant emerging in south africa sent a shock to world markets on nov 26 sending crude oil and stock markets down sharply on concerns that the new vaccine resistant variant would slow economic recovery efforts the energy linked canadian dollar was weaker as well which likely tempered the movement in the canola market throughout the pandemic the adage that people still need to eat has generally propped up the agriculture sector but again time will tell what the latest news will mean for grains and oilseeds in the long term advertisement

washington reuters u s employment growth slowed considerably in november amid job losses at retailers and in local government education but the unemployment rate plunged to a 21 month low of 4 2 suggesting the labor market was rapidly tightening the four tenths of a percentage point drop in the jobless rate from october reported by the labor department in its closely watched employment report on friday occurred even as 594 000 people entered the labor force the most in 13 months workers put in more hours boosting aggregate wages which should help to underpin consumer spending don t be

hospitality sector added only 23 000 jobs compared to 170 000 in the previous month professional and business services payrolls increased by 90 000 jobs there were also solid gains in transportation and warehousing as well as in construction manufacturing employment increased by 31 000 jobs november s modest job growth did little to temper expectations that the economy was poised for stronger growth this quarter after hitting a speed bump in the third quarter a measure of services sector activity scaled a fresh record high in november consumer spending and manufacturing activity have been strong spending should remain supported by rising wages as companies scramble for scarce workers average hourly earnings increased 0 3 keeping the annual increase in wages at 4 8 the average workweek climbed to 34 8 hours from 34 7 as a result of the longer workweek aggregate wages rose 0 7 but the spread of the new highly contagious omicron variant of covid 19 poses a risk to the brightening picture while little is known about the impact of omicron some slowdown in hiring and demand for services is likely based on the experience with the delta variant which was responsible for the slowest economic growth pace in more than a year last quarter while labor supply remains tight there are signs that some of the millions of americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic induced recession are wading back into the labor force the smaller survey of households from which the unemployment rate is derived showed the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one was 61 8 that was the highest level since march 2020 and was up from 61 6 in october the workforce remains 2 4 million below it pre pandemic level labor market participation if more people are starting to look for work again this would allow for stronger near term hiring said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial in pittsburgh pennsylvania the household survey also showed a rise of 1 136 million in the number of people employed the employment to population ratio viewed as a measure of an economy s ability to create jobs jumped to 59 2 also

keytruda is the first anti pd 1 l1 therapy to show recurrence free survival benefit in the adjuvant setting for stage iib and iic melanoma keytruda is now approved as adjuvant treatment for patients 12 years of age with completely resected melanoma across stage iib stage iic and stage iii disease kenilworth n j business wire mrk mrk merck nyse mrk known as msd outside the united states and canada today announced that the u s food and drug administration fda has approved keytruda merck s anti pd 1 therapy for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric 12 years and older patients with stage iib or iic melanoma following complete resection additionally the fda expanded the indication for keytruda as adjuvant treatment for stage iii melanoma following complete resection to include pediatric patients 12 years and older the approval in stage iib and iic melanoma is based on data from the first interim analysis of the phase 3 keynote 716 trial in which keytruda showed a statistically significant improvement in recurrence free survival rfs reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 35 hr 0 65 p 0 0132 compared to placebo median rfs was not reached for either group after a median follow up of 14 4 months 11 n 54 487 of patients who received keytruda had recurrence or died compared to 17 n 82 489 of patients who received placebo efficacy in pediatric patients 12 years and older with stage iib iic and iii melanoma is supported by extrapolation of efficacy data from adults given similar biology pharmacology of drug effect as well as similar exposure response for efficacy and safety immune mediated adverse reactions which may be severe or fatal can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously immune mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time during or after treatment with keytruda including pneumonitis colitis hepatitis endocrinopathies nephritis dermatologic reactions solid organ transplant rejection and complications of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation important immune mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune mediated adverse reactions early identification and management of immune mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of keytruda based on the severity of the adverse reaction keytruda should be withheld or permanently discontinued and corticosteroids administered if appropriate keytruda can also cause severe or life threatening infusion related reactions based on its mechanism of action keytruda can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman for more information see selected important safety information below the standard of care for patients with resected stage iib and iic melanoma has been observation despite the fact that for these patients the risk of recurrence is nearly the same as for patients with later stage disease for whom treatment is recommended said dr jason luke director cancer immunotherapeutics center at upmc hillman cancer center today s approval of pembrolizumab for the adjuvant treatment of patients 12 years and older with stage iib and iic melanoma following complete resection is an important advance that provides these patients with a new option that can help reduce the risk of their cancer returning keytruda was the first anti pd 1 therapy to be approved in metastatic melanoma in the u s seven years ago since then we have built on this foundation in melanoma and have expanded the use of keytruda into earlier stages of this disease said dr scot ebbinghaus vice president clinical research merck research laboratories with today s approval we can now offer healthcare providers and patients 12 years and older the opportunity to help prevent melanoma recurrence with keytruda across resected stage iib stage iic and stage iii melanoma study design and additional data from keynote 716 keynote 716 clinicaltrials gov nct03553836 is a multicenter randomized 1 1 double blind placebo controlled phase 3 trial that enrolled 976 patients with completely resected stage iib or iic melanoma patients were randomized to keytruda 200 mg or the pediatric 12 years old dose of keytruda 2 mg kg intravenously up to a maximum of 200 mg every three weeks or placebo for up to one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity randomization was stratified by ajcc eighth edition t stage 2 0 4 0 mm with ulceration vs 4 0 mm without ulceration vs 4 0 mm with ulceration patients must not have been previously treated for melanoma beyond complete surgical resection for their melanoma prior to study entry the main efficacy outcome measure was investigator assessed rfs defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence or death whichever occurred first new primary melanomas were excluded from the definition of rfs patients underwent imaging every six months for one year from randomization every six months from years two to four and then once in year five from randomization or until recurrence whichever came first adverse reactions occurring in patients with stage iib or iic melanoma were similar to those occurring in 1 011 patients with stage iii melanoma from keynote 054 or the 2 799 patients with melanoma or nsclc treated with keytruda as a single agent for more information see selected important safety information below about merck in melanoma melanoma the most serious form of skin cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment producing cells the rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades with nearly 325 000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2020 in the u s skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths it is estimated there will be more than 106 000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and more than 7 000 deaths resulting from the disease in the u s in 2021 the recurrence rates for resected melanoma are estimated to be 32 46 for patients with stage iib and stage iic disease and 39 74 for patients with stage iii disease the five year survival rates ajcc eighth edition are estimated to be 87 for stage iib 82 for stage iic 93 for stage iiia 83 for stage iiib 69 for stage iiic and 32 for stage iiid merck is committed to delivering meaningful advances for patients with melanoma with keytruda and to continuing research in skin cancers through a broad clinical development program keytruda has been established as an important treatment option for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with resected stage iii melanoma and is approved in over 90 countries based on the results from eortc1325 keynote 054 keytruda is also approved in over 90 countries for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma about merck s early stage cancer clinical program finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long term survival many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease building on the strong understanding of the role of keytruda in later stage cancers merck is studying keytruda in earlier disease states with approximately 20 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer about keytruda

nasdaq abcl today announced the u s food and drug administration fda has expanded the emergency use authorization eua for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together to include pediatric patients under the age of 12 including neonates infants 1 year old the eua allows for bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together in the treatment of mild to moderate covid 19 as well as post exposure prophylaxis in certain patients the expanded eua is based on data from the blaze 1 phase 2 3 clinical trial studying bamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together for the treatment of pediatric and infant patients with mild to moderate covid 19 and who are at high risk for severe disease progression the median time to complete symptom resolution as recorded in a trial specific daily symptom diary was 7 days for subjects treated with bamlanivimab 700 mg and etesevimab 1 400 mg and 5 days for subjects treated with weight based dosing of bamlanivimab and etesevimab no subject died or required hospitalization due to covid 19 pseudovirus and authentic virus studies conducted by abcellera s partner eli lilly and company lilly demonstrate that bamlanivimab and etesevimab

by the u s food and drug administration fda bamlanivimab alone and together with other antibodies has treated hundreds of thousands of patients preventing covid 19 related hospitalizations and death abcellera s ongoing efforts to respond to the covid 19 pandemic have identified thousands of unique anti sars cov 2 human antibodies these include bamlanivimab bebtelovimab and other antibodies that are in various stages of testing by abcellera and its partners abcellera s pandemic response capabilities were developed over the past three years as part of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa pandemic prevention platform p3 program the goal of the p3 program is to establish a robust technology platform for pandemic response capable of developing field ready medical countermeasures within 60 days of isolation of an unknown viral pathogen about bamlanivimab bamlanivimab is a recombinant neutralizing human igg1 monoclonal antibody mab directed against the spike protein of sars cov 2 it is designed to block viral attachment and entry into human cells thus neutralizing the virus bamlanivimab was developed from an antibody that was discovered from the blood of a recovered covid 19 patient using abcellera s pandemic response platform in partnership with the vaccine research center vrc at the national institutes for allergy and infectious diseases niaid within one week of receiving the sample abcellera screened over five million antibody producing cells to identify and isolate approximately 500 unique antibodies that bind to sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 the binding antibodies were then tested by abcellera the vrc and lilly to find those most effective in neutralizing the virus bamlanivimab was selected as the lead candidate from this group of antibodies and was both the first therapeutic candidate specifically developed against sars cov 2 to enter human clinical trials in north america and to receive eua from the fda bamlanivimab

republican glenn youngkin s wealth helped catapult him from political nobody to virginia s executive mansion investing 20 million of his own money into his campaign it was a drop in the bucket of a fortune valued over 450 million with his financial holdings eclipsing the annual budgets of several state agencies he ll soon manage the money now poses potential conflicts of interest as youngkin prepares to be sworn in as governor with only some of his holdings in a blind trust and while the businessman has complied with state disclosure laws he has declined to hand over tax returns that would paint a fuller picture of his wealth youngkin will inherit a state government with some of the laxest ethics rules in the country according to one ranking with promised reforms making little headway under generations of democratic and republican leaders youngkin put some of his holdings into a blind trust after winning the republican nomination in may an arrangement also used by several of his predecessors in the executive mansion the blind trust includes his holdings in carlyle group where he served as co ceo an august 2020 federal filing showed youngkin owned over eight million shares in the stock a holding that if youngkin kept is now valued at more than 459 million they have been entirely removed from my knowledge and control youngkin wrote on a disclosure form signed in june macaulay porter a transition aide said a professional asset manager would be in charge of the trust but declined to name them youngkin has also pledged to donate all of his 175 000 annual salary to unspecified charities dozens of youngkin s stocks bonds and mutual funds will remain outside of the trust those assets include hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars in stocks of companies that do business in virginia including anthem cigna corp citigroup cvs healthcare corp comcast general mills microsoft pnc financial services group procter gamble target teladoc health verizon visa and richmond based carmax inc among others youngkin also holds millions of dollars in bonds issued by virginia based public authorities ranging from the riverside virginia regional jail authority to the loudoun county economic development authority the exact amount of holdings remains unclear because virginia s disclosure forms provide ranges rather than precise dollar amounts youngkin has not provided more detailed information or responded to calls to release his tax returns both youngkin and democrat terry mcauliffe backed off promises to the associated press to share summaries of their tax returns during the campaign after his nov 2 general election win youngkin s campaign provided a spreadsheet to the washington post showing he made 127 million over five years and gave away over 52 million to charity the post was not able to verify the figures and porter declined to show vpm the same information delaney marsco senior legal counsel for ethics at the campaign legal center said a truly blind trust is one in which politicians divest their wealth from their current portfolio the money is then either put in savings accounts or exchange traded funds that contain a broad spectrum of assets the easiest way for us to avoid a conflict of interest is just to not have those conflict producing assets in the first place marsco said marsco said the issue became apparent at the federal level in the early stages of the covid 19 pandemic when several members of congress bought and sold stock after receiving classified briefings a report from clc found 12 senators and 37 house members purchased or sold stocks from feb 2 to april 8 2020 u s sen richard burr r north carolina remains under investigation by the securities and exchange commission for insider trading no similar data exists in virginia because state lawmakers and other officials are not required to disclose when they buy or sell stocks or recuse themselves from votes involving their holdings youngkin is not the first wealthy governor to use a blind trust democrat mark warner who entered the executive mansion with his own unprecedented wealth in 2002 took the same step neither of his successors democrat tim kaine and republican bob mcdonnell used a trust former gov terry mcauliffe sold his assets of greentech automotive a firm he co founded that faced federal investigation and a lawsuit from chinese investors after winning office in 2013 he also moved his sizable assets into a blind trust as a state senator gov ralph northam took votes related to dominion energy while also holding the company s stock the stock became an issue on the campaign trail and the democrat ultimately put all his assets in a blind trust the commonwealth s ethics laws are among the loosest in the country according to a ranking last year by the coalition for integrity the issue has largely faded after mcdonnell faced federal corruption charges for accepting expensive gifts from a richmond businessman seeking favors from the state his two year prison sentence was later overturned by the u s supreme court and mcdonnell now sits on youngkin s transition team in the wake of the scandal lawmakers adopted a few piecemeal changes including capping gifts from lobbyists at 100 and the creation of an ethics council that council does not speak to the public or press or investigate wrongdoing shruti shah president of the coalition urged action in the face of waning trust in government i think the perception is that people in government don t act for the interests of the constituents shah said and one way to change that is to enact strong ethics rules strong campaign finance rules and focus on implementing them

by sarah anderson brian wakamo the build back better agenda under negotiation in congress includes sweeping public investments to make our economy more equitable sustainable and resilient in the face of future crises another major potential benefit several tax reforms on the table to help pay for the plan would also reduce economic inequality and curb harmful corporate behavior here we highlight corporate tax proposals in play on capitol hill that are designed to discourage corporate tax dodging and offshoring excessive ceo pay and wasteful stock buybacks corporate tax dodging and offshoring for decades large corporations have pitted countries against each other to drive their own tax bills lower and lower this has put an enormous strain on public budgets for education health care and other vital investments in the united states the percentage of total federal revenue from corporate tax receipts dropped from 32 1 percent in 1952 to 6 6 percent in 2019 according to the office of management and budget the biden administration has just forged a deal with more than 130 governments aimed at ending this global race to the bottom each of these governments has agreed to charge large corporations a global minimum tax on profits of at least 15 percent through rampant abuse of tax havens and other loopholes many u s corporations have gotten away with paying a much lower effective tax rate the effective rate is what corporations actually pay while the statutory rate is what they owe before accounting for tax breaks and credits one government survey found that u s based multinationals paid an average u s tax rate of just 7 8 percent in 2018 the institute on taxation and economic policy found that 55 large profitable u s corporations actually paid zero in federal income taxes last year don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the new corporate minimum tax would generate u s revenue of an estimated 148 billion over a decade this would go a long way towards covering the costs of vital investments in the build back better agenda for example it is more than enough to pay for universal free community college and more than twice as much as the cost of building affordable accessible housing for more than 300 000 families democratic lawmakers are also considering closing various other loopholes that have encouraged use of offshore tax havens the house ways and means committee has proposed other international tax reforms that would raise more than 300 billion over 10 years while president joe biden s more comprehensive plan would raise as much as 1 trillion corporate tax rate increase in addition to reforms aimed at reducing offshore tax dodging democratic lawmakers are planning to increase the statutory rate on domestic profits to ensure big companies pay their fair share republicans slashed that rate in 2017 from 35 percent to 21 percent a move that will cost the country 750 billion over a decade if left unchanged views among democrats differ on the ideal rate increase president biden is proposing a hike to 28 percent while senator joe manchin has called for a rate of no higher than 25 percent citing concerns about driving corporate activity to lower tax countries these concerns while always overblown are now even less of an issue thanks to the global minimum tax agreement as negotiations continue hundreds of billions of dollars in vital build back better investment funds are hanging in the balance the white house proposal would raise 858 billion over a decade more than twice as much as the 400 billion expected from the manchin plan the revenue gap between those two proposals would be more than enough to fully fund president biden s proposed 400 billion investment to eliminate the waiting list for affordable home care and create good jobs with benefits for care workers the house ways and means committee has proposed a 26 5 percent rate that could generate an estimated 540 billion excessive ceo pay corporate lobbyists have long pushed the false claim that lower corporate taxes are guaranteed to be a boon for u s workers in reality big companies have plowed tax cut windfalls into the pockets of executives and wealthy shareholders rather than boosting wages according to the office of management and budget and the economic policy institute when corporate tax receipts made up 21 8 percent of all federal revenue in 1965 the average ratio between ceo and median worker pay was 21 to 1 after the republican tax cuts corporate tax receipts fell to just 6 6 percent of federal revenue in 2019 while the average pay ratio rose to 320 to 1 senate finance committee chair ron wyden s list of revenue options includes an excise tax that would encourage companies to share their wealth by penalizing firms with big gaps between ceo and worker pay while details of the wyden plan are not public the proposal is no doubt inspired by the tax excessive ceo pay act which would apply graduated corporate tax rate increases based on the pay ratio between a company s highest paid executive and median worker senate budget chair bernie sanders has championed that bill which also enjoys support from the afl cio the center for american progress and numerous other organizations and academics don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free stock buybacks wyden also aims to use tax policy to rein in another controversial corporate activity stock buybacks he and senator sherrod brown recently unveiled the stock buyback accountability act which would impose a 2 percent excise tax on stock repurchases and raise an estimated 100 billion over 10 years as professor william lazonick and other analysts have long documented stock buybacks artificially inflate executives stock based pay and siphon off capital that could be used to raise worker wages or make other productive investments in the first year after the 2017 republican tax cuts s p 500 firms spent a record 806 billion buying back their own stock while buyback spending dropped in the initial phase of the pandemic crisis it is now rebounding to near record levels according to standard and poor s s p 500 firms blew nearly 200 billion on stock buybacks in the second quarter of this year wealthy americans reap the vast bulk of financial gains from these stock buybacks and corporate tax cuts because of their disproportionate ownership of corporate stock federal reserve data indicate that the richest 1 percent hold more than half of all stocks and mutual funds while the bottom 90 percent of americans own just 11 percent the disparities in stock ownership are even starker if race is factored in while 61 percent of white families owned at least some stock in 2019 only 34 percent of black and 24 percent of latino families did according to the federal reserve the build back better negotiations are a huge opportunity to secure health education and infrastructure investments that will make a real difference in american lives these negotiations also create an opening for long overdue tax reforms with enough public pressure we can ensure the wealthy and large corporations pay

nevada court sides with gunmakers in las vegas shooting lawsuit carson city nevada s supreme court ruled gun manufacturers cannot be held responsible for the deaths in the 2017 mass shooting on the las vegas strip because a state law shields them from liability unless the weapon malfunctions the parents of a woman who was among the 60 people killed in the shooting at packed music festival filed a wrongful death suit against colt manufacturing co and several other gun manufacturers in july 2019 the suit said the gun companies knowingly manufactured and sold weapons designed to shoot automatically because they were aware their ar 15s could be easily modified with bump stocks to do so thereby violating federal and state machine gun prohibitions stephen paddock used an ar 15 with a bump stock when he fired 1 049 rounds in just 10 minutes on the crowd of 22 000 people from his suite in a casino resort tower before he killed himself fifty eight people were killed at the site or died in hospitals and hundreds more were wounded including two people who died in the years after of complications from their injuries nevada s supreme court largely sided thursday with the manufacturers argument that nevada law immunizes them from civil actions with the only exception for products liability actions involving design or production defects that cause the firearm to malfunction we hold that state law provides the gun companies immunity from the wrongful death and negligence per se claims asserted against them under nevada law in this case justice kristina pickering wrote in the unanimous decision the lawsuit filed by carrie parsons parents james and ann marie parsons of seattle alleged the manufacturers showed a reckless lack of regard for public safety by advertising the firearms as military weapons and signaling the weapon s ability to be simply modified it said there are dozens of videos online showing people how to install bump stocks it was only a question of when not if a gunman would take advantage of the ease of modifying ar 15s to fire automatically in order to substantially increase the body count the lawsuit said pickering said the lawsuit was based on a claim of fault beyond a firearm s inherent ability to cause harm that is the gun companies manufacture and distribution of illegal machine guns but she said in the 20 page ruling the state law doesn t limit the manufacturer s immunity specifically to legal firearms she said it states that no civil action is permitted in such cases against the maker of any firearm or ammunition we in no way underestimate the profound public policy issues presented or the horrific tragedy the route 91 harvest festival mass shooting inflicted she wrote while noting that the law as written did not allow the parsons to make a claim against the manufacturers if civil liability is to be imposed against firearm manufacturers and distributors in the position of the gun companies in this case that decision is for the legislature not this court she wrote we urge the legislature to act if it did not mean to provide immunity in situations like this one back to top
