there are many demands on a producer and just as no single day presents the same challenges there is no single path to becoming a producer growing up on the palos verdes peninsula siena oberman thought she might want to be a doctor then she took a high school elective that allowed her to go off campus i thought oh sweet i can leave class and go to the beach she said instead she fell in love the class was in filmmaking and oberman started making movies with her friends using a flip camera no beach bum but in fact an overachiever oberman quickly assembled a resume of internships more varied than most careers im global an international sales firm route one entertainment an indie film company plan b brad pitt s production company paramount pictures united talent agency in her sophomore year at loyola marymount university she wrangled a meeting with a senior executive at warner bros he told me if i wanted to be successful i need to get really good at one thing she remembers that one thing was making movies happen producing advertisement oberman transferred to usc and began taking her small movies to film festivals from outfest to cannes and going to every networking event i could she says i realized that if you can bring an actor or money or a big director if you could make certain connections then you could get involved in projects by bringing value to them by age 26 oberman had 13 producer credits to her name including four as lead producer when i watched her in 2019 on the set of the fourth the birthday cake an indie mob picture set in brooklyn that was released this month she was nimbly juggling a dozen tasks at once including a balky financier in south america a set overcrowded with hangers on and val kilmer s personal documentary crew an unexpected delay in paul sorvino s arrival conked out wi fi and a crew member who wasn t up to the job i asked her if this was a typical day on set she said there was no typical day for me the priority is what s the biggest emergency just as there is no typical day in a producer s life there is no typical path to becoming one it isn t something kids tend to dream of doing when they grow up in part because it s hard for even many grown ups to get a handle on what it is check out any movie s closing credits and you ll see a long list of people called producers it s the only title anyone can just decide to join said lynda obst a producer and the author of the industry memoir hello he lied but some of us have to stay and make the movie many credited producers are simply financiers

festival says that if there are common themes among those who gravitate toward producing it s like i was the person who put parties together or when the kids on the block played kickball i would organize it it s someone who knows how to build teams a left brain right brain thinker in most of the stories producers tell about their origins there comes a point where the artistic impulse melds with an analytical mind set even while on set oberman spent as much time going over numbers forms for tax breaks financing contracts cash flow calendars as she did ensuring that the cinematographer got enough wide shots to give them options in the editing room producers are as likely to come from majors like economics as they are to emerge from english departments some move over from careers in finance or law even the artiest indie producers have to deal in spreadsheets christine vachon legendary for producing some of the most daring films of the late 90s and early aughts boys don t cry far from heaven velvet goldmine wrote an indie producing bible shoot to kill which included plenty of wild anecdotes and aesthetic mantras but also an itemized 30 page production budget a nurturer jordan horowitz one of the producers of la la land recalls trying a new tactic once while prepping for industry meetings i remember making a chart of what everybody s priorities were he says actor executive whoever to see how my priority could intersect with everyone s priority an actor wanted the best part an executive a safe bet a director the fulfillment of a perfect vision and it was so interesting to see that for the producer it was the project the project was never anyone else s first priority advertisement how do you get started about this article this article has been adapted from becoming a film producer copyright 2021 by boris kachka reprinted by permission of simon schuster inc all rights reserved more on hollywood careers unlike such specific pursuits as acting or costume design production has relatively few academic tracks though there are producing programs or entry level prerequisites that said many producers share the same path as others in the industry starting at the bottom as an assistant and making connections on the way up film school an obvious first step with usc being the gold standard though it bears remembering that steven spielberg was rejected by usc went to cal state long beach and did just fine film school is a natural hub for the brightest and most passionate budding filmmakers in other words a great place to meet your future collaborators industry assistant work hollywood runs on assistants and the next generation of power brokers get their training in these trenches most common is a position in one of the big talent agencies that dominate hollywood united talent agency creative artists agency icm partners and william morris endeavor it s the easiest place to get your foot in the door there s plenty of turnover and demand variously called boot camp or grad school by insiders it s both a grueling gantlet subject as recently documented to low pay and occasionally abusive behavior and a huge learning experience agencies are factories of information and assistants learn everything in part because their job is to listen in on every call they hear how everyone works agents producers executives directors and actors and can figure out pretty quickly which one of those corners of the industry they d want to work in production office jobs for would be producers there are also lower level jobs in production companies you can be a production assistant p a helping out on set before moving up to the next stage perhaps development meeting with agents and finding scripts and writers an assistant might eventually score an associate producer credit from there you might become a production executive keeping the office running before becoming a partner or striking out on your own advertisement what are the career paths lai remembers sitting in on a movie when an actor walked by and asked what it was she did all day a fellow producer cut in it s like we re pilots we have to put everyone on the plane we have to get everyone safely off the ground we have to get to 20 000 feet and our job is basically not to crash while you guys do the work there are two ways to get the plane off the ground essentially two ways to be a producer studio backed films in the old days most producers worked for studios which took care of financing and expenses nowadays there are still producers on the lot like obst at sony but they are semi autonomous and can take rejected projects elsewhere still others have first look deals with one or more studios streamers or networks that might cover some of their overhead even in the absence of such a deal an independent producer would usually prefer to line up a studio before the actual filming begins if that happens the producer gets her fee or percentage and it s smooth sailing with the huge caveat that the studio is ultimately calling the shots television is so huge now that you can find these lanes where if you re in the right place at the right time you can get something really interesting done michael london independent films for movies without a star or clear genre potential a pre production studio deal might not be in the cards in order to make an independent movie the producer must cobble together financiers to pay up front costs advertisement these are investors not benefactors their money securely backed by foreign sale guarantees and bridge loans these are the films that really rack up the producer credits in the event of a sale to a distributor often at a film festival the investors get paid back first the producer is among the last to see back end money if the film takes off oberman still goes this route she also used lai s pilot analogy when we first met just as the birthday cake was set to start filming but still awaiting its final financing essentially taking off without enough fuel to land it s just a reality of indie producing oberman said almost every movie close to production feels like it s going to fall apart even today my state of mind is i think i m making a movie in a week it doesn t hit me as fully real until everything is locked in every independent film project is like this in fact no film is a done deal until the day it s released it s what makes the process thrilling but highly unstable it can take years of toiling on a project before it comes to fruition or pitching multiple projects before one happens to take flight inevitably there are low points moments of extreme self doubt for producer michael london the break came a couple years after he had left a plum position as a producer at fox to hang out his own shingle advertisement i left the lot and i was a little lost he says i left my relatively plush job and my office and my assistant i was working out of my house and i wasn t exactly feeling overconfident about things but he had fallen in love with an unpublished manuscript from a friend rex pickett about two guys having a lost weekend in california wine country he just needed a filmmaker one evening a few days before he was planning to give up and look for a job he got a phone call in his home office alexander payne wanted to make the script into a movie which became the successful and critically acclaimed 2004 film sideways how do you make money as a producer and what kind of money there are easier ways for a smart and driven person to earn a living a producer s earliest training whether as an assistant or in film school or in the mad scramble to get a friend s movie made can net close to minimum wage sometimes a producer takes a flat fee on a project other times a cut of a movie s production budget maybe 5 but everything can be subject to change throughout the long development process a small movie can earn a producer 30 000 for six months of work and when a production s budget needs tightening a producer s fee tends to be the first to go because the boss can t quit ultimately producers can and often do make a lot of money but it only kicks in after all the work of development fundraising talent scouting and staffing has been done if a studio has acquired it by then the money starts to flow only when filming begins but that 5 of the budget can mean millions some eventual percentage of net profit is often worked into the deal but as producers are among the last to be paid it takes the rare blockbuster for the eye popping money to kick in advertisement how has being a producer changed in 20 years london knows more about hollywood s evolution than most he s been adapting deftly to its seismic shifts from the beginning of his career on the strength of sideways and two other successful projects the family stone and the illusionist london set himself up for a successful career in the mid aughts i was riding the tail end of the indie movie explosion he says there was a lot of excitement about the notion that you could find broader audiences for more personal films in 2006 he founded groundswell the fruit of a collaboration with caa creative artists agency and capital investors from wall street the company made milk the visitor and the informant among others and then the bottom fell out two giant markets collapsed simultaneously in 2008 the one for stocks and the one for dvds between those two forces it suddenly became much harder for london to find the financing he needed through groundswell he had to return to the life of an independent producer the way out of his impasse is obvious if you ve been watching anything over the past decade even before indie film production began to buckle tv had begun to rise in prestige setting off a highly competitive market that then became super heated in the era of streaming early on in that evolution london got the idea for his first tv show the only taker was a tech company just moving into tv amazon advertisement betas became one of amazon s first shows it reminded me of sideways and thirteen he says where the financiers said go off and make what you want to make he secured a first look deal with a television arm of fox and rode the content boom with projects in keeping with his taste when he delved into genre there was always a strong storytelling element for fx he made snowfall for showtime he made smilf hulu aired chance starring hugh laurie the magicians ran on syfy for five seasons i feel like i get to be here for a second golden moment says london television is so huge now that you can find these lanes where if you re in the right place at the right time you can get something really interesting done company town how to pay your bills when you re starting out in hollywood for many people who pursue entertainment as a career it takes years to get yourself to where you are making money from your creative work for making money in the meantime there s always waiting tables but more and more people are turning to platforms like tiktok twitch and patreon what advice do pros always hear that is wrong in a field that many enter through side doors the only wrong advice is that you have to follow any particular path you don t have to go to film school london s career began when producer don simpson liked a profile he wrote for the l a times obst was a magazine editor before she made the leap some producers argue that in a field where youth and energy are at a premium it s better to just jump right in and find a job you don t have to be an assistant oberman skipped right past the agency assistant path and turned out just fine if you can wrangle a job in development or on set that may be just as good a path advertisement and thanks to the rise of tv you don t have to get a studio deal with so many streaming services competing for the right story whether from a book or magazine piece or the fertile mind of a young screenwriter all it takes is a great concept plus a committed name actor and some open minded financiers oberman manages without any first look deals she s trying to build up her portfolio first maintaining full creative control until she finds the right partner at the right price what s some good advice networking is key a producer s job is to make connections so many projects come together through what looks like serendipity an agent for an in demand director turns down a project on her behalf but passes the script along to a famous playwright who happens to love it that s not luck that s the result of a producer knowing the right agent and keeping an open mind persistence is essential there are legendary projects that waited years through actor defections production snafus botched rewrites and studio turnover only to find the right team and the right moment and click instantly behind nearly every surprise success that actually took years to pull together there is a producer with a plan a followed by b c d e and so on hear everyone out but trust yourself once you ve learned everything you can about the industry from mentors actors test audiences figure out your own tastes and limits not every project will get made and even fewer will find a large audience never mind leaving a cultural mark but no movie or show that does break through can do so without the guiding hand of a producer who projected unbridled confidence london waited years for payne to get freed up to make sideways which was a risk but his instinct told him payne was the right director oberman s early success showcases all these qualities beginning with her breakthrough moment in her senior year at usc oberman had a pinched nerve in treating it a doctor broke one of her vertebrae unable to sit for 10 hours a day her plan to become an assistant was derailed but it might have been the best thing that s happened to her so far i went to a lot of festivals did general meetings with tons of people and asked them for advice she says i had a lot of time on my hands which i spent researching the business and consuming films and then she decided to start producing advertisement the idea that i m going to go get famous actors and millions of dollars and suddenly be a producer at 22 i don t think i would ever have been brave enough to pursue it because it s kind of crazy but a few years and many movies later she wouldn t trade her agonizing exhilarating job for anything in the world read more of the times guide to working in hollywood

categories for her performance in the netflix women s prison series orange is the new black she played suzanne warren who was nicknamed crazy eyes because of how she widened her big round eyes reflecting the intensity instability and unpredictability caused by her mental health problems aduba won a third emmy for her performance in the fx series mrs america about the failed fight to ratify the equal rights amendment in the 70s aduba portrayed shirley chisholm who in 1968 became the first black woman elected to congress and in 1972 became the first black person to run in a major party presidential primary in the nbc live production of the wiz aduba played glinda the good witch aduba is the daughter of nigerian immigrants who came to america in the late 60s after the biafran war let s start by talking about in treatment this season is a reboot of hbo s in treatment that ended about a decade ago and starred gabriel byrne as the therapist this season focuses on aduba s character dr brooke taylor there are four episodes each week with each of the first three episodes focusing on one session with one of her three patients that the series follows the fourth episode typically features dr taylor talking with her aa sponsor who figured out that taylor was drinking again after years of sobriety and is back with her old boyfriend who s also a drinker it s clear that although dr taylor has great insight into her patients lives and their delusions she s having trouble seeing how she s deluding herself here s a scene from her second session with her patient eladio played by anthony ramos he s been working as a live in home health care aide for a wealthy family taking care of their son jeremy who has a disability although jeremy s parents are paying for eladio s sessions with dr taylor hoping she can help cure his insomnia eladio thinks the family doesn t care about him but he has no alternative no place else to go he s angry with the family and angry with himself and doesn t want to talk about it anymore soundbite of tv show in treatment anthony ramos as eladio if you want to talk about whatever right from now on you want to talk about whatever you want to talk about my mom my ex my i m down but do me a favor and let s just put an embargo on this particular topic ok with all due respect uzo aduba as dr brooke taylor that s a lot of anger eladio a lot of justifiable anger you have a right to your feelings all of them and i hear you do you know that i hear you look we re not going to solve white people today we re not going to solve capitalism today but we can talk about the situation that stirs these feelings up in you gross uzo aduba welcome to fresh air i m really going to miss you and your character laughter aduba oh laughter thank you for having me gross did playing a therapist lead to a lot of self reflection did you start asking yourself questions that she asked her patients aduba oh yeah for sure i think the first thing is why do people go to therapy what are you supposed to do in therapy i think that s a question anybody myself included who s ever gone to therapy wonders you know what am i initially supposed to be doing here with you and you realize what you re supposed to be doing is being honest both with the person in the room but most important yourself and what it is you re here to unpack gross so you ve been in therapy yourself aduba yes gross was it helpful in playing the character of a psychotherapist aduba oh definitely i mean i certainly was able to tap into what well what the room and the structure of the experience is like having been in therapy it was interesting for me being in brooke s seat it really made me empathic to not only my own but to therapists at large that they do this all day you know the weight of that job is a heavy one because i think before even though i knew that it was a hard job i think i never really took full stock of what it must mean to have not just me come in for a session but the person before me the person after me that they are responsible for helping to hold some of whatever it is that their patient brings into the room that day along with carrying whatever it is they re holding in their own lives gross and it doesn t stop it s like one person s pain after another person s pain that you have to comprehend and respond to and that just feels like a lot i think about that a lot you know i ve been seeing a therapist for years and find it like so valuable but i often think about well gee what is this like for her to just hear all of us laughter aduba absolutely and i mean also it made me wonder we don t know what they re going through in their own lives and how much of whatever it is that you re bringing into the room echoes what they re going through and it s just a hard job and it s not an easy one i have such respect for deeper a deepened respect for therapists and their everyday you know what they re tasked with dealing with every day gross so my next question is going to relate to your mother and i want to start before i ask you the question by saying i know you lost your mother in november and i just want to say how sorry i am so aduba thank you gross yeah your mother was from nigeria and she was a social worker aduba yeah gross how did she feel about therapy did she like encourage therapy or feel that there was a stigma about it i don t know what it was like in nigeria whether there was much psychotherapy there and how it was regarded aduba you know i don t know how it was regarded growing up for her as a young person before moving to the united states my mother was a social worker and she thought therapy was a fine resource she supported it she thought it was great she believed in it i think probably coming from her professional background she understood it in a larger way but my mom also came from a house of people who talked she grew up in a very progressive home who really did talk and communicate and engage with each other so i m sure that served as a bit of a launching pad for her to be also progressive about therapy for her children you know my mom was a bit of a therapist herself in certain ways you know whether it was for her children or nieces and nephews or neighbors and friends she had a very confiding spirit in her you know everybody used to call her the vault because she could you could tell her something she s never going to repeat it laughter aduba you know she s never going to repeat it and it wasn t uncommon to come home and see people you know either standing in the driveway with her talking or pulled over in a corner on a couch somewhere talking to her and you knew they were having something intimate there discussed and she would never break that trust ever and yeah she was amazing an amazing mazing ph mazing mazing place to take solace and comfort gross let me reintroduce you here if you re just joining us my guest is uzo aduba and she stars in the hbo series in treatment we ll be back after we take a short break this is fresh air soundbite of naomi moon siegel s it s not safe gross this is fresh air let s get back to my interview with uzo aduba she stars on the reboot of the hbo series in treatment in the role of psychotherapist dr brooke taylor she won two emmys for her performance in orange is the new black as suzanne warren aka crazy eyes and won a third emmy for her portrayal of shirley chisholm in the series mrs america in your performance on in treatment you have to do a lot of listening cause your patients are sharing what s disturbing them they re sharing their delusions and you re listening and you just kind of like cock your head a certain way when something strikes you as particularly important that you ve just heard and you know your eyes register what you re hearing you said your mother was a good listener did you watch her listen to you and like think like this is what it looks like when someone is really listening aduba i didn t necessarily watch her while i was preparing for the part but what i know from my whole life is i always had her attention and she was never missing anything and she would you know i can again you know as a kid can see myself going in her room if you want to talk mom can i talk to you and immediately she would pause or mute the television close whatever she was reading writing and give you her full attention her full attention i don t want to be distracted i am listening and it s such a powerful thing because you know that someone has zeroed in on you and is giving you all of themselves in what you re wanting to share and i think that is the responsibility of the job as a therapist and my desire when i would be sitting in that chair was to be laser focused on whatever it was that was being shared with me and that i was never distracted that you and i wanted to communicate back to each patient you have my full attention gross in the series we get to see what you re like as a therapist when you re usually laughter like very calm and very reflective but we also get to see you in your private life after you aduba right gross start drinking again when you re kind of like a different person aduba yeah gross and it s an interesting role for an actor to have cause it s almost as if you re playing two parts but you know we can see that as a therapist you re so perceptive about other people s rationalizations and delusions but you ve been going through a lot your father had recently died the character s father had recently died and you miss him but you re also really still angry with him and you don t really see the things you re hiding from yourself you don t see your own delusions and that s where your aa sponsor rita comes in she realizes after coming back from a trip that you ve been drinking again after years of sobriety she calls you out on it and i want to play a scene where she s talking to you about drinking again and rita is played by liza colon zayas she speaks first soundbite of tv show in treatment liza colon zayas as rita so when did it start again aduba as dr brooke taylor around when my father died colon zayas as rita and did adam have anything to do with this aduba as dr brooke taylor uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh don t blame him i m a grown ass woman colon zayas as rita well why couldn t you call me when you had your head on straight aduba as dr brooke taylor my head hasn t been on straight for a while now and besides i knew whatever you were going to say wouldn t change my mind colon zayas as rita now i ve talked you down before aduba as dr brooke taylor yeah well this isn t before colon zayas as rita how are you treating patients like this aduba as dr brooke taylor i would never compromise my work colon zayas as rita no i m not saying that it s just if it were me aduba as dr brooke taylor i know how to hold my patients pain i show up for them they come in here into this house carrying their fear and despair and anxiety because they have nowhere else to turn i am here for them colon zayas as rita and who holds your pain where do you leave your despair at the bottom of one of these bottles aduba as dr brooke taylor i just want to forget it all sometimes it s not that complicated to understand sometimes i want to silence that voice that makes me feel small hell could i do some positive self talk some cbt some meditation sure but sometimes an old fashioned or four just gets me there a little bit faster gross that s my guest uzo aduba in a scene from in treatment do you feel like you really understand how someone can be so perceptive about other people s behavior and motivations and so blind to their own aduba oh for sure absolutely i mean laughter i think they call that life gross yeah yeah laughter gross yeah the strange part about the casting is that you re probably most famous for your role as suzanne warren aka crazy eyes in orange is the new black where your character had really serious mental health issues aduba yeah gross and so it s like yeah let s get that person laughter to play the therapist aduba laughter that s i thought the same thing i was like laughter well if that s not a 180 i don t know what is laughter just kind of like what i was like did you read my resume laughter aduba have you read it laughter but yeah i was it was exciting though that wasn t lost on me to tell you the honest truth you know i was like wow this is so interesting you know being on the polar opposite you know in ways of one story you know felt like i had played the funhouse mirror side of mental health and now being on the opposite end with brooke dr brooke taylor providing another set of challenges but it was great it was great to have had that experience with suzanne crazy eyes warren and now coming into this project gross your mother died during the pandemic were you able to be with her aduba oh yes i was with her the entire time gross was she at home instead of a hospital aduba oh yes yes she was at home she came home and you know from diagnosis to when she left us i was with her the entire time and when she passed away on november 4 yes i was with her and thankful that i was gross i know so many people who have a loved one who ve died during the pandemic either from covid or from other things like your mother had cancer i think grieving during the pandemic when people are relatively isolated from each other must be just like especially hard were you able to have any ceremonies rituals gatherings that you would have wanted to have aduba you know of course you know my mom so many people loved her so much so in person we weren t able to have all the people who we would ve wanted to have present who would ve wanted to have been present because of covid protocols from churches to funeral homes we did you know we are part of the zoom story when it comes to funeral services but let me tell you that zoom had like 200 something people on it gross wow aduba yes my mother was gross how did she know so many people aduba people loved her she was beloved let me give you an example at the burial word had gotten around that my mother had passed and from a distance and then they came over afterwards two women who my mother had taught as children in nigeria because before my mother moved to america she was a teacher two little girls who were little girls to my you know what i mean students of my mom who lived in maryland drove up to come to the service and they stood outside the church because there was a capacity limit followed the procession to the site and stood there as well and watched the zoom from outside the church came to the burial just to tell us that gross wow aduba that s how long that history of people were showing up on that zoom because she was she was the best thing that ever happened to me period gross were there things from traditional nigerian funerals that she wanted you to do for her aduba yes we have some of i mean there s still a process in our culture as far as how you pay one one pays their respects to their loved one and we re still in the midst of that process by year s end we ll have completed our traditional send off ancestor send off there s a way that we send off our loved ones to assure that they can be received and make it to the other side to meet our ancestors gross do you find that helpful to have rituals and a ceremony and a process to send someone you love off to send them off aduba absolutely you know i ve never said goodbye to someone this close to me and had such a front row seat to it i do find it helpful especially you know there s the western send off which has been you know has there s a catharsis to it but there s also you know i m also very nigerian as well and that piece of it is also very important it s important to my mom it s important to our extended family it s important to each of us to make sure that those traditions rituals are upheld that have been around longer than well longer than any of us have so yes i think it s important gross let s take a short break here and then we ll talk some more if you re just joining us my guest is uzo aduba and she stars in the hbo series in treatment this season concludes tonight she also costarred in orange is the new black and mrs america we ll talk more after we take a short break i m terry gross and this is fresh air soundbite of stefon harris and blackout s until gross this is fresh air i m terry gross let s get back to my interview with uzo aduba she stars in the hbo series in treatment as psychotherapist dr brooke taylor aduba won two emmys for her performance in orange is the new black as suzanne warren who was known as crazy eyes and won a third emmy for her portrayal of shirley chisholm in the series mrs america aduba is the daughter of nigerian immigrants and grew up in medfield mass i want to ask you about orange is the new black since that was really the role that tv viewers got to know you from and you play suzanne warren who s known by the nickname crazy eyes because she has mental health problems she has no boundaries she has no understanding of how to interact with other people and she s impulsive and often out of control and can be scary even when she s expressing her love for you and i want to play a scene your character has been infatuated with one of the other inmates piper chapman and in this scene from the first season you re explaining how you re sometimes sent to the psych ward in prison and how you ve also been in the shu which is the acronym for the solitary housing unit which is basically solitary confinement and so taylor schilling as piper chapman speaks first soundbite of tv show orange is the new black taylor schilling as piper is psych worse than the shu aduba as suzanne way worse scary old cold old it s real bad i wouldn t wish it on the worst gremlin schilling as piper don t they give you a therapist aduba as suzanne no nope i m they give me medication to make me calm but that just makes me sleepy sometimes when i m real upset they tie me down like a balloon so i don t fly away schilling as piper that sounds horrible aduba as suzanne yeah nobody comes back from psych except me laughter once you go to psych you get lost in psych it s like that place with the three corners in the ocean schilling as piper the bermuda triangle aduba as suzanne we should play charades sometime dandelion we d make great partners not wives just partners can i ask you one more question schilling as piper yeah of course aduba as suzanne how come everyone calls me crazy eyes soundbite of music gross uzo aduba what was your take on the character and what did you model her on aduba my take on the character was that she was just looking for love in all the wrong places gross and in all the wrong ways laughter aduba and in all the wrong ways she actually was born of my imagination it was a line in the script that described her as something like innocent like a child except children aren t scary and i remember it just popped an image in my head of like a kid with a sledgehammer and laughter like this sort of you know unintentionally destructive you know but i thought she was just so honest so loving and she just saw the world differently than we did that was always how i just approached her gross how much did you think about your eyes in the road because your eyes do have to get really big and wild looking aduba i didn t think about that to be honest with you i just let i knew that i didn t think about it because i knew already it s built into her name her character s name is crazy eyes so i don t need to do anything to make them more crazy you know i thought to myself what how does she move through life and what i was really focused on was there is no filter with this person you know this woman has zero filter she does not hide her reaction she does not you know filter her emotions what you see is what she exactly she is feeling and thinking she has no poker face you know and even if she thinks she has a poker face that poker face tells on her every time you know that was where i really concentrated my energy and whatever came out of that is what came out of it gross so the series was set in a women s prison and you told stephen colbert that you didn t go to a women s prison to do the research but you had been to a scared straight program laughter aduba yeah gross when you were in school and what did they teach you in that aduba when we gross how did they scare you what did they do to make you really terrified like oh no if i do this they re going to take me to prison and aduba yeah when i was in middle school high school we went to a county jail and it i mean scared straight worked on me dare worked on me all these programs worked on me laughter like they were like i was the audience they were speaking to these things worked for me i just remember the it was the coldness of the not necessarily temperature wise but the energy and feeling and the rigidity of it all and i just remember that you could smell the lack of freedom in there from the yellow line that you have to follow to the you know the prison jumpsuits you have to wear to the being shackled seeing people shackled and then honestly it was the testimonies of the inmates there you know that really spoke to me more than anything listening to them speak about their lives and how a moment such as this was having such a huge impact on it based on one choice it worked it worked for me gross yeah i mean you say it worked for you but do you think you were a kid who was ever on the verge of getting into trouble aduba no i wasn t no that was the thing that was so funny about the whole thing i didn t i wasn t in the program because i was part of like a troubled core of children or anything like this not that that makes it any better i thought it was so interesting because our whole school went to scared straight laughter you just have to google my hometown to know that it was an odd thing that we were all going to but nonetheless important just the same but no i didn t need to be i was definitely you know i had an imagination i was a precocious child when i was really really little but by the time i got to the age of this no i was not that kid gross so you got the part in orange is the new black about 45 minutes after you decided to quit acting because things weren t going well so what was your plan b when you were going to quit aduba yeah my plan b was to become a lawyer laughter that was my plan b gross that was going to take a long time aduba i had time you know it was something that i thought i was going to do before i even got to got into the arts originally when i started you know thinking about college and the future i thought i was going to go to school and study ir international relations and go into or political science and go into law because i loved those things as well and when i decided that i was going to quit acting that day that was what i defaulted to i think my brain went to you made the wrong choice all the way back then in high school you should ve gone you were supposed to be a lawyer and not chase this you know silly pipe dream and so since i knew that was something else that i loved and was passionate about i said that s where i m going to steer the reroute the ship and go back to what i was meant to do or what i thought i was meant to do gross well that must have been a big switch to realize no i was right laughter i made the right choice i got a part aduba yeah laughter aduba definitely i mean definitely it was definitely mind blowing to you know it made me think i remember when i got the job think of that line you know the sopranos excuse me the godfather it s like just when i thought i was out laughter they pull me back in gross had you already told people that you were quitting and then have to call them and say changed my mind laughter aduba no but i had you know what let me tell you i had invited my sister over for sushi and wine that night because i was having a little i was going to have a little sushi and wine you know pity party for myself and i told my sister chi chi ph to come over and she was going to be the first person i was going to tell it was a friday and i said i m going to wait to tell my agent and manager until that monday and she said ok yes i ll come over and between the time of that conversation and her coming over i found out that i got the job and it wound up being a celebration instead gross if you re just joining us my guest is uzo aduba she stars in the hbo series in treatment the final episode of this season is tonight we ll be back after a short break this is fresh air soundbite of jay z song december 4th gross this is fresh air let s get back to my interview with uzo aduba she stars in the reboot of the hbo series in treatment in the role of psychotherapist dr brooke taylor she won two emmys for her performance in orange is the new black as suzanne warren aka crazy eyes and won a third emmy for her portrayal of shirley chisholm in the series mrs america so you were an athlete when you were growing up you were a figure skater competitive figure skater you ran track what was your relationship to your body then did you feel like it was that it was really strong and capable and could do things other bodies couldn t aduba i think it was a mix i knew and felt that my body was strong and capable and i thought it was beautiful and all of this but remembering also the time that we re talking about i don t think those were always things that were celebrated necessarily for girls and so what you think is beautiful often and is strong and is an attribute you know a strong beautiful characteristic i should say it starts to become challenged when that s not something that s being when something different is being lifted up let me say it that way gross so we re talking about the 80s and 90s here and so people did think like you re not feminine enough aduba oh yeah not feminine enough not slim enough fair enough not too muscular not beautiful enough i mean you name it laughter gross and how did being black figure into the not beautiful enough aduba oh my goodness well i think certainly you know i don t hold any proximity whatsoever to eurocentric beauty at all so gross but did you grow up in a community with a lot of white people aduba yes i grew up yes very much so my family was maybe like one i think maybe like one of three black families by the time i started school in our hometown i think you know there were five black kids in my school i was related to three of them you know like very small and yeah you know the idea and ideal beauty not just you know what i m observing but told spoken on was blond hair blue eyes or brown hair brown eyes and i have neither so then you start to think oh ok then i guess the antithesis of that must be ugly gross did you feel ugly aduba at times yeah i did i did not think i was but i started to feel like i must be gross was your mother helpful in helping you overcome that aduba yes later down the road i think you know things that like for example i used to hate my gap as a kid gross in your front teeth aduba yes in my front teeth i have a gap and i would beg beg beg for braces because everybody had braces everybody was fixing their horrible teeth you know whatever that means and my mom would she was just like no absolutely not absolutely not and you know finally she sat me down i was begging begging she said what you have there is anyaoku gap uzo she said don t you know that in nigeria and throughout africa a gap is a sign of beauty why would you want to close it and i was like sure but we live in america it s like we don t live in like laughter aduba you know and she would impress those kind of things on me and i cause i wouldn t smile in pictures you know i would just like i d be laughing but then like as soon as we would take a picture i d close smile with my mouth closed and my mom would be like open your mouth smile smile you have such a beautiful smile and i never would and it wasn t until my senior year of high school i was doing my yearbook pictures the summer before senior year you know when you get your senior yearbook pictures they re like the fancy ones you know like special so we re in the library taking our pictures and the photographer s talking to me and you know he s chatting me up and we re talking and i m laughing and then as soon as he points the camera i close my mouth and i m not smiling and he says to me finally he s like how come you re not smiling in pictures and i was like i don t know i don t like my smile and he was like why not and i was like i don t like my gap and then he paused for a minute and he says you know i think you have a beautiful smile and i remember thinking to myself like what you know like i was just like kind of blown away and i you know even though my mom has said this for thousands of years at this point and by the way she always hates when i tell hated when i tell this story because she was like so you listen to that man but you do listen to me you know like laughter aduba and but it stuck with me and i didn t necessarily smile that day terry in the picture but i did end up smiling the rest of that year and so and have since in photographs you know all my i made a point i was like every time i would take a picture senior year i d say i have a beautiful smile and do a big cheese smile and yeah it made an impact and she impacted my life in ways because she had been reinforced she was really insistent my mom in making sure that we saw ourselves for who we actually are versus what the world might want to tell us we are and it was hugely powerful and had a great deal of effect on my life and i think maybe it not as strongly in my younger years but i think it has absolutely cemented in me my identity what i will and will not allow as the definition of for who i am and has certainly made me feel very strongly in just myself and my feet walk in my body you know it s not perfect but walk in with a confidence of no no no i know who i am gross if you re just joining us my guest is uzo aduba she stars in the hbo series in treatment the final episode of this season is tonight we ll be right back after a short break this is fresh air soundbite of gabriel mervine s people gross this is fresh air let s get back to my interview with uzo aduba she stars in the reboot of the hbo series in treatment in the role of psychotherapist dr brooke taylor she won two emmys for her performance in orange is the new black as suzanne warren who was nicknamed crazy eyes and won a third emmy for her portrayal of shirley chisholm in the series mrs america how much more challenging did it seem an acting career was going to be because you were a black woman aduba i think it felt challenging because i was a black woman and also because i was a dark skinned black woman because it just i those roles didn t exist in a wide range or they kind of felt always relegated to the background almost like an afterthought and so i knew that it was going to be very difficult i think i knew for a fact that it was going to be more noes than yeses i think i knew that for whatever reason things beyond my control meaning how i look were going to determine what i was going to be allowed to do gross what about your name do you think that created preconceptions aduba sure i m laughter probably probably i think my name probably did but it s my name i m very proud of that name i was gross did anyone ever tell you to change it aduba not gross anyone in show business aduba nobody in show no one in show business ever told me to change it i was told or asked more than once to close my gap nobody ever asked gross did you say talk to my mother laughter aduba yeah exactly laughter exactly i said that s not going anywhere but yeah my name i think at that point in my life when i i had wrestling with my name when i was young like in primary age but by the time i got to it never even occurred to me and this is what i mean foundation building because the beautiful thing about the lessons we re taught as children they can either set in as children or they can set in in adulthood and a lot a good measure of them had set in without my knowing in my adulthood that to the point it had never even occurred to me in a real way to consider changing my name gross do names have a special significance in nigerian culture aduba yes absolutely so naming in my culture will tell you more almost about the parent of the child than the child themselves and also what is being spoken onto the child so my full name is uzoamaka nwanneka aduba but the first name uzoamaka it means the road is good my second name means my middle name it means nothing is more important than your sisters and my last name means the mediator gross huh is that a role you feel like you ve ever played aduba a mediator gross uh huh aduba absolutely as a middle child absolutely gross oh laughter gross the road is good did your parents name you that because they found a road so to speak to safety after the war aduba yeah so my actual father s name is also similar so there s that in the family but my mom loved it and put that name on me because she had had polio as a child she had been through the biafran civil war she had been married once before and her first husband had passed away when she was still a very young woman with two children and then she sometime later she met my father they got married and they had me and the name uzoamaka or the road is good it s a name that means you know that someone has been through something but it was worth it gross that has wonderful meaning aduba right yeah gross yeah so do you feel like you re entering a new stage of life now i mean things are starting to open up again and i know you re still grieving for your mother but that s also a new chapter of your life that you ve just begun life without your mother so do you feel like you re kind of emerging into a new chapter of your life aduba i do i feel like i m emerging into a new chapter of my life you know what my mother left me if we believe in these sort of things is she came to me in my dream a week later and she said to me just like this uzo you are settled and it gave me such a peace and a calm that i could continue without her because i never had she was always in my corner i talked to my mom every day in whether email text phone and i know that those lessons those teachings that she placed inside of me have readied me for this next phase of my life gross well i wish you all good things and it s been such a pleasure to talk with you i really want to thank you aduba thank you it s been wonderful gross uzo aduba stars

two weeks ago twitter got a gift when yanis varoufakis posed for a paris match photo shoot which depicted the greek finmin living a not very austere looking lifestyle while the pictures didn t show varoufakis being chauffeured around in any rolls royces they did include one shot of what appeared to be a rather ostentatious picnic with the acropolis in the background that contrasted starkly with the plight of the large number of greeks who now have difficulty scraping together meals it also came at a time when the government was actively considering borrowing money from public pension funds to make debt payments to the imf and the ecb at the time we said the following as the greek people live in perpetual fear of financial ruin and are subjected on a near hourly basis to rumors about just what kind of humiliation they may be forced to endure next in order to insure that christine lagarde gets the money she needs to prop up ukraine for another couple of months yanis varoufakis isn t about to roll over and allow his people to drown in despair on the contrary the finance minister apparently believes the best way to restore the faith is to show the greek people just how good life could be one possibly fake middle finger kerfluffle and exactly no progress with european creditors later we discover that varoufakis has a vacation villa that he s willing to rent for the bargain price of just 5 000 week for those who are interested here s an idea of what you ll get for your money
what is city talk city talk allows marketers to connect directly with our audience by publishing content on cityam com 32 reasons not to invest in the stock market the most vulnerable could get a booster jab in september to help them maintain protection against the disease through the winter wars disasters economic strife political instability and now a pandemic the last four decades have challenged and affected people s attitude towards investing in many cases they make an already tough decision to commit your money to investments even harder leading some to not invest at all behavioural scientists have a name for this loss aversion they estimate that the psychological pain of losing is about twice as powerful as the pleasure of gaining hence why some people shy from the risks involved with investing yet as schroders research shows staying out of the stock market over the last 32 years could have proven costly the eroding effects of inflation and historically low interest rates would have eaten away at the value of your money if you decided not to invest while investing in the stock market carries greater risks and volatility it could have boosted your returns of course choosing to invest depends on your personal circumstances and if you are unsure as to the suitability of any investment speak to an financial adviser schroders research found after adjusting for the effects of inflation 1 000 hidden under the mattress at the start of 1989 would now be worth 428 due to the effects of uk inflation annual growth of 2 6 1 000 left alone in a uk savings account at the start of 1989 would now be worth 1 818 annual growth of 1 90 1 000 invested in the ftse all share index at the start of 1989 with all income reinvested would now be worth 5 751 annual growth of 5 6 these figures are not adjusted to include any account charges or investment fees the chart below illustrates the change in real meaning after inflation value each year of 1 000 invested in uk stocks a uk bank account or left under your bed please remember that past performance is not a guide to future performance investing in one geographical region may result in large changes to the value to your investment which may adversely impact the performance a short history of stock market crashes since 2000 the last 32 years have included some of the biggest stock market shocks in history the most recent shocks were triggered by the pandemic which caused the global economy to all but shut down covid 19 was the major contributing factor to three of the ten biggest one day falls over the last four decades yet while covid produced some large one day falls the fall in uk shares of nearly 10 during 2020 was modest in comparison to other yearly falls experienced since 1989 the global financial crisis of 2008 which began with the gradual collapse of the housing market in the us the year before led to the worst global recession since the 1930s in the year to the end of 2008 the ftse all share was down 30 its worst annual performance since 1989 discover more from schroders learn the 33k cost of mistiming the market read the equity sectors best at combating higher inflation in 2001 the ftse all share index fell by 13 this was in the wake of the bursting of the dotcom bubble at the end of 1990s when highly rated technology stocks were sold off but it also coincided with the devastating attacks on the world trade centre in new york in september the period also saw a global economic slump although the uk managed to avoid recession the ftse all share index was down 22 in the year to the end of 2002 the table below illustrates how your investment returns could have built up year by year between 1989 and 2020 and shows the damaging effect inflation can have on your wealth it also shows global events that could have deterred investors in any of those given years nick kirrage a fund manager and author on the value perspective investment blog has written often about the danger fear can play people can lose touch with just how bad things have looked and been in the past he said that can lead to them taking or failing to take actions that can harm their personal wealth for decades to come this data shows that investors who had instead opted to stay in cash would have seen their savings destroyed by inflation during a period when the stock market rallied quite frankly there are many other periods of the last century which offer the same conclusion even the second world war offered decent stock market returns in the us and uk the reality is that there is no perfect time to put money into the stock market if you are holding out for one you are going to remain in cash forever and over the longer term you are likely to be materially

ken schrader to a fifth place finish in the 1988 nascar cup series points standings like 10 others his first victory came at talladega superspeedway there on a sweltering sunday afternoon in july 1988 he won after starting seventh and perfectly executing a last lap high side pass i was running about 20th with 10 to go when crew chief harry hyde came on the radio and said boy i think it would be good for you to get back up there schrader recalled so i worked my way through a lot of traffic and got to i think third or fourth near the end something like that dale earnhardt sterling marlin and bodine took the white flag 1 2 3 with schrader close behind when marlin went high entering turn 1 schrader followed in his draft marlin then abruptly swung low to pass earnhardt on the inside briefly leaving schrader on the outside of a three wide in turn 2 when sterling got his nose under dale dale didn t like that too much schrader said so he moved down a little and that cost them both a shade of momentum that put me around them on the outside going down the backstretch on the last lap at that point greed kicked in and everybody went for whatever they could get i never thought i had it won over bodine earnhardt rick wilson and rusty wallace until right before the start finish line racingone getty images ken schrader 25 chases down phil parsons 55 at talladega in 1988 just over a year later at charlotte in the fall schrader won again this time with richard broome atop the pit box his last two victories for hendrick came at atlanta in june 1991 and seven races later at dover in july both with broome as crew chief his nascar resume shows those four cup victories plus two in xfinity and one in camping world trucks also notable he won the busch clash in 1989 and 1990 and the daytona 500 pole in 1989 1990 1991 his best points season was fourth in 1994 with crew chief ken howes at 42 schrader left hendrick after the 1996 season replaced by 31 year old wunderkind ricky craven the final 16 seasons of his 29 year nascar career were largely disappointing he raced for 10 owners few of whom had the resources to field a competitive team he had five poles no victories only five top 5 finishes and 40 top 10 finishes in his last 404 cup starts between 1997 2013 all the poles and top 5 finishes and 25 of the 40 top 10 finishes came in 1997 1999 with rookie owner andy petree he skipped the entire 2009 cup season to go short track and arca racing then did a combined 31 cup starts with owner frankie stoddard during 2010 2012 but with more fun and excitement waiting on the outside schrader left nascar for good after finishing 34th in the 2013 season finale at homestead miami speedway he was 58 at the time but his racing career was just about to take off all over again but wait there s more schrader is among the 11 drivers whose breakthrough came at talladega the others richard brickhouse 1969 dick brooks 1973 lennie pond 1978 ron bouchard 1981 bobby hillin jr 1986 davey allison 1987 phil parsons 1988 schrader 1988 brian vickers 2006 brad keselowski 2009 and ricky stenhouse jr 2017 when he raced in alaska in 2017 it moved schrader closer to his avowed goal of racing in every state going into this year he lacked only hawaii and rhode island to reach 50 there s a track in hawaii but not a suitable outdoor venue in rhode island schrader s 1985 rookie of the year season came with team owner junie donlavey maybe the only man in racing about whom nothing bad has ever been written or spoken chief also fielded cars for jody ridley s 1980 roty season and contributed some starts to the 1970 roty seaso0n for bill dennis in any reference to his career schrader always speaks reverently of mr donlavey racingone getty images ken schrader was the nascar cup series 1985 rookie of the year schrader is more than just a racer he owns federated auto parts raceway in pevely mo formerly i 55 speedway and co owns macon ill speedway with kenny wallace tony stewart and bob sargent there were years during his career when he briefly fielded entries in nascar s top three classes and the arca series as an owner he won the 2017 arca championship with maine native austin theriault schrader and former nascar star and fellow missouri native carl edwards are first cousins once removed
seen on the left is the 18 story residential building named 87 park a height restriction for surfside limits buildings to 12 stories however 87 park is just across the border in miami beach according to a june 30 article by casey tolan of cnn residents of champlain would complain of shaking during the construction of 87 park no evidence that the building s construction 2016 2019 contributed to the collapse the collapse of miami s champlain towers south condo building is one of the biggest and most tragic stories of the year here at forconstructionpros com we re combing through all the information we can in order to bring you a full view of the story all in one spot updated july 6 32 confirmed dead 26 identified 113 missing final demolition occurred on july 4 as reported by the new york times at roughly 1 30 a m the residents of the champlain towers condo building in miami fla were startled awake by fire alarms debris and the ground trembling reporters giulia heyward richard fausset and jack healy interviewed bruno treptow who lived on the eighth floor of the building the collapse consumed half of the building stopping at the edge of treptow s living space he s quoted saying the hallway s gone constructed in 1981 the champlain towers south condo building was 13 stories tall housing 136 units with a parking garage beneath the building described on the condominium s website the building is located just steps from the atlantic ocean and featured a pool deck and access to a sandy beach with year round ocean breezes for context the location is set on the south side of surfside located north of miami beach on a peninsula island of sorts between the biscayne bay and the atlantic ocean abc news reports that about 55 of the building s condominiums were destroyed units were comprised of one two three and four bedroom floor plans ranging from 1 200 ft 2 to 4 500 ft 2 as reported by curt anderson of the associated press on monday june 28 2021 released minutes from 2018 had board members claiming the building was in very good shape however the ap report surfaced documents that show no evidence any of the critical concrete structure work ever started apparently residents were instructed that they had to pay a fair share of the multi million dollar assessment by july 1 in this unprecedented happening the south tower of the building collapsed on thursday june 24 2021 robert frosch professor of civil engineering and senior associate dean of engineering for facilities and operations at purdue university calls the catastrophe a progressive collapse similar to what happened with the world trade center when a floor collapses the weight of that slab doubles the weight of the floor below it frosch explains this type of failure is extremely rare we have provisions in the building code to minimize the risk of this type of failure the miami herald reports that rosendo prieto the former top building official for the town of surfside began a leave of absence on june 28 though it s unconfirmed that the decision was voluntary allegedly prieto had reviewed the 2018 inspection report and informed the residents that the building appeared to be in very good shape according to the miami herald s article this statement was made a month after the october 2018 report a link to the report and excerpts are below however prieto denies receiving the report he last worked for surfside in november 2020 and was reassigned to the city of doral in may rescue as of tuesday june 29 the miami herald reports that three million pounds of concrete have been removed from the site the miami dade fire chief alan cominsky has come forward stating that rescue workers will no longer be returning to the west section of the collapse as it is too dangerous for responders the eastern side poses the same risk using technologies like infrared search and rescue dogs cameras sonar and robotics unmanned rescuers have found small voids or crevices in the rubble during the operation while it does not necessarily mean survivors will be found said they are pursuing every possible option that could lead them to finding residents many of the technologies used are similar to those used in the world trade center mass shootings and in disabling explosives in its coverage abc news described the situation as bad and not ideal for rescuers while search and rescue continues around the clock levine cava tells abc news that the remaining structure is being considered unstable crews are no longer entering the remaining structure surfside mayor charles burkett spoke in a june 29 press conference nobody is giving up here nobody is stopping we are dedicated to getting everyone out of that pile of rubble adobe stock images by felix mizioznikov the big question why while investigations are still underway it s been said that it will likely take a long time to determine the cause of the collapse however new york times reporters mike baker sophie kasakove christopher flavelle and mitch smith report that the town released documents that showed evidence that an engineering consultant noted major structural damage to a concrete slab below the pool deck with abundant cracking and crumbling of the columns beams and walls of the parking garage this report was done in 2018 and reportedly work was planned to be underway to address the issue the report from morabito consultants mc has been released online due to the location with exposure to the ocean s saltwater and hurricanes it s not surprising there are numerous accounts of waterproofing issues and cracking in the concrete slab edges of balconies structurally mc recommended that the entrance pool deck concrete slab be removed and replaced entirely however all the failed slab areas were underneath brick pavers decorative stamped concrete and planters all requiring waterproofing replacement purdue university s charles pankow professor of civil engineering rodrigo salgado is quoted imparting the impact water can have on cracks there were reports of cracks in the superstructure of the condo building and possibly some foundation movement cracks can be a cause or a symptom of building pathology if you have cracks opening up water can get in corrode steel reinforcement and that may lead to failure but if you start getting movement at the foundation those movements distort the building and that leads to cracking excessively wide cracks particularly in certain locations are an indicator of a structure in distress salgado has studied how to design and construct foundations for various types of structures for 30 years he is the author of the engineering of foundations and the editor in chief of the journal of geotechnical and geoenvironmental engineering of the american society of civil engineers asce excerpts from the report many of the existing pavers on the pool deck are cracked and showing moderate wear and tear from years of being exposed to the elements the pavers do not appear to pose any hazard to the building occupants and are currently not in need of replacement the joint sealant was observed to be beyond its useful life and are in need of complete replacement however the waterproofing below the pool deck entrance drive as well as all of the planter waterproofing is beyond it useful life and therefore must all be completely removed and replaced the failed waterproofing is causing major structural damage to the concrete structural slab below these areas failure to replace the waterproofing in the near future will cause the extent of the concrete deterioration to expand exponentially mc approach to the repair of this structure is different from what is specified in contract documents in numerous aspects mc s suggested repairs included the removal of all pavers decorative concrete paving setting beds concrete topping slab and waterproofing down to the reinforced concrete structure repairing the concrete structure as deemed necessary pouring a sloped bonded concrete overlay that will be sloped to drain installing a new waterproofing membrane protection board and drainage panels on the new sloped surface and placing new pavers decorative concrete slabs over a sand setting bed new stainless steel dual level drains will be installed at all existing drain locations that will collect rain water at the surface of the pavers and at the waterproofing level this system will assure that all water that penetrates to the waterproofing layer will be able to flow freely to the deck drains resulting in an extended life for the replacement waterproofing membrane this system also provides extra protection for the existing reinforced concrete structure and allows future membrane repair replacement to be completed more economically the repairs to all planters will be completed in a similar manner adobe stock images by felix mizioznikov the report then discusses the parking garage and slabs abundant cracking and spalling of varying degrees was observed in the concrete columns beams and walls several sizeable spalls were noted in both the topside of the entrance drive ramp and underside of the pool entrance drive planter slabs which included instances with exposed deteriorating rebar though some of this damage is minor most of the concrete deterioration needs to be repaired in a timely fashion all cracking and spalling located in the parking garage shall be repaired in accordance with the recommendations of icri international concrete repair institute mc visual observations revealed that many of the previous garage concrete repairs are failing resulting in additional concrete cracking spalling and leaching of calcium carbonate deposits at the underside of entrance pool deck where the slab had been epoxy injected new cracks were radiating from the originally repaired cracks the installed epoxy is not continuous as observed from the bottom of the slab which is evidence of poor workmanship performed by the previous contractor the injection ports were not removed and the surfaces were not ground smooth at the completion of the injection leaching of calcium carbonate deposits in numerous areas has surely caused cts to pay to repaint numerous cars this leaching will continue to increase until proper repairs are completed mc is convinced that the previously installed epoxy injection repairs were ineffective in properly repairing the existing cracked and spalled concrete slabs mc recommends that the entrance pool deck concrete slabs that are showing distress be removed and replaced in their entirely unfortunately all of these failed slab areas are under brick pavers decorative stamped concrete and planters which require completed waterproofing replacement all repaired concrete slabs located in the parking garage are to be repaired in accordance with the recommendations of icri the building was meant to begin repairs as part of required structural recertification for buildings at 40 years of age with the original construction done in 1981 it was just past this 40 year recertification requirement however many experts say there may be more involved theories so far include the potential of removing a structural support column over the years a sinkhole problems with the foundation and possibly more of course there s a chance that this could be the cause of a combination of many issues instead of a single problem yet the fact that that this horrific event happened to such a building at such an age is unusual to say the least having a building that is only 40 years old collapse like that is unbelievable and often a failure like that is a combination of factors not necessarily a single one says julio ramierez purdue university s karl h kettelhut professor of civil engineering adobe stock images by felix mizioznikov inspections investigation while the building had undergone extensive inspections kenneth direktor a lower for the champlain towers south condo association spoke with abc news reporters in their june 30 article he is noted as explaining that he hadn t been warned of any structural issues with the building or about the land it was built on he said there was water damage to the complex but that is common for oceanfront properties and wouldn t have caused the partial collapse florida governor ron desantis and mayor danielle levine cava have announced that a full investigation would be done abc news reports that the miami dade police department are leading the investigation while not being ruled out no evidence of foul play has been found asce quest for answers begins following florida building collapse ronald burg pe faci executive vice president of the american concrete institute released a statement on june 29 the shares its sadness at the loss of life following the collapse of the champlain towers south in surfside florida usa on june 24 2021 he adds that the aci has begun assembling a team of aci member experts to work with the national institute of standards and technology on the investigation they will work under the leadership of aci committee 133 on disaster reconnaissance the coordinated teams are focused on the collapse and areas involving concrete construction additional details of the investigation will be made available in time it seems the area has taken some proactive measures for the area s structures in a july 1 video abc news reporter victor oquendo reports that all buildings 40 years and older and above four stories are undergoing an audit more than 500 buildings are being inspected in miami beach alone one building already notified to close off access to four balconies demolition late on july 4 mark loiaux a 73 year old explosives veteran and ceo of controlled demolotion inc cdi was hired as a subcontractor to demolition what remained of surfside s champlain tower as reported by the miami herald on july 5 while miami dade s mayor loizeaux had originally claimed that the demolition would take weeks it seems worry about the incoming tropical storm elsa drove governor desantis to direct for a more immediate response for safety from the miami herald article we spent two full days with a lot of attorneys trying to figure out the legal way to get it done said steve greenberg founder of the bg group which hired cdi as a subcontractor for the surfside operation greenberg said he was in talks with the administration of desantis about a quick demolition late last week ahead of a potential hit by tropical cyclone elsa even as he was seeing news report that such an operation would take weeks the governor basically directed them there s a storm coming it s not safe get it done greenberg said the article states that cdi who was also instrumental in the demo of the alfred p murrah federal building after the 1995 bombing brought two drillers from a new jersey project they drilled 165 hols and used 128 lbs of dynamite by 11 p m the job was done without damage to nearby buildings soon after the scene was declared safe search and recovery resumed searching how you can help both the american red cross and the miami mayor have come

this video was recorded to play on june 21 2021 chris hill it s monday june 21st welcome to marketfoolery i m chris hill and i am off this week as you re listening to this i m actually headed to charleston south carolina for a bit of time off a little time on the beach and more than my fair share of good food but did i record some episodes to run this week while i m gone yes i did we are just about at the midpoint of 2021 so i thought it would be a good opportunity to take a step back from the daily grind of news we could all collectively lift up our heads look around and see where we are i asked a few people to help me out with that this week starting with today s guests ron gross thanks for being here my friend ron gross you re very welcome does this mean i m working this week it s all very confusing hill i don t know we re taping this a few days before monday the 21st what you do starting monday the 21st you re grown man ron that s up to you gross that sounds good to me hill let s start with inflation inflation is one of those things that we don t talk about all that often we ve been talking about it recently on motley fool money we had the fed meeting last week did jay powell and the good people at the federal reserve give us any clues to it based on what they said do you think there are some industries that are more attractive or less attractive because of what they said gross i ve got some thoughts as you say inflation is tricky because once we start talking about economics and economic theory i almost hate to go down too much of a rabbit hole with it because foolishness is about picking great companies and holding them for the long term but i do think it s important to understand some of these concepts and how it could impact your investments just to unpack it a little bit so prices are definitely higher across many sectors i think we all see it across the board real estate for sure food chipotle recently announcing price hikes energy is up commodities some of this i think is certainly transitory as the economy reopens but all that stimulus money that was pumped into the economy over the last year has to have some impact you can t just print money and it does not have an impact plus you have the fed quantitative easing programs buying bonds that leads to i think probably some sustained inflation as well then you ve got supply chain problems semiconductors being one of the most glaring examples you have a labor shortage not everyone is back to work yet in fact lots of folks are not and that s also added i think to some increase in prices i do think those higher prices some of them are here for a while but we ve already seen some prices fall back a bit lumber is a good example it was sky high and has taken a step back copper i think is another good example we re already seeing some pullback in some inflationary pricing then the fed steps in and considerably raises its expectations for inflation this year and brings forward the time frame of when it will next raise interest rates they raised their headline inflation expectation to 3 4 that s a full percentage point higher than in march they did not give an indication of when they would begin cutting back on their aggressive bond buying program the forecast if you read between the lines and actually take some of the verbatim suggests two interest rate hikes in 2023 they re still committed to their inflation goal of 2 over the long run they raised their gdp expectations for this year to 7 from 6 5 unemployment estimate remains unchanged at 4 5 it s really interesting to see what happened in the market the day after the fed made all these announcements the day after tech stocks were up breathing a sigh of relief that the fed is going to fight inflation they re doing something about it interest rates will likely be higher and inflation won t be as bad the dow jones index was down because folks are saying well if the fed is going to actually combat inflation then maybe commodity prices are going to come back down that impacts a lot of the stocks and dow jones industrial average but it s so interesting because one day stocks could react to the increase in interest rates one way and then very next day they could go the exact opposite for another reason traders and institutional investors are an interesting bunch what we learned to summarize everything i just said was that the fed is steering the ship they see inflation they don t think it s all transitory they do stand ready to fight it with somewhat higher interest rates which will still be historically low depending on how much they hike 2023 is likely the time they ll do that and the economy does look like it s relatively strong as measured by their expectations for gdp hill i just love that some small number of people flipped out because we might have two interest rate hikes in 2023 as though there is no way the fed changes its mind in the next two years gross so many things can happen literally everything from pandemic related things to geopolitical things to market cycles if you look at the market by all measures the market s expensive you can look at so many different things you could look at the shiller cape ratio which is the cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio that s basically like the second highest it s ever been if you look at the warren buffett indicators of market cap to gdp all time high we ve had free money for a long time interest rates have been close to zero for a long time lots of money pumped into the economy stocks have been on fire for a long time they re just high right now in terms of valuation and there s not necessarily anything to panic with respect to that you can be concerned we might see a pullback in fact we always see a pullback within a reasonable period of time and then we regroup good companies build back earnings get posted and the stock market moves higher we could be at a point like that now especially with interest rates expected to rise if we do get a pullback if we get a little bit of a breather it s actually natural and that you shouldn t panic as long as you don t have money in the market that you need over the next three to five years hill maybe it s because we re starting summer and here in the u s things are opening back up people are getting out of their homes going on vacations etc is it me or is volatility coming down it just seems like things are a little bit calmer in the market than they were three six months ago gross i think you do see volatility as measured even by the vix a little bit lower than where it had been over the last year every three months not even necessarily surrounding earnings time you saw a spike but now it s on the wane i think even more importantly than something like the volatility index or the vix you re seeing some speculative pockets i stole that word from schwab some speculative pockets that are in the market appear to be declining so spacs were this frothy crazy thing going on earlier in the year and last year spacs have come back down to earth i think you see some non profitable technology companies that were sky high and it s trading at really lofty valuations come back down to earth now that doesn t mean that they won t regroup become profitable at some point and be wonderful investments over the next five to 10 years but you ve seen some of that froth come out of the market the meme stocks are a whole other animal i don t know if we can say that they ve waned you look at what s happening with amc or naked brand is a new one there s one called castor maritime that the reddit community has taken a liking to those remain and i don t even know how i think we don t play that we just ignore that let s just invest not trade hill speaking of the meme stocks you and i inadvertently got caught up in the meme stocks in a small way in that we were both shareholders at bed bath beyond bbby just to provide the context we were doing motley fool money this was the end of 2019 the story around bed bath beyond was that mark tritton who is a very accomplished retail executive from target had gone over to become the ceo he i think within a month of taking the job essentially cleaned house of the executive ranks and you and i just looked at that situation and said well this is something to keep an eye on because he clearly knows what he wants to do and has set things up as look this is my plan and either you re on board or you re not if you re not then let s talk about having you leave cut to spring of 2020 the stock gets just crushed i think at about the same time maybe even certainly the same week you and i both independently were like i think i m going to buy some shares of the stock gross yeah hill yet it got caught up in the meme stuff my memory of the day this was a few weeks ago i was doing marketfoolery and you sent me a message on slack you just wrote bed bath beyond up 37 20 minutes later i was done with the show i got to look i was like well let me see if that s still the situation it was up 47 gross yeah hill on that day i just decided ok it s time to go i just sold my share did you sell all of your shares of bed bath beyond or did you keep some gross i kept 100 shares but i sold the majority of my stake and that was really something we were buying this we don t always buy stocks to play turnarounds in fact i rarely do nowadays but this was when i was really interested in owning i was really impressed with what tritton did at target i loved that he was selling off non core assets he was really strengthening the balance sheet he was as you said changing the management team moving more into private label i was really interested in watching it and there s no better way to watch it than when you are a shareholder and you ve got some skin in the game i was almost disappointed when the stock price and market cap all of a sudden for no reason at all reflected the fact that he won he was right he restructured the company and everything is perfect he didn t need to do that because the meme stock thing ramped up his stock price for him i was disappointed when i said i can t be silly about this if the market is handing me a gift i m going to take the gift bed bath beyond actually shouldn t theoretically be at 40 a share yet until tritton proves he is turning this ship even if it gets to 40 i m not sure it s going to get to 50 or 60 or 70 or certainly no time soon so it just made sense to take the gift that we were given luckily it was long term capital gains by the way i think for both of us and we moved along i m not going to look a gift horse in the mouth but i m still very interested to watch what happens at bed bath beyond hill i am too but it reminded me of something this was a member event that the motley fool had at the westin hotel near fool hq in alexandria bill mann was on a panel i think you might have been on the panel with him i m pretty sure charly travers was as well i m going to paraphrase the first part of what bill said he was asked a question and talked about all the usual things in terms of look we like to focus on the business we like to hold for the long term that s the best way to win but then he punctuated it by saying but to be clear every stock i own is for sale at the right price gross yeah hill he s look there are companies i own shares of i love these companies but if someone s going to offer me a ridiculous multiple i m going to take that price i thought of that quote on that day a few weeks ago and i just thought all right look i like this story i believe in tritton i believe in what he is doing there if you re going to hand me a ridiculous multiple on a stock i ve owned for just over a year i m going to take it gross it s just prudent investing it really is i know we fall in love with our companies and we want to think like long term shareholders and we really and truly do but you also have to be prudent if at 40 a share bed bath is either going to produce a subpar return going forward perhaps a negative return a 2 3 there s better places for your money in that case just in terms of portfolio optimization portfolio allocation it makes sense to sell and reallocate to something better hill before i let you go i m curious what you re going to be watching in the second half of 2021 personally i look at the earnings season we got coming up in july i know how important the back to school shopping season is for major retailers so i m curious to hear what people like brian cornell and doug mcmillon and other retail executives are saying about what they are seeing and expecting in august and september but that s me what are you going to be watching gross i like that i ll be looking at that too there s a few things for me and some of it s related to this inflation conversation we had if inflation continues to be an issue it will be really interesting to watch if the typical inflation plays are beneficiaries as they have been in the past are commodity companies going to do well real estate and reits for example typically do well in an inflationary environment high dividend stocks conversely don t do well in an inflationary environment i want to keep an eye on that energy sector is another one lots of interesting plays from an inflation interest rate perspective i ll be watching but just more generally i m really going to be interested to take a look and keep an eye on the reopening stock specifically the airlines and the hotels i want to see this business travel come back i want to see if personal travel gets back to the level that they seem to be indicating that it will then i also want to keep an eye on infrastructure stocks it looks like there might at least be some kind of a bipartisan deal that biden and the congress can get through it s not going to be three or four trillion it could be close to a trillion that s going to be really interesting to me to see if all of a sudden we across our neighborhoods are seeing our roads all repaired or our bridges all repaired who is going to be the beneficiaries is it going to be vulcan materials or nucor or freeport mcmoran lots of industrial companies a lot of commodity companies could be interested to keep an eye on those guys as well hill ron gross loved talking to you thanks for being here gross thank you chris i appreciate it hill as always people on the program may have interest in these stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear that s going to do it for this edition of marketfoolery this show is mixed by dan boyd i m chris hill thanks for listening we ll see you tomorrow

tailwinds are forming behind the solar industry what happened solar energy stocks started the week off on a hot streak with several jumping by double digit percentages on monday manufacturer canadian solar csiq 7 36 jumped by as much as 12 6 while supplier enphase energy enph 1 95 was up 7 8 developer renesola sol 2 73 rose 10 3 and residential and commercial developer sunpower spwr 7 61 was up 11 8 at its peak those stocks closed the day up 12 5 7 4 8 7 and 11 8 respectively solar stocks have gone through some big volatile swings over the past year but during the past week they have moved sharply higher in unison some of that may stem from momentum trading but there has been some good news around the industry as well so what momentum started last week when democratic sen jon ossoff of georgia introduced legislation that would give tax credits to manufacturers throughout the solar energy supply chain the idea of giving incentives to onshore solar manufacturing has gotten more support in washington than some observers may have expected the impact this bill would have on the solar industry if it becomes law isn t 100 clear right now but manufacturers would likely be the first beneficiaries that would help explain why canadian solar and enphase are up they are market leaders in their niches early reporting from pv magazine says that under the proposed legislation solar modules would get a credit of 11 cents per watt cells would get 4 cents wafers would get 12 per square meter and polysilicon could get 3 per kilogram those are generous initial numbers though so it s reasonable to expect that negotiations in congress could dial them back downstream some cost savings from u s manufacturing could be passed on to developers like renesola and sunpower although the real benefit that this bill might have for them is simply that it would help solar energy become cheaper and more popular in the u s there s no knowing yet precisely what this legislation will look like by the time it reaches key votes in congress assuming it gets that far and even if it does the bill may not pass so for now investors should base their decisions on the idea that it ll be business as usual for solar companies with a possible nudge of tax help on the horizon the other factor that was helping solar energy stocks monday was that interest rates declined further the yield on the 10 year u s treasury fell by 5 basis points to 1 48 lower interest rates help solar developers by lowering their cost of capital which allows them to cut the prices they charge for electricity increase their margins or both it was most likely those lower interest rates that provided the largest boost to sunpower and renesola on monday now what an environmentally friendly atmosphere in washington was a major reason why solar energy stocks rose late last year and early in 2021 now it looks like the industry s hopes for some federal support are starting to turn into legislative proposals that have at least some chance of passing bond yields rose notably in the past year but they ve edged lower in recent months which helps solar companies if rates remain low and the costs to end users come down with the help of tax incentives it could create a new boom in the u s solar industry and that s what investors were reacting to monday
activtrades weekly by ricardo evangelista www activtrades bs on wednesday june 16 the united states federal reserve stunned observers announcing the intention to start rising interest rates at some point in 2023 bringing the dot plot forward by a full year prior to june 16 central bank officials spent months dismissing inflationary fears insisting spikes in consumer prices were to be expected in a post lockdown scenario of booming economic activity highlighting the transitory nature of the phenomena and insisting on the importance of maintaining monetary stimulus in place in order to support the economic recovery so the announcement took the financial markets by surprise with investors who had bought heavily into growth stocks left fearing the end of the reflationary trade cycle after 14 months of growth the sudden change in investors sentiment triggered an increase in market volatility as many panicked and tried to close positions causing losses of several percentage points in major stock indices around the world with risk aversion suddenly taking over meanwhile the us dollar index which measures the performance of the greenback versus a basket of six other major currencies gained more than one percent within a few hours of the announcement this dollar rally continued over the days that followed climbing another full percentage point before the markets closed for the week on friday however despite the shock to outsiders the timing of this announcement appears to have been carefully plotted with the aim of minimising the potential negative impact over the financial markets no less than 11 public appearances by fed officials were scheduled for the week that followed the pivot including the chairman s testimony to congress several fed policy makers have since used public appearances to insist that although they are now thinking about considering raising rates such move is still over the horizon dismissing the idea of pre emptive action being taken in order to contain potential inflationary risks committing to only act should those risks materialise the federal reserve did what it would have to do at some point start the conversation on bringing forward the timing of the tapering as it is undeniable that inflationary risks are growing with the price of housing and commodities such as oil contributing significantly to exacerbate rising core prices central banks have two ways to influence the behaviour of economic agents do something ie actually increasing interest rates or talk about doing it june 16 offered a classic example of the latter faced with the dilemma of needing to tighten policies to contain the threat of inflation a move that entails the risk of damaging the economic recovery and wreaking havoc in the financial markets the fed gave the world a nudge a sign of readiness without actually doing anything since june 16 market volatility fizzled out and stock indexes reached new all time highs it may still be too soon for a final analysis of this episode but early evidence points at a master class in central bank communication by the federal reserve
it s surprising how much this stock move matters to investors wall street opened the new week in a mixed mood as investors are starting to look forward to seeing what second quarter earnings reports have to say about the state of the economic recovery as of noon edt the dow jones industrial average dji 1 09 was down 170 points to 34 263 pulling back from recent gains however the s p 500 gspc 0 95 managed to pick up 1 point to 4 281 and the nasdaq composite ixic 0 84 saw larger gains of nearly 100 points to 14 460 u s investors are used to focusing on the domestic stock market where most of the action is indeed many foreign companies list on u s exchanges so that they can give american investors easier access to their shares what many u s investors haven t seen before is the positive impact that can result when a foreign company whose shares are already listed in the u s decides to do an initial public offering on another country s exchange on monday jinkosolar jks 1 09 became the latest company to benefit from such a maneuver shining in the sun shares of jinkosolar were trading up by 21 at midday on monday that brought its two day gains to almost 37 as the solar specialist made investors happy in several different ways the gains that jinkosolar stock saw last week were related primarily to its latest earnings report quarterly shipments of solar modules climbed almost 34 year over year and the company managed to weather declines in revenue and net income reasonably well given the impacts of the global pandemic and economic slowdowns worldwide despite some price increases for raw materials that have had an adverse impact on demand jinkosolar remains optimistic about the long term prospects for its business on monday jinkosolar said that its primary operating subsidiary had submitted initial documents with the hopes of doing an initial public offering on the shanghai sci tech innovation board known as the star market jinkosolar expects to issue a maximum of 2 67 billion new shares the planned sale will represent 10 to 25 of the subsidiary s outstanding shares following the offering jinkosolar s stake in the subsidiary will therefore shrink from 73 to roughly 55 after the offering assuming it sells the maximum number of shares that it s contemplating the company intends to use the cash generated for the construction of an r d center and production lines in the chinese city of haining current jinkosolar investors seem pleased to see the company monetizing its stake in its subsidiary perhaps with the expectation that ipo related hype will lift share prices more broadly jinkosolar has had the plan in place since late last year and shareholders like that the company is moving forward with it driving higher yet jinkosolar isn t the only company that s benefited from dual listing news lately another is xpeng xpev 0 99 the chinese electric vehicle manufacturer decided to list its shares first in the u s but now it s looking to raise capital closer to home last week xpeng announced that it would list its shares on the hong kong stock exchange by doing so it hopes to broaden the funnel on a global effort to raise roughly 2 billion xpeng s presence on the hong kong exchange will be fairly small the company expects to make just 4 25 million shares available there roughly 5 of what it intends to offer worldwide the remaining 95 will be aimed at institutional investors globally thinking globally increasingly as more foreign companies start doing business globally investors can expect them to go public in a variety of different forums each ipo in a new location won t necessarily warrant a big share price move higher however if those offerings succeed in unlocking new value investors might start getting used to seeing multiple listings as a net positive for a stock
international travel is likely not coming back anytime soon what happened international focused airlines were under pressure on monday due to new restrictions imposed by countries trying to fight the delta variant of the coronavirus shares of american airlines group aal 3 87 led the decline down as much as 5 in midday trading so what after a miserable 2020 airlines have rebounded nicely so far this year as vaccines have gained traction and travelers have returned to the skies but for the most part it has been a domestic recovery and more lucrative international travel remains muted fresh developments in fighting the pandemic suggest we will not see a return of robust international travel anytime soon parts of australia have begun a two week lockdown as cases of the so called delta variant of the virus have increased and in europe a number of countries are taking steps to limit international travel in response to the threat in good times full service airlines including american united airlines holdings ual 2 46 and delta air lines dal 2 28 generate a significant portion of their profits from international travel and even as progress is made in the u s the industry is going to suffer some until there is again unfettered travel around the globe now what the new virus threats are compounding an already murky future for the airlines with american and others also facing pilot shortages and other staffing issues these big companies tried to be conservative last year when cutting personnel in response to the outbreak but are now struggling to adequately staff a recovery shares of american have doubled from spring 2020 lows and it does seem clear that the worst is now over for an industry hard hit by the pandemic but the news flow monday is a reminder that it isn t all clear skies ahead and that there is likely a limit to how high these shares can fly in the near term the stocks are selling off as a result

the proposal submitted in march aims to make venice a world sustainability capital and hopes to tap some of the 222 million euros a355 million in eu recovery funds to help hard hit italy relaunch from the pandemic venice is in danger of disappearing if we don t stop and reverse this venice in 10 years will be a desert where you turn the lights on in the morning and turn them off in the evening said nicola pianon a venice native and managing director of the boston consulting group whose strategic plan for venice informed the region s proposal the proposal responds to venetians urgency to reclaim their city from the mass tourism that peaked at some 25 million individual visitors in 2019 and stanch the exodus of 1 000 venetians each year it envisions investments of up to 4 billion euros to attract 12 000 new residents and create 20 000 new jobs as much as venetians groan at the huge tourist flows the pandemic also revealed the extent to which the relationship is symbiotic along with lost tourist revenue venetians suffered a drastic reduction in public transport heavily subsidised by tourist traffic even city museums could not afford to reopen to residents when lockdowns eased venice without tourists became a city that could not serve its own citizens said anna moretti an expert in destination management at venice s ca foscari university the pandemic paused the city s plans to introduce a day tripper tax last year on visitors who sleep elsewhere 80 per cent of the total tourist footfall some 19 million day trippers visited in 2019 spending just 5 euros to 20 euros each according to boston consulting on the other side of that equation the 20 per cent of tourists who spend at least one night in venice contribute more than two thirds of all tourist revenue a reservation system with an access fee is expected to launch sometime in 2022 to manage day visitors with an eye on monitoring daily tourist arrivals the city set up a state of the art smart control room near the main railroad bridge last year that identifies how many visitors are in venice at any moment using cell phone data that also reveals their country of origin and location in the city the technology means that future reservations can be monitored with qr codes downloaded on phones without the need to set up check points pianon said the plan is feasible in a city like venice which has a limited number of access points and is just 5 square kilometres in area relaunching more sustainable tourism in venice would require diverting tourists to new destinations encouraging more overnight stays discouraging day trips and enabling the repopulation of the city with new residents much could go wrong tourist operators are desperate for business to return and there is a pent up global desire to travel in addition many changes being sought by regional and city officials must be decided in rome including any limits on commercial zoning or airbnb rental properties i think the level of dystopia that we had reached was of such a scale that there has to be a reaction said carlo bagnoli head of an innovation lab venisia at ca foscari university there are many projects emerging from many places certosa island after more than a decade is still a work in progress but its success is in the numbers 3 000 visitors each weekend

united nations ap â u n experts are accusing russian military instructors and the central african republic forces they are supporting of â excessive use of force indiscriminate killings the occupation of schools and looting on a large scaleâ allegations moscow strongly rejected monday the panel of experts monitoring sanctions on the conflict torn african nation said in a 40 page report obtained monday by the associated press that it collected â testimonies from a large number of local officials government military and internal security forces and community level sources in multiple locations in the country who reported â the active participation of russian instructors in combat operations on the ground â the panel said many of the officials and other sources reported that russian instructors â often led rather than followedâ central african republic troops as they advanced on different towns and villages in a counter offensive against rebels linked to former president francois bozize bozize tried to prevent elections in december and then attempted to seize power from president faustin archange touadera kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov categorically denied the allegations first reported in the new york times that russian instructors were involved in killing civilians and looting homes â russian military advisers couldnâ t take part and didnâ t take part in any killings or lootings â peskov said in a conference call with reporters â this is yet another lie â the mineral rich central african republic has faced deadly inter religious and inter communal fighting since 2013 a peace deal between the government and 14 rebel groups was signed in february 2019 but violence blamed on bozize and his allies threatens to nullify the agreement it erupted after the constitutional court rejected bozizeâ s candidacy to run for president in december and has continued since touadera won a second term later that month with 53 of the vote the experts said russia informed the u n security council committee monitoring sanctions on the central african republic in december that it would send 300 unarmed instructors to support the training of the countryâ s infantry and motorized forces and that those deployed did not take part in military operations carried out by the security forces the coordinator of the russian instructors told the panel they were all russians recruited from an association of primarily former military officers and had not been hired by â a private company â contrary to reports by a u n human rights commission working group and a number of media outlets the report said last week the u s britain and france accused russian personnel in central african republic of committing abuses against civilians and obstructing u n peacekeeping â accusations russia angrily denied the western powers linked the russian personnel to the notorious wagner group a private security company allegedly tied to yevgeny prigozhin a businessman who has been indicted in the united states on charges of meddling in the 2016 presidential election and whose companies have reportedly secured lucrative mining contracts in central african republic according to the expertsâ findings russia confirmed on april 18 that it had 532 instructors in the african country and had never exceeded 550 but the panel noted multiple sources estimated the number of russian instructors at between 800 and 2 100 and said multiple sources reported the instructors included individuals who identified themselves as nationals of libya syria and other countries although the sanctions committee was informed that the instructors would be unarmed the panel said it â directly observed and received testimonies that russian instructorsâ supporting government military operations and providing close protection to central african republic officials â were armed â it said russian officials confirmed that instructors were armed saying that it was for their own protection and that weapons were only used â when fired upon â it said the arms and ammunition came from stocks russia provided to the ministry of defense a breach of end user commitments to the sanctions committee by central african republic s president in 2018 and 2019 the panel said that in several areas it visited its experts received confidential information and found evidence of excessive use of force by central african republic s military and russian instructors as one example it said a commercial truck driving to the capital bangui was arriving at a temporary checkpoint on dec 28 2020 in grimari in south central ouaka prefecture when soldiers appeared and ordered the driver to stop according to eyewitnesses as he was trying to stop the soldiers started shooting from both sides and russian instructors opened fire from the front it said the panel said three civilians were killed and 15 were injured including six women and a minor many with multiple bullet wounds local officials found no evidence of a connection in the truck to armed groups it said and the russian coordinator denied any involvement the panel said that during an operation against rebels backing bozize in bambari the capital of ouaka prefecture on feb 15 government troops and russian instructors entered al takwa mosque shooting without respect to its religious nature or making any effort to distinguish between fighters and civilians according to local sources there were 17 victims including some fighters but the panel said it was able to confirm that at least six people who died were civilians the experts said they received â numerous reports of indiscriminate killings against unarmed civilians by russian instructors they said they were able to confirm with local officials or eyewitnesses a number of such incidents including the shooting of an unarmed man feb 21 the killings of two disabled civilians and the shooting of two civilians from the fulani tribe march 8 in many locations where government soldiers and russian instructors passed through or deployed the panel said it received accounts of looting of houses and buildings with items ranging from livestock to mattresses as well as money and motorbikes it said humanitarian groups were also targeted citing as an example statements about the march 18 looting of an unnamed humanitarian organization in the capital of northwest ouham prefecture where goods taken included kits for victims of sexual violence worth about 1 850 ___ associated press writer vladimir isachenkov in moscow

travellers from the us and businessowners in the local hospitality industry are querying the rationale behind cayman making the five day quarantine option available only to those vaccinated locally or in the uk when vaccine certificates from other countries are accepted for the 10 day quarantine chief medical officer dr john lee has said that currently only those with cayman health services authority vaccination cards and people who can show their vaccination information on the uk s national health services app can avail of the five day quarantine this is because these are the only certificates the cayman authorities feel they can safely verify amid concerns over fake documentation incoming travellers with vaccination certificates from other countries are still required to quarantine for 10 days while unvaccinated travellers must isolate for 14 days several readers have contacted the cayman compass to complain about the policy of only accepting uk and cayman certificates for the five day quarantine stating that certificates from the us are accepted in many countries and are also accepted in cayman for the 10 day quarantine cita questions basis for selective 5 day quarantine dr michael tibbetts vice president of the cayman islands tourism association and owner of three dive resorts in cayman wrote to lee governor martyn roper and deputy governor franz manderson over the weekend to query the basis on which local health authorities were refusing to accept non uk or non cayman certificates for the five day quarantine he made a copy of his letter available to the compass advertisement he said more than 22 countries worldwide as well as several eu countries have announced they will accept us vaccination certificates tibbetts stated in his letter i simply can t foresee that fraud should be a legitimate concern given the ease of obtaining a vaccine in the us right now available at virtually any pharmacy with a same day appointment this might be an issue in other countries without vaccine availability but that can easily be addressed with restrictions on countries of origin i have a us vaccination card and i must say it would take some effort to forge given the unique size card stock and ink this would be much harder than changing a pdf and printing it out the truth is that any future digital vaccine passport will simply be converting a printed vaccination card into a digital one as there is no central registry of the 150m americans that have been fully vaccinated he said the cayman islands government s policy to reject us vaccination cards for the five day quarantine period undermines confidence in a viable path to reopening for american travelers to cayman and he asked the government to reconsider its position he told the compass on monday the cig can verify us vaccination cards for the 10 day reduced quarantine but not the 5 day quarantine how does that make sense according to us news and world report as of 21 june a total of 32 countries accept fully vaccinated us travellers including caribbean jurisdictions such as british virgin islands barbados the bahamas belize and anguilla rules regarding quarantine and covid testing for vaccinated arrivals vary from country to country with some requiring quarantine until the results of covid tests upon arrival are returned while others do not require vaccinated travellers to undergo any isolation period only securely verifiable certificates allowed in an emailed response to questions from the compass on monday including why the vaccination certificates were acceptable for 10 day quarantine but not for five day quarantine lee sent the following statement there are significant global concerns around counterfeit covid 19 documentation which every country is facing and we wish to protect ourselves from this potential threat securely verifiable documentation is something that all countries are urgently seeking to introduce and we hope to achieve this with increasing numbers of travellers as soon as we have the technology in place to do so this will be on a country or system wide basis in an interview with government s cigtv last week the chief medical officer elaborated on why cayman was accepting only the local and uk certificates for the five day quarantine option he said people entering cayman who have completed the full course of the pfizer biontech astrazeneca moderna or johnson johnson s janssen vaccines must quarantine for 10 days unless they have received those vaccines in cayman or the uk as those are the only two places issuing vaccine certificates that the cayman authorities can securely verify at this stage the uk s nhs has an app that shows if a person is vaccinated which can be presented to customs and border control officers by incoming travellers lee said in the cigtv segment when you log in cbc can ask you to do it in front of them so they can see you are logging in and you can demonstrate that you have been vaccinated he said he added that the nhs was producing certificates with a lot of security features like coloured thermochromic ink that changes with temperatures things which would make it difficult to photocopy backgrounds which are very difficult to reproduce we re also working to find out exactly what those features are and to have cbc officers trained so that they recognise that he said cayman was working hard on apps to be able to read the secure verification and when that comes in it s likely we will be able to extend for example that to all the european union certificates for vaccination evidence or pcr testing lee said cayman was working with cerner the healthcare information technology system that the hsa uses to ensure that when people who have been vaccinated on island travel overseas their vaccination certifications can be verified securely using an app or a qr code noting that cerner is a us company he said we are expecting in the states they will have a similar system for everyone that s been vaccinated there it might take a few weeks we think it ll take a short period of time rather than a longer period of time before they can also demonstrate secure evidence of vaccination family asks why us vaccination is not verifiable one local family got in touch with the cayman compass over the weekend to say they felt they had adequately provided verifiable online documentation from the us to health authorities here regarding their daughter s vaccination status after she was told she needed to quarantine for 10 days the teenager flew into cayman from school in the us on wednesday 23 june the day regulations were updated to include a five day quarantine for people whose vaccination certificates could be securely verified what the family did not realise at the time of booking her flight was that the cayman islands authorities could only verify the hsa and nhs certificates the family who did not want their name published said they had contacted health minister sabrina turner on thursday they said she told them if they could provide verifiable online evidence that the teen had been vaccinated the matter would be looked into that was late thursday the father said by friday morning i had three items showing verification of the us vaccine these included a copy of the prescription from walgreen s pharmacy showing the dates the daughter received her pfizer biontech vaccine as well as an email from the board of health in the state in which she was vaccinated and a link to the website of color a healthcare technology company that has partnered with the state which showed the girl s inoculation information the teenager s family members returned to cayman from the us on 16 june and because they had been vaccinated earlier in cayman they had a 10 day quarantine which was due to end on sunday 27 june now they say they will have to remain in quarantine with her until she completes her 10 day isolation period next week the girl s father said he and his wife will have served 18 days of quarantine as fully vaxed and negative testing on arrival individuals if we don t get the five days approved

amc entertainment nyse amc stock has been one of the best performing assets of 2021 up 2 785 for the year it has truly soared amc has a legion of loyal investors willing to pump it on reddit and twitter which has led to it defying wall street s expectations in fact amc investors have caused wall street to experience some actual losses according to a reuters article shorts lost 512 million in a single trading day this month it s been a wild ride no question about it and it leads naturally to the question could another movie theatre stock be next certainly most movie theatre chains are in about the same boat that amc is in that is to say they re currently suffering depressed revenue but are certain to recover when the pandemic is over just recently the film f9 had a record setting opening weekend signaling the return to normal life for movie theatre companies if that benefits amc then it probably benefits companies like cineplex tsx cgx as well in this article i ll explore whether cineplex has the potential to rally like amc did or whether it will deliver much more tepid returns how cineplex is similar to amc cineplex shares many similarities with amc it s a movie theatre chain its revenue abruptly collapsed in 2020 it is expected to see revenue surge in 2021 with the post pandemic recovery in 2020 amc saw its revenue decline from 5 4 billion to 1 2 billion in cineplex s case it was from 700 million to 132 million the decline was similar in percentage terms 77 7 for amc 81 for cineplex yet one company s stock has rallied out of control this year while the other has risen much less in the next section i ll explore why that s the case and why ultimately cineplex probably will not become a meme stock like amc how it s different despite all the similarities it shares with amc cineplex is very different in other ways here are the most important ones cineplex is not a meme stock getting massive amounts of coverage on reddit cineplex is based in canada which has generally had stricter and longer lasting lockdown policies than the united states cineplex has not received massive cash inflows from equity sales like amc has and may therefore have a harder time staying solvent given these differences it appears unlikely that cineplex will become the next amc it is very similar as a business but it has not received the kind of social media hype that let s be honest is responsible for most of amc s gains this year there is one interesting thing to note though cineplex does appear to be a decent candidate for a short squeeze about 25 of its trading volume is short according to shortdata ca which would result in a pretty big spike when shorts are forced to cover that s something investors could keep in mind when considering going long cgx however shorts still have over 100 days to cover so you can t reasonably expect a squeeze to occur anytime soon

update governor inslee announced on tuesday that he is allocating 100 000 in state strategic reserve funds to keep point roberts only grocery store the international marketplace open for residents previously owner ali hayton had been planning to close the store due to the loss in revenue i have been subsidizing this for 15 months and i can t do it anymore hayton said original story a community teetering on the edge of financial collapse that is the reality that the fire chief of point roberts says the u s canada border closure has forced upon his town after 16 months of the border being shut to both sides point roberts fire chief christopher carleton says the small waterfront town is all but destroyed the community shares a land border only with canada and can only be accessed from the rest of washington by boat or by driving a short distance through british columbia it sits on the end of a spit that reaches just below the 49th parallel rendering it a part of washington rather than british columbia when the border was drawn canada to ease some restrictions but u s canada border still closed but because americans and canadians alike have been barred from crossing the border to visit point roberts unless it is for a purpose considered essential the town has lost the visitors it relies on upwards of 70 of our properties are internationally owned by canadians and that s what we don t have at this point carleton said he added that washingtonians who have second homes in point roberts also cannot get in because it is not deemed essential then there are the american day trippers who would normally visit especially this time of year now point roberts is facing the loss of a second summer we don t have the daily flow of customers coming through our businesses because we have no influx coming into our community carleton said adding every business we have here is at a critical point of complete failure and shuttering forever small businesses have shut down or drastically reduced their hours cutting jobs and if the border doesn t reopen soon carleton believes every one of those mom and pops will be gone that includes the town s single grocery store the loss of which would deprive residents of on site necessities carleton pointed out that small shops and restaurants around the country have suffered greatly during the pandemic but at least other businesses in washington have still been able to sell to americans for point roberts businesses who have lost out on both nationalities of visitors even the pandemic grants they ve received are not enough to keep them alive much longer then there are the problems that point roberts residents run into in daily life for those without a private boat the only way to get to bellingham is by the foot ferry set up as an emergency during the pandemic the ferry which leaves point roberts twice a day on mondays and thursdays drops a person off in bellingham s fairhaven neighborhood across the city from from the kinds of large stores where people may want to stock up on resources it doesn t allow people who need a vehicle to go down to fairhaven we have people who live on 400 a month in my community and they don t have the money to spend on a taxi or an uber or a lyft carleton said you can t do a big run for supplies on a ferry this means a person is forced to buy only what they can carry sometimes residents are able to drive down to bellingham but carleton noted that based on residents experiences whether or not a person can drive to costco as an essential trip largely depends upon the officer who would be in the booth at the time carleton believes that when a person s ability to get basic necessities hinges on the whims of a border guard people are not being treated with the compassion and respect they deserve i truly believe that we ve lost a piece of humanity he said point roberts properties that belong to canadians are also getting overgrown because no one is checking on them carleton noted that this can pose a danger to the community governor inslee said last week that he is working on behalf of point roberts residents to get the border open and will be reaching out to them to see what necessities they need in the meantime however inslee pointed out that the decision rests not with him but with the federal government i m a frustrated governor by this and i will continue to urge both the executive branch and congress do do this as soon as possible inslee said and in the interim we will look for ways as we have to assist these affected communities carleton is appreciative of what governor inslee and washington s members of congress have done but he wants more action to be taken by both federal governments to open the border as soon as possible allowing those who are partially or fully vaccinated to come into those communities that they own property in take care of those properties stay with us for the coming months during the summer spend their money with us realistically that means everything carleton said follow nicolekirofm

border closures popped bubbles etc it then chopped around for a while waiting for the daily case count update given the trend to date no doubt the market was anticipating another exponential increase on the weekend numbers but at 18 a lower figure there appeared a glimmer of hope thus the index ultimately closed flat it was not simply a case of as you were sector and stock moves suggested we re set to party like it s 2020 all over again winning individually were your previous stay at home stocks such as temple webster tpw kogan kgn and redbubble rbl which rose 10 2 6 6 and 8 2 respectively as to why you would want to replace all your furniture and homewares yet again is unclear note kogan is the most shorted stock on the market 11 8 temple webster is over 8 shorted maybe you d hit the online sites while a bit under the weather as another trend from last year would attest endeavour group edv shares rose 3 4 while the supermarkets had a good day and consumer staples was the best performing sector 1 5 hope you ve got your toilet paper the consumer discretionary winners above were of course countered by your travel stocks qantas qan down 4 0 flight centre flt 3 4 and webjet web 4 7 hence on the balance the discretionary sector rose 0 4 webjet is the second most shorted stock on the market 10 2 flight centre is over 9 shorted it s retail cold turkey time for millennials who can t get out to buy a new outfit on next week s wages afterpay apt fell 7 5 zip co z1p 7 0 and the tech sector 2 8 to be the standout worst performer the banks managed to hold flat despite increased bad debt implications although the market had already made an adjustment last week while the other bigger winner on the day after staples was healthcare 0 9 because that s where you go when people are sick the resource sectors all but sat it out with small gains while telcos fell 0 3 on the assumption businesses won t be able to pay their phone bills wall street posted a fairly similar rotation session last night as a well vaccinated us begins to acknowledge the delta threat around the globe the s p500 managed a 0 2 gain but our futures are down 15 points this morning stand by for the 11am case count update also complicating today and tomorrow is end of year rebalancing more on that below zoom zoom sydney s predicament has not been lost on wall street as markets opened last night after our weekend developments the fact australia had done so well last year but is now struggling with delta is a point of concern and it s not just us delta is impacting around the globe including the us hong kong spain and portugal have banned flights from the uk the us has made up for a dismissive 2020 response under trump with an excellent vaccination rollout under biden yet still there are new hotspots in which delta is prevailing and plenty of americans refuse to be vaccinated or are at least wary so the 2020 party we started here yesterday kicked on in the us last night with the likes of your stay at homers zoom and peloton posting solid gains along with the faags in the latter case the market was boosted late in the session by news a judge had dismissed an antitrust case brought against facebook by the us federal trade commission he did not dismiss the notion out of hand rather did not believe the argument that facebook should divest of either instagram or whatsapp or both given no lack of competition eg tik tok he basically said go back and try again and there remains another antitrust case in the offing brought by a group of us state attorneys general facebook jumped 4 on the news and the other faag s were also boosted facebook has now joined apple amazon and google in the us 1trn club microsoft which is not under any antitrust scrutiny remains at us 2trn and then its daylight down to the next big names such as your berkshire hathaways and teslas on around us 600bn on the matter of rebalancing which for the us is end of quarter and half rather than end of year the point to note is the s p500 has risen 7 over the quarter to ever new highs whereas us bond yield have remained relatively stable over the period unlike the prior quarter this means that passive 60 40 balanced funds the most popular of all investments are out of balance too overweight equity value which implies they need to buy bonds and sell stocks australia s experience is the same last night the us ten year bond yield fell 6 basis points to 1 48 having risen by about that on friday night s pce inflation number but stocks were not sold as a whole new highs again for the s p and nasdaq on another clear rotation session from value cyclicals and into growth the dow was the outright loser but around 50 points of the 150 point drop can be attributed to boeing the highest priced stock in the average on news its 777 x airliner will not receive faa approval until at least 2023 2020 original goal the energy sector was the biggest loser as for the first time in a while oil prices fell

over the last several years news of a racial wealth gap has flooded america s airwaves and print media according to those pushing the concept white americans have a great deal more in all respects than black americans and that therefore race based remedies tailored to upper income blacks such as reparations set asides and affirmative action must be deployed these racialist politics share one common feature they leave untouched the actual source of social inequality for workers of all races capitalism the concept of the racial wealth gap and the attendant idea of white privilege have been promoted by academics for some time but it is only recently that they have appeared broadly in the news media an analysis of newspaper articles on the archive newspapers com shows that the terms racial wealth gap racial wealth divide racial inequality and white privilege appeared 4 689 times in the 1990s and then more than tripled in the 2010s reaching 15 758 mentions over the 2020s that is just the last year and a half there have already been 10 658 references to these terms by contrast during the 1960s the height of the civil rights era they only appeared 4 560 times the deluge coincides with a massive growth in overall wealth and income inequality in the us and globally the wealthiest 10 percent of us households owns 34 5 times more than the bottom 50 percent and over the course of just 2020 they increased their fortune by more than 18 8 trillion about 1 53 million per household with far higher going to the super rich as the richest of all races have seen their fortunes climb into the stratosphere and their counterparts in the bottom 90 percent have seen theirs stagnate and crumble an obsessive focus on race has emerged it is being pumped into the veins of american society the purpose is to transform a looming class war into a race war the argument that the racial wealth gap is the most salient feature of american society today is to be blunt a fraud it is based on the tendentious selection and presentation of data there is nothing about it that is remotely progressive or left wing much less marxist as those on the political right claim before delving into the data it is essential to underscore one point race is neither biologically real nor socially immutable but when it comes to the creation of categories of people for the purposes of social analysis it is assumed that it is the data spin around the idea that there is some sort of clear distinction as to what constitutes a white household and what constitutes a black household even though people have always formed and increasingly continue to form family bonds across these lines each racial group in fact subsumes within it populations with extremely different histories so called white households may include the children of appalachian coal miners soviet jewish immigrants from the caucasus persians from modern day iran spaniards from the mediterranean arabs from morocco the great great great grandchildren of american slaves dispossessed palestinians and so on so called black households might include some of the same groups as well as caribbean islanders individuals from the indian subcontinent french immigrants of west african descent etc but census forms surveys and medical histories require americans to adopt some sort of racial identity the resulting data is then utilized to argue that race is the overwhelming determinant of social reality regardless of whether it is personally meaningful or significant in explaining any given individual s place in the social structure all other factors such as language culture citizenship status time of arrival in the united states role in the labor force and above all class are regarded as small change in the face of the concept of race the data when investigating the racial wealth gap mean and median wealth for different racial groups is commonly cited to demonstrate the existence of universal white privilege analysts and commentators draw on different data sources generally surveys the census and tax records of which the federal reserve s survey of consumer finances scf is frequently cited in 2020 the federal reserve published the results of its 2019 survey of consumer finances scf the data were picked up by the media with news articles on the findings appearing in many press outlets according to the scf in 2019 the typical white family had 188 200 in wealth and the typical black family had 24 100 he typical white family has 50 600 in equities they could tap into in an emergency compared to just 14 400 for the typical black family and 14 900 for the typical hispanic family the typical white families home value is 230 000 and the typical other families home value is 310 000 the typical black and hispanic families home values are lower at 150 000 and 200 000 respectively while the typical black or hispanic family has 2 000 or less in liquid savings the typical white family has more than four times that amount in the federal reserve s ten pages of analysis of the scf typical appears 25 times the use of the word gives the impression that the great majority of whites possess eight times more own homes worth 80 000 more and have quadruple the financial reserves of their black counterparts this implies that white families are overwhelmingly comfortable and secure and that they have tidy bundles in the bank but this is an intentionally distorted portrait of social reality in order to arrive at it analysts have to do several things first they attach to mathematical measures a social meaning that they lack second they remain silent about the scale of inequality that exists within racial groups and within society as a whole both of which dwarf by many times the racial wealth gap third they focus on strata of whites and blacks and make no mention of the absolute numbers of people that these percentages encompass because the white population is five to six times the size of the black population even if lower percentages of white households are poor in aggregate tens of millions of whites actually more share the same level of social deprivation as the most oppressed minorities returning to the question of the median wealth of white versus black households it is essential to realize that the description of this value as reflective of the wealth of the typical or average white family in the us is deceptive a median is a halfway point in a data set when dealing with wealth and income in which there is a massive chasm between the best and least well off a median is often a better measure of the overall situation than a mean commonly referred to as an average which is pulled upward by the super wealthy and extremely high income earners however under situations in which there are very high levels of inequality a median also hides more than it reveals using the median scf data found that half of all white families own more and half own less than 188 200 compared to 24 100 for the fiftieth percentile division among black families but what is lost by focusing on the median for the white population as a whole is the fact that among those who own less than the median tens of millions of families own vastly less massive numbers of white households are not experiencing anything like this allegedly typical reality according to scf data the bottom 20 percent of white households 18 6 million using an average household size of 2 53 about 47 million people own virtually nothing or are so indebted that the total value of their wealth is negative their reality is shared by the 30 percent of black households 4 5 million approximately 11 million people and 20 percent of latino households 3 4 million an estimated 8 6 million people using different data economist gabriel zucman calculated in 2014 that as much as 50 percent of the total us population nearly 160 million people at the time has zero or negative wealth in other words for the tens of millions of households that have zero or negative wealth the racial wealth gap is a meaningless concept it does not exist regardless of skin color no one has anything a more equitable distribution of wealth across the lower strata of racial groups would not pay a single bill for a poor black family for the simple reason that you cannot divide something that does not exist the united states is a sea of multi racial destitution according to the analysis of scf data by matt bruenig with the people s policy project the poorest 10 percent of the us population is about 54 percent white 27 percent black 12 percent hispanic and 3 percent some other group the next most impoverished layer is 42 percent white 32 percent black 20 percent hispanic and 5 percent other and the third one up from the bottom is 53 percent white 20 percent black 20 percent hispanic and 7 percent other when one gets to the top three deciles of wealth holders the racial composition begins to strongly favor whites the largest imbalance exists in the highest tier the racial wealth gap is primarily meaningful for elite african americans who are frustrated at being underrepresented where the vast majority of net worth is concentrated looking at the middle of the wealth pyramid white households whose net worth puts them in the fifth decile the 40th to 50th percentiles control just 1 5 percent of the total 93 82 trillion possessed by white households according to the federal reserve imagining this tiny share could be spread evenly among all families in that decile group it would amount to about 151 200 per household this is 30 000 shy of the median wealth of white households as a whole which is 188 200 and about 16 percent of the mean wealth of all white households which stands at around 950 000 the fifth decile of black households possess only 0 9 percent of the approximately 4 46 trillion held by all households in this racial categorization if we divided this share up evenly among fifth decile black households we find an average wealth for black families of about 26 760 white households in the parallel bracket in other words own about 5 5 times more than black households because african americans are overrepresented among the poor according to the racial wealth gap proponents having 151 200 which as federal reserve data show will be largely comprised of a partially paid off mortgage and a small retirement fund is an incredible level of white privilege however when we consider the privilege that accrues to the richest households of all races the real stratification in society becomes evident today the top 10 percent of white households control 74 4 percent of all the wealth for that group the situation for rich blacks is similar they have 70 6 percent of everything held by their racial category as a whole imagining that this is divided equally among the white households in the top 10 percent each would have a net worth of 7 5 million the equivalent number for black households is only 2 1 million inequality is greater among black households than among white households the average wealth of top white households and the fifth decile of white households technically families that fall somewhere near the middle of the wealth pyramid differs by a factor of nearly 50 comparing black households at the top to blacks in the fifth decile yields a difference of 78 5 times looking at the data cross racially we also see big differences between the wealthiest black families and middle class white families with the former being 14 times richer than the latter this gives the lie to the claim that all whites enjoy skin privilege the gap between the wealthiest white and wealthiest black households is 3 5 times tiny compared to what exists more broadly in society but because the volume of assets at stake at the upper echelons is so large such a discrepancy is intolerable to the richest african americans since the first quarter of 2020 total white household wealth has grown by 21 3 trillion and total black household wealth has increased by 1 12 trillion again the racial wealth gap proponents point to the fact that white household wealth grew by far more than that of black households but as the increase for both groups was driven by an extraordinary run up in stocks of which the bottom 50 percent of the population owns just 0 7 percent compared to 87 2 percent for the top 10 percent virtually all of this wealth has been captured by the rich of all races of the entirety of the wealth generated over the course of 2020 the bottom half of the population shared in just 2 8 percent in addition to net worth it is often emphasized that typical white families have significantly more back up reserves than blacks and hispanics again an image of relative security is imposed on white families but this betrays on the part of the government analysts journalists and academics with six figure salaries a complete lack of understanding of how what most people have really stacks up against the economic burdens they face the scf data show that the average black latino and white families have somewhere between 14 000 and 50 000 of equities including stocks mutual funds and retirement accounts that theoretically could be transformed into cash in the event of an emergency in addition the typical white family has 8 000 in liquid savings compared to the typical black family with just 2 000 that is white households it would appear have about four times as much but these numbers simply do not apply to the bottom 20 to 30 percent of any racial group who own nothing and four times a pittance is still a pittance while some white households are in a better position to hold out against financial blows for a longer period of time in the event of a job loss unexpected medical bill major home repair or similar disaster tens of thousands of dollars can swiftly evaporate a 2018 report based on a survey also conducted by the federal reserve found that four out of ten adults said they could not cope with an unexpected expense of just 400 the equivalent of a set of tires blown out on a freeway or a flu test not covered by insurance without taking out a loan overdrawing on their bank account borrowing from a friend or family member or simply not paying the bill among this group are tens of millions of people from all races this data took on a human face during the covid 19 crisis in the form of miles long lines of cars that appeared at food banks those queues were made up of families of all backgrounds who it seems somehow did not get the memo about their net worth equity and liquid savings calculated by the racial wealth gap specialists it must be stressed that the way the federal reserve measures net worth minimizes the wealth of the very richest who are very adept at hiding their fortunes while overstating the wealth in the working class in its calculation of household net worth the federal reserve includes unfunded pensions for instance of which 99 percent are promised to government employees when the 2019 scf data were released analysts highlighted the fact that more white households tend to have pensions and retirement accounts than black households however as gabriel zucman and emanuel saez noted in september 2020 unfunded pensions are not backed by anything they actually have no real value conclusion the overrepresentation of black families in the poorest strata of society is the outcome of history namely specific forms of capitalist exploitation for which racism provided ideological justification including slavery and sharecropping historically african americans have suffered from horrendous forms of prejudice and discrimination with many pushed into the most oppressed layers of the population as a consequence but the origins of racism do not lie in the dna of white people as is claimed by the n ew y ork times 1619 project but in capitalism the capitalist class foments divisions among workers in order to exercise its rule all those who insist that the racial wealth gap not the class gap is most important division in society do the same the dire conditions facing masses of black workers today arise out of a sweeping assault on living standards that started in the 1960s and 1970s and was overseen by both democrats and republicans black and white the advances of the civil rights movement and mass entry of african americans into industrial work in northern cities during the post world war ii era had just begun to lift sections of that population out of the extreme poverty and oppression of the jim crow era for a short time some black workers began to share in the rising living standards of the american working class experiencing modest gains that were won through hard fought class battles but the weakening global position of american capitalism led the us ruling class to determine that such concessions were intolerable while the south where many blacks lived remained poor deindustrialization hammered northern city after city such as chicago detroit milwaukee buffalo pittsburgh st louis and cleveland which were home to millions of blacks african american workers shared the fate of their class as a whole job losses wage cuts collapsing property values the destruction of whole communities but a narrow layer including a black elite shared in the spoils of the wreckage in the 1970s as the assault on the working class intensified affirmative action black capitalism and black power in the form of black mayors police chiefs and school boards were part of the thin gruel dished out to the residents of america s hollowed out cities they did nothing for the overwhelming majority of the african american population but a great deal for a small few the obsession with the racial wealth gap is intended to obscure these class realities hide this history and drown class anger in a toxic swamp of racial hatred social scientists expend incredible effort to suppress the reality of social class unlike race class is not a scientifically false category it arises objectively from control over the means of production there are those who own great wealth and those who labor to produce it but in contemporary american sociology class is at best of tertiary interest important to the allegedly more decisive categories of race gender and sexuality only as it intersects with them more often it is treated as essentially meaningless trotsky once explained that behind every social categorization is a political prognosis those that insist that universal white privilege is the cornerstone of modern american reality demand more racial equity in doing so they reveal more than they intend to in the original meaning of the term to have equity means to own stocks indeed this is what they are after it is to be achieved by impoverishing a section of the white population ensuring that poor blacks stay poor and growing the share of total wealth that goes to the african american population at the top class inequality is not only to remain untouched it is to be defended deepened and expanded

the united states doesn t need a central bank digital currency cbdc because such a thing will not notably improve the nation s financial system and also the us dollar isn t threatened by digital currencies nor other nations cbdcs so what s the point so said randal k quarles a member of the us federal reserve s board of governors and its vice chair for supervision in a speech delivered on monday to the 113th annual utah bankers association convention quarles said one argument he hears in favor of a us cbdc a government created cryptocurrency essentially is to counter private cryptocurrencies which he divided into two classes stablecoins and non stablecoins such as bitcoin and other cryptoassets as one might very well expect the vice chair was not kind to bitcoin which he likened to gold inasmuch as it is scarce and its price fluctuates unlike gold however which has industrial uses and aesthetic attributes quite apart from its vestigial financial role bitcoin s principal additional attractions are its novelty and its anonymity he added the anonymity will make it appropriately the target for increasingly comprehensive scrutiny from law enforcement and the novelty is a rapidly wasting asset gold will always glitter but novelty by definition fades bitcoin and its ilk will accordingly almost certainly remain a risky and speculative investment rather than a revolutionary means of payment quarles rated bitcoin et al as therefore highly unlikely to affect the role of the us dollar or require a response with a cbdc for what it s worth bitcoin isn t completely anonymous contrary to popular belief and its price in us dollars right now 34 500 is about what it started the year on nearly seven months ago though during that time it emerged above the 60 000 mark before crashing down taking investors on a rollercoaster given bitcoin has been running for about 12 years it s taking its sweet time to lose that novelty quarles was more enthusiastic about stablecoins crypto coins that are pegged to things like fiat currencies and precious metals which he argued have risks but are not so exotic that regulators like the fed don t understand how to manage them stablecoins could also improve international payments and that s an outcome the vice chair sees as desirable because the cost and complexity of such transactions are among the weaknesses he sees in america s current payment systems those systems he said are generally robust the united states large scale payment systems handle six trillion dollars of transfers each day without breaking a sweat quarles also noted that smaller payments can be slow and the fed has therefore created a new instant payment scheme to speed things up that scheme called fednow is due to commence operations soon the vice chair also considered whether a us cbdc would help the nation compete against those with digital currencies he concluded the us dollar s role as the dominant currency in international financial transactions won t be challenged by any cbdc gold will always glitter but novelty by definition fades bitcoin and its ilk will almost certainly remain risky the dollar s role in the global economy rests on a number of foundations including the strength and size of the us economy extensive trade linkages between the united states and the rest of the world deep financial markets including for us treasury securities the stable value of the dollar over time the ease of converting us dollars into foreign currencies the rule of law and strong property rights in the united states and last but not least credible us monetary policy he argued none of these are likely to be threatened by a foreign currency and certainly not because that foreign currency is a cbdc quarles also worried that a us cbdc would be expensive to establish represent an irresistible target for cyber attackers and could mean the fed effectively becomes a retail bank the vice chair nonetheless welcomed the fed s ongoing exploration of a cbdc but concluded i think the bar to establishing a us cbdc is a high one

if politicians decide where investment dollars are going we will soon be paying for hundreds of bankrupt solyndras and our tech leadership really will be in mortal peril no one is paying much attention but washington is building up a vast new multitrillion dollar welfare class corporate america deep inside president joe biden s budget are hundreds of billions of dollars of loans grants and loan guarantees for corporate america this aid to dependent corporations is most prevalent in the area of renewable energy despite more than 100 billion already doled out to wind and solar companies over the past 30 years the biden plan would enrich often very wealthy investors in solar and wind plants with another 100 to 200 billion in the president s green energy scheme for the past dozen years we keep hearing how much cheaper and more efficient the wind and solar industries are becoming and yet the subsidies keep getting more expensive and long lasting explain that one then there is another stash of tens of billions of taxpayer dollars for companies such as tesla and ford so they can make electric cars the government will also spend billions for road recharging stations wait a minute i don t recall uncle sam paying to build gas stations across the country these are mostly democratic initiatives but republicans are in on the gambit in early june the senate passed by a 68 32 margin what cnbc has called one of the largest bipartisan industrial bills in u s history the idea is to shower money to manufacturers semiconductor makers tech companies and the military industrial complex to allow america to compete more effectively with china the bill s price tag is 250 billion congress and the white house actually believe that politicians and government agencies can do a better job of allocating capital than our multitrillion dollar financial markets and venture capital firms brian deese the chief economist for the biden white house recently explained the rationale for erecting this new corporate welfare state the idea of an open free market global economy ignores the reality that china and other countries are playing by a different set of rules strategic public investment corporate welfare to shelter and grow champion industries is a reality of the 21st century economy that is a dangerous absurdity if you believe this you believe that al gore invented the internet and what has the government invested in over the last 20 years that has had a positive return the new york subway system back in the 1970s there was a big scare that japan s industrial policy the ministry of international trade and industry would overtake america s technological prowess liberals said we should imitate the hands on policies of the land of the rising sun instead ronald reagan was elected who cut investment taxes and cut government spending and since then the u s stock market has risen three times faster than japan s it was almost all private sector driven with tens of trillions of dollars of wealth created by the revolution in innovation in places such as silicon valley the last big government venture to partner with private industry happened in the obama years when his trillion dollar stimulus plan of 2009 wasted tens of billions of dollars on more than a dozen now bankrupt companies such as solyndra the quest to keep america dominant in 21st century industries in robotics bioengineering manufacturing 5g technologies 3d imaging artificial intelligence fracking technologies micronuclear power plants and so on is an honorable one but inventions and innovations almost never come from government when they do they often send companies on wild goose chases as they hunt down free government dollars instead of selling private investment capitalists on their business models operation warp speed wasn t so much a government directed program as a deregulation to get a vaccine in people s arms in record time if we want more investment what is the logic of the biden plan to raise taxes on private investment capital through higher personal income capital gains and dividend and corporate tax rates these will drain funding for private ventures and make investments in u s companies less attractive in after tax returns relative to investing in other countries such as china dumbest of all is that while congress ladles out trillions of dollars into new corporate welfare programs we now have bipartisan bills to break up monopolistic big tech companies including amazon apple facebook and google these firms have market capitalization of more than 6 trillion employ hundreds of thousands of american workers and arguably do more to spur american innovation than all the government programs in the history of the united states deese is dead wrong china and its communistic economic system will not outcompete the united states in the 21st century unless we are dumb enough to tax our own successful companies break them up if they are too successful and destroy our domestic energy industry if politicians decide where investment dollars are going we will soon be paying for hundreds of bankrupt solyndras and our tech leadership really will be in mortal peril washington is a much greater threat to american supremacy right now than china copyright 2021 creators com
the english language is full of words to size up things from millilitres to square metres to even lightyears we can measure the smallest ant and the distance to the furthest galaxy we are aware of but just how small is the smallest unit of measurement there is a precise number for the smallest possible size for anything in the universe and it s called the planck length 1 6x10 35m basically if you were to write it out the decimal point would be followed by 34 zeroes and a one according to the guinness world records website yes it actually holds a record for smallest unit of length planck length estimates the scale at which quantum foam is believed to exist space has a fast changing foam like structure caused by minute wormholes rapidly opening and closing if humans could exploit the incredible energy of quantum foam the power contained within one cubic centimetre of empty space would be enough to boil earth s oceans talk about packing a punch other measurement terms that exist but may not find their way into daily conversations include the mickey equivalent to approximately 0 1mm it is the smallest detectable movement of a mouse cursor on a screen in nuclear physics a shake is an informal unit of time equivalent to 10 nanoseconds it originated during world war ii as part of top secret projects involving the timing of various events in a nuclear explosion and if you ever hear the word smoot as a measurement unit it is based on oliver r smoot who lay down repeatedly on the harvard bridge in boston us in 1958 so that his fraternity brothers could measure the length of the bridge with his height in 2011 smoot became one of the 10 000 new words added to the american heritage dictionary

law firm on behalf of the orutsararmiut native council onc the tribal council for bethel a village in the yukon kuskokwim region earthjustice s original administrative appeal of the 401 certification to the adec commissioner followed several previous requests for informal review made by onc of the issued 401 certification in 2019 and 2020 which were granted by adec we believe those informal

similar information disclosed by u s companies novagold s disclosure concerning reserve resources estimates remains consistent with ni 43 101 under sec industry guide 7 mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made sec

it is time for middle income countries to be made part of debt relief initiatives for a green and inclusive recovery alicia bárcena executive secretary of the economic commission for latin america and the caribbean eclac said today during an international conference entitled debt relief for a green and inclusive recovery organized by the heinrich böll stiftung the centre for sustainable finance at soas university of london and the boston university global development policy center we aspire to a new global multilateral mechanism for restructuring debt we need to build a new architecture at an intergovernmental level which would include a public rating agency we have to completely rethink the debt restructuring mechanism sustained bárcena who was one of the keynote speakers at this virtual event where the document debt relief for a green inclusive recovery securing private sector participation and policy space for sustainable development was unveiled in her remarks eclac s highest authority called attention to the urgent need to close asymmetries globally both health asymmetries related to access to vaccines as well as those associated with climate change and access to financing bárcena noted that the document presented by the three organizing institutions makes a very useful and innovative contribution to the discussion about the debt problem in developing countries which has been aggravated by the covid 19 crisis and that it is aligned with the 2030 agenda for sustainable development with the paris agreement on climate change and with eclac s views we are pleased that the document includes the debt for climate adaptation swap initiative and the caribbean resilience fund proposed by eclac the senior un official stated we are moving forward on case studies in countries such as antigua and barbuda saint lucia and saint vincent and the grenadines that may be very useful for future work in this area latin america and the caribbean is the most indebted region in the developing world the central government s total debt is equivalent to 79 of gdp and its total external debt is 56 of gdp bárcena indicated the region also has the highest ratio of external debt service to exports of goods and services 59 of gdp she recalled this especially affects small economies of the caribbean where the tourism sector has collapsed due to the covid 19 pandemic she explained the lack of international cooperation during the crisis especially for middle income countries is one of the reasons why debt levels have increased considerably eclac s executive secretary added middle income countries represent 75 of the global population 30 of aggregate demand in the world and 96 of the debt of developing countries excluding china and india she specified nonetheless based on their per capita gdp the majority of these countries are excluded from initiatives for debt relief and increased liquidity this ignores the fact that middle income countries are characterized by having high levels of inequality and sharing vulnerabilities with low income countries she emphasized to date only four countries in latin america and the caribbean dominica grenada saint lucia and saint vincent and the grenadines all of them in the caribbean are participating in the debt service suspension initiative dssi she revealed we need a redistribution of liquidity from developed countries to developing countries this is not just about expansion but also redistribution she stated bárcena also warned about the increase in debt levels seen among both public and private companies in the productive sector in this context she said eclac has proposed that all highly indebted economies should benefit from debt relief or standstills and that those economies facing short term debt profiles or a high debt service burden should also be entitled to some type of debt relief including the small island developing states sids of the caribbean and central american countries any successful debt relief or restructuring initiative requires changes in the international debt architecture it is also necessary for there to be obligations for private creditors financial stability is a global public good she insisted finally bárcena indicated that in order to truly make progress on a green and inclusive recovery it is necessary to promote sectors and projects that are environmentally sustainable and that also generate a significant number of quality jobs eclac has calculated for example that if latin america and the caribbean moves towards renewable energies it can reduce its co2 emissions by 30 and create around 7 million more jobs she said participating in the event were shamshad akhtar chairperson of the board of pakistan stock exchange and chair of the board of directors of karandaaz pakistan kevin p gallagher director of the global development policy center at boston university stephany griffith jones financial markets program director at columbia university s initiative for policy dialogue moritz kraemer chief economist at countryrisk io and senior fellow at soas university of london and ulrich volz director of the centre for sustainable finance at soas university of london in addition to alicia bárcena the keynote speakers were louis kasekende executive director of macroeconomic and financial management institute of eastern and southern africa and josé antonio ocampo a columbia university professor

no one is paying much attention but washington is building up a vast new multitrillion dollar welfare class corporate america deep inside president joe biden s budget are hundreds of billions of dollars of loans grants and loan guarantees for corporate america this aid to dependent corporations is most prevalent in the area of renewable energy despite more than 100 billion already doled out to wind and solar companies over the past 30 years the biden plan would enrich often very wealthy investors in solar and wind plants with another 100 to 200 billion in the president s green energy scheme advertisement for the past dozen years we keep hearing how much cheaper and more efficient the wind and solar industries are becoming and yet the subsidies keep getting more expensive and long lasting explain that one then there is another stash of tens of billions of taxpayer dollars for companies such as tesla and ford so they can make electric cars the government will also spend billions for road recharging stations wait a minute i don t recall uncle sam paying to build gas stations across the country these are mostly democratic initiatives but republicans are in on the gambit in early june the senate passed by a 68 32 margin what cnbc has called one of the largest bipartisan industrial bills in u s history the idea is to shower money to manufacturers semiconductor makers tech companies and the military industrial complex to allow america to compete more effectively with china the bill s price tag is 250 billion congress and the white house actually believe that politicians and government agencies can do a better job of allocating capital than our multitrillion dollar financial markets and venture capital firms brian deese the chief economist for the biden white house recently explained the rationale for erecting this new corporate welfare state the idea of an open free market global economy ignores the reality that china and other countries are playing by a different set of rules strategic public investment corporate welfare to shelter and grow champion industries is a reality of the 21st century economy advertisement recommended that is a dangerous absurdity if you believe this you believe that al gore invented the internet and what has the government invested in over the last 20 years that has had a positive return the new york subway system back in the 1970s there was a big scare that japan s industrial policy the ministry of international trade and industry would overtake america s technological prowess liberals said we should imitate the hands on policies of the land of the rising sun instead ronald reagan was elected who cut investment taxes and cut government spending and since then the u s stock market has risen three times faster than japan s it was almost all private sector driven with tens of trillions of dollars of wealth created by the revolution in innovation in places such as silicon valley the last big government venture to partner with private industry happened in the obama years when his trillion dollar stimulus plan of 2009 wasted tens of billions of dollars on more than a dozen now bankrupt companies such as solyndra the quest to keep america dominant in 21st century industries in robotics bioengineering manufacturing 5g technologies 3d imaging artificial intelligence fracking technologies micronuclear power plants and so on is an honorable one but inventions and innovations almost never come from government when they do they often send companies on wild goose chases as they hunt down free government dollars instead of selling private investment capitalists on their business models operation warp speed wasn t so much a government directed program as a deregulation to get a vaccine in people s arms in record time advertisement if we want more investment what is the logic of the biden plan to raise taxes on private investment capital through higher personal income capital gains and dividend and corporate tax rates these will drain funding for private ventures and make investments in u s companies less attractive in after tax returns relative to investing in other countries such as china dumbest of all is that while congress ladles out trillions of dollars into new corporate welfare programs we now have bipartisan bills to break up monopolistic big tech companies including amazon apple facebook and google these firms have market capitalization of more than 6 trillion employ hundreds of thousands of american workers and arguably do more to spur american innovation than all the government programs in the history of the united states deese is dead wrong china and its communistic economic system will not outcompete the united states in the 21st century unless we are dumb enough to tax our own successful companies break them up if they are too successful and destroy our domestic energy industry if politicians decide where investment dollars are going we will soon be paying for hundreds of bankrupt solyndras and our tech leadership really will be in mortal peril washington is a much greater threat to american supremacy right now than china advertisement stephen

post covid should investors worry about inflation the economic outlook is positive at the mid year point thanks in large part to the significant economic stimulus packages over the past year but all this growth may come at a price investors need to think broadly to navigate an environment of uneven global growth and higher inflation expectations 1 in the post covid boom investors must navigate diverging economies high valuations and higher inflation the global economy continues to reaccelerate after last year s severe slowdown while the covid 19 pandemic isn t over vaccines are helping some parts of the world turn the corner and the hope is that risks will decrease as the year progresses looking ahead investors need to navigate uneven levels of economic growth across countries and sectors and the diverging amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus around the world and they need to factor in higher inflation the united states will power the global economy in 2021 largely thanks to its successful vaccine drive and massive stimulus packages some forecasts show upwards of 6 year over year us gdp growth us equities while quite expensive have continued to enjoy a strong rebound since the market lows of early 2020 china already enjoyed its strongest post coronavirus rebound posting 18 3 year over year gdp growth in march 2021 before slowing to a more moderate rate equity markets have consolidated after a strong 2020 we consider the pullback a healthy development that sets a more solid foundation for the future the european union is having a slow economic recovery from the coronavirus induced recession some eu countries are still struggling to contain the spread of the virus and vaccinate their populations it may be some time until europe turns around fully but european equities are cheap this may be a good time to consider increasing allocations emerging markets are suffering the most particularly india and brazil with the coronavirus exposing long running problems with economic inequality developed nations will need to make a concerted effort to help other countries with virus containment and vaccinations investment implications overall economic growth has returned forcefully bringing a boost to capital markets though growth will likely remain below the pre covid growth trend for years this boom in the economy and markets also comes at a potential price and we expect to see policymakers respond in a way that investors will want to factor into their strategies a spike in inflation this year and potentially beyond makes it important to preserve purchasing power with additional sources of return the us federal reserve plans to slightly raise rates in 2023 in response to stronger than expected economic data and rising inflation markets could become more volatile depending on how these moves are telegraphed and enacted we still have a bias for risk assets albeit with some caution as such we don t think investors should de risk their portfolios but rather consider a more neutral position along the risk return spectrum at least for the short term 2 in this lower for even longer environment keep an eye on inflation economic stimulus will continue to be a major investment story in the second half of 2021 the overall level of global economic stimulus in the form of fiscal and monetary policy measures will be lower than the record setting levels implemented last year this is because recovering economies require less stimulus and because governments don t want to add to their debt levels unless it s absolutely necessary indeed some emerging markets will be reining in their fiscal spending and tightening their money policy by hiking rates but the picture is different in developed markets particularly the us where we expect to see some additional fiscal spending programmes and tax cuts this year all this spending is raising concerns about nanny capitalism with central banks effectively beholden to their governments by funding this spending major central bank balance sheets are at all time highs and projected to push up further in the coming quarters one consequence of this massive policy stimulus both fiscal and monetary has been a notable spike in inflation that started in the second quarter following the swift economic recovery and shrinking global output gap meaning there s less spare capacity in the economy other contributing factors include the ongoing supply chain disruptions for companies around the world and the base effect of commodity prices particularly energy costs that have risen notably from last year there is also evidence that the rise in inflation is not purely transitory for example monetary aggregates the amount of money circulating in an economy have skyrocketed during the covid 19 crisis in response to unprecedented monetary stimulus furthermore a continuation of the deglobalisation trend as countries seek to be self sufficient with essential goods would further drive inflationary pressures there are also tentative signs of rising pressure on wages which gets passed on in the form of higher prices given all these factors it s possible that inflation may be even higher than expected beyond 2021 or at least the markets may price in a rising probability of this outcome and if this scenario is on the cards for next year we expect the markets would begin pricing it in much earlier the financial markets will closely watch how central banks react to inflation and stronger than anticipated economic growth particularly the us federal reserve the fed has been following an average inflation targeting approach which means it will be comfortable with a temporary overshooting of its 2 goal but the recent spike in inflation has already gotten the fed s attention prompting officials to announce their plans for small rate hikes in 2023 the market has also been expecting the fed to start tapering its bond buying probably in 2022 both these moves could trigger some volatility depending on how they are managed by the fed so with inflation going up at least temporarily and with central banks set to tighten monetary policy sooner or later bond yields have risen since the beginning of the year but we continue to believe that over the long term real interest rates which have been adjusted for inflation will stay low compared with their long term averages given that certain structural trends including shifting demographics low productivity growth and high debt levels will keep economic growth low as well and all else being equal economic growth and interest rates historically track each other relatively closely investment implications fixed income we have a bias for keeping durations short many bonds are expensive and not just sovereign debt investment grade and high yield debt is pricey if bond markets get more nervous about inflation and central bank action yields may rise and prices fall investors will want to manage their positions actively in this environment but lower prices may also present an attractive opportunity income replacement will continue to be a challenge in today s low yield environment equities central bank liquidity and a general risk on attitude have pushed up the prices of equities us stocks are expensive perhaps they re even in bubble territory but they may bubble up further in the next six to 12 months european and asian equities are cheaper and moderately priced compared to historical levels we favour the value style of investing over growth currently but in the long run tech stocks also have an important role to play focusing on companies that emphasise sustainable business practices including environmental social and governance esg issues can help investors navigate a possibly bumpy road ahead risk management consider agile risk management strategies in a low yield environment many investors acknowledge that they will need to take more risk to achieve their objectives the key is to take this risk in a managed way 3 consider any setbacks in chinese equities as an opportunity to re establish a longer term position this year has been a case study in the exciting potential and stress inducing volatility that have long characterised china s capital markets after china s authorities successfully managed the country out of the covid 19 crisis last year and reported stellar year over year gdp numbers in early 2021 china s equity markets sold off dramatically in february and march the authorities clampdown on the internet sector earlier this year played a notable role as did profit taking among previous stock market winners since then china s equity markets have been relatively calm but moved mostly sideways throughout it all corporate china has been doing well with most companies meeting or exceeding expectations and many companies reporting strong underlying demand the internet sector remains under a cloud however anti trust regulators have now met with all major internet platforms to warn them about illegal business practices in the long term we believe these companies will continue to deliver faster growth than the overall economy but the growth will likely be achieved in a different way than was historically the case valuations are set to remain under some pressure for the time being china s economic policies during the pandemic have been arguably the most orthodox of any major central bank around the world indeed as the post covid recovery has taken hold china alone among the major economies has acted to tighten fiscal and monetary policy while the natural inclination of china s policy makers is therefore to take proactive steps to prevent the build up of inflationary pressures and asset bubbles the extent of any policy tightening for the rest of the year will likely be constrained investment implications in the short term we would not be surprised to see a further period of consolidation in china s equity markets stocks have rallied strongly over the last year and some profit taking would be entirely natural in addition as china takes prudent steps to normalise monetary policy the very strong liquidity environment may become more moderate in fact we think the recent pullback was a healthy development that helps to set a more solid foundation for the future it remains extremely important to be selective and esg factors can be a good lens through which to identify companies that will continue to thrive in this environment in the fixed income space onshore rmb bonds those traded in mainland china and denominated in cny offer an attractive opportunity to international investors this is primarily thanks to their higher yields compared with bonds from other major economies and the diversification potential provided by their low correlations with other asset classes investors can also benefit from longer term trends in china s bond markets for example china is the second largest bond market in the world and chinese bonds are steadily being added to international benchmark indices increased investor interest can give early entrants the potential to benefit from price appreciation over the longer term we continue to see compelling reasons to invest into china it is of course a relatively volatile asset class so it s important for investors to have a long term perspective and consider their comfort level with drawdowns 4 sustainable investing is the new standard in the past year global esg assets under management reached usd 1 7 trillion according to morningstar already over a third of global aum now applies esg criteria and this growth is set to continue in fact rather than diverting attention from sustainable investing the covid 19 pandemic and its knock on effects for society and economies have accelerated this shift investors are increasingly convinced of the essential role that sustainable approaches play in driving investment performance and helping to manage risk in particular independent data shows the outperformance of actively managed esg funds over their passive counterparts during the start of the pandemic underscoring the value of an active approach to sustainable investing as we head into the second half of 2021 the case for sustainable investing will continue to strengthen in the post pandemic recovery esg factors will be critical for assessing a new array of risks and identifying previously unknown opportunities this should make investors more comfortable taking a risk on stance but we also urge caution economic growth paths and monetary policies are diverging and multiple factors are dampening real economic growth global fiscal policy is becoming less uniform and accommodative supply chain and trade disruptions are pushing up inflation and the number of zombie firms businesses with low productivity high debt and a high risk of default is rising assessing companies across the spectrum of esg factors and actively engaging with them to influence change will be critical to test their resilience against this backdrop the key is to identify those factors that are most influential for each individual company such as greenhouse gas emissions workers rights and executive pay and encourage them to increase transparency what the substantial growth in esg assets indicates is that the case for sustainable investing in terms of balancing risk and reward is proven in many investors minds the priority now for investors is to see how these investments can create demonstrable real world change investment implications post pandemic many governments are pledging to build back better with a focus on areas such as green infrastructure and addressing social inequalities greater global cooperation on climate change and other key issues will also spark an array of projects that require funding incorporate esg factors into everyday decision making to test companies resilience in a challenging investment environment and to drive change on urgent issues consider investments aligned with one or more of the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs these 17 focus areas represent a call to action to address challenges facing society representing potential market opportunities of usd 12 trillion these may include investments that address the implications of climate change for our planetary boundaries such as clean water and food security explore growing opportunities in green debt the pandemic and green infrastructure spending likely provide scope for new issuance many institutional investors are using impact investing in the private markets space in areas such as renewable infrastructure and development finance it s a highly effective way to promote

at most central banks monetary policy is determined by a committee a potential advantage of committee decision making is that two heads are better than one but the nature of a committee also raises a host of questions positive and normative earlier vox columns have discussed issues related to committee composition such as the role of the appointment process for the us federal reserve system s monetary policy committee the federal open market committee fomc bordo and istrefi 2018 and the desirability of diversity see mcmahon and hansen 2010 related to internal and external members eijffinger et al 2013 with regard to professional background and masciandaro et al 2018 on gender how transparency may induce monetary policy committee members to be better prepared has been discussed by hansen et al 2014 and how to decide on voting rules is studied by claussen and røisland 2015 an organisational feature that is receiving considerable attention from lawmakers in the us but has not been studied much by academics is the rotation of voting rights the rotation scheme used on the fomc is the topic of this column in a new paper ehrmann et al 2021 we investigate how voting right rotation affects behaviour between and during fomc meetings and whether the reaction of the financial market to a speech depends on the voting status of the speaker voting right rotation on the fomc the seven members of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the president of the federal reserve bank of new york are permanent members of the fomc and vote at every meeting the remaining four votes are assigned to four groups of 11 federal reserve districts which district in each group has the right to vote is determined by an annual mechanical rotation scheme which has been in place since 1943 as a result reserve bank presidents of these districts experience years with and without the right to vote rotation is without exclusion i e non voting presidents attend the meetings and participate in the discussions their only difference to voting presidents is that they do not vote two competing hypotheses about whether the voting status of presidents affects their behaviour in our paper we formulate two hypotheses first the loss compensation hypothesis is inspired by the literature on influence activities and strategic information transmission crawford and sobel 1982 milgrom and roberts 1986 1988 it maintains that in years without the right to vote presidents seek to compensate for the loss of the formal voting right by making more intense use of intermeeting speeches and meeting interventions second the gain enhancement hypothesis is inspired by the literature on decision making authority in organizations aghion and tirole 1997 baker gibbons and murphy 1999 it maintains that in years with the right to vote presidents are more committed and involved in the decision making process and this leads them to make more intense use of intermeeting speeches and meeting interventions a reserve bank president is expected to bring intelligence about regional economic conditions to the fomc discussions moreover they are the chief executive officer of the bank and are accountable to the bank s board of directors these boards have strong ties with the districts economy and community in general in line with this role earlier research meade and sheets 2005 chappell et al 2008 has highlighted that regional economic conditions influence the speeches and policy preferences of reserve bank presidents with regard to the variation of their voting rights the loss compensation hypothesis predicts that the tone and number of intermeeting speeches and the tone and length of meeting interventions depend more strongly on regional economic conditions in years without than in years with the right to vote the gain enhancement hypothesis maintains the opposite i e that their dependence becomes stronger in years with the right to vote to test our hypotheses we parse the transcripts of 160 fomc meetings and around 2 800 speeches during the period 1994 2013 voting status changes presidents behaviour between and during meetings the patterns in the data support the gain enhancement hypothesis and go against the loss compensation hypothesis both when we study the intermeeting speeches and the meeting interventions the number of speeches and the tone of speeches and meeting interventions depend more strongly on regional economic circumstances in years a president has the voting right than in years without the stronger dependence on regional conditions in voting years is even larger after fomc meetings with dissenting votes this further supports the gain enhancement hypothesis because in times of high disagreement on the fomc having the right to vote is particularly valuable 1 figure 1 the responsiveness of speeches to regional economic conditions notes the figure shows the responsiveness of speeches to regional unemployment for the number of speeches upper panel and the tone of speeches lower panel as estimated for years in which a president is without the right to vote blue bars and years with the right to vote red bars for the full sample for the time period before the release of the beige book and for the full intermeeting period following an fomc meeting with dissent dark shaded bars are statistically significant at least at the 10 significance level cases where the difference between years with and without the right to vote is statistically significant at least at the 10 significance level are denoted with an asterisk in the axis labels asset price reactions to speeches show a vote discount these differences in behaviour affect how financial markets react to speeches delivered between meetings we measure the market reaction to presidents speeches by the absolute daily change in treasury yields with maturities varying from three months to five years as shown in figure 2 we find a vote discount the market responds systematically less to speeches in years presidents vote than in years they do not vote the estimated effect is large in our benchmark estimation the discount equals 26 of the average absolute daily change for three month rates and still amounts to 11 for five year rates figure 2 the responsiveness of three month constant maturity treasury yields to speeches by reserve bank presidents in the voting rotation notes the figure shows the responsiveness of 3 month constant maturity treasury yields to speeches by reserve bank presidents in the voting rotation as estimated for years in which a president is without the right to vote blue bars and years with the right to vote red bars for the full sample for the time period before the release of the beige book and for the full intermeeting period following an fomc meeting with dissent cases where the difference between years with and without the right to vote are statistically significant at least at the 10 significance level are denoted with an asterisk in the axis labels the vote discount might seem surprising after all formally a president is more influential in years with the right to vote we argue that this vote discount is consistent with the difference in behaviour due to voting status under the assumption that participants in the us treasury market are more interested in national than in regional information our argument is that markets can extract more relevant information from a speech given by a president in years without the right to vote than in years with the right to vote in further support of this argument we find that the vote discount by the market is especially large for speeches given before the publication of the beige book with district level information 35 for 3 month rates or after meetings with dissent 40 for 3 month rates these are precisely the speeches that respond most strongly to the regional economy when a president has voting status implications for ongoing policy debates our contribution is descriptive a normative framework should be used to assess whether this change in behaviour is desirable and if not how it could be mitigated still our analysis sheds light on possible consequences of recent proposals for reforming the fomc most related to our analysis vissing jorgensen 2020 and bills h r 4759 and h r 6741 of the 115th congress propose among other things to remove the voting right rotation and give the reserve bank presidents permanent voting rights 2 if presidents get a permanent voting right on the fomc they could become even more committed this might further strengthen the gain enhancement effects we find in the data removing the voting rights for reserve bank presidents altogether as proposed by conti brown 2016 may lead them to seek other ways to influence policy after all the regional information that reserve bank presidents presently bring to the table forms a vital part of the meeting input and

boasberg granted the company s request to dismiss the complaints filed last year by the u s federal trade commission and state attorneys general led by new york saying in his opinion that the ftc failed to meet the burden for establishing that facebook has a monopoly in social networking the judge faulted the ftc for failing to detail how facebook has monopoly power in a market the agency described as personal social networking the agency s claim that facebook has in excess of 60 percent of a vaguely defined market is too speculative and conclusory to go forward he wrote in the ruling boasberg said the agency could refile the complaint within 30 days the ftc s complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power facebook actually had and still has in a properly defined antitrust product market boasberg said it is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that facebook is a monopolist facebook shares gained 4 2 to 355 64 at the close in new york the biggest single day increase since april 29 the stock has jumped 30 this year we are pleased that today s decisions recognize the defects in the government complaints filed against facebook said a company spokesman with the ruling facebook has escaped at least for now the most significant regulatory threat to its business to emerge out of the wider crackdown on u s technology giants both the ftc and new york attorney general s office said they re reviewing the decision and considering their legal options the ruling delivers a blow to the ftc and the states which claimed facebook violated antitrust laws by buying photo sharing app instagram and messaging service whatsapp in order to cut off emerging competitive threats and protect its monopoly it also puts new emphasis on antitrust legislation advanced by the house judiciary committee last week that would make it easier for enforcers to challenge anticompetitive conduct by the biggest tech platforms antitrust hurdles boasberg s decision to toss the facebook complaints shows the hurdles u s antitrust enforcers face in trying to take on the internet giants officials on their own can t break up companies or impose other remedies but instead must persuade judges to take action the process can take years in a separate opinion about the states lawsuit the judge criticized the attorneys general for waiting years after the instagram and whatsapp deals to challenges the acquisitions the states long delays were unreasonable and unjustified as a matter of law boasberg said both acquisitions were per plaintiffs allegations publicly announced and the states were thus aware or certainly should have been aware of them from those points onward the facebook lawsuits were filed in december as part of a widening crackdown on america s tech giants the cases followed a justice department complaint against alphabet inc for allegedly monopolizing internet search and the findings of a house investigation that accused tech companies of abusing their dominance lawmakers have since proposed a pile of bills that would cast a broad regulatory net over the companies antitrust investigators at the u s justice department have stepped up scrutiny of google s digital ad market practices in recent months according to people familiar with the matter showing that the biden administration is actively pursuing a probe that started under former president donald trump for more google ad business faces scrutiny as doj extends trump era probe the facebook lawsuits centered on the 2012 acquisition of instagram and the 2014 takeover of whatsapp officials say facebook made the deals because it saw both companies as threats to its business rather than compete with its own products facebook followed chief executive officer mark zuckerberg s mantra it is better to buy than compete according to the ftc complaint facebook offered 1 billion for instagram when it had only 25 million users and no revenue but had already started to capture the market for mobile photo sharing zuckerberg said the threat from instagram was really scary according to the ftc complaint the company paid 19 billion for whatsapp because it saw messaging apps as another danger to its business a facebook executive said the apps might be the biggest threat we ve ever faced as a company the ftc complaint said facebook attacked the complaints on several grounds one of its key arguments was that the ftc investigated both acquisitions when they were announced and allowed both deals to proceed while antitrust enforcers can challenge completed mergers facebook argued the ftc s case was unprecedented and the agency never explained why its prior decisions approving the purchases were mistaken the government simply wants a do over facebook said the company also had argued that a u s supreme court ruling in april that curtailed the ftc s authority to recover money for defrauded consumers required that the complaint be dismissed the case is federal trade commission v facebook inc 20 cv 3590 u s district court district of columbia washington
