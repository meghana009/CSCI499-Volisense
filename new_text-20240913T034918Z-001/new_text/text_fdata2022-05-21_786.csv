sunrise in spring at micron technology knowlesgallery istock editorial via getty images to the satisfaction of many prognosticators hoards of â pandemic darlingâ stocks have now fallen more than 30 50 and even 70 however itâ s worth noting that some of them actually have impressive businesses and now trade at dramatically more compelling valuation multiples even after taking into consideration the risks created by the fedâ s aggressive interest rate hike trajectory to battle inflation which could drive us into recession and decisively warrant discounted valuation multiples being assigned to these businesses still on track to achieve significantly higher future earnings in this report we highlight 25 examples including a special focus on micron technology nasdaq mu macroeconomic context to quickly review weâ ve gone from extraordinarily dovish monetary and fiscal policies e g near zero interest rates massive bond buying lots of economic stimulus programs to a dramatically hawkish inflation fighting stance e g higher rates aspirations to reduce the fedâ s balance sheet in less than one year what this means is that the stocks that arguably benefitted the most from low interest rates e g high growth stocks with little current earnings but high â expectedâ future earnings have gone from loved to hated in less than one year and this about face has been magnified by the fact that many of these high growth darlings are also naturally socially distanced businesses which is now less â in vogueâ as investors perhaps mistakenly think the pandemic is over anecdotally i have covid as i type and as the short term market narrative and investor sentiment has shifted the selloff for high growth stocks has been intense ycharts the two macroeconomic takeaways here are 1 the best economists in the world are usually only right about half of the time i e itâ s much easier to pick good long term businesses than to predict the direction of the overall economy and 2 some babies are now being thrown out with the bathwater as short term narratives have taken a vice grip on the psyche of many investors i e the market is a voting machine in the short term especially with twitter and reddit etc but a weighing machine in the long term for example micron micron thesis micron is an impressive growth stock that has sold off hard in the recent fed induced growth stock selloff itâ s about 30 below its 52 week high and despite the sell off the business continues to post impressive numbers including revenue growth high margins a compelling valuation and an impressive total addressable market opportunity micron overview if you donâ t know micron designs and produces memory storage solutions that are used in an expanding host of devices such as pcs mobile automotive data centers the cloud artificial intelligence and the overall â internet of thingsâ iot more specifically about 73 of the companyâ s revenues are from dram dynamic random access memory and the rest are from nand dram provides data storage and retrieval while a device in â on â and nand is memory that retains its content when the power is turned â off â micron is the worldâ s third biggest memory storage provider behind samsung and sk hynix it has over 40 000 employees located globally and is headquartered in boise idaho micron s growth opportunity the total addressable market opportunity for micron s products is large and expanding for starters here is a look at the market size for memory and storage end demand not only is it diverse and dramatically expanded from years ago when some investors feared micron s opportunities would decline with the decline of traditional desktop pcs but it is growing as you can see in the compound annual growth rates cagr for both dram and nand solutions micron source investor day presentation and for a little more perspective micron s revenues are expected to grow at 21 5 this year and 20 5 next year as per the table later in this report which is dramatically higher than the average s p 500 stock growth rate nand and dram are even expected to grow faster than the overall semiconductor industry in fact the company estimates the market opportunity will more than double over the next decade as you can see in the graphic below taken from the company s investor day presentation delivered last week micron investor day presentation micron financial health micron continues to operate from a position of financial strength for example the firm has significantly reduced its debt levels in recent years see chart below and maintains a healthy investment grade credit rating in fact it was recently upgraded by fitch ycharts also important micron continues to maintain a healthy amount of cash while it consistently spends on research and development which is critically important for future growth ycharts micron valuation for a high growth business with extremely impressive margins 45 8 gross and 33 5 operating micron trades at very low attractive valuation multiples for example it currently trades at only about 2 5 times sales and 8 6 times earnings you can see how favorable these numbers are versus other top growth stocks included in the table later in this presentation and versus the overall s p 500 which currently trades at around 19 5 times earnings and here is a look at a few of micron s valuation multiples versus the company s own history ycharts the shares are also cheap by its own historical standards especially considering revenue growth is particularly high and the total addressable market is very large and continues to expand micron risks besides the recent indiscriminate tech and growth sell off there are a few reasons risks why micron trades at such low compelling valuation multiples as compared to its very strong business for starters micron products are largely considered to be commodities there is no specific economic moat per se and new competitors are constantly attempting to come online and compete further samsung and sk hynix are formidable innovators that can quickly put micron behind the curve in terms of technology and costs another risk is that the business can be highly cyclical in the past extended periods of oversupply in the industry has created severe stress on operations however according to micron industry supply discipline and the slowing of moore s law has reduced some of this risk as the company s strategy is to work towards growing bit supply in line with demand investor day presentation thirdly many investors still view micron as providing an old school technology nand and dram that they believe is dying with the desktop pc this may have been a valid concern a decade ago but the market seems not to fully recognize the dramatically expanding uses of dram and nand itâ s not just for desktop pcs anymore just because micron chips are not as cutting edge as nvidia nvda and amd amd that doesn t mean the business will die quite the contrary as the growth rates and market opportunity demonstrate micron investors despite the fact that many investors are attracted to micron for its high growth and large market opportunity billionaire value investor seth klarman is also a large shareholder klarman is the founder portfolio manager of baupost group a firm known for its success in buying unpopular assets while they are undervalued and per the firm s latest 13f micron is their 13th largest position dataroma source dataroma baupost group lbtyk qrvo intc vsat goog lsxmk vrtv fisv wtw ssnc lsxma dbx 25 more growth stocks to rip higher micron is a bit of an anomaly on our list because its valuation is so low compelling compared to the business growth high margins and total addressable market for the reasons we explained above however there are plenty more impressive growth business that have sold off hard recently as the fed has decided for now to fight inflation at any cost to the economy recession anyone the following table includes 25 more growth stocks that have recently sold off hard stockrover stockrover to be included in the table businesses were required to have at least 15 expected revenue growth this year and next as well as a positive operating margin there are plenty more â popularâ stocks that have even higher expected revenue growth rates but did not make our list because theyâ re operating margins basically operating earnings divided by revenues were quite negative here are a few examples j curve or not stockrover investment goals and time horizon disagreements about investment opportunities often come down to differing investment goals and time horizons for example if youâ re already retired and prone to lose sleep over extreme investment volatility it probably doesnâ t make a lot of sense to load up on investments from the table outlined in red above but if you are a 31 year old with a high paying job a long investment horizon and a prudently diversified portfolio you could end up being extremely well served to selectively pick up a few long term high growth stocks that are currently down big conclusion the fedâ s increasingly draconian posture in addressing inflation may drive the economy into recession it has mosty certainly already driven forward looking stock prices significantly lower depending on your own personal goals and time horizon you may want to bravely consider owning a few shares from our lists above there are some impressive business trading at dramatically lower prices or you may simply be too repulsed by the highly volatile risk reward potential they offer at the end of the day itâ s your money and you need to do whatâ s right for you

the world is full of difficult to explain wonders in the last century archaeologists have discovered many civilizations such as the hittites which were previously not thought to exist as a result the discovery of a new civilization has become relatively commonplace today one supposed example of this is the marcahuasi rock forest within the unusual rock formations many visitors have claimed to have found what amounts to hundreds of carvings but others say that these are just the result of natural erosion meaning one possible explanation of this phenomenon is pareidolia one of the first modern explorers to visit marcahuasi in peru was the self styled archaeologist and mystic daniel ruzo who visited the site in 1952 he spent nine years exploring the region and claimed to have found hundreds of human sculptures as well as figurines of animals such as camels lions seals and frogs he also claimed that some sculptures were made in such a way that they appeared to change their shape at different times of the day and year depending on how they were illuminated the monument to humanity rock sculpture at marcahuasi willmontano adobe stock the masma civilization ruzo also claimed that marcahuasi had vortices of healing power making it a deeply spiritual place he believed that it was built by a civilization called the masma who according to ruzo once maintained a globe spanning civilization before they were destroyed in a cataclysm he used this to explain why some of the figures appeared to imply an origin on different continents such as animals not native to south america ruzo s tale of the masma civilization has its origins in the beliefs of a peruvian esotericist by the name of pedro astete who had heard the name in a dream ruzo came to believe that the cataclysm that allegedly wiped out the masma would one day happen again and that it was a part of a cycle spanning thousands of years stones at marcahuasi adwo adobe stock strange occurrences at marcahuasi since daniel ruzo first made these observations in the 1950s many people have gone to the marcahuasi rock forest and have claimed to feel a spiritual presence there many have also said they experienced out of body experiences visions of ghosts and even encounters with ufos there are many stories of supernatural events involving these mysterious formations one such tale is of a man who was paralyzed in a car accident being miraculously healed after meeting a mysterious man among the rock formations people camping at marcahuasi josemanuel246 adobe stock although most archaeologists believe them to be natural formations many fringe theorists and mystics have insisted that the rock formations are artificially modified among the more well known sculptures are the monument to humanity two statues of queens one of which is said to be african and a feature that some believe resembles an egyptian deity in the form of an anthropomorphic hippopotamus there is also at least one statue that is said to resemble the face on mars in addition to statues explorers of the area say that they have found the remains of office buildings and residences indicating that it was once a city there is also a claim of a mummy having been found in the area although this would be definitive proof of a sustained human presence in the area it wouldn t necessarily mean that the rock formations are indeed statues or that a city ever existed in the area no serious archaeological surveys appear to have been done in the area so it is hard to verify that a mummy was actually found at the site chullpas tombs in marcahuasi peruphotoart adobe stock questioning the claims the man who is most often sourced in relation to marcahuasi is daniel ruzo his methods don t appear to have been very rigorous he was more of a mystic than scientific investigator most of the other studies of marcahuasi suggest that there isn t any evidence of a large human settlement having ever existed in the area if the location had been the site of a city it is likely the tools human remains ornaments figurines middens and other archaeological items would be found from what can be gathered though none of the hallmarks of a human settlement have been discovered with the possible exception of a mummified body if the rocks really are sculptures then they are the only evidence of a complex society at marcahuasi in fact this is probably why there hasn t been much archaeological investigation at the site by mainstream archaeologists they believe there isn t much to be found ruined structure at marcahuasi rickahontas cc by sa 3 0 another problem with the alleged statues is that upon examination it is difficult to tell them apart from natural rock formations that have been eroded some people have claimed that the sculptures change their form in different light at different times of the year at one time of the year a formation might appear to be a frog and at another part of the year it might be a bird art is distinguished from nature by how clearly it represents something and is deliberately manufactured if the form of a sculpture is so open to interpretation it leaves one to wonder if there is anything there at all or if these statues are not simply the result of imagination marcahuasi bayamin adobe stock this leads to another possible explanation for the apparent figures pareidolia pareidolia is a tendency for humans to see patterns that are not really there this is the reason why people have claimed to have seen things like a face on mars or the face of jesus christ on toast our mind tries to make sense of all the sensory stimuli and puts together a pattern that is familiar to us but it does not actually exist the reason that our brains are wired to see patterns even if they aren t there is probably because there was no selective advantage against false positives if a prehistoric human thought he saw a tiger in the grass and didn t he would run and still survive even though he was mistaken whereas someone who wasn t able to detect a pattern that actually was there tiger stripes in this case would be more likely to get eaten because of pareidolia we must be more careful to make sure that what we see is actually there if we look long enough our brain will discern a pattern whether or not one actually exists especially if we want it to be there as a result it is important to be skeptical and discerning when it comes to encountering things in nature that look manmade is there a good reason to think it is is it likely if not it might just be

share several key factors can move the forex market these factors put together make up what we call fundamental analysis understanding the impact of these essential factors helps traders decide which positions to take in the markets for their chosen pair therefore every trader must study these factors explained below as these will assist them in determining market trends very often the economic situation in a country is considered the chief factor that determines its exchange rate however the economic factors cover a wide range of subject matter below we shall discuss nine significant aspects of a country s financial situation that influence its currency s value in the exchange market inflation generally inflation is the resulting rate of decline in purchasing power of a given currency over a certain period high inflation levels mean that a particular currency is losing value rapidly under such conditions the prices of goods and services tend to increase drastically this situation occurs when too much of one country s currency is in circulation devaluing its exchange rate through oversupply of course investors are mainly attracted to buying currencies that have lower inflation rates therefore people tend to sell a country s currency with a high inflation rate tapering tapering is an absolute term encountered daily in forex trading it is a strategy used by the federal reserve to reduce the amount of money in circulation the term refers to removing the quantitative easing measures adopted by the federal reserve and other central banks to boost their economies when we talk of tapering the government has slowed down its asset purchases including mortgage securities and treasury bonds tapering helps slow down inflation as the amount of money in circulation becomes limited tapering is a strategy used in a strong economy that does need the central bank s help of course investors become drawn toward buying a currency once the government embarks on tapering since its supply will start shrinking employment rates the employment rate is an economic factor investors pay great attention to before buying or selling a particular currency it is a way of measuring the average productivity of the country within a specific period of course when more people are employed it suggests improving productivity within the country to this end every country releases its employment rate periodically say monthly or quarterly forex traders often pay significant attention to the us nfp report released every first friday of the month nfp which stands for the non farm payrolls is used to measure the total number of newly hired paid workers in the united states except for farm employees private household employees government employees and other non profit organisations this report is used to measure the progress of the u s economy by demonstrating the increase or decrease in the pace of job creation by a country at the end of each month as expected increasing the employment rate by creating more jobs favours an economy as a result a country s currency value will appreciate in return a high unemployment rate would otherwise reduce the country s currency value gross domestic product gdp the gross domestic product data produced annually with a six months interval is used to measure the total goods and services produced by the country within the said period this data shows the size of the country s economy a high gdp growth rate means the country is highly productive and that there is growing demand for its products and services an increase in output of a country s goods and services generates demand for the country s currency in the forex markets interest rates often interest rates are seen as the additional reward investors get for holding a particular currency for an extended period investors tend to buy currencies that offer them high returns high interest rates help strengthen the value of a currency and attract more investors similarly high interest rates encourage saving and discourage borrowing as a result the citizens carry out more productive work to earn money which is a good sign for the economy debts trade deficits regular borrowing from other nations decreases the value of the country s currency increased borrowing by a particular government suggests low productive activity conducted in the country which discourages investors and devalues the country s currency in the international market balance of trade the trade balance measures a country s ratio of imports over exports countries with a high importation rate have a lower trade balance which devalues their currency on the other hand those nations with a higher rate of exportation indicate a more labour productive workforce hence their products are sold in other countries this increases the overall demand for a country s currency in the foreign exchange market capital market investment the capital market measures the number of inflows or investments coming into a country essential data for stock and indices traders a rising capital market means that investors will purchase more stocks and bonds which is very good for the economy in addition a healthy capital market shows that foreign investors now have confidence in the country s economy increasing the value of the country s currency monetary policy the monetary policy in place within a country often determines whether investors will come in or not when harsh economic policies place many limitations on investors most foreign investors will withdraw or stay away on the contrary when the government and central bank s monetary policies are very friendly with lots of incentives for investors then more foreign investors will come into the country therefore more capital will go into the country s market creating more demand for the country s currency across borders political factors the way investors perceive the ruling government goes a long way in determining their confidence in the country s economy when a perceived strong leader comes into power many foreign investors tend to be attracted to the country often people define a country by its leaders the leader s personality and understanding of the capital markets often determine his policy decisions areas of business he promotes and incentives given to investors to this end forex traders pay great attention to various political news and events and predict their effects on a country s economy often these include shifts in government expenditures and new regulations imposed on particular sectors or industries there is always a significant shift and volatility observed in the forex market during national elections in most countries often the impact of the election on a country s currency depends on who wins the election and how people perceive the new leader also conducting a referendum or the division of a nation can substantially impact the country s currency a case study could be made with the brexit referendum conducted in 2016 which significantly affected the british pound when the u k voted to leave the european union war any war incidents always reflect poorly on the affected country s economy and currency simultaneously of course war leads to the destruction of significant physical assets and investments loss of life and properties and job losses among others a good example is the currently ongoing russian ukraine war as a result the russian ruble hit its lowest value similarly the war has affected eur usd and the european economy which depends mainly on russian oil and gas products for increased productivity often commodities such as gold silver and crude oil seem to be the most in demand assets during this period viral hazards pandemic sudden outbreaks of diseases within a country often lead to restricted movements and slow down economic activities this means decreased production and increased consumption a country s economy could crumble if such restrictions last long a clear example of this is the current global pandemic known as the coronavirus the united states and the u k were the most affected countries by this pandemic we saw the u k generate its worst gdp growth rate in 2020 due to the limitations created by the global pandemic some economies are yet to recover fully from the pandemic s negative impact often gold seems to be the most viable asset for investment during such volatile periods understanding all these fundamental factors that affect the forex markets will make it easier for traders to attain success in the markets understanding and using the above factors in your trading distinguishes forex trading from gambling moreover the above factors undoubtedly help traders decide

believed to be about 8 000 years old two us kayakers recovered the human skull last september in a river about 110 miles west of minneapolis after they spotted the unnatural shaped object on a riverbank they paddled toward it on realizing what it was and suspecting it might belong to a modern murder victim they called the renville county sheriff s office and reported the body part to sheriff scott hable sheriff hable sent the skull to a medical examiner who then forwarded it to a federal bureau of investigation forensic anthropologist a report in the new york times explained that preliminary testing determined the bone belonged to a young man who lived as many as 8 000 years ago between 5500 and 6000 bc 8 000 year old human skull found by kayakers on minnesota river pic twitter com exxyxgisxd new york post nypost may 20 2022 legacy of the smashed skulled hunter according to a report by the archaeology laboratory at augustana university in south dakota the man had likely traversed through parts of what is now minnesota during the archaic period in north america between 8000 to 1000 bc kathleen blue a professor of anthropology at minnesota state university said the skull might have drifted in the river for thousands of years or been placed in a burial site close to the water and carried away over time dr blue wrote that the young man would have likely eaten a diet of plants deer fish turtles and freshwater mussels in a small area rather than following mammals and bison as they migrate for miles furthermore the fbi anthropologist identified a severe head wound on the skull which sheriff hable said was evidence of violent blunt force trauma however dr blue noted signs of healing round the edges of the wound which suggests the blow didn t kill the man the human skull has been tested and appears to have suffered blunt force trauma renville county sheriff s office skull discovered thanks to a mega drought the ancient skull would never have been found if a severe drought hadn t struck minnesota in 2021 the state department of natural resources explained that persistent moisture deficits combined with above normal temperatures across the state caused the worst drought in over 40 years sheriff hable said parts of the minnesota river were exposed that hadn t been before and this is why the pair of anonymous kayakers spotted the skull cap but what happened next would quickly shift focus from the skull to the sheriff two kayakers on the minnesota river spotted what appeared to be a bone a forensic anthropologist with the fbi determined it was part of a skull most likely from a young man who lived as many as 8 000 years ago between 5500 and 6000 b c the new york times nytimes may 19 2022 being caught up in the excitement of the discovery on wednesday afternoon sheriff hable posted photographs of the skull on facebook soon after his office was contacted by the minnesota indian affairs council who said the photographs were very offensive to native american culture dylan goetsch a cultural resources specialist with the minnesota indian affairs council said the sheriff s office showed a complete lack of cultural sensitivity by their failure to reference the individual as being native american goetsch was particularly offended because the police had failed to inform the council of the discovery before publishing it the human skull was discovered by kayakers after parts of the minnesota river were exposed after a drought struck minnesota in 2021 ferrer photography adobe stock archaeologists cops and cultural sensitivities responding to dylan goetsch s protest sheriff hable took the post offline immediately dr blue has since confirmed that the skull was definitely from an ancestor of one of the native american tribes in the area today but in defense of sheriff hable dr blue stressed that if he had not suspected the skull was from a murder victim it would never have been analyzed by an fbi anthropologist now that it has it will be returned to native american tribes in the state since 1990 federal law has systemized the repatriation or respectful return of confirmed native american human remains furthermore funerary objects sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony must at all times be treated with dignity and respect congress also declared that artifacts and human remains removed from federal or tribal lands belong to lineal descendants of native tribes where sheriff hable went wrong was in thinking facebook was an appropriate place to announce the discovery of the ancient skull rather than informing the minnesota indian affairs council hable hands down broke the federal law that states at all times cultural artifacts and human remains must be treated with dignity and respect top image human skull discovered in minnesota river in september is believed to be about 8 000 years old source renville county sheriff s office by ashley cowie

loss of 617 points to close 8 77 higher or less than 0 1 at 31 261 90 the nasdaq composite trimmed a big loss to finish 33 88 points lower or 0 3 at 11 354 62 related inflation gave most americans a 2 6 wage cut in april because the s p 500 did not finish the day more than 20 below its record the company in charge of the index says a bear market has not officially begun of course the 20 threshold is an arbitrary number whether or not the s p 500 closes in a bear market does not matter too much said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments a lot of pain has already been experienced many big tech stocks seen as some of the most vulnerable to rising interest rates have already fallen much more than 20 this year that includes a 37 2 tumble for tesla and 69 1 nosedive for netflix it s a sharp turnaround from the powerful run wall street enjoyed after emerging from its last bear market in early 2020 at the start of the pandemic through it the s p 500 more than doubled as a new generation of investors met seemingly every wobble with the rallying cry to buy the dip i think plenty of investors were scratching their heads and wondering why the market was rallying despite the pandemic jacobsen said now that the pandemic has hopefully mostly passed i think a lot of investors are kicking themselves for not having gotten out on signs that the economy was probably slowing and the fed was making its policy pivot with inflation at its highest level in four decades the fed has aggressively flipped away from keeping interest rates super low in order to support markets and the economy instead it s raising rates and making other moves in hopes of slowing the economy enough to tamp down inflation the worry is if it goes too far or too quickly the famous bull sculpture stands near wall street in new york u s on friday feb 12 2016 photographer michael nagle bloomberg via getty images certainly the market volatility has all been driven by investor concerns that fed will tighten policy too much and put the u s into a recession said michael arone chief investment strategist at state street global advisors bond yields fell as recession worries pushed investors into treasurys and other things seen as safer the yield on the 10 year treasury note which helps set mortgage rates fell to 2 78 from 2 85 late thursday inflation has been painfully high for months but the market s worries swung higher after russia s invasion of ukraine sent prices spiraling further at grocery stores and gasoline pumps because the region is a major source of energy and grains the world s second largest economy meanwhile has taken a hit as chinese officials locked down key cities in hopes of halting covid 19 cases that s all compounded with some disappointing data on the u s economy though the job market remains hot adding pressure onto stocks have been signs that corporate profits are slowing and may finally be getting hurt by inflation that means the pain has widened beyond tech and high growth stocks to encompass more of wall street retail giants target and walmart both had warnings this week about inflation cutting into finances discount retailer ross stores sank 22 5 on friday after cutting its profit forecast and citing rising inflation as a factor related house approves bill to take aim at gasoline price gouging the latest earnings from retail companies finally signaled that u s consumers and businesses are being negatively impacted by inflation arone said although its source is different the gloom on wall street is mirroring a sense of exasperation across country a poll from the associated press norc center for public research released friday found that only about 2 in 10 adults say the u s is heading in the right direction or the economy is good both down from about 3 in 10 a month earlier related what is shrinkflation how companies hide inflation without increasing prices much of wall street s bull market since early 2020 was the result of buying by regular investors many of whom started trading for the first time during the pandic alongside many cryptocurrencies they helped drive darlings like tesla s stock higher they even got gamestop to surge suddenly to such a high level that it sent shudders through professional wall street but these traders called retail investors by wall street to differentiate them from big institutional investors have been pulling back as stocks have tumbled individual investors have turned from a net buyer of stocks to a net seller over the last six months according to a recent report from goldman sachs why is it called a bear market a bear market is a term used by wall street when an index like the s p 500 the dow jones industrial average or even an individual stock has fallen 20 or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time why use a bear to represent a market slump bears hibernate so bears represent a market that s retreating said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra in contrast wall street s nickname for a surging stock market is a bull market because bulls charge stovall said new york new york may 18 traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse on may 18 2022 in new york city photo by spencer platt getty images the most recent bear market for the s p 500 ran from february 19 2020 through march 23 2020 the index fell 34 in that one month period it s the shortest bear market ever why are investors worried market enemy no 1 is interest rates which are rising quickly as a result of the high inflation battering the economy low rates act like steroids for stocks and other investments and wall street is now going through withdrawal the federal reserve has made an aggressive pivot away from propping up financial markets and the economy with record low rates and is focused on fighting inflation the central bank has already raised its key short term interest rate from its record low near zero which had encouraged investors to move their money into riskier assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies to get better returns earlier this month the fed signaled additional rate increases of double the usual amount are likely in upcoming months consumer prices are at the highest level in four decades and rose 8 3 in april compared with a year ago the moves by design will slow the economy by making it more expensive to borrow the risk is the fed could cause a recession if it raises rates too high or too quickly russia s war in ukraine has also put upward pressure on inflation by pushing up commodities prices and worries about china s economy the world s second largest have added to the gloom

are nervous consumers who are grumbling all the way to the grocery ready to call it quits is inflation driving them to reconsider how often they open their wallets if so are we closer to a recession than some might have imagined several months ago or are consumers in good shape and simply spending more now on vacations home renovations and a variety of services and spending less on much of the things they were buying during the pandemic at retailers like target walmart and amazon it s been a brutal week for 401 k plans as wall street faced troubling steep losses fueled by inflation woes and recession worries we are looking at the eighth week in a row for the dow jones industrial average to post losses the longest weekly losing streak since 1923 how long will consumers keep spending fear of a recession in the next six months to 12 months has clearly been mounting lately the dow jones industrial average closed friday at 31 261 90 points up 8 77 or 0 03 after an incredible last minute turnaround at one point friday the dow was down more than 600 points uttering the phrase thank goodness it s friday doesn t come close to describing how investors feel after one bad day after another the dow closed at 32 654 59 on tuesday but tumbled 1 164 52 points wednesday and declined by 3 56 it wasn t the first 1 000 point drop in may either on may 5 the dow tumbled by 1 063 09 points down 3 1 to close at 32 997 97 i had almost no concerned client phone calls until up to two days ago said sam huszczo a chartered financial analyst in southfield told me in an interview friday morning many investors he said seemed to shake off some of the earlier declines when the dow regained some ground last week more from susan tompor 2 michigan women tricked by convincing sophisticated amazon scam what to know metro detroit rents have gone up 8 8 over past 2 years as inflation sizzles but this week s market sell off became harder to ignore many investors are increasingly nervous about the risks of a recession and further declines in stock prices the stock market s reaction has been somewhat surprising huszczo said as the economic data does not match the fear trading that is happening today much of the economic data he said remains quite strong retail sales grew 0 9 to a record 677 7 billion in april consumers are sitting on 2 trillion in savings manufacturing is strong and the u s unemployment rate remains exceptionally low at 3 6 in april huszczo falls into the camp that says the consumer remains in good shape and is able to keep spending the fact that the american consumer hasn t slowed down yet puts a backdrop on how bad this market could get from here huszczo said i don t see anybody cutting their lifestyles out of fears of an economic recession higher interest rates and inflation create problems for buyers yet fear is the driving force wall street remains fixated on any sign that indicates that high inflation will drive consumers to cut back on much of their discretionary spending as skyrocketing food and gas prices take an even bigger chunk out of their budgets as interest rates go up it becomes more expensive for consumers to borrow especially to buy big ticket items such as cars ford motor closed at 12 50 a share on friday down 35 cents or 2 72 general motors closed at 35 40 a share on friday down 72 cents or 1 99 stellantis closed at 14 46 a

target s stock tumbled nearly 25 wednesday after wall street was disappointed by earnings target ceo brian cornell blamed inflationary pressures as well as supply chain disruptions that caused some inventory to arrive too early and some to arrive to late to meet demand target s ceo also noted that shoppers are shifting their spending some as birthday parties for children resume driving up toy sales and more people plan to travel driving up luggage sales both stocks and bonds have been ugly investors are seeing tough times for both stocks and bonds which isn t typical david kudla ceo of mainstay capital management in grand blanc noted that both the stock and bond markets have reacted adversely since early this year as investors anticipate how aggressively the federal reserve will need to raise short term interest rates to drive inflation lower how much and how fast inflation comes down kudla said will determine whether the fed can ease up on its tightening policy and this will determine the direction for markets through the remainder of 2022 kudla said he noted that technology companies typically suffer more in market sell offs that are triggered by rising rates and that has already happened this year value stocks and commodities companies that perform well during times of high inflation are obviously holding up very well he said some investors face huge losses how much money you ve lost in the past year depends greatly on where you ve invested david sowerby bloomfield hills based managing director and portfolio manager for ancora advisors noted that bitcoin was down 54 as of may 9 from its 52 week high hit in november 2021 gamestop was down 67 as of may 9 from its 52 week high set in june 2021 netflix was down 75 from its 52 week high set in november 2021

even out a bit in the days ahead according to some analysts the ride could continue to be volatile in the summer too companies that sell discretionary goods to consumers and let s face it a lot of

while some might argue there s always a bull market somewhere it doesn t mean you have to invest heavily at all times certainly with swing trading as with most styles it s best to hit it hard when you are in a favorable environment and less aggressively when you aren t x the rise of wheat despite crushing losses in the major indexes cyclical and commodity stocks have put in stunning performances oil and gas in particular have dominated ibd lists from industry group strength to relative strength winners when looking for innovation that will change the world or a critical energy source wheat is probably far from top of mind but with the war in ukraine wheat can t be taken for granted anymore according to the world population review russia and ukraine grow 30 of the global wheat supply the threat and eventual breakout of war caused serious disruptions in that market teucrium wheat fund weat provides an easy way to take advantage of changes in wheat prices using a traditional brokerage account the exchange traded fund tracks the price of the chicago board of trade futures contracts on wheat after fairly flat action the price of wheat made a strong move feb 22 just two days before russia invaded ukraine 1 wheat shot up over 50 in the next two weeks 2 the heightened volatility and uncertainty of war didn t make for a good swing trading opportunity at that point but if the chart were to tighten it might look interesting swing trading setup within a week s time wheat lost nearly 25 of its value 3 this is why waiting for a proper swing trading setup is important buying into the volatility can lead to large losses especially if buying extended on this week s podcast andrew chanin explains why outer space is important for ukraine after a couple of months wheat started trading in a more orderly manner it had a roughly 20 gain followed by less than a 10 pullback 4 proportionally similar to the first move and drop but a lot less volatile in absolute percentage changes the relative tightness is what we look for in the technical action for swing trading setups the trading volume also dried up significantly we added the wheat etf to swingtrader as it came out of that short consolidation 5 volume rose well above average and the relative strength line made a new high even with the price still below its high the relative strength line has been our deciding factor of separating the wheat from the chaff as it were it was an unusual buy especially as market indexes were falling to lows on that day taking profits into strength given the weak market environment it was even more important that we take our swing trading profits quickly the next day we were up over 5 from our entry and we took the majority of our position off as wheat rose 6 with just one third left and a good profit already booked we could afford to give wheat more room to run and run it did the wheat etf hit a peak gain of 12 from our entry on the recent follow through day 7 but sector rotation or a follow through day failure could easily make those profits disappear since swing trading uses a shorter time frame for holding it can also be useful to use moving averages with shorter time frames we looked to the 5 day moving average line in this case the follow through day had an early warning signal of a failure the next day but the wheat etf held its 5 day line 8 when it gave that up the next day we didn t hesitate to book our remaining profit 9 given the poor market we considered the 4 5 average gain a swing trading win more details on past trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to swingtrader free trials are available follow nielsen on twitter at ibd_jnielsen you might also like swing trading strategy basics with the follow through day in trouble here s a podcast focused on early warnings learn more trading lessons through ibd videos marketsmith research charts data and coaching all in one place
by kate sullivan cnn the white house says flying a bill that will authorize about 40 billion in aid to ukraine will ensure there won t be any funding gaps when it comes to its military and humanitarian support for their fight against a russian invasion but while flying a bill to a president s location is not uncommon it also isn t entirely necessary the justice department issued an opinion in 2005 when george w bush was president that stated the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law rather the president may sign a bill within the meaning of article i section 7 by directing a subordinate to affix the president s signature to such a bill for example by autopen barack obama later became the first us president to sign legislation using autopen a device used for automatic signatures when he was abroad in 2011 obama authorized the use of the autopen to sign legislation extending the patriot act when he was in europe biden had already departed for his first trip to asia as president by the time the senate passed the 40 billion aid package on thursday the bill was presented to the white house by the house enrolling clerk later that day a national security council spokesman told cnn the bill is going with someone who was already traveling to the region for official duties cnn has reached out to the white house for comment on flying the bill over to south korea national security adviser jake sullivan told reporters traveling with the president on thursday the president does intend to sign the bill while he s on the road so that he can sign it expeditiously the modalities of that are being worked right now so that he can get it and sign it there won t be a gap for that very reason he continued we today authorized the 10th presidential drawdown the remaining 100 million on may 19 just as we said we were going to do that money will be converted into capabilities those capabilities will flow in the coming days and then the next presidential drawdown will be teed up shortly following his signature so we will have the kind of continuity of support that we asked for and for that we are grateful to the bipartisan backing that we ve gotten from the congress who stepped up and did this in a timely fashion presidential drawdown authority funding allows the administration to send military equipment and weapons from us stocks the bill includes an increase in presidential drawdown authority funding from the 5 billion the biden administration originally requested to 11 billion the legislation approved by congress provides money for military and humanitarian aid including funding to assist ukrainian military and national security forces help replenish stores of us equipment sent to ukraine and provide public health and medical support for ukrainian refugees in 2020 then president donald trump had a massive 2 3 trillion coronavirus relief and government funding bill flown to mar a lago his resort in palm beach for his signature the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s jeremy diamond ali zaslav clare foran and ellie kaufman contributed to this report

cnbc s jim cramer on friday explained fresh technical analysis from veteran chartist larry williams that signals the market is headed for a bottom he says this is it i wouldn t bet against him i trust his predictions more than i despise this market and i say that as someone who really does hate the tape the mad money host said cnbc s jim cramer on friday explained fresh technical analysis from veteran chartist larry williams that signals the market is headed for a bottom i know it s tough to believe anything positive at this moment but i said the same thing in april 2020 and that s when larry williams made one of the best bottom calls i ve ever seen the mad money host said referring to when the market spiraled after the onset of the covid pandemic sent shockwaves through the global economy get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters he says this is it i wouldn t bet against him i trust his predictions more than i despise this market and i say that as someone who really does hate the tape he added cramer started off his explanation of williams analysis by examining the s p 500 futures chart the futures line is in black and the advance decline line a cumulative indicator measuring the number of stocks going up on a daily basis versus the number going down is in blue cramer said williams views the advance decline line as an indicator of the market s internal strength or weakness according to cramer right now you can see that while the s p spent the last week getting smashed into oblivion the advance decline line has been holding up much better in fact it s steadily worked its way higher he said he noted that that pattern when an important indicator goes the opposite way of an index is called a bullish divergence according to williams this action in the advance decline line is incredibly positive for the market it tells you that from the perspective of breadth the worst of this decline may be behind us cramer said next cramer inspected the daily s p futures chart plotted with the on balance volume index in purple the chart reveals that the volume of trading has already started to dry up on the sell side cramer said he noted that the on balance volume index is a cumulative indicator that measures volume flow by adding the volume on up days and subtracting on down days we care about this because volume s like a polygraph test for technicians high volume moves are telling the truth low volume moves often misleading he said and because the on balance volume line has held up despite the s p reaching new lows the chart is consistent with what williams would expect to see in a down market where some major money managers have finally just started buying stocks more aggressively cramer said he also showed a chart showing s p 500 futures plotted with williams insider activity indicator in green look at the bottom of the chart this is williams commitments of traders index which shows you what professional money managers are doing with their futures positions cramer said even though the market s down williams sees the professionals buying here and that often sets up significant rallies he added finally williams observed the dominant cycles for the s p 500 which typically run for 75 days right now that cycle says the s p is ready to run and if the cycle holds williams would expect it to keep running through mid to late june cramer said sign up now for the cnbc investing club to follow jim cramer s every move in the market disclaimer questions for cramer call cramer 1 800 743 cnbc want to take a deep dive into cramer s world hit him up mad money twitter jim cramer twitter facebook instagram questions comments suggestions for the mad money website madcap cnbc com

stock sales and an ongoing distraction finally musk is denying sexual misconduct claims regarding a business insider report of alleged 2018 settlement with a spacex employee but as with the general market what matters for investors is how the stock reacts right now tesla stock is in a major sell off anyone who bought tesla in the past year should be long gone longer term investors have to decide how long to hold big winners and when to take whole or partial profits there s no easy answer on that tesla stock fell 1 early monday tesla vs byd how these two ev giants match up market analysis the best that can be said about the recent rally is that it failed so quickly and decisively so it offered less temptation than the bear market rally in late march on tuesday the major indexes all staged follow through days confirming the new stock market rally there were plenty of reasons to be skeptical and few stocks to buy so why not demand a better ftd ibd founder bill o neil wanted to make sure he and other investors didn t miss new rallies even if that meant ftds that ultimately didn t work still wednesday s stunning sell off was a major expectation breaker rallies fail 90 of the time when the major indexes close below the low of their follow through days and they all knifed well below that level on wednesday the official end of the uptrend was almost a formality weekly charts show an unrelenting sell off since early april on friday the s p 500 was down more than 20 from its jan 4 peak for most of the session until a final hour rally off the lows the dow jones and s p 500 eked out fractional gains on friday so that technically marks day one of a new market rally attempt the nasdaq closed in the upper half of its daily range so that qualifies as a pink rally day in theory the major indexes could stage ftds later next week assuming they don t undercut friday s lows the market environment is extremely tough with the federal reserve not worried about protecting the dow jones this time inflation is smothering consumers and businesses alike with growth and hiring already likely starting to slow as a result the fed is rapidly raising rates to cool inflation also contributing to the slowdown bringing down inflation while avoiding a recession would be extremely difficult powell and his colleagues may feel a modest economic slump is unavoidable perhaps even necessary to reduce demand sufficiently to bring inflation under control throw in supply chain chaos from china s lockdowns and the russia ukraine war and there are few economic scenarios that look attractive in the coming months at some point the stock market will price in the negative news and look ahead to a brighter future but it is not today when it s time to sell your favorite stock what to do now this isn t a time to be brave or clever it s a time to be smart and manage risk if you have some energy stocks with decent gains you can choose to keep a minimal exposure but even here you might want to take partial or full profits investors also have decisions to make about big long term winners such as apple or tesla stock but otherwise investors should be on the sidelines it s possible that zim eli lilly chevron or wwe stock will trigger buy signals in the near future but any purchases would be extremely risky while the upside could be limited right now it s better to wait for a better market to develop and that is far more than a strong open or close or even a big day or two even when there s another confirmed rally add exposure slowly and be quick to exit study past bear markets and corrections including those from the late 1960s to early 1980s when inflation was a major threat and keep working on watchlists if you haven t updated them this past week get ready to do some

the likely final debate among the top five pennsylvania republican primary candidates for senate put more of their effort into going after each other than the issues wednesday night at grove city college even as the hour long debate organized by newsmax began with a question on the candidates positions on abortion republican frontrunners mehmet oz and dave mccormick were the main focus among their opponents kathy barnette jeff bartos and carla sands political commentator kathy barnette of montgomery county who was conceived when her mother was raped as a child is adamantly opposed to abortion and pointed to a 2019 interview in which oz had expressed concerns over states restricting access to those procedures the cardiothoracic surgeon turned tv host shrugged off comments from barnette oz saying he had operated on children who were just days old and would not harm any child that young or nine months younger the recent leak of a u s supreme court draft ruling on a case that would overturn a precedent protecting abortion rights since the 1973 landmark roe v wade decision sent a shockwave through the national political landscape on monday more what makes dr oz s senate campaign stand out trump s endorsement tv show and wealth while it may be only a preliminary ruling and could change before the court is expected to decide early this summer the rare leak of the judicial branch sparked outrage among democratic leaders and signaled a rallying cry to republicans as abortion is now expected by many to be a driving factor in the november midterm each of the republican candidates on the stage wednesday have described themselves as pro life and in favor of banning abortion in most cases like barnette bartos and sands reaffirmed their position while taking jabs at mccormick and oz over their attendance at past debates and their previous out of state addresses bartos said pennsylvania has a long history of sending pro life candidates from both parties to washington but warned against sending two candidates who had recently moved to pennsylvania to the nation s capital oz lived in new jersey before moving to montgomery county shortly before he began his campaign in 2021 mccormick was born and raised in bloomsburg columbia county but lived in connecticut for the past 15 years before moving back to allegheny county for his campaign sands a former ambassador to denmark under the trump administration and resident of cumberland county chided both men for not appearing at a debate last week hosted by spotlight pa in carlisle i want to thank newsmax for hosting this debate and i also want to thank the gentlemen on either side of me for showing up because they don t come to many of our debates sands said more pa senate race ex hedge fund ceo david mccormick tries to fend off oz s trump endorsement the opening question lasted several minutes but it set the tone for the rest of the night leading to a heated moment between bartos and mccormick as he s done in past debates bartos responded to a question about inflation by highlighting his work creating the nonprofit pennsylvania 30 day fund during the pandemic which he claims has helped save more than 1 000 small businesses across all 67 counties in the state through more than 3 1 million in aid bartos said wednesday that his focus would be to help main street pennsylvanians and again alluded to oz and mccormick saying there were two out of staters who cannot save main street if you can t find main street when it came time to respond to a question about how the candidates would help older pennsylvanians struggling to make ends meet mccormick fired back at bartos over a 1 million palm beach home he owns florida property records show bartos bought the home last march mccormick raised the issue while also referencing two paycheck protection program loans bartos had taken out in 2020 and 2021 for a total of 191 492 according to data available on the u s small business administration website the loans given to fmg operating company llc which property records show shares the same address as bartos montgomery county home have since been forgiven the federal pandemic relief loans funded with 800 billion of taxpayer dollars were designed to be forgiven in most cases as the funding was created to help small businesses struggling to stay afloat bartos was denied a chance to directly respond and instead used his time on a later question to raise questions around bridgewater s time as a state teacher pension fund s biggest money manager while mccormick was heading the hedge fund pennsylvania s public school employees retirement system had paid bridgewater hundreds of millions of dollars since 2004 to manage what the philadelphia inquirer reported in march to be up to 5 billion of the roughly 75 billion fund oz had initially taken his leading political rival to task over what he and psers officials have described as middling returns that should have been much higher than the 4 billion the fund saw over that time the new york times reported while bridgewater didn t lose psers any money oz and the retirement fund officials have said the returns would have been much higher if invested in stocks and blame lackluster returns for current teachers having to pay more into their retirement funds his firm failed pennsylvania seniors they got screwed bartos said mccormick said he wouldn t apologize for his success and accused bartos of carrying water for oz mccormick stood by the returns bridgewater did make for the teacher pension saying what psers paid for was what they got from bridgewater barnette also referred to mccormick and oz as globalists with business ties to china with sands claiming mccormick made his billions with the foreign country that oz described as an existential threat to america you don t make billions in china without bowing to chinese communists sands said sands also brought out one last jab against barnette immediately after as the debate was nearing an end but her comment underscored something noteworthy about the newsmax debate more this week on the campaign trail for pa governor senate races polls debates and pledges no questions about voter fraud it was a claim sands has made multiple times before calling out barnette s 2020 run for congress against democrat madeleine dean in pennsylvania s 4th congressional district she used the same playbook two years ago and lost in a red wave year by 20 points to a weak democrat sands said barnette pushed back saying she went to bed on nov 3 2020 having won 76 of reporting precincts and lost three days later as election workers tallied mail in ballots the associated press called the race just before midnight on election night with dean leading barnette 92 337 to 38 913 not only did i have that thing happen to me but president trump lost by 26 to an equally weak democrat joe biden barnette said before debate moderator greta van susteren quickly moved to another question while tame compared to other rows that came up wednesday night this exchange is noteworthy because barnette has previously been quick to cite her loss as an example of alleged widespread irregularities and unproven claims of widespread voter fraud that followed the 2020 election that s not a claim that s necessarily unique to barnette either during last week s spotlight debate bartos was the only candidate who said he would have certified the 2020 election results if he had been in office on jan 6 2021 election integrity or rather the alleged lack thereof has been a topic at every debate featuring a crowded field of senate and governor candidates most of whom have cited the persistent unproven claims that followed trump s presidential loss two years ago newsmax settled a defamation lawsuit brought by dominion voting systems in august which included an apology published by the news organization newsmax initially covered claims by president trump s lawyers supporters and others newsmax subsequently found no evidence that such allegations were true the apology stated dominion and another voting machine company smartmatic filed multiple lawsuits seeking billions in damages against conservative news organizations and key figures who backed voter fraud claims on the national stage last year forbes reported in march that nearly a dozen lawsuits against one america news network fox news attorney rudy giuliani and many others could be going to trial over the next two years there were dozens of court challenges across the country from trump s campaign following his loss in 2020 but none of those claims have resulted in conclusive evidence of widespread voter fraud as a result of the ongoing claims republican state lawmakers have also pushed for a review of the state s voter registration system claiming it s wrought with errors that open the state up to potential voter fraud this news organization reviewed nearly 30 million rows of voter registration data across 2020 and 2021 and conferred with political policy experts who said the potential errors like repeating names or missing information made up less than 1 of the voter rolls and didn t constitute a serious concern the may 17 primary may be less than two weeks away but recent polls have continued to show the republican race is still a toss up with at least 40

through our wholly owned subsidiary rpm dental systems llc rpm kentucky rpm kentucky was formed on september 15 2009 under the laws of the commonwealth of kentucky and we acquired rpm kentucky on march 23 2010 prior to the share exchange we had minimal revenue and our operations were limited to capital formation organization and development of our business plan as a result of the share exchange we ceased our prior operations and through quest nv we now operate as an innovative water technology company that provides sustainable and environmentally sound solutions to water scarce regions quest nv was incorporated under the laws of nevada on october 20 2008 and commenced operations on february 20 2009 its operations to date have consisted of business formation strategic development marketing technologies development negotiations with technologies companies and capital raising activities prior to 2021 quest nv had not generated any revenues since its inception 5

of the share exchange on april 13 2012 we also appointed mr miele as our chief financial officer as a result of our acquisition of quest nv quest nv became our wholly owned subsidiary and we assumed the business and operations of quest nv we then changed our name from rpm dental inc to quest water global inc to more accurately reflect our new business operations aquatap entities in july 2021 we incorporated a new operating subsidiary aquatap global inc a wyoming corporation that subsequently established a wholly owned subsidiary aquatap global investments inc a british columbia canada corporation in november 2021 through these entities we expect to coordinate facilitate and manage our current planned and future safe water partnerships throughout africa latin america and the caribbean that provide clean water initiatives for underserved communities the aquatap entities together with their strategic global partners plan to establish subordinate partnerships in various countries and engage experienced local individuals and organizations for operational expertise we anticipate that this will enable the subordinate partnerships to enter into public private partnerships commonly known as ppps with ngos strategic investors and various levels of government quest water solutions inc a british columbia canada corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of quest nv quest bc will remain as the technology provider to our safe water initiatives quest bc is responsible for designing engineering and manufacturing our range of products and it also sells these water technology products directly to end users through our corporate sales marketing divisions and through global distributors and agents business overview we provide sustainable and environmentally sound solutions to water scarce regions our goal is to address the vital issue of water quality and water supply by providing an alternative sustainable source of pure water at the smallest possible environmental cost to global areas in need while becoming a leading company in providing turn key solutions using alternative energy for the purification desalination and distribution of clean drinking water 6 we have developed a proprietary aquatap community water purification and distribution system consisting of a self contained water purification system using either a reverse osmosis membrane or ultrafiltration membrane powered by photovoltaic solar panels and hosted in modified shipping containers each unit is energy self sufficient with minimal operational and maintenance costs we believe that this product represents the first truly environmentally sound solution to drinking water shortages as it is autonomous decentralized and sustainable and because each unit is capable of converting brackish sea or contaminated surface water into high quality drinking water at a rate of up to 100 000 litres per day in addition to the solar powered water purification systems we have also developed a technology known as wepstm that produces potable water from humidity in the atmosphere wepstm technology works by converting humidity into water otherwise known as atmospheric water extraction results of operations for the three months ended march 31 2022 revenue we did not generate any revenue during the three months ended march 31 2022 whereas we generated 150 000 in revenue during the same period in the prior year all of the revenue was attributable to a sales order and advance payment from aquatap oasis partnership s a r l and was offset by 112 724 in cost of goods sold for a gross margin of 37 276 we anticipate that we will incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and our ability to generate any revenues in the next 12 months continues to be uncertain expenses during the three months ended march 31 2022 we incurred 144 635 in total expenses including 112 500 in management fees 13 781 in professional fees 7 806 in transfer agent and filing fees 5 250 in rent 2 645 in automotive expenses 1 690 in office and miscellaneous expenses and 963 in telephone expenses during the same period in the prior year we incurred 119 829 in total expenses including 107 500 in management fees 5 250 in rent 3 061 in automotive expenses 2 825 in office and miscellaneous expenses 805 in telephone expenses and 388 in transfer agent and filing fees except for the minor increases in our professional fees and transfer agent and filing fees our expenses were relatively consistent between the two periods net loss during the three months ended march 31 2022 we incurred a net loss of 144 635 whereas we incurred a net loss of 82 553 during the same period in the prior year our net loss per share during the three months ended march 31 2022 and 2021 was 0 002 and 0 001 respectively 7 liquidity and capital resources as of march 31 2022 we had 4 170 in cash 21 513 in total assets 3 836 523 in total liabilities and a working capital deficiency of 3 822 230 as of that date we also had an accumulated deficit of 10 147 844 to date we have experienced negative cash flows from operations and we have been dependent on sales of our common stock and capital contributions to fund our operations we expect this situation to continue for the foreseeable future and we anticipate that we will experience negative cash flows during the year ended december 31 2022 during the three months ended march 31 2022 we spent 57 in net cash on operating activities which was identical to our 57 in net cash spending on operating activities during the same period in the prior year although our net loss in the current period increased as described above it was offset by certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities notably the due to related company and unbilled costs balances we did not spend or receive any cash in respect of investing activities or financing activities during the three months ended march 31 2022 or 2021 during the three months ended march 31 2022 our cash decreased by 57 as a result of our operating activities from 4 227 to 4 170 as of march 31 2022 we did not have sufficient cash resources to meet our operating expenses for the next month based on our then current burn rate plan of operations our plan of operations over the next 12 months is to continue to address water quality and supply issues in the drc through the installation of our aquataptm community water purification distribution systems as well as the employment of our wepstmtechnology and we anticipate that we will require a minimum of 946 000 to pursue those plans as described above we intend to meet the balance of our cash requirements for the next 12 months through advances from related parties as well as a combination of debt financing and equity financing through private placements as circumstances allow we are not presently contacting broker dealers in canada and elsewhere regarding possible financing arrangements but we intend to initiate such contact once the current cease trade order in effect against us in the province of british columbia canada has been revoked regardless there is no assurance that we will be successful in completing any private placement or other financings if we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient funds through our capital raising efforts we may review other financing options during the next 12 months we estimate that our planned expenditures will include the following amount description equipment purchases 250 000 management fees 430 000 consulting fees 120 000 professional fees 50 000 rent 21 000 advertising and promotion expenses 15 000 travel and automotive expenses 30 000 other general and administrative expenses 30 000 total 946 000 8 going concern our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which implies we will continue to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of business as at march 31 2022 we had a working capital deficiency of 3 822 230 and an accumulated deficit of 10 147 844 our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from our creditors our ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and ultimately on the attainment of profitable operations these factors raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial

fort worth texas the e p sector in the u s has made such strides in recent years to accommodate shareholder demands for returns and emissions mitigation that esg matters are taking a backseat to energy security fears pioneer natural resources ceo scott sheffield told attendees of hart energy s dug permian basin and eagle ford conference and exhibition on may 18 russia s invasion of ukraine flipped the narrative two months ago part of the fallout is a continent plunged into fuel and power uncertainty propelling energy security fears above esg matters in the view of investors and shareholders he said nobody s going to drop esg but energy security has become 10 times more important than esg he said and we re seeing all the changes in europe and hopefully we ll have an administration that ll make the appropriate changes in this country too meanwhile the largest pure play in the permian basin continues to be among the top of its peers in addressing esg issues pioneer has largely led the sector in dramatically downshifting on flaring and developing technology to mitigate methane leaks as well as leading the drawdown in growth in recent years pioneer s target growth plan today targets 5 but that came several years after the industry became a pariah on the s p 500 with its capital destruction and dismal shareholder returns five years ago the firm targeted growth of 20 when sheffield rejoined the company as ceo management lowered the growth rate to 15 as the pandemic spread pioneer took the rate of growth down to 5 where it remains for now obviously the reason we did that was to return more capital the industry had the lowest return on capital employed among any industry in the s p 500 for the last 10 years he said now we re contributing 8 to 10 of the earnings on the s p 500 that s the energy sector the 5 cap on growth makes it easier for the firm to manage the ups and downs of the industry investors are taking notice and finding appeal in energy stocks that have set a target on 5 growth sheffield said it s easier to get equipment it s easier to plan he said you don t have to go up and down when we go through those downturns your staff can plan ahead they can get the equipment needed and then in addition you can return 75 of your free cash flow back to the investor which is what pioneer is doing after an exodus of investors from the space many are beginning to regain confidence in the sector he said there is a movement and you can see it at the largest money managers sheffield said referencing blackrock which manages some 11 trillion worth of assets in recent years blackrock ceo larry fink has fired off excoriating letters to oil and gas executives urging them to take responsibility for climate impacts of their work sheffield said that following several meetings with blackrock executives in recent weeks you can see a mindset change at the top
the stock market bounced back friday from a potential negative milestone for a while on friday it appeared that the s p 500 gspc 1 20 would close down 20 from its all time highs prompting calls that wall street was in a bear market on an intraday basis the s p did get far enough lower to trigger that call but a late day rally brought the index back into positive territory the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 also finished in the green and the nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 ended with far smaller losses than just a couple hours before the close index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 03 9 s p 500 0 01 1 nasdaq 0 30 34 as growth stocks take big hits some investors are seeing the opportunity to tap into an investing style they haven t paid much attention to in years value investing is back in vogue but it hasn t necessarily worked all that well in 2022 either looking at big bank stocks companies like jpmorgan chase jpm 0 06 bank of america bac 0 45 wells fargo wfc 0 89 and citigroup c 1 88 are trading at attractive valuations yet they ve posted substantial losses below we ll look more closely to see why bank stocks are giving mixed signals and whether they really represent a true bargain banks low multiples big losses when you look at the earnings of the largest banks in the u s compared to their share prices you ll find few stocks that look more inexpensive jpmorgan and wells fargo trade at less than nine times earnings while bofa has an earnings multiple just below 10 citigroup takes the prize with a trailing price to earnings ratio of less than six yet even in an environment in which value investing has gotten more popular these stocks aren t doing well wells fargo and citigroup are down 13 and 18 respectively so far in 2022 declines for bofa and jpmorgan have been more severe nearing the 25 level the quandary banks face many investors have turned to bank stocks because of the rising interest rate environment banks have the reputation of being good ways to benefit from higher rates because they can sometimes give lending institutions the chance to increase the spread between what they have to pay depositors on checking and savings accounts and what they can charge borrowers in interest on their loans however the problem with the current interest rate environment is that it s not quite as obviously beneficial for big banks it s true that long term interest rates have risen sharply with the 30 year treasury climbing from around 1 75 to 3 in the past six months mortgage rates have gone up even more dramatically and commercial lending rates have likely risen largely in lockstep with longer term treasury bonds yet short term rates are also going up and investors see the federal reserve continuing to boost its federal funds rate well into the future as a result of the movements at both ends of the yield curve net interest income might well not rise much or even at all that could stop the profit growth that many shareholders have hoped to see meanwhile several of these banks also have exposure to the investment side of the financial markets if falling stocks and an economic recession lead to a slowdown in initial public offerings mergers and acquisitions and other transactions then these banks could see a hit to the other side of their business moreover with several big banks having focused more on wealth management in recent years the declines in client assets from the market downturn could also weigh on profits relatively low stock prices give bank stocks a margin of safety over other companies that are exposed to the economy however they re not recession proof and with the potential to see earnings decline from current levels under certain circumstances there s a reason they trade at their current valuations

updated june 14 this story will be continuously updated as more wineries release their futures allocations check back for the latest in a time of war and deep economic anxiety bordeaux s futures campaign has begun with the first top wineries releasing futures allocations this week early indicators suggest price increases will be minimal with some producers even reducing prices from last year

dollar is the strongest it s been against the euro in several years giving americans a discount but the 2021 futures offer twin challenges for sales teams the vintage was not easy heavy april frosts drastically reduced yields and a rainy summer left many vintners fighting fungal diseases for much of the growing season some winemakers had to chaptalize in the cellars many are calling it a traditional vintage more elegant than powerful and they are quick to point out that methods in the vineyard and the cellar have drastically improved in the past 50 years outstanding wines can be made even in challenging years then there s the economic outlook as the campaign starts russia s invasion of ukraine and a surge of covid 19 cases in china have exacerbated the challenges faced by an economy already struggling with inflation and the after effects of the pandemic with the s p 500 officially entering bear market territory this week many who typically invest in bordeaux futures aren t feeling flush with cash in a growing season that was clearly the most difficult since 2013 there is simply no reason for consumers to chase the 2021s simply because their prices are in line with

the specialty discount retailer fell along with the entire sector after target and walmart gave out poor commentary for the full year what happened shares of five below five 2 96 tumbled 19 5 this week according to s p global market intelligence the specialty discount retailer that sells items below 5 got hit after target and walmart reported their quarterly earnings it also doesn t help that the broad market indices were down this week as well so what five below did not release any earnings or business updates this week however both target and walmart large companies in the same industry reported poor quarterly results target s operating margin is under pressure from both inflationary pressures in freight costs and inventory issues apparently consumers are moving away from home goods apparel and buying items focused on the beauty and travel industries these developments caught target s management off guard but make sense given the changing dynamics of the u s economy coming out of the covid 19 pandemic target stock dropped more than 20 this week because of these developments walmart faced a similar fate with its earnings results operating income decreased 23 year over year in its latest quarter even though the company delivered solid top line growth this shows how inflationary costs can impact a company that operates heavily in the physical world like walmart so what does this have to do with five below since the company also operates in the retail industry selling knickknack and gift items investors are betting the same sort of inflationary margin pressures are going to hurt its business as well this caused people to sell off the stock this week now what as of this writing five below stock is down 43 2 this year marking one of the worst drawdowns in its history even though short term worries have impacted the stock management is still optimistic about its long term growth plans it eventually wants to triple its store count in the united states to 3 500 locations and by 2025 it wants to double both sales and earnings per share eps this would equate to an eps of around 10 in 2025 compared to its current share price of 117 a share that is a projected 2025 price to earnings ratio of 11 7 if you believe these inflationary pressures will subside eventually now could be a good time to take a long term position in five below stock because of its long term earnings potential

so the plunging stock market has finally dropped into bear market territory a nearly 20 full fledged bear market this comes as no great surprise the market s been falling all year i take no pleasure from this over 100 million americans are invested one way or another in various retirement accounts the vast majority of these retirement savings investors are middle income working folks they re not rich they don t own the bulk of the market wealth but for them their monthly reports from various financial planners or brokerage firms are important very important s p 500 falls into bear market joins nasdaq for most of my career i have argued that the best investment strategy is stocks for the long run professor jeremy siegel wrote the book on this as did professor burton malkiel jeremy is from penn malkiel is from princeton and i think folks who followed their advice to buy on weakness and hold for 40 or 50 years have done very well this current bear market correction is certainly not the end of the world for those faint of heart i recommend not opening your monthly statements when they come at least for a while for others i suggest deep prayer and meditation we will get through this but there s no question in my mind that however temporary these biden radical progressive big government socialist economic policies have been driving stocks down all year excessive federal spending the war against fossil fuels and the fed s money printing have all contributed mightily to a sharp rise of inflation that led to a closely linked upturn of market interest rates and a pronounced drop in the living standards of typical american families where spiking inflation has completely undermined solid wage and salary increases real wages have fallen for 13 consecutive months according to some metrics and if you look under the hood of the major stock market averages you see it clearly the s p 500 retailing index is down over 31 year to date and if you tack on the producer price index increase of 11 those consumer related stocks are off over 40 this year similarly for the home builders index which is now approaching a 50 loss semiconductors near a 40 drop the consumer discretionary cyclicals off over 40 infotech is off over 35 i don t mean to bore you with numbers but i m trying to explain that if you look under the hood of the major averages key economic sensitive sectors have been in a deep bear market for quite some time they are pointing toward recession they could be discounting inflationary recession which is the worst of all worlds the 30 year mortgage rate is at 5 5 ten year treasury notes have just about doubled to 3 the federal reserve s target rate which is hovering at just under 1 currently could go as high as 3 5 by year s end according to sound money advocate jim bullard president of the st louis federal reserve bank georgia gov brian kemp announces plans for massive new hyundai facility unfortunately the fed fell under the woke spell of bidenomics spend borrow print and remained in denial of the inflation threat of these left wing policies now we all have to pay the piper as reality closes in around them i will again say the only way to stop inflation is by abandoning the progressive agenda stop the massive spending stop the regulatory control over the economy stop the radical climate policies that have produced less energy higher gasoline prices and huge consumer angst people in the biden white house choose to ignore the stock market big mistake at their own peril the stock market is reflecting what the rest of the country is saying the latest ap poll shows biden approval at 39 disapproval at 60 a cnn poll shows 86 are either concerned or scared about the country s direction whereas 14 are either excited or optimistic i d truly like to meet that excited crowd that was a joke this is serious business if i may summarize these feelings the key point whether it s the stock market or it s consumers or working families or well heeled businesses nobody has any confidence in the biden administration virtually nobody and confidence matters a lot click here to get the fox news app a free market economy is built on confidence but that confidence has to rest on the rule of law limited government sound money minimal tax rates and the great american idea that as good as the country is today it will be even better in the future we ve lost that for the moment but we will get it back trust me the cavalry is coming this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the may 20 2022 edition of kudlow
cnbc s jim cramer on friday explained fresh technical analysis from veteran chartist larry williams that signals the market is headed for a bottom he says this is it i wouldn t bet against him i trust his predictions more than i despise this market and i say that as someone who really does hate the tape the mad money host said cnbc s jim cramer on friday explained fresh technical analysis from veteran chartist larry williams that signals the market is headed for a bottom i know it s tough to believe anything positive at this moment but i said the same thing in april 2020 and that s when larry williams made one of the best bottom calls i ve ever seen the mad money host said referring to when the market spiraled after the onset of the covid pandemic sent shockwaves through the global economy get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters he says this is it i wouldn t bet against him i trust his predictions more than i despise this market and i say that as someone who really does hate the tape he added cramer started off his explanation of williams analysis by examining the s p 500 futures chart the futures line is in black and the advance decline line a cumulative indicator measuring the number of stocks going up on a daily basis versus the number going down is in blue cramer said williams views the advance decline line as an indicator of the market s internal strength or weakness according to cramer right now you can see that while the s p spent the last week getting smashed into oblivion the advance decline line has been holding up much better in fact it s steadily worked its way higher he said he noted that that pattern when an important indicator goes the opposite way of an index is called a bullish divergence according to williams this action in the advance decline line is incredibly positive for the market it tells you that from the perspective of breadth the worst of this decline may be behind us cramer said next cramer inspected the daily s p futures chart plotted with the on balance volume index in purple the chart reveals that the volume of trading has already started to dry up on the sell side cramer said he noted that the on balance volume index is a cumulative indicator that measures volume flow by adding the volume on up days and subtracting on down days we care about this because volume s like a polygraph test for technicians high volume moves are telling the truth low volume moves often misleading he said and because the on balance volume line has held up despite the s p reaching new lows the chart is consistent with what williams would expect to see in a down market where some major money managers have finally just started buying stocks more aggressively cramer said he also showed a chart showing s p 500 futures plotted with williams insider activity indicator in green look at the bottom of the chart this is williams commitments of traders index which shows you what professional money managers are doing with their futures positions cramer said even though the market s down williams sees the professionals buying here and that often sets up significant rallies he added finally williams observed the dominant cycles for the s p 500 which typically run for 75 days right now that cycle says the s p is ready to run and if the cycle holds williams would expect it to keep running through mid to late june cramer said sign up now for the cnbc investing club to follow jim cramer s every move in the market disclaimer questions for cramer call cramer 1 800 743 cnbc want to take a deep dive into cramer s world hit him up mad money twitter jim cramer twitter facebook instagram questions comments suggestions for the mad money website madcap cnbc com

the man whose mother called him françois marie arouet but who is called voltaire by the rest of us was asked on his deathbed if he would renounce the devil and all his works voltaire declined on the grounds that this is no time to be making new enemies donald trump is to be sure no voltaire the once and perhaps future president of the united states unleashed withering mockery at the news that elon musk has announced he will from now on be voting for the republican ticket gee elon musk never told me that until now he only voted for democrats trump tweeted actually it was quite the contrary but now it seems with all of his problems with a probably illegal purchase of a crummy phony account loaded company fake twitter he wants to be a republican because the dems are a party of hate i could have told him that a long time ago but actually they are a party of sickness greed corruption absolutely horrible policy good luck elon have fun far from being afraid of making new enemies trump revels in it ironically trump is actually supporting musk s central complaint about twitter s accounting for the number of fake accounts on its platform keep in mind that if truth social ever really gets rolling and if musk ever ends up buying twitter these two will own rival social media platforms so a bit of competitive chiding is to be expected fascinatingly musk usually not shy about firing back at critics has so far declined to respond maybe he s decided like voltaire that now is not a moment to make enemies into the bear cave and out the market swung wildly on friday after opening to the upside following an overnight of mostly positive futures stocks tumbled later in the morning the s p 500 entered bear market territory defined as 20 percent below its recent highwater mark then things turned around again and stocks ended mostly flat the s p is down by only just under 19 percent from its january closing high so we officially climbed our way out of the bear s cave the s p has been down seven weeks in a row the nasdaq composite as well those are the longest losing streaks since 2001 according to data from dow jones but the really impressive track record is the dow jones industrial average which has been down eight weeks in a row that s something the market hasn t managed since 1932 when the country was mired in the great depression democrats catch the bidenflation blues president joe biden s approval rating fell to the lowest point of his presidency in may a new poll from the associated press shows what s truly extraordinary is what the ap called that deepening pessimism emerging among members of his own democratic party sixty two percent of democrats say biden s policies have either hurt the economy or made no difference whatsoever sixty five percent of democrats rate the economy as poor up from 50 percent in march not surprisingly including republicans and independents in the mix makes the numbers even bleaker overall two thirds of americans disapprove of biden s handling of the economy which is largely unchanged over the last few months only 18 percent of americans say biden s policies have done more to help than hurt the economy down from the already miserable 24 percent in march we re almost tempted to say that things could not get much worse for the democrats as we hurtle toward the midterms but then we glance back over at the stock market returns and remember that until you get to zero you can always drop another 20 percent

oil gains for the week as demand and tightness show no sign of abating by ship bunker news team however the impact of china s severe covid lockdowns worry analysts file image pixabay the reality of strong global fuel demand on friday outweighed persistent fears within the analytical community of demand destruction due to a host of factors and the result was another session of price gains for oil and the fourth straight week of gains for the commodity west texas intermediate for june delivery settled up 1 02 at 113 23 per barrel and wti for july settled up 39 cents at 110 28 brent for july settled up 51 cents at 112 55 per barrel for the week wti for july was up about 0 4 percent and brent gained about 1 percent it could end up being a cruel summer for energy traders rebecca babin cibc private wealth management trading was influenced by u s energy firms this week adding oil and natural gas rigs for a ninth week in a row according to baker hughes and also by auto club aaa stating that americans continued to get behind the wheel even though gasoline prices hit a record 4 59 per gallon on friday but rebecca babin senior energy trader at cibc private wealth management pointed out there is little logic governing crude trading of late there continues to be a disconnect between the risk financial markets associate with crude financial assets and the physical market that is trying to digest spr releases to meet product demand this dichotomy keeps markets fragmented and volatile it could end up being a cruel summer for energy traders the biggest fear of traders apart from galloping inflation is china who brutal covid lockdown measures have caused economic chaos and on friday it was reported that shanghai found the first cases of covid 19 outside quarantine in six days raising the question about whether the easing of the city s lockdown will be delayed however bloomberg on friday reported that more trucks are on china s highways than a month ago 7 37 million compared to 7 19 million while shanghai s peak hour traffic congestion has edged higher but the news agency conceded that an ongoing virus outbreak in beijing a flareup in the auto hub of tianjin and a ballooning cluster in sichuan indicate the fragile demand recovery could easily be derailed further volatility could result from china s ongoing effort to replenish its strategic crude stockpiles with cheap oil from russia something observers say is a clear sign of beijing strengthening ties with moscow at a time when the western world is divorcing itself economically from the former soviet union meanwhile analysts on friday were optimistic that a long planned initiative by the european union to ban the import of oil from russia will go ahead bca research said in a note odds of an eu embargo being declared sooner rather than later increased in the wake of germany s success in cutting russian oil imports by more than half in a very short period and the plan was said to also have been bolstered by new carve outs for member states most dependent on russian oil such as hungary

washington d c at a meeting thursday to address a nationwide shortage of baby formula fda commissioner robert califf said the nation was still weeks away from returning to normal supplies of the essential product i m pleased to say today we ve already made significant progress and i think we are on track to get open in the next week to two weeks most likely at the outer bound two weeks he said as a parent and grandparent i recognize that many parents and caregivers have been unable to access the infant formula and critical medical foods that they need and they are understandably frustrated and anxious the shortage which experts say has existed for months in the u s was heavily exacerbated by a recall issued by abbott nutrition the recall was issued by the fda in february after four children in three states fell ill and two of them died abbott issued a voluntary recall of certain products and shut down their facility in sturgis michigan badly disrupting the supply of formula the federal government later closed down the facility entirely after discovering abbott had violated safety and sanitary procedures in sturgis this crisis has shown us the impact of having a single manufacturer cease production for a brief period and unless we strengthen the resilience of our supply chain we could be one natural disaster quality mishap or cyber attack from this happening again said califf the fda has already faced criticism from lawmakers over their inability to address the brewing situation even before the abbott recalls i don t think we should be giving ourselves too many kudos here because i wish this hadn t happened in the very beginning said senator debbie stabenow d mi who sponsored a bill that passed this week meant to aid moms on government assistance obtain formula we shouldn t have seen what happened at the abbott plant and in my mind the fda should ve moved more quickly fda was not aggressive enough to go and make sure that formula factory was doing what it needed to do to make sure that families could purchase formula that was safe to get it reopened to work with them said sen patty murray d washington it was just like nobody did their job here this week president joe biden invoked the defense production act so manufacturers of formula could get it to the distributors who need it most the white house also authorized the pentagon to begin using commercial airliners to fly in formula from other nations it would be subject to safety and quality testing once it arrives in the u s i want to be clear said califf under this process an infant formula would only be imported after the agency reviews the product and determines the product is safe and provides adequate nutrition safety is paramount michigan lawmakers want this all looked at closely so stocks of imperative formula don t run low again we need to look at this as not just a checkers move this is a chess move said rep bill huizenga r michigan what are the next couple of moves that need to be made and that is helping these companies especially when we have constrained production and shortages like this to then move as rapidly and safely as possible to get them back online

national tax service has reportedly ordered terraform labs its cofounder do kwon and other executives to pay a 100 billion won 78 million fine for tax evasion according to reports in south korean media the tax agency first launched an investigation into terraform labs and its subsidiaries last june on suspicion of corporate and income tax evasion the probe found two of terraform s subsidiaries were registered in the virgin islands and singapore but managed in south korea this under the country s tax rules required them to pay tax to the korean government but south korea s digitaltoday obtained documents from the country s supreme court registry office which revealed that do kwon decided to dissolve terraform s seoul and busan branches during its general shareholders meeting on april 30 the busan branch was liquidated on may 4 and the seoul branch on may 5 the new findings suggest there s a lot more to the ust luna collapse than meets the eye unsurprisingly employees of

2021 the company admitted it used a range of other assets to support its token us treasury secretary janet yellen addressed the issue of ust s collapse at a congressional hearing on thursday she said such assets don t currently pose a systemic risk to financial stability but suggested they eventually could and urged lawmakers to approve federal regulation of stablecoins this year they present the same kind of risks that we have known for centuries in connection with bank runs she said the european commission is also considering strict curbs on stablecoins to prevent them from being widely used
