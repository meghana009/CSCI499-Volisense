in 2019 general cigar co released the first in what would become an annual series of cigars under the company s punch brand inspired by asian foods and other themes in celebration of chinese lunar new year the first cigar in the series was the punch egg roll a 4 1 2 x 50 rothschild vitola made with a shaggy unwrapped foot that is supposed to mimic the cabbage texture you get when biting into an actual egg roll appropriately enough the egg roll was packaged in a 25 count container designed to look like a chinese food take out container one year later general released the punch chop suey a 7 x 37 panatela that was packaged in a box with chopsticks attached to the top that was followed by the punch kung pow in 2021 a 6 x 52 toro which was once again sold in containers that would look familiar to anyone taking home leftovers from a chinese restaurant earlier this year general began shipping the newest addition to the line although it was a bit different in one notable way named punch fu manchu the 6 x 50 box pressed toro takes its inspiration not from food but from dr fu manchu a character in more than 20 books written by english author sax rohmer blend wise the cigar incorporates a honduran habano wrapper covering an indonesian binder as well as filler tobaccos grown in the dominican republic nicaragua and mexico my colleague patrick lagreid expanded on the origin of the character the dr fu manchu character is the creation of english author sax rohmer with his first appearance coming in 1913 by way of the book the mystery of dr fu manchu the character would go onto appear in more than 20 books as well as movies television music and comic books he is generally described as a supervillain evil criminal genius and mad scientist and became recognizable for his distinctive mustache that became synonymous with his name the character has been portrayed by several notable actors over the years including boris karloff peter sellers and nicolas cage the punch fu manchu was rolled at stg danlí with production limited to 6 400 boxes of 20 cigars for a total run of 128 000 cigars each of which has an msrp of 5 99 instead of traditional boxes the cigars are placed into packaging designed to look like a takeout style soup container that has graphics acknowledging the year of the tiger note the following shows the various punch chinese new year series

more than an interesting gimmick it turns out there is quite a bit more to the story in fact the cigar is smooth flavorful and nicely balanced with a combination of flavors that include not only oak cocoa nibs and peanuts but also a distinct syrupy sweetness that is present on the retrohale sure both the construction and the maple syrup sweetness suffer a bit in the final third but for a cigar that retails for under 6 the combination of positive aspects has no problem outweighing any negatives making it easy to call the punch fu manchu a winner in the end cigar reviewed punch fu manchu

6 400 boxes of 20 cigars 128 000 total cigars 6 400 boxes of 20 cigars 128 000 total cigars number of cigars smoked for review 3 there have been times when i have found a number of different interesting visual aspects about cigars but the punch fu manchu may have them all beat in addition to a soft box press the cigar has a noticeably lighter portion wrapper on the top inch or so a metallic band and a very long tail running from the cap under the band before ending about three quarters of the way down the cigar the rest of the wrapper is a dark espresso brown that is relatively smooth to the touch with a bit of oil and has faint aromas of earth nuts leather manure hay however notes from the foot are quite bit stronger including oak leather vegetal barnyard toast and generic sweetness after a straight cut the cold draw features flavors of strong peanuts gritty earth leather hay cinnamon raisin sweetness and light pepper a combination of distinct anise and strong maple syrup sweetness as well as some light black pepper starts the punch off and while the maple sweetness remains a major part of the profile on the retrohale the main flavors morph to creamy oak and powdery cocoa nibs additional notes of leather earth toast cinnamon popcorn and very light citrus peel flit in and out while the finish is full of roasted espresso beans as mentioned before there is plenty of maple syrup sweetness on the retrohale interspersed with a small amount of white pepper both of which seem to be getting stronger as the first third burns down flavor is a solid medium while both the body and strength end the first third just over the mild mark there is a copious amount of dense gray smoke while the draw is excellent after a straight cut and although the burn is far from razor sharp on all three samples none of them need correcting with my lighter while cocoa nibs remain a core flavor of the cigar during the second third the creamy oak is replaced by a creamy peanut flavor creating a combination that continues to top the profile well after the halfway point secondary notes of generic wood leather tack gritty earth toasted bread cinnamon and a light floral note show up at various points as expected both the white pepper and maple syrup sweetness increase in strength while a small bit of saltiness has shown up on my lips flavor increases to a point just over medium but the body and strength continue to increase in tandem hitting a point halfway between mild and medium by the end of the second third construction wise both the smoke production and draw continue along their excellent paths but the burn on two of the three cigars becomes problematic enough to need attention from my lighter the final third of the fu manchu is a continuation of the previous third meaning the peanut and cocoa nibs flavors easily remains the main combination in the profile followed the by now familiar notes of oak leather tack earth toast and cinnamon as well as hay and nutmeg unfortunately the white pepper and the maple syrup sweetness noticeably recede after their high points in the second third although both notes continue to be more than strong enough to have a positive impact on the profile as a whole until the end of the cigar flavor ends at medium plus while the body hits a point just under medium and the strength ends the cigar at a solid medium the construction was basically unchanged including virtually perfect smoke production and draws as well as two cigars that run into enough issues with their burn that they need corrections final notes according to ed lahmann senior brand manager for punch the lighter tobacco at the cap which is actually additional tobacco added on top of the existing wrapper is simply a lighter shade of the same habano wrapper that is used on the rest of the body of the cigar in fact the blonde cap is meant to replicate kung fu movies he watched as a child where the kung fu master was typically depicted as an old wise man with white hair and a long braid or goatee for what it is worth i did not notice much of a change in the profile when the burn line passed into the lighter tobacco other than being a bit creamier overall the pigtail on this cigar is extremely interesting in that it does not actually originate from the middle of the top of the cap as is normally the case but instead it begins on the side of the cigar and runs under part of the triple cap before running under the band and continuing three quarters of the way down the cigar what this means is that if you pull the pigtail off of the cigar you would bust the cap according to victoria jaworski director of digital marketing and communications at general cigar co the pigtail is not designed to be removed before smoking having said the above i just snapped the pigtail off at the bottom of the band thus leaving the cap intact with no issues as is the case with all three of the previous releases in general s series there is a saying printed on the inside of each cigar s band however the three i smoked included only the above specific sentence in september 2021 general released the punch bento box a sampler that contained a total of 42 cigars 20 of the egg roll 12 of the chop suey and 10 of the kung pow the cigars for that release were not from the original production however as they were rolled specifically for the sampler general cigar co advertises on halfwheel the cigars smoked for this review were purchased by halfwheel final smoking time for all three samples averaged one hour and 51 minutes if you would like to purchase any of the punch fu manchu site sponsors famous smoke shop jr cigars and stogies world class cigars all have them in stock 88 overall score while it may be tempting to pass the punch fu manchu off as nothing more than an interesting gimmick it turns out there is quite a bit more to the story in fact the cigar is smooth flavorful and nicely balanced with a combination of flavors that include not only oak cocoa nibs and peanuts but also a distinct syrupy sweetness that is present on the retrohale sure both the construction and the maple syrup sweetness suffer a bit in the

this report might not reach the level of babylon bee satire but it sure pegs the hell out of the needle on the irony meter as the biden border crisis continues to worsen and the most inept president in modern history and his war on energy have contributed to increasing gas prices virtually from the beginning of his presidency mexico would like a word our southern neighbor is not happy with americans crossing the border in search of lower prices at mexican gas stations advertisement that statement alone is ironic on multiple levels but it gets better as reported by reuters on saturday the mexican government has been subsidizing gasoline to soften price spikes but it has announced that the policy would be suspended in areas close to the u s border this week citing shortages as more and more americans hop over to fill their tanks according to reuters the suspension of the subsidy from april 2 8 covers cities in the border states of tamaulipas nuevo leon coahuila chihuahua sonora and baja california including tijuana one of the world s busiest border crossings mexico s finance ministry said in a statement that the gasoline shortage in the area is due to an imbalance between supply and demand in the united states gasoline prices are higher than in mexico and citizens of that country cross the border to stock up that they are right joe unsurprisingly chinese state media s cgtn global business didn t miss the reuters report about the news no doubt gleefully so tweeting mexico will suspend gasoline subsidies in the u s border regions citing shortages as there were increasing numbers of american drivers crossing borders to fill their tanks reported reuters on sunday how ironic straight factual news from the chicoms on u s gas prices one wonders what they think about the buck passer in chief s silly claim that it s all vladimir putin s fault advertisement mexico will suspend gasoline subsidies in the u s border regions citing shortages as there were increasing numbers of american drivers crossing borders to fill their tanks reported reuters on sunday pic twitter com s2uoldbbcs cgtn global business cgtnglobalbiz april 3 2022 in addition to blaming everyone and everything but himself for run away gas prices as he does with every self created mess biden announced on thursday he plans to tap the strategic petroleum reserve for the next six months at a clip of one million barrels a day as redstate reported biden s big news might very well amount to little more than political expediency moreover given that biden s planned release is equal to just 1 of daily global production and 5 of u s consumption the net effect will likely be a drop in the proverbial bucket biden s real objective of course is convincing everyday americans how much better off they d be if they d give up those gas guzzlers in favor of shiny new evs electric cars and other vehicles as we reported on friday in addition to dropping a whopper on the notion of renewable energy savings mr clueless pontificated about the money saving wonders of electric cars we can take advantage of the next generation of electric vehicles that a typical driver will save about 80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump just one problem advertisement biden says you will save about 80 a month from not having to pay gas at the pump if you buy an electric car so out of touch pic twitter com tsmy5xqvit benny bennyjohnson april 1 2022 the problem that joe and ev hawking sidekick transportation secretary pete buttigieg continue to forget to mention is the average price of a new electric vehicle in february was 64 685 nearly 2 5 times the average price of a new compact car 26 196 and almost twice the average cost of a new suv 33 732 if you check out the aforementioned redstate report you ll see that the rest of the story the math gets worse the longer car payments are made on an ev vs a much less expensive traditional vehicle not that biden has become desperate as gas prices have continued to skyrocket but as we reported in mid march the white house reached out to 30 tiktok and influencers and told them to blame rising gas prices on vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine a demonstrable bald faced lie russia invaded ukraine on february 24 2022 gas prices began to rise in june 2020 and have continued to rise ever since true the russia ukraine war has driven prices through the roof but biden continues to lie by accepting zero responsibility for the 12 months of increases prior to the invasion incidentally the average price of gas when donald trump left office was 2 38 not the 1 86 he continues to claim advertisement the bottom line feckless people do feckless things generally leading to feckless and undesirable results such is the case with joseph robinette biden jr a 50 year career d c insider who improbably rose to the highest office in the land his policies have inarguably left america in far worse shape than he found it from the cost of energy to inflation as a whole to u s foreign policy and of course the continuing stream of illegal aliens crossing our southern border most of whom are apprehended processed and released into the country still the notion of americans fleeing biden s america for mexico in search of affordable gas prompting mexican authorities to rise to the threat of gas shortages by

profits following a 6 4 rally for the asx200 in the month of march it would have been safe to assume the first day of the next quarter would ceteris paribus see investors step back in but not so the only saving grace for the index on friday were rallies for energy 1 2 and materials 1 3 with utilities 0 4 and real estate 0 1 the only other sectors to close in the green the australian economy enjoys a hedge via its resource sector size against the inflation driven by covid and exacerbated by the war energy and materials each rallied 10 in march to drive the 6 4 index gain on friday it was all about lithium and to a lesser extent iron ore every one of the top five index winners on the day was a lithium stock led out by allkem ake up 8 5 down to novonix on 3 4 lesser known avz minerals

supplies iron ore rose 6 on friday bhp group bhp rose 1 2 and is nearing its all time high of last year on the flipside it seems the excitement has faded after the initial response to the josh s show bag of goodies with consumer discretionary the second worst performer on friday with a 1 4 fall pipped only by communication services on 1 5 perhaps the market has come to realise that it s not australia s economy that needs saving rather the coalition and hand outs only fuel further inflation the banks continue to come off their highs as well 0 6 following down us banks while all of healthcare industrials and technology suffered similar falls we begin the new week with oil prices off a bit and metal prices mixed outside iron ore with wall street closing higher our futures closed up 19 points on saturday morning it s official us bond yields shot up again on thursday night following the release of pce inflation data and once again on friday night following the march jobs report but the two year shot up more than the ten year the two year closed at 2 46 and the ten year at 2 39 for a 7 point inversion the thirty year fell to 2 44 the us added 431 000 jobs in march which while shy of 490 000 forecasts it was still a very strong result add in revisions and job additions have averaged 572 000 per month in the three months of 2022 the unemployment rate fell to 3 6 from 3 8 on increased participation and hours worked rose yet there remain 11 million job vacancies hence hourly pay is up 5 6 year on year to the highest level since the 1980s while commentators continue to shrug off yield curve inversion reiterating that inversion in the three month to ten year curve is the true indicator three month 0 53 on friday wall street also began april cautiously despite also having seen an end of quarter sell off on thursday night indeed with five minutes to go all three major indices were flat before closing up 0 3 0 4 on the death as june quarter buyers finally emerged an index garnering a lot of attention on friday night was the dow transports which fell 4 7 the dow transports is separate to the dow industrials and contains trucking companies rail companies airlines and the like we recall that when us inflation began to take off this time last year it was not just about supply shortages but about soaring freight rates which in covid ravaged america had a lot to do with a big deficit of available truck drivers well as the strong jobs numbers might suggest the truckies are back in force indeed there were more in march than there were pre pandemic the result is plunging freight rates good for everyone else and a likely a signal of inflation easing ahead but not good for transport companies another positive sign of possibly easing inflation comes from the us march manufacturing pmi it rose to 58 8 from 57 3 in february suggesting supply issues might also be easing that said auto makers are still being forced to temporarily shut down production due to supply constraints mostly in chips if we look to what was a flat opening to the new quarter for wall street if we discard the final five minutes the suggestion is the jobs numbers only serve to

with the world of retail shifting to a more autonomous future shekel brainweigh asx sbw is at the forefront of the transition with its innovative technologies for the sector the retail market is on the cusp of a digital and frictionless shopping revolution and shekel has created its retail innovations division to develop technologies to lead the way shekel already has established a global presence with long term clients in israel the united states europe australia japan and brazil several of its retail innovation products are also in operation in israel the uk europe and australia with this set to rapidly expand retail transactions through autonomous checkout technologies alone are predicted to increase from us 2 billion in 2020 to reach us 387 billion by 2025 to facilitate this shift to contactless shopping retailers are expected to invest around us 23 billion in artificial intelligence which is up from us 5 billion in 2020 another opportunity in this global retail transition to automation is big data which shekel plans to harness and sell driving the shift according to shekel chief business development officer rami bahar there is a significant increase in demand for small urban grocery stores to service young and small families with smaller homes and tight schedules shoppers are looking to purchase the same day dinner near their home sometimes ready made fresh and healthy food assisting this move is a growth in convenience store product offerings with a focus on healthier and more customised products in line with this consumer shift there has been a rise in new technologies allowing for automation in payments and inventory management these small groceries with limited selection and shoppers traffic cannot afford labour intensive services and autonomous shop models are critical to present realistic return on investment mr bahar explained shekel s solutions can be found everywhere in global retail markets from unattended vending points of purchase through to multiple models of autonomous and hybrid grocery stores as well as self checkout and smart carts in super and hyper markets no other company offers that mr bahar added the smart vending machine market is currently around us 1 6 billion and this is forecast to grow to us 3 billion in 2027 although currently small the market for unmanned convenience stores is worth about us 67 5 million and is predicted to expand to us 1 64 billion by 2027 shekel at the forefront of the global transition leveraging its ai and machine learning technologies combined with decades of knowledge and experience in providing weighing solutions shekel has created a retail innovation division for its business this division has already developed a suite of automation products that aim to transform the retail sector this year alone has seen the first autonomous store opened in the united states which uses shekel s smart solutions for product identification and movement the us store opening in january attracted strong media and public interest with shekel anticipating there is potential for further autonomous stores to open across the country meanwhile an autonomous store will be unveiled in israel later in the current quarter these new stores follow existing autonomous stores in france and one in germany the autonomous stores use shekel s product aware shelves along with hitachi s consumer tracking technology and ust s digital solutions customers use a mobile app and make purchases from the product aware shelves and pay digitally product aware technology shekel s product aware technology incorporates internet of things iot ai on shelf electronics software and algorithms the technology is able to identify products and detect movement on the shelves and continues to be developed using this technology shekel has created the product aware bay which comprises up to eight shelves it is these bays that are used in the autonomous stores other innovations that incorporate shekel s product aware technology are the innovendi and hubz smart fridges these smart fridges have been described as the new way of vending and are already in use across numerous countries the vending machines are unattended micro smart coolers that enable owners to stock food and beverages closer to clients consumers open the fridge by swiping their credit card they can then grab food and beverages directly from the fridge and their purchases are recognised and tallied when each item is taken items grabbed are then automatically calculated and once the fridge door has closed the customer s credit card is automatically charged vending machine owners pay shekel for the hardware and an ongoing software as a services subscription using these technologies shekel has developed the micro market capsule which is a single shopper autonomous store the micro market capsule comprises the product aware bays innovendi units and self checkout technology shekel s autonomous and hybrid store offerings enables retailers an affordable point of sale roll out with the lowest cost of ownership and clear profitability mr bahar explained avoiding expensive and time consuming video files analytics shekel provides a perfectly frictionless experience showing shoppers their basket status in real time while meticulously keeping their privacy smart carts shekel is also at the forefront of the smart cart technology for the retail space a2z smart technologies has developed the cust2mate smart cart which incorporates shekel s weighing technologies including legal for trade and security scales shekel says the smart carts allow efficient accurate and trouble free shopping eliminating the need to search for supermarket weighing positions and checkout queues the units have advanced big data capabilities and communicate with store management preventing fraud and automatically issuing re stocking alerts earlier this month shekel received its first order for its weighing units from a2z the cust2mate is the world s first proven in use mobile self checkout shopping cart which will be rolled out across supermarket chains in israel and the us self checkout technologies as well as its other innovative retail technologies shekel has developed security scales for self checkouts and its more advanced fast track technology shekel is dominating the grocery retail check out zone offering its weigh based solutions to manned and unmanned check out points mr bahar said most self checkout solutions currently rely on computer vision rfid tags and traditional scales which struggle to meet accuracy thresholds shekel s fast track technology was launched in january at the largest retail convention in nyc us national retail federation conference 2022 the embedded deep learning technology has visual fruit and vegetable recognition capabilities that are incorporated in computer vision based self checkouts the technology solves a problem most retailers face at the self checkout where fruit and vegetables can be mistaken or substituted for a cheaper alternative without detection compared to current technologies fast track s accuracy is higher than 99 and more cost effective because it is ai based fast track requires no major infrastructure outlays and can be installed on existing computing devices fast track is also scalable and automatically updated across the network and can be incorporated in fully autonomous stores data the new oil with shekel s technologies able to capture data from every point of the product selection and sale process the company plans to harness this and develop data insight products these data insight products can be purchased by retailers and product developers to provide critical insights into consumer engagement and behaviours shekel describes data as the new oil the global big data and business analytics market was valued at about us 198 billion in 2020 it is estimated it will be worth more than us 684 billion by 2030 equating to a 13 5 compound annual growth rate between 2021 and 2030

warsaw an incoming shipment of u s made switchblade drones will not include the most effective version of that weapon despite ukrainian hopes to acquire the ones that can destroy armored russian military targets as president joe biden s team balances ukrainian requests for aid against logistical challenges and the threat of additional russian aggression the impending delivery of 100 so called kamikaze drones will be drawn from u s government stocks of switchblade 300s a lightweight loitering missile system with a range of about 6 miles over 15 minutes of flight the transfer will not include any of the heavier switchblade 600s which ukraine is eager to acquire in advance of an expected russian effort to destroy its military in the eastern ukrainian region of donbas now that the russians have broken off their attack on the ukrainian capital of kyiv this is the biggest issue a ukrainian official said speaking on condition of anonymity the russians will bring all their capabilities to the battlefield and we have those ridiculous tactical drones that frustration is in tension with the perspective offered by a senior pentagon official who informed congress that 100 drones would be provided to ukraine human rights watch says russian military has committed apparent war crimes in ukraine we have received the message loud and clear from our ukrainian colleagues that this is required defense department assistant secretary celeste wallander told the house armed services committee on wednesday we have committed 100 switchblade tactical unmanned aerial systems to be delivered in the most recent package of presidential drawdown we ve heard the ukrainians and we take that very seriously the biden administration has not approved the transfer of the heavier duty drones according to a senior congressional aide the number of available switchblades is limited by supply chain issues the aide acknowledged but the limitations on the transfer are emblematic of a widespread perception that fear of provoking russia is curbing the amount and quality of military aid that the white house is willing to give there s no reason that we can t be giving the stuff that s in our stocks right now which is several hundred more of the and dozens of the the senior congressional aide said that forbearance is illustrative of a wider gap between actual u s aid to ukraine and the potential american assistance one that reflects a struggle inside major nato capitals including washington about the most prudent way to support ukraine france and germany have been perceived as eager for a ceasefire while the biden administration according to u s and european sources is more willing to support ukraine but also fears that russian president vladimir putin will turn to weapons of mass destruction if the war goes too wrong for russian troops ukraine so much harm to the russian war machine that they ve gained momentum and now we see worry in the west what putin now might do that now he s like a rat in a corner and he s even more dangerous said a senior european official whose country emerged from behind the iron curtain after the collapse of the soviet union so it s weird we don t agree with that at all other allies argue that putin is more likely to use chemical weapons in support of a russian offensive not to halt a ukrainian counteroffensive the aim is not to have written in the history books that russia lost the war in ukraine but on top of that used chemical weapons a baltic official said the primary goal is to occupy ukraine or at least part of ukraine and for that they would be willing to use chemical weapons in advancement if they see that their casualties are mounting but they still have hope but they don t want more lost troops and equipment use chemical weapons secretary of state antony blinken s team is perceived as more willing to answer ukrainian calls for increased military assistance while white house national security adviser jake sullivan has acquired a reputation being afraid of winning due to an apparent misgiving that putin could use weapons of mass destruction if the ukrainian military proves too effective in the war it s quite extraordinary that the state department is rather on the hawkish side whereas the white house is certainly pretty careful about this provoking thing a second senior european official said they are just concerned of what if as a result of anything happening russians feeling weakened or something like that if the russians were to use the chemical or biological weapons what then the actual response to that i know that they are sitting down trying to draw up some options that attitude has not prevented the united states from functioning as one of the world leaders in assistance to ukraine the biden administration has provided more than 1 6 billion in security assistance since russia s unprovoked premeditated invasion counting the 300 million package unveiled friday that includes the 100 switchblade drones our role is to do everything we can to strengthen ukraine on the battlefield as we ve done with the security assistance the unprecedented amount of security assistance and weapons that we ve flowed to ukraine and also to strengthen their hand at the negotiating table by continuing to apply incredibly severe costs and sanctions on russia white house communications director kate bedingfield told reporters wednesday yet the vast majority of that effort has focused on providing ukraine with weapons that would allow them to resist russian attacks rather than counterattack and reverse the russian invasion according to one senior official from a nato member state ukraine has first of all a right to self defense but it also has a right to return to the status quo ante by force if needed this is absolutely legitimate the senior central european diplomat said some of the allies are just afraid that it will be too provocative to provide ukraine with higher end systems that caution has existed uncomfortably alongside the intermittent peace talks between russian and ukrainian officials in turkey some of the west europeans would be more comfortable with this ending sooner regardless of the outcome the senior central european official said earlier this week after the discovery of massacred civilians around kyiv was revealed by the withdrawal of russian forces this week german chancellor olaf scholz pledged that putin and his supporters will feel the consequences of the atrocities while german defense minister christine lambrecht cautioned against trusting putin to honor the terms of a hypothetical peace deal we have seen how people lied how we were deceived how promises and commitments were not kept she said sunday and that s why i m very hesitant very skeptical that statement is more in line with the assessment of russia hawks who assume that putin will cling to any ukrainian territory that russian troops control at the moment that a ceasefire is called there ll be no afghanization no long conflict exhausting as someone expects michael podolyak a senior zelensky adviser wrote on twitter as russian troops withdrew from kyiv will leave all territories except the south east will try to dig in there set air defense drastically reduce losses dictate terms without heavy weapons we won t be able to drive out logistical problems also impede the provision of those systems as the central european official and others acknowledged because the training for more advanced and more complicated systems take much more time especially with respect to maintenance and yet it s clear that some western allies are less nervous about improving ukrainian military power the brits seem to be more eager to give something stronger actually what ukraine needs to repel the aggressors out the first senior european official said the ukrainian logic is that in their own territory nothing is an offensive weapon everything that they could get and use in their own territory is defensive there are signs that u s and western european officials are trending toward alignment with that argument scholz said berlin will continue to make weapons available to ukraine and biden s team has agreed to assist with the transfer of soviet made tanks in the possession of nato allies according to a new report from the new york times click here to read more from the washington examiner we applaud all of those countries who are supporting our ukrainian partners state department spokesman ned price said thursday for our part we have provided 2 billion to our ukrainian partners over the course of this administration and that support that assistance will continue it will continue so that our ukrainian partners can continue to be effective on the battlefield

this post is also available in italian german something strange has happened something strange has happened something has changed over the last year or two you ve probably been hearing people say these sorts of things lately come to think of it you ve probably been hearing yourself thinking and saying these sorts of things lately as well and maybe you ve got a sneaky suspicion that these thoughts that these feelings of strangeness are not simply a product of the covid 19 pandemic good news bad news the good news is you re not at all crazy for thinking and feeling these things the bad news is you re not at all crazy for thinking and feeling these things we as a nation and as a global economy have entered a post capitalist era what does this mean the biggest windfall in 72 years before we get into the meat of the matter here are a few important bits of information from very recent economic news articles according to the latest market watch economic report u s corporate profits rose 25 this past year to an unprecedented high 1 in fact according to yesterday s edition of bloomberg business week the wealthiest sector of american society has not seen a windfall like this in 72 years 2 only half of the story directly alongside these reports of never before seen levels of profit by 0 01 of the population we are seeing reports of rising inflation and an upcoming level of recession for the rest of us that the us has not encountered in almost half a century some are saying that this new phase of the downturn is the result of the us involvement in the ukraine russia conflict this is simply not true in fact reports of an oncoming rise in inflation rates and a coming economic downturn were proliferating months before russia s invasion of ukraine 3 what has happened this time in 2021 2022 is not just a matter of the rich getting richer at the expense of everyone else we ve entered an era where that old adage is only half of the story as you well know since april 2009 there has been a steadily growing gap opening up between financial markets and the rest of the economy this gap appeared and began expanding when central banks and governments decided at the g 20 level to print massive amounts of money in order to bail out huge financial institutions after the 2008 economic crash many of these institutions as you well know had been stealing large sums of money from their clients for nearly a decade instead of re investing this newly printed money in the general economy the heads of these giant companies kept the money for themselves by buying back their own stock shares ironically these huge financial institutions bought back these shares with money that would ultimately come out of the pockets of the very taxpayers that these corporations stole from repeat recycle this same procedure of gifting newly printed money to huge financial institutions was repeated over the last two years as a response to the covid 19 pandemic and of course again the monstrous profits that were the direct result of the suffering and misfortune of large swaths of the public during the pandemic will be subsidized via inflation and austerity by the very public who endured the suffering and misfortune the difference this time the difference this time in 2022 is that the market financiers have effectively exited the stratosphere so to speak while the rest of the economy is shrinking the gap between markets and what is taking place in the general economy has become an abyss we have entered an economic phase that amounts literally to socialism for the extremely wealthy and continually burgeoning austerity for the many i had been referring to this phase as inverted socialism until i recently heard a better definition put forth by the greek economist yanis varoufakis he calls it techno feudalism we no longer live under capitalism we no longer live under capitalism the last vestiges of a competition driven market are all but gone what we have now is a very small number of platform companies that effectively own the market they don t monopolize it they own it take for instance amazon and facebook as varoufakis says when you enter amazon or facebook you are no longer in capitalism you are in a kind of soviet regime owned by one man meanwhile the rest of the market economy is shrinking it s in stagnation money is being pumped in by the central banks that are struggling to keep the general economy alive this money ends up with the large corporations that already have savings that they re not investing due to the public s decreased purchasing power which is the result of austerity and so these corporate financiers use the money to buy back their own stocks the result is that you have the stock exchanges of london frankfurt new york etc doing very well while the rest of the people are suffering 4 what all this is doing to our democracy it doesn t take a rocket scientist to connect all of this to what is happening to our already fragile democracy in recent decades we ve done away with pretty much all restrictions on the takeover of our major institutions by a handful of wealthy financiers we ve deregulated our banking system and our media and we ve done away with any serious campaign finance restrictions when you have a handful of exorbitantly rich unconstrained people dictating the terms and conditions of all the major aspects of a society including who gets the donations necessary to run for government offices you no longer have a growing democracy you have a growing oligarchy if you think calling the us an oligarchy is an overstatement then you ll have to take it up with the new york times and business insider who both published articles affirming that we are no longer living in an actual democratic state 5 the oddly hopeful aspect of all this the oddly hopeful aspect of all this to put it bluntly is that just about everybody is beginning to realize that there is absolutely no way we can continue to carry on in this manner even if they can t formulate it in words yet even if they re not clear on the details huge numbers of people from every sector of society from every income bracket are feeling more and more that something is fundamentally broken about the way we are living about our beliefs about our collective conception of what it means to be a human being on this planet called earth yes the world does feel strange and sometimes scary right now but this is because we haven t yet broken out of our isolation we haven t yet broken out of a belief system that makes it seem that it is we each of us who are the problem the belief that it is we who must continue to struggle to make the necessary grade to be worthy to live in a world with the 0 01 of the population who really matter a stage of collective acknowledgement a stage of collective acknowledgement is going to eventually arrive we re already seeing stirrings of it in things like the huge resurgence of workers unions over the last 18 months 6 we mustn t forget that eleven years ago a global movement of millions formed in a period of a few months we mustn t forget that we re living in a digital age an exponentially changing age not an incrementally changing analog age we mustn t underestimate ourselves almost anything could happen citations 1 2 3 4 5 6

an economist has claimed the us stock market has already hit its lowest point for 2022 after russia invaded ukraine although that war and soaring inflation could prove him badly wrong tom lee managing partner at fundstrat said that as long as there s no recession due to a continuation of the war or the 40 year spike in the cost of living the s p could surge to 5 100 by the end of the year as of sunday night it sits at 4 545 86 points lee believes there s a roughly 90 percent chance that the market won t slip below the 4 114 low of february 24 when the invasion began the upside would be a 13 percent gain from current levels and a 24 percent rise from the late february nadir we think lows for 2022 are in with 88 probability we still see stocks in a jagged recovery in 1h2022 full risk on coming in 2h2022 s p 500 can exceed 5 100 before year end lee told business insider tom lee managing partner at fundstrat said that as long as there s no recession due to a continuation of the war the s p could surge to 5 100 by the end of the year the low points for the s p 500 mark the very beginning of vladimir putin s war in ukraine but the market has since recovered nicely inflation in the united states reached a new 40 year high of 7 9 in february in another grim signal for consumers lee s predictions are based on the stock market withstanding inflation supply chain issues war in europe and the continuation of the pandemic all of which have badly rattled the economy the s p 500 has only dipped around 5 percent from where it was in 2021 despite a nearly 12 percent drop early in march the dow jones and nasdaq have also seen big gains since a february 2022 low when the war in ukraine began president voloydymr zelensky s troops have done a far better than expected job of holding back vladimir putin s far larger army but much of the world s reliance on russian gas and sanctions slapped on putin s government have seen energy prices soar inflation hit 7 9 per cent in february according to the most recent complete figures that is the highest level since 1982 with the figure likely to rise even higher in march when the ongoing war in ukraine is factored in lee pointed to the fact that there have been 31 key reversals where the s p 500 went over six percent below its moving 200 day average and closed above the technical indicator the s p went higher six months later 14 of the 15 times when the united states didn t go into a recession and was higher in a year s time in 100 percent of those instances that means that even if there were to be a recession there would be a great chance of stocks rising back up within a year the dow jones has also seen big gains since a february 2022 low when the war in ukraine began the nasdaq has climbed back above 14 000 after going nearly as low as 12 000 in late february lee an accomplished wall street strategist with over 25 years of experience in equity research is bullish on the market s rebuild so this recovery in equities to close above 200 day moving average generates quite a lot of positive signal lee said lee adds that there may be some rockiness in the very near future after the next three to four months things look positive us still has the best companies and is the most liquid market he said adding that latin american countries are also seeing solid performance thanks to their pro commodity exposure though lee called the us the best house in a bad neighborhood

dear earthtalk is encouraging dairy farmers and cattle ranchers to capture methane gas from their livestock s manure good or bad for the planet phil onorato pittsburgh pa methane capture the process of using the decomposition of livestock byproducts like cow and hog manure to generate electricity is a promising technology it helps to resolve existing and for the time being necessary evils such as climate warming methane emissions from cattle and pigs it works by exposing the livestock waste to bacteria and enzymes that break down the embedded methane into usable natural gas that can be pumped right into generators large farms and livestock operations that employ this now widely available technology can turn their cattle and pigs from a climate scourge methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than even carbon dioxide into at least a producer of renewable energy even if it is a fossil fuel one benefit of generating natural gas this way is that the resource is renewable as long as cows and pigs keep defecating another is that methane capture accommodates existing technologies methane capture fuel and traditional natural gas use the same infrastructure the downside of methane capture at least as far as environmentalists are concerned is that it perpetuates the fossil fuel oriented status quo and further incentivizes the factory farm business model instead of a shift to true zero emission renewables like solar wind and geothermal the factory farm business model has wreaked havoc on the environment from coast to coast from pig waste overflows in north carolina to poisoned waterways in the midwest from runoff contaminated by livestock waste to california drought from cattle ranches claiming more than their fair share of water to quench cattle thirst but proponents of using methane emissions to offset methane production by livestock argue that their way of producing energy is just as zero emission as solar or wind yet we wouldn t even need the process of methane capture to begin with without the livestock trade carbon offsets also do not reduce methane emissions they simply compensate for them in a sense they are robbing peter to pay paul policy pushes abound on both sides of the issue these include the california state government walking a fine line between supporting its farm based economy while leaning toward a greener future through incentivizing methane capture their opponents including advocacy groups like food and water watch the sierra club the southern environmental law center and the natural resources defense council are coordinating on crafting legal solutions to manure related pollution issues methane capture may be a controversial technology but it is worth investigating solutions that can work right now have some benefits over solutions that are only possible in the distant future but future planning will require more ambitious solutions than temporary replacements contacts california rejects petition to drop factory farm gas from energy credit system foodandwaterwatch org 2022 01 26 california rejects petition to drop factory farm gas from energy credit system for dairy farmers this technology turns methane from cow manure into cash marketplace org 2021 07 21 for dairy farmers this technology turns methane from cow manure into cash earthtalk is produced by roddy scheer doug moss for the 501 c 3 nonprofit earthtalk see more at emagazine com to donate visit earthtalk org send questions to
spring is here and with it come holidays perfect for a favorite protein eggs besides being delicious eggs also are important to virginia agriculture in 2021 virginia farmers produced 710 million eggs according to the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service ranking among the top 20 commodities produced in the commonwealth sales of eggs generated more than 94 million in cash receipts in 2020 over the past 20 years egg consumption has trended upward by 15 said hobey bauhan president of the virginia poultry federation and a member of rockingham county farm bureau this increase has resulted in americans consuming an average of 286 eggs annually according to the usda u s poultry farms produced nearly 96 billion table eggs in 2021 the usda forecasts 2022 s production will exceed last year s by 1 while consumer demand remains strong throughout the year there is an uptick during spring and around holidays as people use more eggs for cooking and baking special treats and for egg hunts eggs are a great nutrient dense source of protein for healthy diets explained mary rapoport consumer affairs director for the virginia egg council there are so many different nutrients and benefits that come with eggs people are more and more aware of that which is why we ve seen an upward trend of egg consumption in recent years whether they re eaten deviled fried scrambled or mixed into a salad eggs are known for being nutritional powerhouses they contain nutrients like iron vitamins a and b selenium potassium and more with only about 70 calories most of these nutrients are found in the yolks in addition eggs help support heart brain and eye health they are one of the most concentrated sources of choline vital for the nervous system and help improve the body s absorption of nutrients in vegetables including vitamin e and carotenoids they re also one of the most affordable proteins at the grocery store while inflation has increased prices overall the retail price of eggs is tracking with general inflation eggs and other poultry products remain a good value for consumers compared to some other protein options available bauhan noted
mk bhadrakumar former ambassador washington expects india to comply with its sanctions from hell against russia this paradigm has been cast as a battle between democracies and autocracies but india will not get swayed by such dissimulation the fact that pm narendra modi made a notable exception to receive the visiting russian foreign minister sergey lavrov for a 40 minute meeting against the tumultuous backdrop of global politics has conveyed a powerful message modi has underscored that india attaches the highest importance to relations with russia in its global strategies indeed it bears testimony to modi s warm personal relations with russian president vladimir putin and to the centrality he attaches to the strategic partnership with russia in his own global vision the west s real agenda is the reimposition of a unipolar world order to perpetuate its domination of the international economic and political order there couldn t be a more definitive signal than what modi gave namely that india s strategic autonomy is non negotiable and its national honour as a fiercely independent country is not up for bargaining hopefully the curtain will now come down on western bullying equally the readout of eam jaishankar s meeting with lavrov suggests that an in depth discussion on the overall state of cooperation took place eam s emphasis on a stable and predictable bilateral relationship presaged the confidence publicly expressed by lavrov that a way would be found to bypass the artificial impediments which illegal unilateral sanctions by the west create this relates also to the area of military and technical cooperation we have no doubt that the solution would be found and respective ministries are working jaishankar has skilfully navigated the indian approach in a hugely transformative period in the international system and world order by viewing the paradigm solely through the prism of the country s interests as modi would have expected the national consensus will laud this fundamentally what needs to be understood is that the confrontation brewing over ukraine for a decade is in reality about the contours of the world order the spectre that haunts the west is that its five century old global domination has come under serious challenge as multiple power centres such as china india have emerged in various regions this is a last desperate throw of the dice so to speak to push back the forces of history the west s real agenda is the reimposition of a unipolar world order to perpetuate its domination of the international economic and political order while in delhi last week us deputy national security adviser daleep singh blurted out the truth when he explained the raison d être of giving a financial shock to russia s central bank what we are doing is pushing russia back decades i think they re going back to the ussr in terms of their technological sophistication that reduces mr putin s ability to exert influence and to exercise power on the world stage russia has become a thorn in the flesh because of its independent foreign policies that impede or block the west s global policies to transfer wealth from resource rich countries or to bully weaker countries into submission on the other hand in military terms too russia has obtained a superiority over hypersonic missiles which may give it a monopoly on nuclear capable weapons in the foreseeable future and on top of all this russia s alliance with china and india can potentially become a game changer for the economic order the confidence in washington that the sanctions would deal a lethal blow to russia s economy is shaky already reuters reported on friday that the rouble clipped its strongest mark since the ukraine conflict began on february 24 thanks to a genuine improvement in the country s finances and also due to capital controls russian stock indexes hit their highest since february 22 and of course russia didn t default on its debt repayments meanwhile if russia creates new facts on the ground to the east of dniepr river we are looking at a new world altogether at the end of the day the us leadership will not be taken seriously anymore particularly in europe the frenzy of rage in washington is self evident on a parallel track the us overuse of sanctions as a weapon to punish countries is also triggering a blowback raghuram rajan wrote last week it is not impossible to imagine a country being subjected to economic warfare because of its government s position on abortion or climate change for example a widespread fear of indiscriminate sanctions would lead to more defensive behaviour following the action taken against russia s central bank china india and many other countries will worry that their own foreign exchange holdings of advanced economy debt may prove unusable if a few countries decide to freeze their assets more countries also might start exploring collective alternatives to the swift financial messaging network gita gopinath the imf s first deputy managing director has said the unprecedented financial sanctions imposed on russia threaten to gradually dilute the dominance of the us dollar and encourage the emergence of small currency blocs based on trade between groups of countries in fact the share of international reserves has fallen from 70 per cent to 60 per cent over the past two decades with the emergence of other trading currencies the erosion in the status of the dollar as the world currency would have profound geopolitical consequences the sum of all outstanding debt owed by the us federal government on february 1 surpassed 30 trillion for the first time government debt to gdp is expected to reach 138 10 per cent of gdp by the end of 2022 now what happens if the us cannot pay off its debt the highly arbitrary unlawful seizure of russia s central bank reserves shows that anything is possible the us has really ripped up the playbook
mexico has suspended petrol subsidy in states close to the us border in a bid to stop americans from driving across to fill up their tanks at subsidised rates mexico s finance ministry said there have been shortages because of the increasing rate of americans crossing over to buy petrol petrol prices in the us have significantly gone up in the past weeks following the russian ukraine war diesel price currently stands at 4 192 and it is expected to keep rising in the coming days the price hikes pushed us drivers into mexico for cheaper fuel sold in the neighbouring country advertisement but the mexican government has now enforced a suspension of the petrol subsidy in border states from april 2 8 the affected border states include tamaulipas nuevo leon coahuila chihuahua sonora baja california and tijuana mexico s finance ministry said an imbalance between supply and demand caused the petrol shortage in the states advertisement in the united states gasoline prices are higher than in mexico and citizens of that country cross the border to stock up the ministry said speaking with reuters on friday gabriel yorio mexico s deputy finance minister said the country intends to use revenue from high oil prices to subsidise domestic petrol and diesel prices andres manuel lopez obrador mexico s president had earlier promised to implement a subsidy policy that will insulate mexicans from sharp spikes in fuel prices

but while there may be industrial logic in a better together takeover this will not necessarily be an easy deal to get over the line while pendal led by chief executive nick good and new chairman deborah page has very much left the door ajar to a combination it has also accused perpetual of being opportunistic although without actually using that word it should be noted the scrip and cash bid of 6 23 might represent a near 40 per cent premium to pendal s closing price on friday but pendal has been quick to point out it is in line with where pendal traded as recently as late november pendal s internal problems this implied charge of opportunism is almost standard in modern takeover battles and as such is no surprise but pendal s suggestion that it is a victim of significant geopolitical instability the economic impacts of the covid 19 pandemic and broader market volatility does ring a bit hollow given pendal s most recent problems have been internal advertisement on january 14 it announced it had seen 6 8 billion worth of net outflows in the december quarter just three days later chairman james evans suddenly retired and was replaced by page the world may be a dangerous place and markets are clearly volatile but pendal hasn t exactly given investors many reasons to believe of late and it s worth noting that perpetual shares have held up quite well compared to others in the funds management sector where pendal is down 46 per cent over the past six months magellan is down 52 per cent and pinnacle investment management is down 30 per cent perpetual shares have fallen 8 5 per cent value will clearly be central to this deal as you would expect given we are talking about two companies whose stock pickers spend their time assessing what businesses are worth pendal shares surged 21 per cent to 5 41 on monday morning but that obviously leaves a big gap to the perpetual bid in a note released monday before the takeover was announced credit suisse analyst james cordukes said pendal looked oversold but still slashed his target price on the stock from 6 85 to 5 40 due to a weaker investment outlook script heavy component advertisement but how perpetual proposes to deliver value to pendal investors will be important too a big issue for pendal s board is the bid s heavy script component pendal shareholders have been offered 1 67 in cash plus one perpetual share for every 7 5 pendal share they own and would emerge with 48 per cent of the combined business the pendal board and its advisers macquarie capital and king wood mallesons will justifiably argue this makes the process of assessing the perpetual bid much more complex because the pendal board will need to effectively conduct due diligence on perpetual if they are to recommend the bid many issues could flow from that due diligence but one that is top of mind for pendal and its advisers right now is how well the two businesses will fit together pendal sees itself as a boutique fund manager with a stable of options for investors perpetual obviously also has a funds management business but it is more than that its perpetual private division provides advice and services to individuals families and the not for profit sector while perpetual corporate trust provides a range of trustee services to the wealth management sector the feeling inside pendal s boardroom is that their investors want exposure to a pure play fund manager rather than a diversified business like perpetual advertisement indeed the pendal camp points out the fact perpetual s share price has held up better than other global fund managers shows that the bidder isn t in this category and as such this isn t a simple combination of two very similar businesses that may be right although whether the tie up creates new opportunities for creating value should also be on the minds of the pendal board as one investor says the combined group s strengthened funds management capability across australia the us and britain could actually create new opportunities for the perpetual private and perpetual corporate trust divisions at least over time the perpetual camp argues that pendal s recent outflows mean the target could do with some help on distribution cost synergies but the biggest immediate selling point is around cost synergies which perpetual puts at 50 million a year on a pre tax basis subject to due diligence advertisement perpetual sees the deal creating a clear leader in the australian asset management market the combined group will be well placed to grow its asset management businesses across all key markets and channels gain improved leverage and scalability across a unified business platform delivering high quality client service greater innovation whilst meaningfully enhancing the growth profile of both companies the company said in a statement another obvious point of synergy between the two businesses is around esg in 2019 pendal completed the buyout of esg investment advisory and engagement business regnan which grew out of monash university in the late 1990s to become one of australia s pioneering esg firms advertisement perpetual burnished its esg credential in 2020 with the acquisition of trillium established in 1982 by the woman adams describes as the founding mother of esg in america joan bavaria trillium has grown assets under management by 74 per cent to 9 2 billion since perpetual completed its deal on june 30 2020 esg could emerge as the second force behind perpetual s takeover of pendal clearly the wave of money into esg is not going to stop any time soon and at face value at least it appears regnan and trillium could fit together nicely pendal and its advisers will clearly want to test perpetual s synergies assumptions as part of their appraisal of the bid and there reverse due diligence but the pendal camp says it will also need to explore if the bid throws up any dis synergies integration costs are one obvious source of dis synergies but client overlap may throw up another do institutional investors who have money invested with both perpetual and pendal become worried about their exposure to the enlarged group such

as we enter the next quarter of 2022 cnbc asked analysts from goldman sachs and jpmorgan asset management which southeast asian markets were their top picks indonesia is a top southeast asian pick for both jpmorgan asset management and goldman sachs southeast asia as a whole is relatively insulated from geopolitical tensions elsewhere in places such as europe where the war in ukraine has kept investors on edge over the region s economic outlook the analysts told cnbc geopolitical tensions around the world have been on the rise but southeast asia s markets may offer relative safety to investors according to top investment banks as we enter the next quarter of 2022 cnbc asked analysts from goldman sachs and jpmorgan asset management which southeast asian markets were their top picks southeast asian stocks have underperformed and been largely ignored by global investors for a decade said timothy moe goldman s chief asia pacific equity strategist get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters indonesia is a top southeast asian pick for both wall street banks indonesia banking and commodity plays in indonesia we are structurally positive on the banks as the majority of the population are still unbanked or underbanked we are currently positioned in the leading private sector and also state owned banks as they have been proactively driving digital adoption to accelerate financial penetration said desmond loh a portfolio manager at jpmorgan asset management strong commodity prices have also been beneficial for export earnings in indonesia as well as the country s trade balance and that s set to support the indonesian rupiah as well as the nearer term growth outlook in indonesia he said global commodity prices have been on a rollercoaster ride since the war in ukraine broke out after russia s invasion in late february russia is a major oil producer while ukraine is a major exporter of other commodities such as wheat and corn as of monday morning in asia international benchmark brent crude futures have risen more than 30 so far this year vietnam and singapore jpmorgan asset management also likes vietnam which loh termed a star performer in the past few years in economic resiliency and growth vietnam is one of the few economies globally to have seen positive economic growth throughout the pandemic he added to capitalize on the growth we are positioned in high quality consumer proxies and banks he said without naming specific stocks meanwhile singapore is the other southeast asian that goldman sachs likes there are three main reasons why the investment bank likes indonesia as well as singapore said moe improving economic and growth momentum from a region recovering belatedly from covid related setbacks a banking sector that is heavily weighted in stock indexes and set to benefit from a switch to tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates the gradual emergence of digital economy firms which are being included in indonesia and singapore indexes indonesia s jakarta composite has risen more than 7 this year while vietnam s vn index is up about 1 in the same period singapore s straits times index has gained more than 9 in comparison msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan has dropped 6 on wall street the s p 500 is down 4 6 so far this year while the pan european stoxx 600 has dropped about 6 investors have in recent weeks been grappling with a range of concerns from the commodity price spike triggered by russia s invasion of ukraine to a rising interest rate environment as major central banks like the u s federal reserve seek to fight inflation shelter from geopolitical tensions southeast asia is relatively insulated from rising geopolitical tensions in europe as russia and ukraine account for less than 1 of regional exports according to loh escalation in geopolitical risks renders near term tailwind for commodity prices to underpin the strength of asean s commodity exporter markets he said referring to the 10 member states of the association of southeast asian nations no exodus of outflows expected global investors have been repositioning in the last few weeks in anticipation of more aggressive moves ahead by the federal reserve s monetary tightening but the analysts expect the impact on southeast asia to be relatively smaller compared to before in march the federal reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 and fed chair jerome powell subsequently pledged to take tough action on inflation that is much too high the prospect of more rate hikes ahead by the fed has raised concerns of capital outflows and currency depreciation in southeast asia s emerging markets a phenomenon seen in 2013 during the taper tantrum that saw bond yields spike after the fed hinted asset purchases could wind down we don t expect an exodus of outflows as we saw in the last taper tantrum loh said explaining that country level balance sheets in southeast asia are generally much healthier now compared to a decade ago most of southeast asia s central banks with the exception of singapore have yet to tighten monetary policy that s in part due to an inflation situation regionally that is relatively less severe compared with developed economies in the west southeast asian economies today are also more resilient compared to past cycles according to moe who cited external balances that are in better shape as well as currencies that are attractively valued
it was more than just the successful delivery of a few vehicles that helped this ev company s stock motor ahead in march what happened after sinking more than 24 through the first two months of 2022 shares of xos xos 1 10 headed in the other direction last month and rose 25 1 in march according to data from s p global market intelligence in addition to news regarding the delivery of vehicles to an important customer the company s announcement of its fourth quarter 2021 earnings and an auspicious forecast for the start of 2022 electrified the bulls excitement last month so what the first catalyst for the stock s rise came on march 8 when the company announced that it had delivered three vehicles to unifirst a provider of uniform and protective clothing at its southern california location xos plans on making additional deliveries of its electric trucks to unifirst at its location in boston during the second half of 2022 while the delivery of three vehicles is hardly transformational investors recognize the company s achievement as an encouraging sign regarding the likelihood of further deliveries that are in the works during an investor presentation in january xos reported that unifirst as well as cintas and morgan services have signed letters of intent for the purchase of up to 200 vehicles three weeks later xos gave investors more reason to celebrate reporting fourth quarter 2021 revenue of 3 3 million xos beat analysts expectations that the company would report 2 8 million on the top line at the bottom of the income statement investors found even more reason to smile xos reported earnings per share eps of 0 07 notable higher than the 0 11 loss per share that analysts had anticipated but it wasn t only the road that the company had recently traveled that provided motivation to pick up shares last month management s optimistic view of what lies ahead for xos also resonated with investors management forecasts first quarter 2022 deliveries of 40 to 55 vehicles and revenue of 4 5 million to 6 3 million to put in perspective the significance of management s delivery forecast for q1 2022 xos reported deliveries of 32 and 44 units for q4 2021 and the full year of 2021 respectively now what while familiar names like tesla nio and lucid group may captivate the majority of the public s attention it s important to recognize that the ev landscape is much more diverse than than popular luxury brands the electrification of last mile delivery trucks like those that xos manufacturers are also in demand and should remain on the radars of potential ev investors that have remained on the sidelines so far
fn media group presents usa news group news commentary vancouver bc april 1 2022 prnewswire in 2021 shares of more eco friendly companies known to appease esg investors were outperformed by oil and gas stocks over the course of the year despite this apparent divergence there s been a movement towards making o g stocks more esg friendly such as the push to reincorporate civitas resources inc nyse civi into esg funds less phased by esg peer pressure billionaire investor warren buffett and his berkshire hathaway inc nyse brk a nyse brk b stacked up an investment worth 7 7 billion into occidental petroleum corporation nyse oxy in march 2022 with speculation he could pay the remaining 50 billion to acquire the whole thing buffett s latest investment put occidental in with chevron corporation nyse cvx as the only two o g stocks in berkshire s top 10 largest common stock holdings meanwhile other esg friendly o g deals are taking place including the takeover of petroteq energy inc otcpk pqeff by viston united swiss ag in the case of petroteq energy inc otc pink pqeff cleaner technologies for sustainable oil production drew significant attention from esg focused equity firm viston united swiss ag which was created to invest in renewable energies and clean technologies as well as in the environmental protection industry petroteq s development of proprietary oil extraction and remediation technologies made it stand out as part of an overall esg strategy for viston united swiss ag their technology s ability to enable a company to produce oil without water waste tailings ponds and emissions led to viston s premium price valuation of petroteq stock at a price point of approximately 279 over the closing price of the common shares on the tsx venture exchange on august 6 2021 and a 1 032 premium to the 52 week volume weighted average trading price on the tsx v prior to the offer originally made in april 2021 we are particularly pleased with the recognition this shows of our technology which we have taken from inception to commercial viability as a one of its kind in oil sands eco friendly green extraction said former petroteq chairman and ceo dr gerald bailey who retired in january we had always forecast a great future however we respect the value of this offer to shareholders and if it can be achieved it will reward our many dedicated supporters last september petroteq proved it could produce from oil sands ore using its clean oil recovery technology cort process after the release of the pilot program s test results vladimir podlipskiy phd interim ceo and director of petroteq commented confirmation that heavy oil extracted from utah oil sands using our cort process is suitable for production of msar and biomsar fuels could allow for the production of fuel and biofuel with significant environmental benefits while creating a higher value product stream for petroteq s future commercial production in addition to sustainable oil production petroteq s technology cleans oil sands of all hydrocarbons creating a purified sand as part of an overall esg strategy the viston offer has been favorably across the petroteq team its board members have shared their unanimous intention to tender their shares through the offer now the company s founder former chairman and ceo alex blyumkin has announced his support for the takeover bid after thorough consideration of all aspects of the viston offer the advice provided by haywood and consulting with its other advisors the board has unanimously determined to recommend that shareholders accept the viston offer and tender their common shares said the board in their official statement the offer itself is valued at a considerable premium over the market price with a 100 all cash consideration of c 0 74 per common share meanwhile through its us shares on the otc under the pqeff symbol shares of petroteq are trading around us 0 375 c 0 474 on march 30 2022 at that price point the c 0 74 still represents a potential 56 premium over the more current trading price at a time when the us government is urging increased oil and gas production to offset some of the deficit created talk is ramping up on how to increase domestic production again according to ben dell co founder and managing partner of the private equity firm kimmeridge energy management it s possible to produce traditional energy sources with reduced carbon emissions kimmeridge is currently the largest shareholder in civitas resources inc nyse civi which produces oil and natural gas in the rocky mountain region of colorado and is billed as colorado s first carbon neutral oil and gas producer my real ambition is to see oil and gas companies like civitas added back to esg funds said dell stating he hopes esg funds would go on to understand that the company is already reducing its emission footprint and has offset its footprint and is delivering a net zero product after closing a large 346 million acquisition of denver julesburg basin operator bison oil gas ii dell who was already serving as chairman of the company officially took over as interim ceo of civitas last year at the berkshire hathaway inc nyse brk a brk b annual shareholder meeting warren buffett shared his own unconventional views on esg investing when it comes to reporting for the sake of it buffett believes excess esg reporting should be avoided as he doesn t believe these reports are always fully read before additional questions come about berkshire hathaway is comfortable with investing in both chevron corporation nyse cvx and occidental petroleum corporation nyse oxy but just because berkshire s methods of acknowledging esg intentions aren t as transparent as other firms might be that doesn t mean its o g interests ignore the market s demand for esg efforts for example occidental petroleum corporation nyse oxy has announced plans for 70 plants to capture carbon from the air by 2035 construction on the first direct air capture plant that s planned is expected to start in h2 2022 with startup scheduled for late 2024 with the cost per plant expected to cost 1 billion corporations and ceos are realizing that for us to mitigate climate change in the world it s absolutely necessary that we take steps now said vicki hollub ceo of occidental this is a sure opportunity and a way that we can definitively store and keep captured co2 either underground or through products for forever and it s a path for others to make their path sustainable too hollub s company is also investing 100 million this year to develop three carbon sequestration hubs by 2025 occidental has said it s on track to secure more than 100 000 net acres this year for these sequestration hubs including for multiple sequestration sites on the gulf coast another berkshire interest chevron corporation nyse cvx earlier this year made its biggest bet so far in company history into alternative fuels through a 3 15 billion acquisition of biodiesel maker renewable energy while biodiesel and renewable diesel use similar feedstocks renewable diesel undergoes a separate refining process to make it chemically identical to ultra low sulfur diesel most people see biodiesel as growing in the u s and southeast asia and view it as a blendstock to get optimum margin because it s less expensive than renewable diesel said mark nelson executive vp of downstream and chemicals for chevron in an interview with reuters much like the petroteq and viston takeover offer chevron s offer for renewable energy came with a premium of more than 40 prior to the company s closing price the friday before the monday announcement took place the investment fits into chevron s long term plans to cut operational emissions to net zero by 2050 and in september pledged to invest 10 billion to reduce its carbon emissions through 2028 with about 3 billion earmarked for renewable fuels more recently chevron agreed to collaborate with restore the earth foundation on a carbon offsets reforestation project in louisiana which includes planting an expected 1 7 million native bald cypress seedlings as part of the project chevron new energies is proud to collaborate with restore the earth on our inaugural carbon offsets project bringing lower carbon solutions to chevron as well as our customers said barbara harrison vice president of offsets emerging of chevron new energies in addition to helping remove carbon the seedling replanting is anticipated to contribute to local forest and wetland ecosystem

the fed s own data on the distribution of wealth in the us is a quarterly report card on the fed s official policy goal of the wealth effect it has now released the data for q4 the fed uses monetary policies such as qe and interest rate repression to create asset price inflation and make a relatively small number of large asset holders vastly wealthier so that they might spend more this has been explained in numerous fed papers including by janet yellen back when she was still president of the san francisco fed the fed s wealth distribution data divides the us population into four groups by wealth the top 1 the 2 to 9 the next 40 and the bottom 50 my wealth effect monitor divides this data by the number of households in each category to obtain the average wealth per household in each category note the immense increase in the wealth for the 1 households after the fed s money printing scheme and interest rate repression started in march 2020 as you can see from the steep curve of the red line the top 1 households were the primary beneficiaries of the fed s policies since march 2020 these policies were designed to inflate asset prices and only asset holders benefited from that the more assets they held the more they benefited so here is the average wealth assets minus debts per household by category in q4 2021 top 1 household red 36 2 million the 2 to 9 household yellow 4 68 million the next 40 household purple 775 000 the bottom 50 household green 59 000 but wait durable goods the fed includes durable goods in this wealth durable goods are motor vehicles boats furniture electronics etc they re consumables unless they re art antiques or classics and their value will ultimately go to zero for the bottom 50 their durable goods account for nearly 20 of their total assets and for nearly 50 for their total wealth assets minus debts the billionaire class got more billions the fed doesn t provide separate data on the truly rich the 0 01 and the billionaire class a distinct royalty like class in american society whose names often have the royal title of billionaire in front they re the biggest beneficiaries of the fed s monetary policies the top 30 us billionaires have a total wealth of 2 12 trillion sliced into 30 slices for a wealth of 70 8 billion per billionaire according to the bloomberg billionaires index compare that to the bottom half of the us population the bottom 50 who have a combined wealth of just 3 7 trillion sliced into 165 million slices for each individual for them the inflated real estate prices just mean higher housing costs reckless usage of percentages can kill someone if i give my favorite homeless guy 5 and he already has 5 in his pocket i increased his wealth by 100 which is a huge percentage jump in wealth but he s still homeless and still doesn t have any wealth percentage increases are regularly touted to show that the wealth at the bottom increased when in fact it increased by only minuscule amounts of dollars because the bottom 50 have so little that even a big percentage increase still amounts to nearly nothing in dollar terms compared to the billionaire class we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us when the wealth of the bottom 50 increases by 5 they gain about 3 000 and when the average wealth of the top 30 billionaires increases by 5 they on average gain 3 500 000 000 and the wealth disparity just blew out greatest economic injustice committed in recent us history since march 2020 the fed printed 4 9 trillion and repressed short term interest rates to near zero in order to inflate asset prices so that the asset holders would get immensely more wealthy in line with its doctrine of the wealth effect this act has produced the greatest economic injustice committed in recent us history my wealth disparity monitor tracks that economic injustice on a quarterly basis by showing the difference in average wealth between the top 1 and the bottom 50 per household based on the fed s own data in 1990 the wealth disparity between the average top 1 household and the average bottom 50 household was 5 million in q4 2021 it ballooned by another 1 2 million from the prior quarter and by 5 1 million year over year to 36 2 million since the fed s crazed money printing binge and interest rate repression started in march 2020 the wealth disparity between the average top 1 household and the average bottom 50 household has exploded by 11 2 million per household more wealth for the wealthy paid for by crushing inflation for the rest the fed s policy of the wealth effect operates by creating asset price inflation through money printing and interest rate repression the bottom 50 of americans who spend all or nearly all their income on housing transportation food healthcare etc hold practically no stocks no bonds and very little real estate according to the wealth distribution data from the federal reserve when the fed purposefully inflates those assets that only some people in society hold it says f u to the rest and this money printing binge has now created the worst inflation in 40 years inflation destroys the purchasing power of the dollar and it destroys the purchasing power of labor denominated in dollars just to get by the bottom 50 spend all or nearly all of their income on consumer items such as housing transportation and food and they got mauled by this rampant consumer price inflation that this money printing has triggered and they re the ones paying for this act of the fed to enrich the asset holders so average wages and salaries went up a lot but by only a fraction of the amount that rents and the prices of houses used and new vehicles gasoline groceries etc shot higher and the worker bees in this economy now have to tighten their belts further even as richest asset holders got vastly wealthier thanks to the fed s policies
what was claimed there are 89 days worth of oil stock in australia the aap factcheck verdict misleading at the time of the claim australia had 64 days of oil in the country a further 25 days of stock were in transit or overseas energy minister angus taylor has attempted to quell public concern about rising fuel prices and global oil shortages by claiming the country has 89 days of oil stocks here in australia the minister s claim is misleading official data shows australia had 64 days of oil imports on australian soil in december 2021 the most recent month for which figures were available a further 25 days of oil were either stored offshore for australian use onboard vessels to the country or being prepared for shipment at the time mr taylor made the claim during a march 9 interview on sky news during which he was questioned about rising petrol prices asked about australia s strategic oil stocks he replied we have 90 days or 89 days of stocks here in australia according to the definition we use and that includes both crude oil and finished product video mark 1min 32sec transcript here when contacted about the basis of the claim a spokeswoman for mr taylor told aap factcheck in an email minister taylor was referring to australia s emergency oil stocks we hold as part of our commitment to the iea in accordance with the agreement of the international energy program minister taylor went on to say according to the definition we use which includes stock on water coming to australia australia is a member country of the international energy agency iea an organisation created in 1974 to co ordinate a collective response to major disruptions to global oil supplies as part of its iea membership australia is a signatory to the international energy program treaty which requires iea members to hold enough oil to sustain domestic consumption for 90 days in a national emergency page 17 the iea publishes oil stock figures for each member country here measured by days of net oil imports that data shows australia held the equivalent of 67 days of oil stock in december 2021 the most recent data available at the time of writing the lowest total of all 27 iea countries listed australia s tally includes three days of stock held abroad the iea says stocks held under bilateral agreements can be counted towards the 90 day minimum requirement in some circumstances in 2020 australia reached an agreement to access part of the united states strategic petroleum reserve to bolster domestic fuel security the only other country that was not compliant with the 90 day requirement was new zealand with 87 days of stock 34 of which were held abroad in comparison japan had 219 days of stock while the uk had 905 days of stock the iea does not list oil stocks for some iea members such as the united states canada mexico and norway because they are net oil exporters the australian government also publishes monthly petroleum statistics here that data likewise confirms australia had 67 days of net oil import coverage in december 2021 see sheet stock iea days incl on the way the australian government data also lists two other types of oil stock oil onboard vessels destined for australia 12 days of stock and oil overseas waiting delivery to australia 10 days of stock the three categories total 89 days of cover from stock held for the australian market in australia and overseas according to the data notes stock that is onboard vessels or held overseas is not able to be included in meeting australia s iea stockholding obligation mr taylor s spokeswoman said the government does not consider the current iea methodology for counting stocks fair or representative of australia s unique geography compared to interconnected european countries tony wood energy and climate change program director at the grattan institute told aap factcheck in an email that since australia s strategic oil reserve is held to meet our international iea obligation it doesn t matter where the product is physically held however it was pretty questionable to define overseas and on water oil stocks as being here in australia mr wood said in 2019 deakin university law school professor samantha hepburn told aap factcheck that on water supplies should not be counted towards australia s iea oil stocks because we don t have full control of our fuel stocks on international waters until it is on our soil if you don t have 90 days of reserves excluding on water stocks australia would be unable to contribute to the global response in the event of a fuel shortage and this would undermine global security she said at the time australia has not complied with the iea s 90 day reserve requirement since 2012 according to a 2020 parliamentary research paper the government says it is committed to returning to compliance with the stockholding obligation by 2026 the aap factcheck verdict the most recent data at the time of mr taylor s claim showed australia

while other bread wheat markets are seeing a lot of volatility with price spikes both up and down durum is behaving in a totally different manner with durum the market continues to defy the trends in the other markets and actually drifts lower we ve seen as much as 1 or more appreciation in the bread wheat market over that same time frame said jim peterson marketing director with the north dakota wheat commission in late march obviously it shows that the durum market is a bit more isolated from some of the others and probably just continued sell off from elevated prices that it reached earlier this fall and winter the question is whether that trend will continue a lot of that will hinge on the march 31 planting intentions report the perception of a lot in the industry right now is even though supplies have been short this past year there will be a significant increase in durum plantings this year which will help offset that he said looking at current prices many bids have backed off to the 12 50 per bushel range at the local level the national durum index in early march was up to 13 15 per bushel and now prices are down to about 12 70 reflecting those similar trends back in early january peterson noted that prices were close to 15 50 so that s showing almost a 3 per bushel sell off in that time one of the big challenges according to peterson is that u s domestic demand has been throttled back quite significantly due to supply chain issues not necessarily all covid related but just trying to get packaging material ingredients and trucking and other factors that are taken for granted most years in the last year or so those issues have snuck up on the industry and throttled back production and as a result some demand was lost also with the price premium of durum to spring wheat there was some product substitution in some areas going forward if we have reached a more stable environment at these price levels hopefully we can get a rebound in domestic demand he said similar to u s producer prices chicago values which is what a lot of the semolina is priced off of are back to about 16 50 per bushel in early december those were at 18 75 so not quite a 3 drop what we re hearing from domestic pasta manufacturers is they re probably 30 35 percent covered in the third quarter and very little in the fourth quarter he said we ll see what happens after the march 31 report whether we get any more anxiousness or if we see something from the industry covering needs for next year looking at other global issues for durum in canada local nearby prices equate to 13 20 per bushel which is a little stronger than u s values on their new crop it equates to about 11 u s canada s big challenge has been on the export end their export shipments to date are down about 55 percent from a year ago in february they listed just over 7 million bushels which is just 40 percent of what they did the previous year their planting report won t come out until the end of april but early thoughts are for a 5 10 percent increase in durum plantings similar to the u s they are running into some rail logistical issues and that s probably going to affect producers on both sides for the short term he said looking at the european union eu both the u s and canada continue to struggle to compete in that market because our prices are at a 2 50 3 premium to some of the french prices which is making it very difficult to capture some sales coceral a belgium based eu trade association recently came out with its updated 2022 projections the agency is projecting a slight increase in durum acres in the eu going up to 6 million acres from 5 8 million last year that s less of an increase than many had been anticipating but they are looking at similar to slightly lower production than a year ago currently coceral has lower yield outlooks for both italy and france where they have had some pockets of dryness we ll see if that continues as they come out with their monthly estimates going forward but it s nothing overwhelming from the eu in terms of next year s crop production rebound he said also the international grains council igc came out with its updated march report which had no significant adjustments the igc raised exports from both turkey and mexico while consequently lowering eu and u s exports we ve seen that trend for the past couple months where at these price levels mexico turkey and australia have been able to find more stocks to export on the world market which has probably helped temper prices a little he said also of note algeria tunisia and morocco have been extremely dry through much of the winter but some recent rains may have tempered some of the concerns rains are probably too late for any significant benefit to the moroccan crop but indications are that it likely benefited algerian and tunisian crop prospects while it probably just stabilized the moroccan crop lastly domestic demand in the u s has been slow as durum prices have been moving in contrast to the direction of spring wheat prices the march 31 planting intentions report will help provide some direction for the market industry analysts have projected an average of 1 73 million durum acres in the u s which would be up from 1 64 million in 2021 that s only an increase of around 90 000 acres or just 5 percent over last year earlier a lot of the industry was anticipating an increase of 10 15 percent usda recently came out with a drought outlook discussion about 75 percent of the u s durum region primarily in the north is in notable drought conditions that will be an increasing concern if we don t get additional moisture soon and through the growing season peterson said the u s desert durum crop which is a small part of the total u s durum crop will be more important than usual because of the short supplies on hand in its weekly crop ratings arizona noted that 67 percent of the crop there is rated in good to excellent condition that compares to 28 percent last year and 44 percent of the crop is headed vs 33 percent last year it s all under irrigation the only risk is that it can catch some april freezes which could be an issue but at this time it s in better condition than a year ago he said adding that harvest takes place in june

investors on edge over the region s economic outlook the analysts told cnbc geopolitical tensions around the world have been on the rise but southeast asia s markets may offer relative safety to investors according to top investment banks as we enter the next quarter of 2022 cnbc asked analysts from goldman sachs and jpmorgan asset management which southeast asian markets were their top picks southeast asian stocks have underperformed and been largely ignored by global investors for a decade said timothy moe goldman s chief asia pacific equity strategist get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters indonesia is a top southeast asian pick for both wall street banks indonesia banking and commodity plays in indonesia we are structurally positive on the banks as the majority of the population are still unbanked or underbanked we are currently positioned in the leading private sector and also state owned banks as they have been proactively driving digital adoption to accelerate financial penetration said desmond loh a portfolio manager at jpmorgan asset management strong commodity prices have also been beneficial for export earnings in indonesia as well as the country s trade balance and that s set to support the indonesian rupiah as well as the nearer term growth outlook in indonesia he said global commodity prices have been on a rollercoaster ride since the war in ukraine broke out after russia s invasion in late february russia is a major oil producer while ukraine is a major exporter of other commodities such as wheat and corn as of monday morning in asia international benchmark brent crude futures have risen more than 30 so far this year vietnam and singapore jpmorgan asset management also likes vietnam which loh termed a star performer in the past few years in economic resiliency and growth vietnam is one of the few economies globally to have seen positive economic growth throughout the pandemic he added to capitalize on the growth we are positioned in high quality consumer proxies and banks he said without naming specific stocks meanwhile singapore is the other southeast asian that goldman sachs likes there are three main reasons why the investment bank likes indonesia as well as singapore said moe improving economic and growth momentum from a region recovering belatedly from covid related setbacks a banking sector that is heavily weighted in stock indexes and set to benefit from a switch to tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates the gradual emergence of digital economy firms which are being included in indonesia and singapore indexes indonesia s jakarta composite has risen more than 7 this year while vietnam s vn index is up

down 4 6 so far this year while the pan european stoxx 600 has dropped about 6 investors have in recent weeks been grappling with a range of concerns from the commodity price spike triggered by russia s invasion of ukraine to a rising interest rate environment as major central banks like the u s federal reserve seek to fight inflation shelter from geopolitical tensions southeast asia is relatively insulated from rising geopolitical tensions in europe as russia and ukraine account for less than 1 of regional exports according to loh escalation in geopolitical risks renders near term tailwind for commodity prices to underpin the strength of asean s commodity exporter markets he said referring to the 10 member states of the association of southeast asian nations no exodus of outflows expected global investors have been repositioning in the last few weeks in anticipation of more aggressive moves ahead by the federal reserve s monetary tightening but the analysts expect the impact on southeast asia to be relatively smaller compared to before in march the federal reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 and fed chair jerome powell subsequently pledged to take tough action on inflation that is much too high the prospect of more rate hikes ahead by the fed has raised concerns of capital outflows and currency depreciation in southeast asia s emerging markets a phenomenon seen in 2013 during the taper tantrum that saw bond yields spike after the fed hinted asset purchases could wind down we don t expect an exodus of outflows as we saw in the last taper tantrum loh said explaining that country level balance sheets in southeast asia are generally much healthier now compared to a decade ago most of southeast asia s central banks with the exception of singapore have yet to tighten monetary policy that s in part due to an inflation situation regionally that is relatively less severe compared with developed economies in the west southeast asian economies today are also more resilient compared to past cycles according to moe who cited external balances that are in better shape as well as currencies that are attractively valued

make regime change great again by mark alexander web posted april 4 2022 recall ahead of the 2020 election sleepy joe biden took a jab at donald trump s verbal imprecision declaring emphatically the words of a president matter no matter if they are good bad or indifferent they matter no matter how competent or incompetent the president is they can send a nation to war or they can bring peace well in fact the words of an incompetent president do matter and they can send a nation to war thus was the case with biden s latest verbal imprecision while confabbing with nato allies in europe where he insisted vladimir putin cannot remain in power as i concluded last week it was the most compelling moment of his remarks but it fell far outside the administration s appeasement policy so there was a scramble to walk it back secretary of state antony blinken quickly clarified as you know and as you ve heard us say repeatedly we do not have a strategy of regime change in russia or anywhere else followed by more walk backs by the biden bunch that prompted the washington post s henry olsen to demand the left stop making excuses for biden s disturbing pattern of miscues that unnecessarily raise the risk of a direct confrontation with russia likewise our key nato allies the uk france and germany repudiated biden for the inference of regime change however i understood what biden was trying to say â putin is a tyrant doing tyrannical things and needs to go i think most folks understood that fact is every day of his presidency we have all had to interpret the meaning of biden s incontinens lingua incontinent language the result of his increasingly evident non compos mentis slide into dementia while that slide is sad for anyone so afflicted when manifested in the actions of a sitting president it is also incredibly dangerous how dangerous well in the last proxy war with russia the protracted contest to defeat russian backed communists in vietnam 58 220 americans died ironically ukraine could be for putin what vietnam was for the u s â a deadly conflict that lost the public and political will to win but in the current confrontation tempting nato action against russia in ukraine we are perilously near the horizon of a far more deadly and direct kinetic conflict with another nuclear superpower â something we should prefer to avoid that notwithstanding adding fuel to the regime change fire back on american soil biden was asked about his administration s effort to walk back his remarks and he walked back the walk back angrily insisting what s getting walked back i m not walking anything back apparently biden forgot to use the walk back talking points card that he had in hand as he was walking back the walk back so the key question why does biden s regime change insinuation matter first predictably it was a gift to putin who used it as a propaganda talking point to further his fomenting of nationalist fervor in response to the economic sanctions levied because of his unprovoked invasion of ukraine as political analyst gary bauer observed putin took the statement and broadcast it non stop on russian state controlled media putin knows that whatever russians think of him they are a proud people who do not want the u s to pick their leaders second the remark drives a stake into the heart of economic sanctions notwithstanding biden s flip flop insistence that sanctions are not a deterrent â let s get something straight i did not say that in fact the sanctions would deter him after he and everyone around him said sanctions would deter putin â the regime change remark undermines the probability that putin will be moved by the significant economic sanctions now besetting his country it is important to understand that if putin believes the u s nato objective of sanctions is to remove him from office â and in fact regime change may be precisely the objective â then he has nothing to lose in moving forward with what he views as his ultimate legacy or perhaps his destiny â the reunification of ukraine and some smaller former soviet republics fsrs with russia despite sanctions thus biden s remark has enormous consequences but an overarching question is what effect do the current sanctions have on the russian people and by extension putin do sanctions influence a narcissistic autocrat here is the backdrop for the rise of vladimir putin and with him the prospect of another cold war after the collapse of communism in 1991 the fall of the evil empire as ronald reagan referenced the ussr there was hope that russia and the former republics would emerge from the soviet reign of terror as democratized states some of the soviet satellite states moved faster toward democratization than did the fsrs which had existed under communist oppression for seven decades â more than three generations in 1991 i was part of one of the first u s delegations to russia and the former republics members of our delegation were tasked with the objective of seeding the democratization of the judicial and law enforcement systems of the post soviet states the notion of what we take for granted the rule of law that forms the foundation of american liberty had no corresponding point of reference in russia where the dictatorial state and its communist party apparatchiks held all power at that time the russian people whom i found remarkably hopeful were challenged with adopting the principles of individual liberty that did not exist in any form but in less than a decade those hopes faded to darkness as putin a former kgb thug who began perfecting his politically corrupt ambitions the day the ussr disintegrated became an administrator for the corrupt regime of the drunkard president boris yeltsin in 1996 â including taking over the kgb successor bureaucracy the fsb in 1999 putin became acting president when yeltsin resigned and he was elected president in the notoriously corrupt election of 2000 he has held the interchangeable positions of president and prime minister since that time and in 2021 the 68 year old putin enacted a law that would allow him to be reelected for two more terms extending his dictatorship until 2036 under putin the self appointed potentate of a pariah state the evil empire rose from the ashes in russia as it has in several other former republics today putin s political power is akin to a kinder gentler version of joseph stalin s authoritarian rule and over the last two decades he has not only centralized his statist power codifying his dictatorship but he has also amassed enormous kleptocratic wealth stolen from the russian people despite biden s bluster about sanctions on russia s corrupt oligarchs who are all beholden to putin and will do nothing to challenge him the wealthiest among them is putin himself he has embezzled what is estimated to be somewhere between 10 and 200 billion from the russian treasury and state holdings but he and his wealth are well protected however sanctions hurt and will continue to have an enormous impact on the russian people russia is largely dependent on energy exports for revenues more than 40 of russia s federal budget is funded by oil and gas sales which account for almost 60 of its exports thus the sale and price of oil has a significant impact on russia s economy notably the rapid increase in that price as a result of sanctions has actually helped fund putin s invasion in a good summation of sanctions national review s jim geraghty notes that the financial sanctions have the biggest impact on the russian government the uk s treasury committee reports one of the boldest moves in the financial sanctions package has been the sanctions levelled at the russian central bank which appear to have denied access by russia to half of its reserves there are optimistic reports such as we could be witnessing the death throes of a superpower and that russia may be on the verge of collapse some economists suggest that the impact of sanctions on russia s economy could set the nation back three decades but the global impact of sanctions raises questions about how long the unified support for such measures will last sanctions are having a significant detrimental impact on global financial markets particularly the security depositories of eu banks in the u s oil boycotts are pushing the price at gas pumps even higher than biden s war on oil but again the key question is do sanctions dampen putin s pursuit to annex ukraine putin himself told his senior political leaders russian financial companies major enterprises small and medium sized businesses are facing unprecedented pressure clearly we will have to make deep structural changes in our economy and i will not pretend that they will be easy or that they will not lead to a temporary increase in inflation and unemployment why would putin make such admissions as i have noted since the first sanctions were implemented putin anticipated these setbacks and he will use them to evoke nationalist fervor as did adolf hitler ahead of world war ii there are a lot of parallels to be drawn between these two narcissistic dictators to that end putin publicly blames the hardships that accompany these sanctions on the illegal seizure of russian assets by western capitalists what he calls the collective west he declared they have no use â simply no use â for a strong and sovereign russia and they will not forgive us for our independent policy or for standing up for our national interests evoking nationalist fervor as did adolf hitler as for his detractors in a national address putin said any nation and even more so the russian people will always be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and will simply spit them out of their mouths like an insect spit them onto the pavement i am convinced that a natural and necessary self detoxification of society like this would strengthen our country putin has also held massive rallies to bolster nationalism evoking nationalist fervor as did adolf hitler thus coming full circle biden s suggestion of regime change has emboldened putin some analysts are predicting that in ukraine russia may be heading for an outright defeat insisting there are no vast reserves of forces putin can call up to add to the battle presently that is overly optimistic despite all the favorable media reports about breaks in russian military supply lines if true to what extreme will putin go when backed into a corner can you say tactical nukes he may well be determined to demolish what he can t possess clearly as i noted last week the tidiest way to end putin s dictatorship is for a member of his security or military detail to take him out the more sanction related civil unrest that emerges in russia s major cities the more likely a proud and heroic individual may impose regime change and that individual would qualify for a hero of russia medal meanwhile biden is using the ukraine conflict as a smokescreen to seal the disastrous iran nuke deal â as if we can now trust iran he is using it to promote his bloated budget lying about how it will improve our military readiness when in fact it further erodes our warfighting capability he is using it as cover for his record setting bidenflation crush on american families oh and then there is that whole red china threat lurking on the western front let me make this clear again the most dangerous threat to u s national security and domestic prosperity has been and remains joe biden that is becoming clearer by the day to the majority of americans who have no confidence in biden s handling of putin his overall approval remained anchored far underwater reaching new lows last week mark alexander is the executive editor of the patriot post

southeast asian stocks have underperformed and been largely ignored by global investors for a decade said timothy moe goldman s chief asia pacific equity strategist get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters indonesia is a top southeast asian pick for both wall street banks indonesia banking and commodity plays in indonesia we are structurally positive on the banks as the majority of the population are still unbanked or underbanked we are currently positioned in the leading private sector and also state owned banks as they have been proactively driving digital adoption to accelerate financial penetration said desmond loh a portfolio manager at jpmorgan asset management strong commodity prices have also been beneficial for export earnings in indonesia as well as the country s trade balance and that s set to support the indonesian rupiah as well as the nearer term growth outlook in indonesia he said global commodity prices have been on a rollercoaster ride since the war in ukraine broke out after russia s invasion in late february russia is a major oil producer while ukraine is a major exporter of other commodities such as wheat and corn as of monday morning in asia international benchmark brent crude futures have risen more than 30 so far this year vietnam and singapore jpmorgan asset management also likes vietnam which loh termed a star performer in the past few years in economic resiliency and growth vietnam is one of the few economies globally to have seen positive economic growth throughout the pandemic he added to capitalize on the growth we are positioned in high quality consumer proxies and banks he said without naming specific stocks meanwhile singapore is the other southeast asian that goldman sachs likes there are three main reasons why the investment bank likes indonesia as well as singapore said moe improving economic and growth momentum from a region recovering belatedly from covid related setbacks a banking sector that is heavily weighted in stock indexes and set to benefit from a switch to tighter monetary policy and rising interest rates the gradual emergence of digital economy firms which are being included in indonesia and singapore indexes indonesia s jakarta composite has risen more than 7 this year while vietnam s vn index is up about 1 in the same period singapore s straits times index has gained more than 9 in comparison msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan has dropped 6 on wall street the s p 500 is down 4 6 so far this year while the pan european stoxx 600 has dropped about 6 investors have in recent weeks been grappling with a range of concerns from the commodity price spike triggered by russia s invasion of ukraine to a rising interest rate environment as major central banks like the u s federal reserve seek to fight inflation shelter from geopolitical tensions southeast asia is relatively insulated from rising geopolitical tensions in europe as russia and ukraine account for less than 1 of regional exports according to loh escalation in geopolitical risks renders near term tailwind for commodity prices to underpin the strength of asean s commodity exporter markets he said referring to the 10 member states of the association of southeast asian nations no exodus of outflows expected global investors have been repositioning in the last few weeks in anticipation of more aggressive moves ahead by the federal reserve s monetary tightening but the analysts expect the impact on southeast asia to be relatively smaller compared to before in march the federal reserve raised interest rates for the first time since 2018 and fed chair jerome powell subsequently pledged to take tough action on inflation that is much too high the prospect of more rate hikes ahead by the fed has raised concerns of capital outflows and currency depreciation in southeast asia s emerging markets a phenomenon seen in 2013 during the taper tantrum that saw bond yields spike after the fed hinted asset purchases could wind down we don t expect an exodus of outflows as we saw in the last taper tantrum loh said explaining that country level balance sheets in southeast asia are generally much healthier now compared to a decade ago most of southeast asia s central banks with the exception of singapore have yet to tighten monetary policy that s in part due to an inflation situation regionally that is relatively less severe compared with developed economies in the west southeast asian economies today are also more resilient compared to past cycles according to moe who cited external balances that are in better shape as well as currencies that are attractively valued
candy bomber lessons for ukraine â and daily life by paul driessen web posted april 4 2022 the covid pandemic severely disrupted schools commerce and public and private services of every description russia s invasion of ukraine and the west s focus on the manmade climate crisis continue to drive energy and food prices ever higher western energy healthcare and national security policies are increasingly exposed as weak confused and feckless in europe they are hugely exacerbated by the needs of millions of ukrainian refugees trying to escape vladimir putin s brutality by fleeing to europe the uk america turkey and israel practical solutions are essential but we don t have to address or solve this or any entire crisis with one approach successful interventions can come in small inexpensive incremental packages rather than massive government programs prohibitively expensive prescription only drugs or total transformations of our energy and economy u s air force colonel gail seymour halvorsen understood that if he saw these women and children fleeing russian aggression he d probably airdrop chocolates and chewing gum really because that s what he did in 1948 when joe stalin blockaded west berlin deep inside east germany to freeze and starve its people and intimidate the allies into submission this history is real and inspirational for me i was born in 1948 my father served three years in wwii s pacific theater and many years afterward in the army reserves as a command sergeant major i spent time in east and west berlin in 1969 where i saw the stark contrasts between the two sectors in recovery levels prosperity and freedoms west berlin was already quite dynamic and prosperous it had rebuilt preserving kaiser wilhelm gedaechtnis kirche as a memorial to wartime horrors and turning 98 000 000 cubic yards of rubble into the 260 foot tall teufelsberg devil s mountain and ski slope east berlin was personified by spies and repression soviet style apartments and restored historic buildings that were just facades with acres of rubble behind them east berliners were doomed to 44 years of russian domination following the devastation rapes and butchery inflicted by soviet troops in reprisal for nazi devastation rapes and butchery in russia west berliners didn t love american british french rule but they wanted nothing of russian rule the allies responded to stalin s threats with the 1948 49 berlin airlift with planes landing every 90 seconds at its peak the airlift delivered nearly 2 5 million tons of food medicines coal and other supplies averted a humanitarian disaster and kept west berlin alive and free col halvorsen flew some of those c 47 and c 54 cargo planes he became known as the berlin candy bomber and chocolate pilot because he went beyond the call of duty to launch operation little vittles he began dropping candy bars and chewing gum attached to miniature parachutes to lift the spirits of berlin s children during the airlift with his commander s support â and thanks to the generosity of american families and companies that donated gum chocolate and handkerchiefs â little berliners shared 23 tons of candy dropped on 250 000 tiny homemade parachutes halverson had ingenuity empathy and common sense in abundance he didn t have modern research to support his little vittles concept he just knew instinctively that the candy drops would help incredibly or perhaps not recent scientific studies have found that chewing gum actually can help reduce stress and keep anxiety and panic at bay for kids and adults alike some therapists even recommend that schools and parents keep little coping tool boxes handy and stock them with gum and chocolate for anxious kids â preferably sugar free of course chocolate and chewing gum are certainly not the answer to every stressful situation but they may help in many they might even calm nerves a little and bring a few smiles among kids and parents enduring putin s fury fleeing from it coping with refugee life in strange lands or praying he won t obliterate their maternity ward school home or bomb shelter an even more amazing study has come out of the texas children s hospital and baylor college of medicine the researchers colleagues must have thought them daft when they proposed to assess the effectiveness of xylitol sweetened chewing gum in preventing preterm birth among pregnant poor rural east african women who faced high risks of premature birth but they pressed ahead believing that simple accessible affordable even tasty healthcare possibilities should at least be investigated and not rejected out of hand moreover there s a clear well known connection between the oral health benefits of sugar free gum sfg the impact of good oral health on human biological systems and the correlation between periodontitis and premature birth lo and behold they discovered that the gum actually cut preterm births nearly by a quarter far fewer babies were born too early or too small there is some real science behind the choice of xylitol chewing gum to improve oral health said lead author dr kjersti aagaard and our novel application to improving birth outcomes is exciting it certainly is especially in a world where governments charitable foundations and companies routinely spend billions or even trillions of dollars pounds and euros on fancy complicated programs that often invite waste and corruption for other benefits of chewing sfg check this out and this and this as economist and author of the white man s burden william easterly famously observed during five decades the west spent 2 3 trillion in foreign aid to poor countries â but proved unable to distribute 4 mosquito nets to help prevent malaria in africa as i have often noted the west was equally unable to get behind spraying inexpensive ddt on the walls and doorways of cinderblock and mud and thatch homes to keep deadly malaria infected mosquitoes out for six months or more with a single spray at 41 per pregnancy dr aagaard s chewing gum is one of those humble but ingenious and fantastically effective interventions that ought to be contemplated and implemented early and often it s clearly a product of the chocolate pilot school of problem solving but does it have to be sugar free gum and candy sugar free wasn t even available in 1948 and to suppose berlin or ukrainian moms should worry about tooth cavities under their dire circumstances is as preposterous as saying john kerry would worry that putin s butchery might distract the world from the existential threat of fossil fuel driven climate change still sugar free is definitely preferable col halvorsen was right to think that simple solutions may offer real answers especially in a crisis when lives are at stake as we ponder the war our stretched resources and europe s humanitarian crisis we should keep that in mind not every remedy has to be national or global in scope not every program has to be expensive or complicated to be effective common sense and can do ingenuity can go a long way â and both are resources we have in greater abundance than do our totalitarian adversaries following his berlin exploits the candy bomber spent 25 years advocating for children in conflict zones and performing candy drops in bosnia herzegovina albania iraq and elsewhere after logging over 8 000 flying hours he retired and went on to help develop reusable manned spacecraft become a college dean and serve as a mormon missionary in london and st petersburg

new delhi india a year after the government led by narendra modi s bjp came to power in 2014 the top finance ministry official accused the reserve bank of india of setting interest rates to benefit developed countries and sought a probe into its conduct a trove of official documents obtained by the reporters collective reveals finance secretary rajiv mehrishi working under then finance minister the late arun jaitley made the claim after the rbi opted to prioritise controlling rising prices over lowering interest rates which would have made borrowing cheaper for businesses and citizens although the government and the rbi having different views is not unusual the revelations mark the first time a top government official has accused the rbi of working to benefit the white man in developed countries and sought an investigation into the real purpose behind the central bank s decisions the documents which were accessed by the reporters collective trc under the right to information act are being made public for the first time as part of a three part investigative series at the time in 2015 the rbi governor was raghuram rajan an appointee of the previous congress led government the bjp government chose urjit patel as rajan s successor but the rbi didn t cut the interest as sharply as the government wanted even under patel so the finance ministry called a meeting with the bank s newly set up monetary policy committee mpc to push it to cut interest rates according to the documents the unprecedented meeting fell through when committee members declined to attend a development widely reported in 2017 the attempt to influence the central bank came despite the modi government having amended the reserve bank of india act in 2016 to strengthen the firewall between the rbi s primary function of controlling prices and the government s political impulse to spur growth even at the cost of rising inflation the rbi s then governor patel pushed back wrote to the government saying it should stop trying to influence the rbi in order to preserve the integrity and credibility of the new monetary framework in the public eye and our parliament otherwise the government would be in violation of the letter and spirit of the law that protected the rbi s independence as disagreements piled up on this and other issues patel resigned on december 10 2018 citing personal reasons the government replaced him with shaktikanta das who as a top finance ministry bureaucrat had justified increasing the government s influence in the rbi s rate setting function official documents reveal different roles one of the rbi s key roles is to control the amount of money and credit available in the economy through the interest rate at which it lends to banks this is the central bank s monetary policy function lower interest rates spur economic growth in the short term but can also lead to an increase in the prices of goods and services or inflation untamed inflation erodes the value of money in the hands of citizens particularly the poor acting like a hidden tax that hits poorer and lower income citizens more than the rich monetary policy is typically kept independent of government control because politicians face the temptation to create more money and spend beyond their means on populist schemes and vanity projects in the long run excess spending by the government harms the economy differing analyses of where inflation may be headed and how interest rates should be set often create tension between central banks and governments in many parts of the world including india but in new delhi the debate took an ugly turn when the modi government came to power in may 2014 as india was witnessing one of the highest levels of inflation in the world newly appointed finance minister arun jaitley announced that the government would establish a monetary policy regime that would focus on keeping inflation in check with transparency and accountability this would be a departure from the existing system where the rbi governor alone set interest rates without an inflation target at hand in february 2015 as a first step towards establishing an mpc mehrishi and then rbi governor rajan signed an agreement outlining an inflation target for the first time the central bank committed to bringing inflation down to 6 percent by january 2016 and 4 percent in subsequent years with a goal of maintaining it within a range of 2 to 6 percent if the rbi failed to meet the target it would be required to send an explanation letter to the government subsidised the rich abroad in 2014 rajan kept the repo rate the rate at which the rbi lends to banks unchanged at 8 percent due to inflationary concerns as inflationary pressures eased in 2015 he started cutting the rate bringing it down to 7 25 percent by june but in the august 2015 meeting he maintained the status quo the modi government was not satisfied with the cuts with jaitley and chief economic adviser arvind subramanian often publicly criticising the rbi and complaining that borrowing costs were still too high their public venting however was only a hint of the pressure being applied behind the scenes documents show on august 6 2015 two days after the rbi announced its latest rate decision finance secretary mehrishi wrote an internal note asking for the interest rate to be cut sharply to 5 75 percent i agree with neither the analysis nor the conclusion to keep interest rates higher by as much as 150 basis points if not more mehrishi said in his note an incalculable damage has been done to the indian economy and indian growth prospects by stunting credit and therefore investment he added mehrishi then accused the rbi of helping wealthy foreign businesses at the cost of indian businesses and citizens claiming the only beneficiaries of india s high interest rates were developed countries we have subsidised the rich and influential in the usa europe and japan in developed countries interest rates are typically lower than in india encouraging some investors to temporarily park their funds in the indian financial system to mint profits from the higher interest under the cover of being inflation hawks the real reason for keeping interest rates high in india at the cost of credit flow investment and growth needs to be more deeply thought about analysed and investigated mehrishi said in his concluding remarks finance minister jaitley acknowledged mehrishi s note on the file and desired a discussion the mpc finally came into place in september 2016 days after rajan moved back to the university of chicago s booth school of business to teach finance he was replaced by deputy governor urjit patel who was also involved in the making of the new monetary framework a month later when patel chaired the first mpc it cut the interest rate by 0 25 percentage points in its november board meeting the central bank led by patel approved modi s decision to invalidate overnight most of the existing currency the so called demonetisation in which 500 and 1 000 indian rupee notes ceased to exist as legal tender some economists accused patel of letting modi railroad the rbi into approving one of the biggest domestic economic disasters and denting the central bank s autonomy rajan would later claim that the government had consulted the rbi during his tenure on demonetisation but never asked it for the nod almost as if responding to the criticism of diluting its autonomy the mpc adopted a tough stance in its next meeting in february 2017 when it changed the monetary policy stance from accommodative to neutral that change in stance which surprised analysts was a signal to the financial markets that the mpc would no longer be open to rate cuts the central bank kept the rates unchanged in the subsequent meeting of the mpc in april 2017 while the government scrambled to resuscitate an economy hit by demonetisation rising tensions with patel resisting government pressure the finance ministry attempted to influence the rbi s independent monetary policy committee which sets the interest rates on april 10 2017 jaitley held a meeting with his economic affairs secretary shaktikanta das during which they decided that then chief economic adviser arvind subramanian and then principal economic advisor sanjeev sanyal would hold a meeting with the three government nominated members of mpc followed by a discussion with rbi prior to the mpc meetings documents show in a note on april 12 das wrote the idea is to convey mof s analysis to the mpc members and rbi the final decision will be theirs the mpc comprises three members from within the rbi including the governor and three external experts appointed by the government mpc decisions which are supposed to be made independent of government influence are based on a majority vote in a tie the governor has a casting vote under the modi government s law establishing the mpc the government is only allowed to present its views to the committee in writing government officials cannot meet with the committee or influence it by any other means ignoring the law on may 17 2017 the finance ministry sent a letter to each of the mpc members stating that with the approval of the finance minister it has been decided to evolve an institutionalised framework under which the government may from time to time engage with the members of mpc to provide the government perspective on macroeconomic situation including economic growth and inflation the mpc s external members were summoned for a meeting chaired by subramanian on june 1 2017 days before the committee was scheduled to meet a separate letter was written to urjit patel telling him about the finance ministry s decision to hold a discussion with the rbi officials on the mpc at its headquarters in mumbai three days later the finance ministry reversed course and said in a file note that the discussions would only be informal because of the sensitivities involved a revised letter may be sent to the mpc without mentioning that we would like to institute a mechanism for informal discussion with them the note said a new letter was issued to all the mpc members which specified that the meeting to be chaired by the government s chief economic adviser is only to discuss the overall macroeconomic situation in the country and developments in the global economy any direct reference to interest rates the real purpose of the meeting had now been left out the letter on may 22 2017 patel wrote back to jaitley opposing the meeting he said the rbi was surprised and dismayed by this development on two counts according to the documents reviewed by the reporters collective firstly we have not discussed the matter with each other although we have interacted several times in recent weeks on work matters and second it is addressed to and seeks to set up meetings with mpc members and separately so with non rbi and rbi members patel said he stressed that the move violates the letter and spirit of the amended rbi act to set up an independent committee for monetary policy and tarnishes the constructive engagement since 2014 between rbi and the ministry of finance on issues relating to monetary policy in fact communication with or from the government should be scrupulously avoided if the integrity and credibility of the monetary policy decision has to be preserved in the public eye and our parliament patel wrote adding that investors will likely take a dim view of any direct intervention in monetary policy frankly this is avoidable as we seek in the national interest to nurture institutions befitting a modern economy the ex rbi governor said patel reminded jaitley of the clause that the federal government can convey its views only in writing to the mpc from time to time and said that any other structure for communication will violate the law this clause where the operating words are writing to the mpc was you may recollect precisely formulated so that in a departure from the past informal and non transparent direction by government officials on monetary policy is disallowed his letter said al jazeera sent a list of questions to the ministry of finance the rbi rajiv mehrishi raghuram rajan and urjit patel none of them responded das s parting words in the finance ministry s final internal note on the matter das the then economic affairs secretary wrote that an interaction between the finance ministry and members of mpc cannot be interpreted as coming in the way of the rbi act ultimately accountability about the functioning of the economy lies at the doorsteps of the government particularly the finance ministry das said in a note dated may 29 2017 while giving the approval to send the finance ministry s analysis of the economy to the mpc members in writing das toeing the government line would become rbi governor one and a half years after his departure in may 2017 from the finance ministry he was appointed barely 24 hours after patel abruptly resigned in december 2018 part 2 of the investigative series will be out tomorrow somesh

eu referendum your sector one year on click on the links below to hear from our board chairmen crops nfu crops board chairman mike hambly markets volatility and cashflow we all know that global commodity prices in almost every sector are very low and have only improved with the huge drop in the value of our currency internationally grain prices are low as our markets are under massive pressure the projection for total world wheat ending stocks in 2017 18 is an estimated 10 million tonnes higher than last year at over 35 of consumption after rising for years global soybean production is likely to again fall slightly this year and stocks to just under 13 of consumption creating both opportunity and risk in oilseed markets for our membership net margins on arable crop production closer to home rural business research shows arable farming having had its fourth consecutive season of negative net margins across all combinable crops off farm income is being used to keep businesses afloat and would not be possible without cross subsidy from both the basic payment and from farm diversification this adds up to farmers having subsidised each tonne of grain by an average of 29 input suppliers have held prices at very high levels particularly crop protection products and fertiliser i know there are currency headwinds but price ambitions need to be curbed and these costs need to fall much further in response to the financial pressures farmers remain under farmer confidence the results of our recent nfu confidence survey by our economics team tell us something of how farmers are responding to external financial pressures with the pound having fallen sharply and better prices for agricultural commodities over much of the past 12 months confidence has improved in the past year this has also made uk produced commodities relatively attractive against imports and at the same time encouraged exports in the medium term 3 years facing uncertainty with brexit and sustained good harvests globally uk farmer confidence is much less strong and although it had been improving very slightly broadly as low as any point in the past seven years this is having an impact on willingness to invest with 20 of farmers planning to cut spending for 2017 18 and only 11 planning to increase investment in the period the threatened loss of plant protection products on crop protection we find ourselves once more at a point in time with glyphosate teetering on the edge of being lost and a threat to further bans on neonicotinoids with no evidence that this is helping bees and a political fudge on defining endocrine disruptors naturally the nfu is working hard to influence the debate through traditional channels and we need our new government to support us furthermore we are increasingly working with our members to complement this in a number of ways we know the common sense of farmers can help restore the balance of evidence to help overcome the fear mongering of anti agriculture campaigners this can be both through writing to mps and meps or by being present in new media we must tell our story in a place where the public more and more develop their opinions increasingly through social media despite the current challenges to our industry it s worth highlighting that as we work hard as an industry to weather the year ahead one thing is for sure we ll increasingly need access to developments like improved integrated crop management techniques novel breeding techniques world class plant protection products and other new technologies as they come on board we have much to be proud of as an industry and we have a huge amount of support from the british public i believe that we are at a pivotal point in time so looking forward farming is not without its challenges and farmers have been increasingly ready to help prepare themselves and their businesses to compete to grow and enjoy success in producing the food energy fibre and feed for this country s future back to top dairy nfu dairy board chairman michael oakes one year on from the momentous day that a majority of the british public voted to leave europe and where are we in the dairy sector put simply it s a mixed bag and a balance between short term positives and long term uncertainty in the short term the decreasing value of sterling has helped reduce the level of dairy imports into the uk and increase our exports so some have seen a positive impact on their milk price but not all dairy companies are exporters a third of english and welsh dairy farmers supply the eu co operative arla which pays an eu milk price the gap between the eu and uk arla milk price is something that regularly comes up in conversation couple that with the fact that most milk buyers in the uk base their milk price around that paid by arla and you ll see that it s not as clear cut as we would expect hence our call for mandatory price and volume reporting on labour we were struggling to source sufficient on farm dairy labour prior to 24 june 2016 and the situation has been exasperated but we re also concerned by the sourcing of labour in many of the allied industries which we work with from veterinarians to tanker drivers or staff in dairy processing plants dairy farming requires a special type of person one that has an affinity with animals and people and one that is willing to work extremely unsocial hours in all weather conditions as a minimum our calls on a future domestic agricultural policy for dairy aren t far from our nfu dairy strategy we want to see minimum standards in milk contracts to stop the abuse we ve seen over the recent market downturn government regulating on price and volume reporting to increase trust in the dairy supply chain and a true focus on promoting the best of british dairy at home and abroad we also need to make sure that dairy farmers are able to access any future agri environmental scheme but we also need government to recognise the high standards by which british dairy farmers already produce both on the environmental and animal welfare front when discussing regulation with dairy farmers the one issue that s always raised is the onerous implementation of the nitrates directive we re yet to see any change in regulation in the year since the vote and that seems less likely now that we re looking at the great repeal bill it s not all negative though this week the european court of justice has passed a judgement that guarantees better labelling of dairy products interestingly post brexit we may be looking at more regulation for the dairy sector not less a sign that the eu has protected us dairy farmers more than we initially thought maybe but as the nfu we will be calling for regulation to compel milk buyers and traders to share market data and regulation on milk contracts what we have seen over the last 12 months though is massive investment in the uk dairy sector something we initially thought would be stalled or impacted by that vote last year milk buyers may see brexit as an opportunity to get more british products on british shelves and reduce our dairy trade imbalance if this is true dairy farmers need to understand their milk buyers future growth strategies and see if their plans match their own uk dairy can have a positive future post brexit but only if the whole supply chain works together to achieve it back to top horticulture and potatoes nfu horticulture and potatoes board chairman ali capper as it stands farmers growers and the nfu are rightly very concerned about the present lack of clarity on the government s approach to agriculture post brexit the right post brexit trade deal is absolutely critical but equally so is a new wider policy framework that better delivers for farming and the nation the nfu horticulture and potatoes board is focusing its attention on four key areas labour continued access to a competent and reliable workforce both seasonal and permanent the nfu has published a set of policy asks on labour and participated in several government enquiries into the impact of brexit on labour supply and the economy our latest labour provider survey reveals some worrying but not entirely unexpected trends of falling numbers of workers fewer returnees and higher turnover rates we need a commitment from government that growers will have access to the workforce they need up to and after we leave the eu it s vital that the crucial importance of migration for low skilled work is recognised until now high skilled migration has received priority treatment we challenge why this should be the case when vital sectors of the economy such as food and drink rely heavily on large numbers of eu workers crop protection favourable crop protection laws that don t put the industry at an international disadvantage loss of actives and issues with the implementation of mutual recognition are resulting in an anti competitive trading environment in which uk growers are being put at a commercial disadvantage to eu counterparts the nfu would like to see greater flexibility for crd to make decisions on product approvals including an improved attitude to mutual recognition in addition the nfu advocates a risk based approach to policy making the current move towards a hazard based approach has resulted in the commission proposing an extension to the ban on neonicotinoids to include all outdoor crops including non flowering plants the nfu is asking members to lobby their mps and meps to explain the impact of this proposed extension to the ban trade we need unrestricted access to the european market with a focus on robust plant health laws that prevent the entry of damaging exotic diseases while still facilitating trade growers rely on imported goods and inputs and have business interests in other parts of europe and across the world as well as needing access to other markets to import and export products we are currently analysing the impacts of different trade deals on our sector and working across the supply chain to gather all perspectives on this important aspect of the brexit negotiations a new agricultural policy we need an agricultural policy that assists in the development of an increasingly productive progressive and above all profitable farming sector and includes support measures that enable farmers and growers to be both more successful and better meet the needs of society for our sector the po scheme is a good example of how this can be achieved and we should see this as an opportunity to ensure that a future po scheme is simpler to join and leave is able to attract more growers from within co ops and potentially as individual businesses and demonstrates benefits for the return on capital and for the consumer as we leave the eu we must not be placed in a worse position than our competitors in the rest of europe we need to remember that the rest of europe will still be supporting its farmers and we have to compete a good deal on brexit will mean access to markets both in europe and the rest of the world access to the labour we need and an ambitious new agriculture policy focused on productive resilient sustainable and profitable farm businesses if together we can make a success of brexit for british farming without doubt the sector most impacted by the decision to leave the eu then we can help government make a success of brexit for britain back to top livestock nfu livestock board chairman charles sercombe sheep the key issue for the uk sheep sector is being able to maintain our ability to export to the european single market france followed by germany and belgium are our biggest markets by some distance we export around 38 40 of our total production without tariff free access we would simply lose this market which would have a dramatic impact on farm gate prices we are also concerned by the gradual decline in lamb consumption so the whole supply chain needs to work harder to ensure the consistency and quality of the product and to promote new cuts of lamb to a wider demographic that encourages younger people and families that do not currently eat much lamb into the category the halal sector is extremely important both here in the uk but also in europe muslims tend to eat around four times as much sheep meat compared to the uk average of just 4 9k per head per year we are also challenged by imported product especially from new zealand and a bit from australia we have seen this trade change over the years as new zealand sends in added value cuts which because of price compete very well with british lamb and therefore displaces british in retail but especially in food service we would like to understand what the status of the existing eu nz trq will be when we leave the eu we would also ask uk government to consider a trq for sheep meat imports which could draw down quota depending on domestic production uk export volumes and domestic consumption consumer demand i e imported product makes up the shortfall beef we have a slightly different situation for beef as we re only around 60 self sufficient so we import around 270 000 tonnes per annum from ireland alone however we also export beef to ireland and the netherlands only for it to return following further processing therefore the impact of tariff barriers between the uk and eu could have a significant impact on trade flows we know that the irish production is heavily reliant on the uk market and if access was restricted in anyway it will find its way onto the european market only and displace eu domestic product causing significant issues for producers in other member states in the eu beef is deemed to be sensitive product which has afforded it some protection from third country imports particularly from south and north america we would like to see uk beef and lamb afforded sensitive status which might help limit imports produced to lower animal welfare and food safety standards this has come into focus more recently with the brazil meat scandal which highlighted long term systemic fraud our aim must be to develop short and transparent supply chains where possible back to top poultry nfu poultry board chairman duncan priestner one of our key priorities is to ensure that we have an adequate supply of permanent labour willing to work on our farms and in our processing and packing plants both during the negotiations and post brexit poultry farmers can continue to automate certain elements of their business but what they can t do is operate their business without skilled labour further the processing and egg packing plants are very reliant on non uk labour in some cases as much as 80 of the workforce the supply of adequate skilled labour is absolutely business critical to the sector trade has to be fair not least for exports of dark meat and breeding stock so we will continue to reinforce the importance of this key sector with government and seek reassurance and support on trade rules we are proud of the welfare standards within the poultry sector in both meat and eggs and will be pressing government to ensure that trade agreements with other countries guarantee all produce is produced to the uk s high standards in short making it very clear that we are against lower standards of production to those that we have in the uk the government must also guarantee any amendments to our already high welfare standards are science based and do not put our own industry at a competitive disadvantage we are lobbying government for a domestic agricultural policy that supports the continued growth of the sector and does not put barriers or policies in place that threaten that growth we need policies that support technology reduce the burden of bureaucracy and promote productivity in short a dap that supports profitable growth and gives members the confidence to invest in their businesses adequate funding and an environment that encourages continued research and development must be adequately resourced and supported there is uncertainty over what a final brexit agreement will look like therefore we must utilise the time over the coming months to ensure that we get the best possible outcome for our poultry members back to top sugar nfu sugar board chairman michael sly one year on the priority for the sugar sector is to ensure brexit delivers a level playing field where uk beet farmers can compete with the best in the world the newly liberalised eu sugar market has already opened opportunities and over the next two years the nfu will work to make sure uk sugar beet producers are in the best position to take advantage of these agriculture needs a domestic policy and regulatory environment that allows sugar beet growers to cater to the nation s demand for sugar sustainably and efficiently while continuing their work caring for the environment to do this we are working closely with government to ensure we are on a level playing field with the rest of the world britain imports one million tonnes of sugar each year mostly from african caribbean and pacific countries derived from sugar cane and refined in the uk the rest is coming from europe it is important that we keep these trading relationships that benefit the poorest countries however allowing subsidised sugar or products grown to lower standards than society expects of uk farmers to enter the uk market at below the cost of production would undermine principles of environmental protection and the development of less developed countries through preferential trade we are working to ensure that the right opportunities are available through negotiated agreements so that our sugar has a place in the uk market place and overseas back to top
