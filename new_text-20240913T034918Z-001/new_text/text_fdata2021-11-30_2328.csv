from jerome powell also likely helped during his testimony on coronavirus he noted downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation biden omicron is cause for concern not panic following a meeting at the whitehouse with his covid 19 team joe biden said that the omicron variant is cause for concerns not panic and that the us is working on contingency plans for new vaccines with pharmaceutical companies meanwhile the who said the unprecedented number of spike of mutations are concerning although no deaths have yet been linked to the new variant if nothing else this new covid variant seems to have caught the attention it craves but the world waits with bated breath to better gauge the ramifications on the economic recovery and society as a whole there s been an outage at twitter and that outage is jack dorsey who announced he is stepping down as ceo and handing his reigns over to parag agrawal the current chief technology officer twitter twtr suspended trading to announce the decision gapped up around 10 but ultimately closed 1 7 lower commodity fx held onto minor gains it would be incorrect to say the commodity currencies aud and cad led the session with any bullish conviction because they did not they simply retraced against friday s bearish moves by a relatively small amount but that aud usd held above last week s low and usd cad pulled back from week s high provides a clear line in the sand in case sentiment turns which will likely be triggered by omicron the new bogeyman in town therefore currency markets remain in wait or see mode as there s no apparent reason to pile into risk or extend friday s sell off with the lack of solid information available for this new covid variant covid headlines to remain the main driver for markets in all likelihood economic data might take a back seat to a degree this week even if the calendar is full of events but when do markets ever waste a crisis if data comes in much weaker than expected alongside the fear of omicron at 11 30 aedt nz business confidence is expected to have fallen further on october with around net 20 of respondents expecting a weaker economy due to higher inflation and this is already showing up in consumption with last week s poor retail sales figures so it s becoming harder to justify another rate hike from rbnz any time soon china s manufacturing pmi is expected to have contracted for a third consecutive month although at a slower pace the data set is a familiar combination of weak exports new orders with rising prices and that is only going to get worse if we see further travel restrictions imposed for today china s headline pmi is expected to contract but at a slower pace according to a reuters poll given lockdowns in nsw and vic q3 gdp in australia scheduled for tomorrow is expected to have contracted and today s net exports contribution to gdp could help fine tune expectations by just how much and if we get a weak print alongside a softer china manufacturing report with headline below 49 2 then we d expect aud to come under pressure and hand back some of yesterday s mild gains potential h s pattern on gold a potentially interesting setup is emerging on gold the daily chart formed a bearish pinbar yesterday which found resistance at its monthly r1 pivot before closing back beneath the 200 day ema the hourly chart shows as established downtrend to the 1777 lows and a potential head and shoulders top has also formed and its right shoulder rs respected the 200 day ema as resistance prices have since found support at the monthly pivot point but we d take a break of 1777 support to confirm a downside breakout of the pattern but prices need to break down relatively soon to keep the pattern alive as a break above 1800 invalidates r and therefore the pattern potential asx 200 held above 7200 the index initially fell below 7200 and reached the upper bounds of our 7145 7185 support zone before paring earlier losses and only closing 0 5 lower on the day having recouped just under 2 3rds of losses it has left a potential buying tail on yesterday s candle although bulls really need to send

discovered variant with travel restrictions experts with the world health organization met friday to assess the variant which appears to have a high number of mutations in the virus spike protein prompting worries about how easily it will spread while good data on the risks of omicron is likely weeks away the organization cited early evidence suggesting an increased risk of reinfection the u s said it will restrict travel from south africa as well as botswana zimbabwe namibia lesotho eswatini mozambique and malawi according to a statement from senior officials from the biden administration

pose is unclear the beta variant was classified a variant of concern but did not spread as far as initially expected the who urged countries to increase surveillance of omicron cases and genome sequencing efforts to better understand its potential impact biden said the emergence of omicron emphasizes the importance of vaccinations and urged americans to get their booster shots as soon as

facebook group omicron s impact on vaccines unclear but contingency plans already rolling out health experts have said it will likely be weeks before the world has good data about how omicron may reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines but moderna has already announced a three point strategy to combat the new variant omicron s mutations could possibly reduce current vaccines effectiveness but are unlikely to eliminate their benefit according to dr ashish jha dean of brown university s school of public health there are a series of mutations in key regions that may impact effectiveness of our vaccines tweeted jha on friday render vaccines useless no super unlikely moderna s strategy involves three options for boosting covid 19 vaccination should omicron prove problematic for current vaccines the three options according to a friday release from the company a higher dose booster shots currently being studied that are designed to anticipate mutations such as those that have emerged in the omicron variant and an omicron specific booster which is already in the works andy slavitt who previously served as president joe biden s white house senior adviser for covid response said in a tweet that both moderna and pfizer biontech have estimated a vaccine to combat a new variant could be developed in about 3 months with some regulatory and logistical hurtles to follow if we start in early december new vaccines could be available by summer in much of the world slavitt tweeted multiple media organizations on friday reported pfizer biontech is studying the new variant and expects data within weeks if warranted a targeted vaccine could be developed within 6 weeks and ship within 100 days the reports say johnson johnson is also testing its current vaccine against omicron according to cnbc it s coming new york braces for omicron hospitals already strained new york gov kathy hochul on friday announced an executive order intended to boost hospital capacity and address staffing shortages a move that comes amid growing concerns about hospital beds and staffing hospitalizations have already risen sharply recently in much of the state and could soar higher if omicron proves to be as highly transmissible as some fear the variant has not yet been detected in new york it s coming hochul said in a statement friday her order allows the state health department to limit non essential surgeries if needed to ensure capacity the governor said the order also will allow the state to acquire critical supplies more quickly hospitals in other areas of the country are already stretched thin amid a spike in cases on wednesday the federal government said it would send 44 military medical staffers to michigan to help beleaguered hospitals treat covid 19 patients amid a fourth surge that is the worst in the country facing hospitals filling up with covid patients needing lengthy stays massachusetts gov charlie baker said tuesday any hospital or hospital system facing limited capacity to care for patients will be required to reduce non essential non urgent scheduled procedures beginning monday the associated press fda merck covid pill effective experts will review safety federal health regulators say an experimental covid 19 pill from merck is effective against the virus but they will seek input from outside experts on risks of birth defects and other potential problems during pregnancy the food and drug administration posted its analysis of the pill ahead of a public meeting next week where academic and other experts will weigh in on its safety and effectiveness the agency isn t required to follow the group s advice the fda scientists said their review identified several potential risks including possible toxicity and birth defects given those risks the fda will ask its advisers whether the drug should never be given during pregnancy or whether it could be made available in certain cases under that scenario the fda said the drug would carry warnings about risks during pregnancy but doctors would still have the option to prescribe it in certain cases where its benefits could outweigh its risks for patients given the safety concerns fda said merck agreed the drug would not be used in children additionally the fda flagged a concern that merck s drug led to small changes in the coronavirus signature spike protein which it uses to penetrate human cells theoretically fda cautioned those changes could lead to dangerous new variants regulators also noted that merck collected far less safety data overall on its drug than was gathered for other covid 19 therapies fda will ask its independent advisers to discuss all those issues and then vote on whether the drug s overall benefits outweigh its risks the associated press

investors wanting the next 75 bagger can learn a lot from these stocks growth investors dream of buying the ipo stock that evolves into a future sensation while stockholders tend to look for such companies in the tech industry some of the massive percentage gainers also come from the consumer sector two examples of such growth are chipotle cmg 1 11 and starbucks sbux 1 14 each began as a single location in the late 20th century and grew to become two of the largest restaurant chains in the u s not only have they delivered impressive stock price growth but these two companies also offer lessons for investors hoping to find future growth stocks 1 chipotle chipotle made its way by combining two popular concepts the popularity of restaurants like mcdonald s has long shown that consumers like access to fast food however mcdonald s and other restaurants had failed to offer the healthy choices that we re growing in demand from many in the market chipotle changed that by providing nutritious meals to customers in a fast casual setting beginning with a restaurant in denver in 1993 chipotle grew to 489 locations by the time it filed to launch its ipo in early 2006 with the stock at just under 1 700 per share at the time of this writing 1 000 would only buy a fractional share today however when it launched its ipo in 2006 the company priced its stock at 22 per share at the time that would have bought 45 shares today those shares are worth around 76 000 moreover with a p e ratio approaching 70 and a market cap nearing 50 billion the growth is likely not done yet the company operates over 2 000 locations but its most important number could be 6 000 as it wants to eventually operate that many restaurants in north america with chipotle adding about 200 locations per year and comparable store sales growth in the 15 per year range the increases should continue for some time to come 2 starbucks starbucks s growth to nearly 34 000 locations worldwide shows how far a restaurant concept can reach american consumers have long demonstrated a love for coffee despite its popularity the coffee house had not taken off in the u s until starbucks ceo howard schultz brought the concept from italy and adapted it for u s consumers its stores spread across the pacific northwest and western canada quickly and by the time starbucks launched its ipo in 1992 it had spread out from seattle into 165 locations at the original ipo price of 17 per share 1 000 would have purchased 58 shares thanks to six 2 for 1 stock splits those 58 shares would have turned into 3 712 shares now valued at approximately 410 000 moreover this does not include the dividend income investors have collected since 2010 that payout has risen every year since and in 2021 this position would have generated 6 830 in dividend income without selling a single share also despite its massive size starbucks predicts comparable store sales growth in the high single digit percentages in fiscal 2022 with the company expecting to add 2 000 stores during that time it has positioned itself to continue the long term growth in its stock and dividends learning from successful restaurant ipos while such stories may give investors hope for the future they likely want to find the next chipotle or the new starbucks however picking that stock may prove challenging investors who bought chipotle or starbucks could have just as easily picked an el pollo loco that has experienced little movement over the last five years or a dunkin which once traded on exchanges but later went private such possibilities necessitate investments in multiple stocks however investors should remember that chipotle s 7 600 growth and the 34 000 gain in starbucks since their ipos can far outweigh stagnation or failure in stock investments that did not succeed by taking chances on multiple stocks with such potential one or more of them could return 75 fold gains or more over the long term

federal reserve chair jerome powell says omicron will pose a threat to the us economy and make the bid to reverse soaring inflation more difficult and could see prices increases well into next year powell testifies before the senate banking committee tuesday greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person he plans to say he will say factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year president joe biden monday urged americans to get vaccinated or get their booster shots amid warnings about the spread of the omicron variant but biden insisted that the infectious new variant was not a cause for panic federal reserve chair jerome powell says that the appearance of a new covid 19 variant could slow the economy and hiring while also raising uncertainty about inflation the recent increase in delta cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation powell said monday in prepared remarks to be delivered to the senate banking committee on tuesday the new variant could also worsen supply chain disruptions he said powell s comments come after other fed officials in recent weeks have said the central bank should consider winding down its ultra low interest rate policies more quickly than it currently plans they cited concerns about inflation which has jumped to three decade highs yet powell s remarks suggest that the additional uncertainty raised by the omicron variant may complicate the fed s next steps federal reserve chairman jerome powell will tell congress that the appearance of a new covid 19 variant could slow the economy and hiring greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions powell said while little is known definitively about the health effects of the omicron variant if it were to cause americans to pull back on spending and slow the economy that could ease inflation pressures in the coming months yet if the new variant causes another wave of factory shutdowns in china vietnam or other asian countries that could worsen supply chain snarls particularly if americans keep buying more furniture appliances and other goods that in turn could push prices even higher in the coming months powell acknowledged that inflation imposes significant burdens especially on those less able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation he said most economists expect inflation to subside over time as supply constraints ease but added that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year at a news conference last month powell said high inflation could persist into late summer at their last meeting november 2 3 fed policymakers agreed to start reducing the central bank s 120 billion in monthly bond purchases by 15 billion a month that would bring the purchases to an end in june those bond buys an emergency measure that began last year are intended to hold down longer term interest rates to encourage more borrowing and spending the fed has pegged its short term interest rate which influences other borrowing costs such as for mortgages and credit cards at nearly zero since last march when covid 19 first erupted last week the fed released minutes from the november meeting that showed some of the 17 fed policymakers supported reducing the bond purchases more quickly particularly if inflation worsens that would give the fed the opportunity to hike its benchmark rate as early as the first half of next year at that time investors expected three rate hikes next year but the odds of that many hikes have fallen sharply since the appearance of the new coronavirus variant powell speaks before the senate banking committee chaired by sen sherrod brown d ohio the consumer price index rose 6 2 percent in october 2021 from one year prior the highest it has been since 1990 the prices for november are yet to be released fuel prices at a shell gas station in san francisco california u s on thursday oct 21 2021 american drivers will continue to face historically high fuel prices as gasoline demand surged to the highest in more than a decade dollar tree s stock price didn t seem to be hurt by the announcement jumping nearly 10 percent to 144 90 the botswana variant has around 50 mutations and more than 30 of them are on the spike protein the current crop of vaccines trigger the body to recognise the version of the spike protein from older versions of the virus but the mutations may make the spike protein look so different that the body s immune system struggles to recognise it and fight it off and three of the spike mutations h665y n679k p681h help it enter the body s cells more easily meanwhile it is missing a membrane protein nsp6 which was seen in earlier iterations of the virus which experts think could make it more infectious and it has two mutations r203k and g204r that have been present in all variants of concern so far and have been linked with infectiousness dr angelique coetzee chair of the south african medical association and the first person to spot the new variant in a patient said her patients infected with omicron reported different and much milder symptoms including tiredness muscle aches a sore head and a dry cough but none reported the tell tale symptoms of a loss of smell or taste or breathing difficulties president joe biden on monday urged americans to get vaccinated or get their booster shots amid warnings about the spread of the omicron variant but insisted that the infectious new variant was not a cause for panic and said no new restrictions were needed we ll fight this variant with scientific and knowledgeable actions and speed not chaos and confusion biden said at the white house but even amid the pressing nature of the new variant biden misstated the name of the variant it s called the omnicron he said inserting an extra n an error his coronavirus advisor dr anthony fauci who was standing in the background also committed on sunday the world health organization who has warned the new variant poses a severe risk to the world s pandemic recovery and the odds of it being infectious enough to spread quickly are very high hours after the speech the cdc strengthened their guidance to recommend that all adults get a booster omicron which was first identified in south africa but is thought to have originated in botswana is the most mutated form of covid yet found and has been declared a variant of concern by the who because early data suggests it is more infectious than the delta strain south africa s national institute for communicable diseases nicd said the variant is fueling a surge in coronavirus hospitalizations in hot spots within the country gauteng the province where the covid 19 variant was first detected has suffered a more than 300 percent increase in virus related hospitalizations this week the number of children hospitalized with covid has also risen sharply around south african s capital city of pretoria though the nicd said not all are at risk of severe disease and some cases could just be out of an abundance of caution when biden addressed the us on monday he said you have to get your vaccine you have to get the shot you have to get the booster biden said speaking to the nation from the white house roosevelt room which is now features a fireplace mantle decked out with holiday decorations sooner or later we re going to see new cases of this variant here in the united states biden predicted a day after it had been identified in canada but he cautioned this variant is a cause for concern not a cause for panic and said no additional measures were currently needed asked if lockdowns were off the table biden responded yes for now if people are vaccinated and wear their masks there s no need for lockdowns however moderna s ceo stephane bancel told cnbc just today that he s worried the vaccines currently available may not do enough to protect people from the newly mutated virus the antibodies moderna s covid 19 vaccine generates to fight against it could be eight times lower against omicron the president fielded a few questions after his remarks where he called the new variant omnicron adding an n biden asked americans to mask when required get vaccinated and get boosted and said he is sparing no effort we re going to fight and beat this new variant as well he said he pleaded with the unvaccinated to go get that first shot the best protection against this new variant or any of the of the various ones out there is getting fully vaccinated biden said we do not yet believe that additional measures will be needed biden said but he said his team was already in touch with people from drug makers pfzizer moderna and johnson johnson to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters if needed vice president kamala harris and fauci both wore masks as they stood behind the president as additional protection please wear your masks indoors in public settings around other people he said biden was pictured shopping at murray s toggery shop in nantucket without his mask on saturday despite the island s mask requirement for indoor facilities the fully vaccinated president was caught flaunting the health guidelines just hours after he was fully briefed on the concerning new variant the island brought back its indoor mask mandates earlier this month at a town meeting on november 18 they made the decision to return to indoor masking because scientists found a prevalence of the virus in island sewage on monday biden also praised south african officials for reporting information about the new variant but said the travel ban the u s imposed was meant to buy time to give more people time to get vaccinated south african officials have fumed that the uk the u s and other nations slapped the travel warning on immediately after they brought forward the new information likely saddling the nation with economic harm but biden isn t pushing new travel restrictions after the u s shut down travel from seven south african nations following initial reports out of south africa those restrictions took effect today also on monday white house press secretary jen psaki defended the limited decision to restrict travel during her regular press briefing insisting the us wasn t looking to punish any other nation the objective here is not to punish it is to protect the american people psaki said this is not going to prevent it is going to delay and that delay is going to help us have necessary time to do the research to get more people vaccinated during his remarks biden also urged everyone to wear a mask in indoor settings except when eating or drinking or speaking in a microphone as he was doing without a mask in addition to defending the new travel ban biden defended the nation s effort to pump out millions of vaccines for the world a humanitarian effort that should also stem the creation of new variants we can t let up until the world is vaccinated biden said we re throwing everything we can at this virus tracking it from every angle he said no vaccines shipped abroad will ever come at the expense of any american and pledged i will always make sure

new york cnn business here we go again federal reserve chairman jerome powell is set to testify tuesday that the omicron variant threatens america s economic recovery much remains unknown about omicron yet if it prolongs the pandemic it could keep prices rising hurt job growth and make the supply chain crisis worse the recent rise in covid 19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation powell wrote in prepared testimony he s set to deliver tuesday to the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs wall street sold off stocks and oil friday after learning about the potentially highly infectious and more immunity resistant variant but the market regained much of its lost ground monday after investors took a breath and sensed a buying opportunity stocks similarly sold off when wall street first heard about the delta variant but it soon rebounded and surged to new records as vaccine availability spread and health officials learned how to better manage the pandemic in his prepared testimony powell noted the economy took a body blow in the summer as the delta variant spread across the globe many americans were afraid to travel shop eat at restaurants and return to the office that kept caregivers at home exacerbating the labor shortage and supply chain crisis that have held back the us economy but infections fell throughout the fall and the economy picked up steam powell predicted the us economy would grow a robust 5 this year as infections fell starting in september the job market rebounded and the unemployment rate fell to 4 6 the lowest rate since may 2020 the economy has ebbed and flowed with rising and falling infections and omicron threatens to undo much of the economic goodwill america has generated throughout the autumn months greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions powell wrote in his testimony powell who president joe biden recently renominated for a second term as fed chair said the imbalance of supply and demand have artificially sent prices surging well above the fed s 2 annual inflation target americans have spent about 5 more on goods and services this year powell noted inflation could be here to stay for a bit longer powell said it s a bit of a catch 22 the labor shortage had been sending wages and prices higher but with job growth accelerating in recent months employers are finding fewer applicants for their available jobs and they have to raise pay to attract new workers

on wall street the end of the pandemic appeared tantalizingly close just a week ago there were positive signs the economy was rebounding and investors biggest worry was how quickly the federal reserve would pivot away from the market boosting policies that have helped stocks soar in the past year and a half the omicron variant changed that almost overnight investors and analysts have snapped their attention back on the virus as they try to assess the myriad ways the concerning new iteration could undermine an often overlooked source of market confidence this year the effectiveness of vaccines now the markets face weeks of uncertainty and increased volatility as investors once again closely watch public health updates arriving hour by hour analysts said after a solid rally on monday the s p 500 rose 1 3 percent recovering some of the ground lost in a panicky slide on friday global markets were sliding again on tuesday in new york the s p 500 opened sharply lower amid new concerns over the ability of current vaccines to control omicron
diagram of key pilot wharton risk center staten island homes in build it back program after hurricane sandy center for new york city neighborhoods government technologyin this installment of the civic stage 2 innovation of the month series we highlight a project called inclusive insurance improving the post flood financial resiliency of low and moderate income households from new york city the project seeks to improve the ability of low and moderate income households to recover after a flood through innovative insurance pilots and capacity building within the city and civic partners to harness risk transfer markets for social goals metrolab s elias gbadamosi and josh schacht spoke with carolyn kousky executive director of the wharton risk management and decision processes center at the university of pennsylvania peter adams senior policy adviser for land use and buildings new york city mayor s office of recovery and resiliency helen wiley project manager at the wharton risk center joseph sant general counsel and vice president of the center for nyc neighborhoods jessi penkoff staff attorney at the center for nyc neighborhoods and aaron sturm program manager at the center for nyc neighborhoods can you tell us what your project is about and what the motivation for it was our project s overarching goal is to increase the financial resilience of low and moderate income lmi households in new york city to escalating flood risk through the use of inclusive insurance currently low and moderate income households in the u s struggle with access to the needed financial resources to recover after disaster events yet financial resilience the ability to recover from an economic shock underpins other aspects of recovery and is a necessary condition for broader urban disaster resilience our project is about helping the neediest when they need help most after a disaster lower income new yorkers often don t have the savings or support network necessary to find safe shelter get food and access needed supplies even though all levels of government and aid organizations scramble to start up response and recovery actions after a flood vulnerable households have needs that cannot wait that s why we are piloting a parametric insurance policy program in new york city to test and demonstrate how this type of speedy ready to go insurance payout can get money to the people who need it most in the immediate aftermath of a disaster we have structured our project activities into four components 1 develop and deploy innovative insurance pilots 2 create a community of practice for harnessing risk transfer for social recovery goals 3 increase literacy and capacity of all partners and 4 link research to actionable change as peter said the key pilot will be the purchase by the center for new york city neighborhoods of a parametric flood insurance policy designed to rapidly provide emergency cash grants to low and moderate income households in the event of a flood who are your project partners and what role do they play on the team this project is a joint effort between the wharton risk management and decision processes center at the university of pennsylvania the new york city mayor s office of climate resiliency mocr and the center for new york city neighborhoods cnycn these partners have deep and extensive experience on topics of disaster resilience insurance and the recovery of low and moderate income households and communities from disasters as a team our three institutions are working closely together to ensure that all of our project components enhance one another for instance cnycn coordinates a network of 30 housing counseling and legal services organizations that assist low and moderate income households in nyc this network was activated during hurricane sandy to help households with recovery our project will provide this network of advisers with deeper training on disaster insurance and disaster finance additionally guy carpenter one of the largest global reinsurance intermediaries with broad experience in disaster risk transfer is providing consultant and brokerage services for the insurance purchase they are helping design and structure this innovative insurance policy the risk center is also undertaking research and development on a second promising parametric insurance model with the help of global parametrics world leaders in inclusive insurance for poorer populations internationally our work also is informed by an advisory board of subject matter experts what are some of the major impacts of flooding on the economy of low and moderate income households the financial burden caused by flood recovery is especially difficult for low and moderate income households after a disaster financial aid does not cover all needs and delays in payments hurt household finances the immediate financial strain causes the least financially resourced households to pay the most for their recovery especially those who do not have enough savings to cover the cost of repairing a flood damaged home or if the recovery process causes them to incur excessive debt furthermore paying for unexpected disaster related payments results in an inability to pay for other bills and households can quickly fall behind on their rent mortgage or other regular payments middle and working class communities of color who were literally marginalized by segregation and discrimination in housing now reside along new york city s coasts and in many places these are now some of the last bastions of affordable housing in urban markets like ours these groups can disproportionately suffer post disaster for example research by the urban institute has found that after four years a medium sized disaster causes an average 31 point decline in credit scores for people living in communities of color whereas people living in majority white communities experienced only a four point decline compared to the city as a whole a disproportionately large number of flood zone residents live in owner occupied one to four family homes they are predominantly low and moderate income residents and they suffered considerably following hurricane sandy both in terms of financial setbacks and through the health risks that accompanied the flooding these same households must now also contend with pandemic related financial setbacks higher flood insurance premiums and limited options for preparing the older housing stock against future storm damage floods come in all shapes and sizes sometimes from coastal surge or extreme rain sometimes spread out across an entire city or other times limited to a single block but whatever the source or scale of the flood if it is your home that is flooded that flood was a disaster for you and your household this is especially true if your household is low income and has a limited safety net a flood damaged home can mean loss of possessions structural damage injury and even loss of life mold and rot can set in creating hazardous conditions and if the floodwaters were saline corrosion causes further problems in the best case occupants are forced to live elsewhere until their home is mucked out cleaned and passes safety inspections in the worst case they may not be able to return to their home for a very long time meanwhile low and moderate income households typically have to wait months or even years for insurance payouts or federal relief the disruption to home work school health and safety can be profound and lasting how would you explain inclusive innovative insurance and why is it an important economic development tool for post disaster recovery inclusive insurance refers to any program or policy that makes insurance coverage available to those previously locked out of the insurance market internationally there has been a growing movement to identify low cost insurance designs and establish public private partnerships that can guarantee a more equitable recovery however these innovations have yet to be widely adopted in the u s our pilot will be parametric that means the insurance policy will pay a set amount based on an observable measure of the disaster such as the height of flood waters or wind speed in a certain location this is different from standard indemnity insurance which typically requires a time consuming loss adjustment process after a disaster parametric insurance provides two important benefits for our project first payouts can be made extremely rapidly this is important as we have found that many households do not have sufficient resources in the immediate aftermath of a severe flood second parametric insurance also provides important flexibility to the insured in how the funds are used we call parametric insurance innovative because it goes beyond typical insurance to provide a level of coverage that is clear to the beneficiary and fast to pay out there is no extensive documentation required or other red tape after a disaster instead there s money in the pockets of people who need it most and need it fast we know that households impacted by a disaster face financial setbacks of all kinds setbacks that compound the longer needs go unmet government aid flows to communities to cover many specific needs but it takes time to distribute and can leave gaps that are never easy to predict we also know there are persistent challenges in disbursing disaster relief equitably so that it reaches the hardest hit populations therefore there is a need for flexible aid dollars that can reach affected households immediately that does not go to excessive lengths to restrict and target what the dollars can be used for and without the procedural hurdles that leave families waiting can you tell us briefly about some of the policy informed research projects that your team plans to deliver for new york city residents the challenge of low and moderate income household recovery and escalating climate risks cannot be solved by one field or the public or private sector alone but only through new partnerships informed by interdisciplinary research therefore the research activities for this project are designed to directly inform on the ground policy and practice we will be undertaking several research projects first we are conducting a survey to quantify the length of delays in various sources of disaster recovery dollars and the costs from these delays the results will be combined into a comprehensive framework linking the delays households experience in obtaining the necessary financial resources for recovery and ultimate financial and non financial costs to households second we are constructing a typology of the community level benefits of widespread insurance purchase and third we are doing a replicability and generalizability analysis of the project s insurance pilots if the pilot is successful scaling will involve not just expanded use within nyc but also transferring the approach and insights to other communities what key considerations would you recommend that other disaster prone communities pursue when building inclusive insurance options work with your local on the ground partners to understand which parts of your community are most at risk what their needs are and how best to address those needs study past disasters and talk to the people who experienced them firsthand also think through the different impacts of different disasters for example smaller disasters may cause less or more limited damage overall but if they are focused on a low income community the need may still be great likewise a smaller disaster may not get a federal disaster declaration and subsequent federal aid or generate as much charitable support as a larger disaster despite the fact that severe impacts are still being felt by low income households find where the recovery gaps are in your community and then determine if parametric insurance is the right tool to help fill them flood insurance is a key component to recovering more quickly post disaster and reducing financial harm it is not just for homeowners and communities living along a coast a large majority of claims come from outside of high risk coastal flood zones community members need access to up to date information so they can understand their individual risk and know what options are available to mitigate the impact of the next flooding event while in some situations households may be able to turn to friends or family for assistance in a flood entire neighborhoods may be hit simultaneously as such resilience typically requires that disaster risks be transferred out of the community most disaster relief programs are designed for long term recovery and hazard mitigation not the financial needs in the weeks and months following a disaster thus considering these other approaches can be beneficial in helping households with a faster and stronger recovery

by nicole gaouette kylie atwood and jennifer hansler cnn iran nuclear talks resumed monday in vienna austria as the us warned tehran against further uranium enrichment israel forcefully lobbied against sanctions relief for iran and iran announced its willingness and seriousness to reach a deal but only if the us lifts sanctions the flurry of public messaging was punctuated by a report out of israel suggesting iran is preparing to enrich uranium to the level needed to make a nuclear weapon two israeli officials confirmed to cnn the news first reported by axios that israel had shared intelligence with us officials in recent weeks that suggests iran is preparing to enrich uranium to 90 those reports follow iran s own announcement last week about its steady march toward greater stockpiles of enriched uranium some of it dictated by a law iran s parliament passed last year that ordered the resumption of uranium enrichment to pressure the us to ease sanctions emerging from the first round of talks about the joint comprehensive plan of action as the deal is formally known the european union s deputy secretary general enrique mora told reporters something has to change both for the sake of nuclear security and the people of iran nothing has changed we have taken stock of the difficult circumstances of the jcpoa mora said over the recent months the iranian nuclear program has advanced and at the same time the united states are imposing the same sanctions no one nothing has changed to the previous administration he noted and that situation points in the direction of that we have to bring jcpoa back to life both for nuclear commitments and for the benefit of the iranian population iran s foreign ministry spokesperson saeed khatibzadeh said tehran is willing to get on the right track to reach an agreement if the other side shows the same willingness the government has shown its willingness and seriousness by sending a quality team known to all khatibzadeh told a news conference in tehran if the other side shows the same willingness we will be on the right track to reach an agreement the two israeli officials told cnn that israel had shared information about iran s activities with the us in the weeks leading up to monday s resumption of talks which had stalled after six rounds of negotiations for almost six months the european union france germany china and russia are meeting directly with the iranians without the us in the room us diplomats are participating indirectly meeting with allies afterward to learn what was discussed and weigh in with their positions it s not clear if the new israeli report will complicate matters israeli intelligence suggests that iran is taking technical steps that would allow it to enrich uranium to 90 purity iran has been openly pursuing efforts to increase its stockpiles of enriched uranium in an apparent effort to gain leverage in vienna iran announced on friday that it had grown its stockpile of 20 enriched uranium just days after announcing that its stock of 60 enriched uranium has grown to 66 pounds 30 kilograms according to the arms control association enriching uranium to 20 constitutes about 90 percent of the necessary work to enrich to weapons grade iran s uranium enrichment was limited under the nuclear deal which then president donald trump pulled the us from in may 2018 now as iran s stockpiles grow the arms control association says that iran s breakout time the time it would take to produce enough enriched uranium for one bomb decreases the association estimates that iran s current breakout time is likely about a month down from 12 months when the nuclear deal was fully implemented but it s not clear iran has the other infrastructure needed to build a bomb and iran has also consistently said it is not aiming to build a nuclear weapon provocative act state department principal deputy spokesperson jalina porter would not comment directly on the reports but said monday that enrichment to 90 purity would be a provocative act we ve made clear that iran s continued nuclear escalations are unconstructive she said during a briefing call with reporters they re also inconsistent work with what s stated in the goal of returning to a mutual compliance with the jcpoa they won t provide iran any negotiating leverage as we return to the talks porter said the white house declined to comment on the matter we will not comment on intelligence matters but it s no secret that the former administration s decision to abandon the jcpoa led to a dramatic and unprecedented acceleration of iran s nuclear program this includes advanced enrichment activities as recently confirmed again by the international atomic energy agency said a senior administration official sending an administration official to vienna this week the biden administration followed through on its pledge to continue engaging in diplomacy as an effort to salvage the iran deal leading into the talks the us also said it is prepared to use other options if the negotiations fail nuclear blackmail meanwhile as the nuclear talks resumed with iran israel targeted its diplomatic firepower at the prospect of a possible interim agreement with tehran that would see sanctions lifted in exchange for a partial freeze on iran s nuclear program prime minister naftali bennett in a video message delivered in english said the united states and its partners must not give in to what he called iran s nuclear blackmail despite iran s violations and undermining of the nuclear inspections iran will be arriving at the negotiation table in vienna and there are those who think they deserve to have their sanctions removed and hundreds of billions of dollars poured right into their rotten regime they re wrong he said iran deserves no rewards no bargain deals and no sanctions relief in return for their brutality foreign minister yair lapid on a whistle stop visit to britain and france two countries participating in the vienna talks echoed that message in london the day before the talks began iran s deputy foreign minister and top negotiator ali bagheri kani laid out iran s message in a financial times op ed their first goal to gain a full guaranteed and verifiable removal of the sanctions that have been imposed on the iranian people without this bagheri said the process will continue

study omicron pfizer s top executive said the company will know within two to three weeks how well its covid 19 vaccine holds up against the new omicron variant and even in a worst case scenario he expects the existing formula will retain some efficacy against the heavily mutated strain the company is currently conducting lab tests to see how antibodies generated by the existing vaccine work

tesla ceo elon musk told all employees in an email not to sprint like crazy to deliver cars pointing out that although the company expends great effort rushing and spending loads of money actually does not deliver more cars advertisement in his email which was sent on friday and obtained by cnbc musk instead prompted workers to focus on minimising the cost of deliveries instead of spending buckets of money on expedite fees overtime and temporary contractors just to ensure that cars reach customers in the fourth quarter of the year which would contribute to sales goals tesla s vehicle deliveries are the closest thing to sales data the company releases as its sales are global and it does not publicise regional data in the third quarter of this year the company produced 237 823 cars and made 241 300 deliveries what has happened historically is that we sprint like crazy at end of quarter to maximise deliveries but then deliveries drop massively in the first few weeks of the next quarter musk wrote according to a transcript provided by cnbc in effect looked at over a six month period we won t have delivered any extra cars but we will have spent a lot of money and burned ourselves out to accelerate deliveries in the last two weeks of each quarter advertisement the tesla ceo added that the company has a big wave of deliveries being made in the last few weeks of december because it hadn t achieved high volume production of cars in europe or texas yet for instance there are many cars being transported on boats from china where tesla has a gigafactory in shanghai that has a production capacity of 450 000 electric vehicles per year to europe in the u s meanwhile new cars are being delivered on trucks and trains from california to the east coast in both cases these cars will arrive late in the quarter musk emphasised that this was the right time to start reducing the size of the wave and focus on obtaining a more steady and efficient pace of deliveries the right principle is take the most efficient action as though we were not publicly traded and the notion of end of quarter didn t exist musk wrote advertisement that s easy to say when you own the most valuable car company in the world despite musk s best efforts to push down the value of the company s stock case in point a tweet this past may where he said that tesla stock price is too high imo which wiped billions off the company s market value while musk s email makes perfect business sense tesla customers that are expecting deliveries over the next few weeks may not be too happy about it many tesla customers have been waiting for their new cars for months and have seen expected delivery dates changed again and again cnbc reported some of these customers are having to dish out even more money for rental cars and ride hailing services in the meantime customers who financed their new teslas are also being impacted as the delays could affect their loan rates and insurance quotes in october tesla posted its biggest quarterly net earnings in history totaling us1 62 a 2 27 billion at that time the company acknowledged its delivery delays which it attributed to global supply chain and logistics challenges to date it has delivered 627 572 cars this year
a group of 87 members of congress have written to president joe biden to urge him to support supplemental funding for israel s iron dome missile defense system the funding which would replenish the system s stock of interceptor rockets and also sponsor its expansion has had a rocky road to approval after the 1 billion marked for iron dome was excluded from a broader spending bill by several progressive house members it overwhelmingly passed the house in a standalone measure however that bill has yet to come before the senate for a vote primarily due to obstruction by sen rand paul r ky the letter s signatories noted that the appropriations deadline is dec 3 and asked the president to specifically ask congress to include funding for the missile defense system in an appropriations bill replenishing israel s stock of iron dome interceptors and expanding its missile defense system is a critical investment that will protect both israeli and palestinian lives and homes as well as america s national security interests asserted the group of mostly democrats the current impasse over the appropriation is jeopardizing civilian lives and the security of our key ally israel in its time of need said the letter which was spearheaded by new jersey democrat josh gottheimer we must ensure that the iron dome is equipped to protect israel without the risk that it could be overwhelmed or its stockpile of interceptors depleted they said israel must always have the resources it needs to defend itself from incoming terrorist rockets please know that congress stands with your administration in its commitment to ensure israel s peace security and capability to defend itself from any attack they concluded
powerful governments including some in the european union the uk switzerland and norway are resisting a proposed wto waiver for covid related intellectual property rights which if implemented will enable companies in less developed countries to temporarily manufacture covid products developed by multinational pharmaceutical companies photo aspen pharmacare sparks were expected to fly at the 12th ministerial council of the world trade organization wto which was due to start today as the trade organisation s top decision making body would have debated who has the right to manufacture covid related health products but things petered out when the wto general council decided late on friday to postpone the meeting because of the new omicron variant that has been detected in several southern african european and middle eastern countries as well as the united states the united kingdom and australia the world health organization who has classified omicron as a variant of concern european countries have implemented travel bans on southern african countries including south africa which will prevent delegates from travelling to geneva where the meeting would have been held powerful governments including some in the european union the uk switzerland and norway are resisting a proposed wto waiver for covid related intellectual property ip rights which if implemented will enable companies in less developed countries to temporarily manufacture covid products developed by multinational pharmaceutical companies ip rights protect an inventor s designs and trade secrets such as methods and processes and trademarks in essence ip rights allow developers to make and sell products exclusively for a certain period however this can block competition and equitable access in the case of covid vaccines for instance poorer countries have had significantly less access to these products at least in part because they re not able to manufacture the vaccines themselves as it stands only about 7 of people in africa have been fully vaccinated against 88 in some high income countries the biennial ministerial meeting which is attended by trade ministers and senior officials of wto member countries was due to negotiate text around the proposal which was tabled by sa and india in october 2020 but more than 130 civil society groups mainly from developing countries have called on governments to instead immediately agree to the waiver they say a ministerial meeting is not necessary in this instance as waivers have been agreed by meetings of the general council of the wto in geneva some groups have also written to us president joe biden requesting his personal engagement in delivering a temporary waiver so that countries can remove ip barriers that are limiting the supplies of covid 19 vaccines treatments and diagnostic tests necessary to end the pandemic in may the us expressed its support for a temporary waiver but activists are unhappy that the country supports only part of the proposal not the waiving of ip rights for all covid related technologies there has however been a lot of shuffling about since the initial proposal was put on the table after meeting upon meeting a revised version of the proposal was submitted in may it was adapted to deal in part with concerns that the phrasing was too broad and to make the timeframe more specific a waiver of at least three years then came a counterproposal by the eu and eventually an announcement in june that wto members including the us have agreed to start text based negotiations by november there was still no clear decision about which proposal to negotiate and now there s been an indefinite postponement of the ministerial conference albeit with an open ended comment that this does not mean negotiations should stop so is all the huffing and puffing just bluffing how do text based negotiations work and how close is the world to reaching a definitive fair agreement on ip rights for covid 19 technologies we asked experts to break it down here are 10 things you should know what are text based negotiations they re a normal part of talks among wto members to hash out the conditions of trade agreements representatives of member countries typically signal that they want to negotiate the wording in a draft agreement by adding square brackets to a piece of text why are negotiations around covid 19 technologies necessary the proposal currently on the table asks wto member countries to suspend some of the ip rights including patents that apply to health products and technologies for the prevention treatment or containment of covid 19 for at least three years doctors without borders global ip adviser leena menghaney explains that ip rights can give a patent holder a pharmaceutical company for example the power to sue someone who makes a generic version of its product without permission this can block competition which would lower prices in a global pandemic and especially in developing countries enforcing ip rights on covid related products won t work she says because we cannot wait for years for alternative supply given the protection ip rights offer product developers it s not unexpected that a proposal to waive these rights or even just some of them would get pushback in fact the eu s counterproposal makes the case for using existing provisions in the trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips agreement to govern the trade in covid 19 technologies why is the proposed waiver contentious the proposal is about more than vaccines and this is a sticking point when the us announced in may that it was willing to participate in text based negotiations it said it supported waiving ip protections specifically for covid vaccines menghaney gives the us trade representative credit for backing off from being big pharma s ally and saying let s negotiate but she says a vaccines only waiver which excludes other covid treatments health products and technologies is not acceptable the waiver is also about getting the newer drugs that are in the pipeline to people when they need most she says as treatment activists we believe that the right way of dealing with a pandemic is to save people who are dying and to prevent them from getting very sick and overwhelming healthcare systems fatima hassan founder of the health justice initiative and an advocate for the waiver agrees the issue that we re trying to address is how ip affects the ability of the world to have immediate and obviously more affordable and sustainable supplies of multiple life saving interventions including vaccines what is discussed during text based negotiations the talks could be based on one text or several bits of text says south african trade official mustaqeem de gama jayant dasgupta former indian ambassador to the wto 2010 2014 adds that during these negotiations either alternative language has to be suggested and accepted by everybody or just drops because the country that suggested it initially could be persuaded the initial waiver proposal asked the wto to lift the regulations that protect copyright industrial designs patents and undisclosed information for any products used in the fight against covid 19 for an undefined period this scope was considered uncomfortably broad by some member countries so after discussions the wording was adapted the language in the revised version which is currently up for discussion therefore specifies what type of covid related health products and technologies should be exempted from ip rights namely diagnostics therapeutics vaccines medical devices personal protective equipment their materials or components and the methods for their manufacture and for how long at least three years how long do these negotiations take really long in some cases they can go on for years for one members might not agree on the text that should form the basis of negotiations as is the case at present de gama explains a member will put in a text reflecting its expectations and its solution and several members probably will come over time and add either a sliver or a big piece of text or have a standalone text or they could all add to the text that s already there for example that the proponents have put on the table once the text flagged for negotiation is finalised during these drawn out discussions and depending on the timing de gama says it would go to the wto s general council or ministerial conference which makes decisions on trade agreements to get a sense of how slow the process can be consider negotiations around aspects of fisheries subsidies which could lead to overfishing and the depletion of natural stocks these negotiations were announced in 2001 two decades later they re still ongoing but says de gama it s important to distinguish between examples such as these and the covid proposal which is driven by an externality that requires a little bit more urgency dasgupta says that target dates are usually set for completing text based negotiations to inject momentum in the negotiations and lead to some outcome the next ministerial conference is typically a good target he says which is where the process was last week how does a text get approved the wto favours decision making by consensus which means all 164 member governments have to agree to the text this can be a hurdle for the trips waiver proposal because some high income countries most notably germany have been fiercely opposed to it in fact a german government representative said at a press conference in may that ip should be protected to ensure continued future innovation if consensus can t be reached the wto can in certain instances take the matter to a vote for the trips waiver to be accepted it would need the support of 75 of member countries de gama who has been involved in the waiver discussions says its supporters are aiming for consensus but if consensus cannot be reached and the situation requires us to go to a vote we will not shy away from using that yet a geneva based trade official says it s unlikely a vote will take place because all member governments would have to agree to proceed to a vote in the first place hassan worries that countries that oppose the trips waiver are going to drag it out because you know the entire model of the wto is about consensus building you have to negotiate the text but people are waiting for vaccines so this is why we say it s absurd to rely on a trade body to get you out of a pandemic because now we sit in geneva at the wto and negotiate with diplomats who don t understand public health what if a text doesn t get approved the talks continue de gama says it is not uncommon in text based negotiations that agreement is not reached by the deadline there are 15 items that i can refer to fisheries subsidies would be one of them where there should have been an outcome already at previous ministerial so it failed at that point members got back and they picked up the pieces and they continued to negotiate what would it mean if the waiver is accepted if the waiver is approved wto member countries would be able to suspend covid related ip rights without being in violation of international rules says roshan joseph trade and ip analyst for doctors without borders access campaign it would be up to individual countries to decide whether they go this route but if they do go ahead it in essence means that they would be able to ramp up the supply of covid 19 test kits treatments vaccines medical devices personal protective equipment and other health products and technologies because they don t have to fear possibly expensive drawn out legal action for infringing ip rights wto member countries would not have to fear a trade dispute being lodged by another member country a patent holding company would not be able to block the manufacture of covid 19 technologies in a country where the waiver is implemented and a company would not be obliged to share its know how or other undisclosed information with competitors but it would be possible for a third party such as a regulator to share information submitted to it why are existing local laws not used to overcome ip hurdles during the pandemic south african law does make it possible for a court to issue a compulsory licence that allows someone other than the patentholder to use a patent but it s not easy the problem says yousuf vawda a senior research associate at the university of kwazulu natal s law school is that the grounds for such an application in terms of the patent act are very few and the process is onerous time consuming and expensive which means small generic manufacturers are unlikely to proceed another complication is that many patents could apply to a single product there might be a patent on the active ingredient on the method of manufacture and so forth there may be dozens of patents you have to know what all those patents are and you have to apply for a compulsory licence against all of those patents and that s a very difficult thing to do says vawda what s next if the waiver is approved it would mean the relevant ip rights would not apply for at least three years in countries that adopt it in theory this could help them ramp up their production of covid 19 technologies but producing a market ready product such as a vaccine without having the actual method is tricky and time consuming as the partners of the who s first mrna vaccine tech transfer hub are finding out the waiver alone will not be the answer but as things stand now we don t even know whether we ll have an answer about it any time soon which leaves poorer countries still on the back foot in confronting the pandemic

new york wall street steadied itself monday after last week s stock market slide caused by the newest coronavirus variant with investors now waiting for more clues about just how much damage it may do to the economy the s p 500 rose 1 3 percent to recover more than half of its drop from friday which was its worst since february bond yields and crude oil also recovered chunks of what they lost in traders knee jerk reaction to run toward safety and away from risky investments with vaccines in hand and with the benefit of a weekend to mull whether friday s sharp market moves were overdone analysts said the world may be in better position to weather this newest potential wave plus friday s tumble for markets may have been exacerbated by many traders taking the day off after thanksgiving but while the market steadied itself uneasiness still hangs over it due to the discovery of the variant now known as omicron the variant appears to spread more easily and countries around the world have put up barriers to travel in hopes of stemming it still to be seen is how effective vaccines currently available are for the variant and how long it may take to develop new omicron specific vaccines there are still more questions than answers regarding the new variant said ryan detrick chief market strategist for lpl financial at the same time we ve been living with covid 19 for almost 20 months now and we ve seen multiple variants given the uncertainty the dow jones industrial average wavered between a loss of 3 points and a gain of 388 points through the day it ended with a gain of 236 60 points or 0 7 percent at 35 135 94 advertisement the most powerful lift for stocks came from those that have been able to grow strongly almost regardless of the economy s strength or pandemic s pall gains for five big tech oriented stocks microsoft tesla apple amazon and nvidia alone accounted for more than a third of the s p 500 s rise the gains for tech oriented stocks also helped to drive the nasdaq composite up a market leading 1 9 percent moderna jumped 11 8 percent for the biggest gain in the s p 500 adding to an even bigger gain from friday after it said it s testing the effectiveness of its vaccine against omicron its ceo said in a televised interview on abc that it could take two to three months for a vaccine developed specifically for the variant to begin manufacturing travel related stocks started the day with gains but fell back as more caution filtered into the market and as travel restrictions around the world remained in force they ended mixed after president biden said he wasn t considering a widespread u s lockdown he said the variant was a cause for concern and not a cause for panic delta air lines and american airlines closed slightly lower while cruise line operators carnival and norwegian cruise line notched gains all told the s p 500 rose 60 65 points to 4 655 27 while the nasdaq added 291 18 points to 15 782 83 the russell 2000 index of small companies was headed for its own rebound after climbing 1 6 percent in the early going but its gains faded by late afternoon the index slipped 3 96 points or 0 2 percent to 2 241 98 because so much is still unknown about the omicron variant it could take us a week or more to recover what we lost in a single day said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 1 51 percent from 1 49 percent late friday recovering some of its steep slide from 1 64 percent that day it tends to rise and fall with expectations for the economy s strength and for inflation advertisement the vix an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the s p 500 also eased significantly but it s not all the way back to where it was before omicron besides waiting on more clues about how much economic damage omicron will ultimately do the market has several big mileposts this week that could swing prices the headliner is likely friday s jobs report where economists expect to see an acceleration in hiring by employers during november omicron adds more risk to a global economy already contending with paralyzing uncertainty travel bans including recent decisions by japan and israel to bar foreign visitors threaten to disrupt global business global supply chains already gummed up by bottlenecks could be further ensnarled if outbreaks shut down factories ports and freight yards shipping problems would risk pushing prices higher adding to inflation pressures in response the world s central banks could raise interest rates and imperil the recovery from last year s brief but intense coronavirus recession omicron reinforces that the economy remains tethered to the pandemic mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said on twitter monday with each new wave of the pandemic the economy will suffer slower growth and higher inflation the u s economic recovery lost significant momentum when the highly contagious delta variant hit over the summer economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2 1 percent from july through september from 6 7 percent from april through june and 6 3 percent from january through march the s p 500 had its worst month of the year in september falling 4 8 percent still more americans are vaccinated now and the economy has shown resiliency regaining speed after the summer slowdown zandi tweeted that the most likely scenario is the economy will manage through each wave better than the one before it of course the only way to know which scenario will ultimately occur is to wait to see it through and that uncertainty in the meantime could lead to more up and down swings for the stock market which has surged more than 24 percent this year and set a record as recently as nov 18 we re just going to be in the dark for several weeks here lpl s detrick said send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
financial markets have been on a rollercoaster ride since the middle of last week we wanted to believe we were getting close to the end of covid but the latest jitters from omicron variant signaled the inevitable covid winter surge might already be here omicron is the latest covid test for the economic outlook and we won t have a clear picture until a couple more weeks friday s turmoil looked a lot worse given the lack of liquidity options volatility and overall frothy levels for equities us stocks are rebounding as optimism grows that the omicron variant is a cause for concern but not a cause for panic and could potentially be the catalyst needed to get more of the country vaccinated investors will learn over the next couple of weeks if the omicron variant causes more severe disease than the other variants so far the mrna vaccines have proved effective against other variants such as delta and optimism is that even they will eventually need to get tweaked that could be done in a few months time risk appetite got a boost from both the pfizer ceo and president biden calmed markets nerves that we won t go back to the darkest days of the pandemic the pfizer ceo bourla said he thinks the data will ultimately show the current vaccine will protect less against omicron but will likely still offer some protection president biden said the us won t need shutdowns to curb the omicron variant us data pending home sales unexpectedly surged in october as rents skyrocketed and buyers were highly motivated as borrowing costs seem poised to increase steadily as the fed positions itself to raise rates us pending homes sales increased by 7 5 from a month earlier which was a 10 month high the dallas fed manufacturing survey came in slightly below expectations but still showed manufacturing activity is healthy and the outlook has dramatically improved the index for general activity came in at 11 8 a miss of the 17 0 consensus estimate and drop from the 14 6 reading in october the six month outlook almost doubled to 28 6 while the raw materials price index hit a series high content is for general information purposes only it is not investment advice or a solution to buy or sell securities opinions are the authors not necessarily that of oanda business information services inc or any of its affiliates subsidiaries officers or directors if you would like to reproduce or redistribute any of the content found on marketpulse an award winning forex commodities and global indices analysis and news site service produced by oanda business information services inc please access the rss feed or contact us at info marketpulse com visit to find out more about the beat of the global markets 2023 oanda business information services inc

musk faces a much more favourable financial environment in texas the state has no state income tax or capital gains tax on individuals musk didn t respond to a request for comment musk who has a us296 billion fortune according to the bloomberg billionaires index has for years achieved a lower tax bill by borrowing against his tesla shares rather than selling them a december 2020 regulatory filing shows that various investment banks have lent him us515 million the number of shares he s pledged means he s potentially borrowed billions more before november the last time musk sold stock was in 2016 that s a pretty savvy planning technique because you can borrow forever and if you do it right you can extract value that s not taxable to you shaver said there s an interest charge on it but that s cheaper than the tax rate in the past month musk has unloaded almost us10 billion of tesla stock after an unusual twitter poll asking if he should sell part of his stake he would typically pay a 23 8 per cent rate that applies to long term capital gains that applies not on the entire amount but instead only on the gain on shares since he acquired them some of the shares being sold are the result of the exercise of options and have no capital gains component but he s sold about 5 4 million of shares that he already owned since tesla s stock price is up more than 1 500 per cent in the last two years and far far more since the company was founded in 2003 that means he ll owe 23 8 per cent on nearly the entire sale price of those shares that would come to at least us1 35 billion based on us5 8 billion of shares sold so far if musk sells a full 10 per cent of his stake excluding the options the total tax due could increase to about us4 35 billion based on tesla s current share price the total could be slightly lower if musk sells shares with a higher cost basis california would ordinarily tack an extra 13 3 per cent on his bill that would amount to us2 4 billion if musk hadn t exited the state the fact that the vast amount of tesla s gains occurred while he was a resident aren t relevant tesla will relocate head office operations from california to austin texas credit ap it s a blind spot in the tax system said cristobal young a cornell university sociology professor who studies taxes on the rich musk is basically shirking his tax responsibilities young said california provided access to the talent he needed to build the company governor gavin newsom has also touted california s role in musk s ascension saying that its history of innovation and policies promoting clean energy paved the way for tesla to become the behemoth it is today a spokesperson for the state s franchise tax board which oversees tax collections declined to comment saying the law prohibits it from disclosing confidential information about individual taxpayers escaping california s taxes isn t as simple as hopping on a private jet the rules take into account a variety of criteria taxpayers need to show they re actually cutting ties to the state while physically relocating themselves and demonstrating they intend to remain in the new locality permanently or indefinitely according to the tax board that s a complex analysis said christopher manes an attorney in palm springs who specialises in california tax residency issues if he s claiming he s a non resident obviously california has an incentive to audit him and find out a key issue is the length of time between an official move date and when a large transaction occurs taxpayers are generally advised to wait six months to a year or risk facing california s auditors for well over a year musk has been making moves that would bolster the case that he s now a texas resident after the

new york wall street steadied itself monday after last week s stock market slide caused by the newest coronavirus variant with investors now waiting for more clues about just how much damage it may do to the economy the s p 500 rose 1 3 percent to recover more than half of its drop from friday which was its worst since february bond yields and crude oil also recovered chunks of what they lost in traders knee jerk reaction to run toward safety and away from risky investments with vaccines in hand and with the benefit of a weekend to mull whether friday s sharp market moves were overdone analysts said the world may be in better position to weather this newest potential wave plus friday s tumble for markets may have been exacerbated by many traders taking the day off after thanksgiving but while the market steadied itself uneasiness still hangs over it due to the discovery of the variant now known as omicron the variant appears to spread more easily and countries around the world have put up barriers to travel in hopes of stemming it still to be seen is how effective vaccines currently available are for the variant and how long it may take to develop new omicron specific vaccines there are still more questions than answers regarding the new variant said ryan detrick chief market strategist for lpl financial at the same time we ve been living with covid 19 for almost 20 months now and we ve seen multiple variants given the uncertainty the dow jones industrial average wavered between a loss of 3 points and a gain of 388 points through the day it ended with a gain of 236 60 points or 0 7 percent at 35 135 94 advertisement the most powerful lift for stocks came from those that have been able to grow strongly almost regardless of the economy s strength or pandemic s pall gains for five big tech oriented stocks microsoft tesla apple amazon and nvidia alone accounted for more than a third of the s p 500 s rise the gains for tech oriented stocks also helped to drive the nasdaq composite up a market leading 1 9 percent moderna jumped 11 8 percent for the biggest gain in the s p 500 adding to an even bigger gain from friday after it said it s testing the effectiveness of its vaccine against omicron its ceo said in a televised interview on abc that it could take two to three months for a vaccine developed specifically for the variant to begin manufacturing travel related stocks started the day with gains but fell back as more caution filtered into the market and as travel restrictions around the world remained in force they ended

russell 2000 index of small companies was headed for its own rebound after climbing 1 6 percent in the early going but its gains faded by late afternoon the index slipped 3 96 points or 0 2 percent to 2 241 98 because so much is still unknown about the omicron variant it could take us a week or more to recover what we lost in a single day said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 1 51 percent from 1 49 percent late friday recovering some of its steep slide from 1 64 percent that day it tends to rise and fall with expectations for the economy s strength and for inflation advertisement the vix an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the s p 500 also eased significantly but it s not all the way back to where it was before omicron besides waiting on more clues about how much economic damage omicron will ultimately do the market has several big mileposts this week that could swing prices the headliner is likely friday s jobs report where economists expect to see an acceleration in hiring by employers during november omicron adds more risk to a global economy already contending with paralyzing uncertainty travel bans including recent decisions by japan and israel to bar foreign visitors threaten to disrupt global business global supply chains already gummed up by bottlenecks could be further ensnarled if outbreaks shut down factories ports and freight yards shipping problems would risk pushing prices higher adding to inflation pressures in response the world s central banks could raise interest rates and imperil the recovery from last year s brief but intense coronavirus recession omicron reinforces that the economy remains tethered to the pandemic mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said on twitter monday with each new wave of the pandemic the economy will suffer slower growth and higher inflation the u s economic recovery lost significant momentum when the highly contagious delta variant hit over the summer economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2 1 percent from july through september from 6 7 percent from april through june and 6 3 percent from january through march the s p 500 had its worst month of the year in september falling 4 8 percent still more americans are vaccinated now and the economy has shown resiliency regaining speed after the summer slowdown zandi tweeted that the most likely scenario is the economy will manage through each wave better than the one before it of course the only way to know which scenario will ultimately occur is to wait to see it through and that uncertainty in the meantime could lead to more up and down swings for the stock market which has surged more than 24 percent this year and

washington afp the omicron variant of covid 19 could slow the recovery of the us economy and labor market and also heighten uncertainty regarding inflation federal reserve chair jerome powell said in testimony released monday advertising read more powell has consistently said the recent spike in inflation would be transitory but acknowledged that the factors pushing us prices higher will linger well into next year the comments to be delivered to the senate banking committee on tuesday indicate the central bank chief is growing more concerned about this year s price increases which has put pressure on the central bank to raise interest rates more quickly the fed slashed interest rates to zero in the early days of the pandemic and flooded the financial system with liquidity which together with massive government aid helped to prevent a more damaging economic downturn while the us economy has continued to strengthen the resurgence of the pandemic has dragged on the recovery starting with the arrival of the delta variant over the summer he said the latest strain which first emerged in south africa has jolted global policy and health officials as they scramble to determine if omicron is more infectious or more serious and whether current vaccines will be as effective financial markets tanked on friday amid fears the global economy would suffer a severe setback but rebounded on monday the recent rise in covid 19 cases and the emergence of the omicron variant pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation powell said greater concerns about the virus could reduce people s willingness to work in person which would slow progress in the labor market and intensify supply chain disruptions those global snags have caused shortages of a variety of products while pent up demand for goods also have contributed to a burst of price hikes unpredictable inflation powell noted that inflation is running well above the fed s two percent goal with the central bank s preferred price gauge seeing a surge of five percent for the 12 months ending in october supply chain problems have made it difficult for producers to meet strong demand particularly for goods increases in energy prices and rents are also pushing inflation upward he said while the fed still expects that inflation will move down significantly over the next year as supply and demand imbalances abate powell acknowledged the trend is difficult to predict noting that rising prices hurt those least able to shoulder the burden including black and hispanic families he pledged to act to support the recovery and prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched the fed already has begun to pull back on its stimulus measures put in place to buffer the economy from the pandemic hit but powell has said policymakers can be patient before raising lending rates however more fed officials have signaled rates could be raised from zero in the middle of 2022 and possibly be followed by a second increase some private economists are predicting three hikes next year eviscerate the recovery treasury secretary janet yellen who is due to testify in the senate alongside powell said the us recovery is on track with hiring averaging half a million positions per month since the start of the year but she warned lawmakers that failing to raise the us debt limit would undermine that progress us treasury secretary janet yellen warns failing to raise the us debt limit will eviscerate the economic recovery al drago pool afp file i cannot overstate how critical it is that congress address this issue america must pay its bills on time and in full if we do not we will eviscerate our current recovery she said in her prepared testimony yellen earlier this month said the treasury will run out of funds on december 15 unless congress raises or suspends the cap on borrowing 2021 afp

cause for panic monday and said he was not considering any widespread u s lockdown he urged americans anew to get fully vaccinated including booster shots and return to face masks indoors in public settings to slow any spread speaking monday at the white house biden said it was inevitable that the new variant would reach the u s but he also said the country has the tools necessary to protect americans particularly the approved vaccines and booster shots when omicron arrives and it will biden said america will face this new threat just as we ve faced those that have come before it he appealed to the roughly 80 million unvaccinated americans aged 5 and up to get their shots and for the rest of the country to seek out booster shots six months after their second dose he also encouraged everyone to get back to wearing face masks in all indoor public settings a pandemic precaution that has fallen out of use across much of the country separately the centers for disease control and prevention broadened its recommendation for covid 19 booster shots to include all adults because of the new variant the agency had previously approved boosters for all adults but only recommended them for those 50 years and older or living in long term care settings everyone ages 18 and older should get a booster shot either when they are six months after their initial pfizer or moderna series or two months after their initial j j vaccine cdc director dr rochelle walensky said in a statement biden was joined by dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert and the president s covid 19 adviser who said earlier monday that scientists hope to know in the next week or two how well the existing covid 19 vaccines protect against the variant and how dangerous it is compared to earlier strains we really don t know fauci told abc s good morning america calling speculation premature the new variant poses the latest test to biden s efforts to contain the pandemic mitigate its impacts on the economy and return a sense of normalcy to the u s during the holiday season this variant is a cause for concern not a cause for panic biden said as u s financial markets rebounded monday after falling sharply on friday the white house said there were no plans to curtail biden s travel as a result of the new variant dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases speaks on capitol hill nov 4 in washington d c biden will not immediately push for more restrictions to stop the spread of the omicron covid 19 variant his chief medical adviser said photo alex brandon associated press biden last week moved to restrict travel from south africa and seven other countries in southern africa effective monday in a bid to give scientists time to learn more about the new variant and for more americans to get vaccinated before it hits the u s south african officials have argued they are being punished for speedily identifying and reporting the new variant as omicron spreads across the globe white house press secretary jen psaki said monday we will continue to assess what steps we need to take to protect the american people some other nations are reinstating severe travel and business lockdowns to prevent the omicron variant from spreading but biden indicated the u s was not following suit if people are vaccinated and wear their mask there s no need for lockdowns he said fauci said earlier on cbs mornings that limiting travel from the countries where omicron was first identified buys you a couple of weeks because if you can keep things out in force for a couple of weeks you can do a lot of things pharmaceutical companies are already adjusting their existing covid 19 vaccines to better attack the omicron variant but fauci said americans should make it a priority to get either their first shots or a booster dose now rather than waiting for a new formulation i would strongly suggest you get boosted now he said he added that depending on what scientists learn about the omicron variant in the coming weeks we may not need targeted boosters to contain that strain of the virus biden said his administration was sparing no effort at removing all roadblocks to keep the american people safe including working with drug manufacturers on potential new boosters and testing targeted specifically at the new variant any omicron specific vaccine probably could not begin to be produced for another two or three months so getting boosters now is a very important initial line of defense dr paul burton chief medical officer for the vaccine maker moderna said monday burton said moderna and other vaccine companies are testing existing covid 19 vaccines to determine how effective they are against the omicron variant if we need to manufacture an omicron specific variant it s going to take some weeks two to three months is probably what we re looking at to be able to really begin to manufacture burton told abc noting that the new variant like earlier ones sprang up overseas in areas with lower vaccination rates biden said it was both a moral imperative and in america s self interest to speed up global vaccinations he noted that the u s has already donated more than 275 million doses more than the rest of the world combined and is on pace to deliver more than 1 1 billion doses globally by september 2022 now we need the rest of the world to step up as well biden said we can t let up until the world is vaccinated as the holiday season got underway biden tried to reassure shoppers that his administration was working to ease supply chain problems businesses are working to overcome lingering effects of covid related shutdowns and now issues arising from the strong recovery that has generated more demand than many ports manufacturers and retailers can handle the president spoke monday with the ceos of best buy food lion samsung etsy and walmart among companies the corporate leaders reassured biden while we re all concerned about the supply chain we have more inventory than we did a year ago and we have the inventory that we need to be able to support the business said walmart ceo doug mcmillon and we are seeing progress the port and transit delays are improving

by andrew moran president joe biden is locked in on a collision course with the global energy sector mainly america s oil and gas behemoths and the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec the president may not have realized but he has fired an opening salvo in his war on fossil fuels leading to a showdown with big oil and the cartel the collateral damage in this battle will be of course the consumer who has been decimated by skyrocketing price inflation this year the economics of crude has been widely discussed but what about the political fallout from the latest announcement biden off more than he can chew overall many parties are doubtful that this will achieve much in the long run in fact it might lead to more geopolitical chaos than savings at the pump or on household heating bills while the media championed a u s china diplomatic victory washington could be at odds with saudi arabia and other opec nations this may not have mattered if the u s sustained its energy independence but now that president biden has undermined this accomplishment by canceling pipelines and discouraging investment and production the oval office may need to tread carefully moving forward the white house confirmed that it would release 50 million barrels from the nation s half century old strategic petroleum reserve spr the decision sparked laughter in the financial markets since it already included 18 million barrels that were authorized for auction and will be given to india and china market analysts also pointed out that the u s consumes between 18 and 20 million barrels of oil per day a fact that energy secretary jennifer granholm was unaware of so the move will only power the nation for about three days plus the administration conceded that the measure would not achieve much to ease prices substantially calling it a bridge to lower gasoline prices next month opec and its allies opec will be holding a ministerial meeting before the president s announcement it was anticipated to be a mundane meeting that would only reaffirm their commitment to pumping out approximately 400 000 barrels per day however with the spr release in the spotlight there is widespread speculation that these oil rich countries could choose to cut output effectively offsetting the expected gains of injecting global energy markets with additional supply and canceling out any potential savings from the tactic ipek ozkardeskaya a senior analyst at swissquote stated in a research note to clients obviously such news doesn t necessarily scare opec but it probably frustrates them the expectation is that they will hit back at their meeting next week and their decision will have an impact longer than a couple of days or weeks this is probably why we are seeing the oil bulls coming back to the market and yes there is a chance now that we see the 80 offers cleared and a push above that level into next week s opec meeting the only thing that joe could do at this point is to pray for opec to not hit back too strong because if they decided to cut supply for a couple of weeks joe s oil reserves would be very quickly down and once again opec would return to the driver s seat of the international oil markets indeed opec can endure the multilateral strategy to unleash global strategic reserves because they understand this is a swap and governments will need to replenish these reserves suffice it to say opec will be paid to replace the oil dumped on the market make the entity not the consumer the primary beneficiary the politics and the economics of the spr decision do not bode well for the biden administration but what about the consumer will motorists start seeing lower prices at gasoline stations brace yourselves savings are coming in december the price will be about 3 19 a gallon and then in january it s going to go down the energy secretary projected during a white house press briefing on nov 23 but one of two things are likely to unfold experts say the first is that the supply injection will shave a few pennies off of a gallon of gasoline the second is that nothing will happen at all because the stockpile withdrawal will be in crude barrels meaning that refineries many of which have already acquired their oil stocks for december will need to ramp up gasoline output in the end strategists are still penciling in higher oil and gasoline prices in 2022 alluding to structural problems and strengthening global demand many believe a barrel of oil will top 100 by the summer and others forecast that a gallon of gasoline could reach 6 by the next busy driving season did president biden create this mess of course not is he pouring kerosene on the inflationary fire most definitely but it is the american people who face the consequences of asinine policymaking this was originally published on liberty nation like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here

musk faces a much more favourable financial environment in texas the state has no state income tax or capital gains tax on individuals musk didn t respond to a request for comment musk who has a us296 billion fortune according to the bloomberg billionaires index has for years achieved a lower tax bill by borrowing against his tesla shares rather than selling them a december 2020 regulatory filing shows that various investment banks have lent him us515 million the number of shares he s pledged means he s potentially borrowed billions more before november the last time musk sold stock was in 2016 that s a pretty savvy planning technique because you can borrow forever and if you do it right you can extract value that s not taxable to you shaver said there s an interest charge on it but that s cheaper than the tax rate in the past month musk has unloaded almost us10 billion of tesla stock after an unusual twitter poll asking if he should sell part of his stake he would typically pay a 23 8 per cent rate that applies to long term capital gains that applies not on the entire amount but instead only on the gain on shares since he acquired them some of the shares being sold are the result of the exercise of options and have no capital gains component but he s sold about 5 4 million of shares that he already owned since tesla s stock price is up more than 1 500 per cent in the last two years and far far more since the company was founded in 2003 that means he ll owe 23 8 per cent on nearly the entire sale price of those shares that would come to at least us1 35 billion based on us5 8 billion of shares sold so far if musk sells a full 10 per cent of his stake excluding the options the total tax due could increase to about us4 35 billion based on tesla s current share price the total could be slightly lower if musk sells shares with a higher cost basis california would ordinarily tack an extra 13 3 per cent on his bill that would amount to us2 4 billion if musk hadn t exited the state the fact that the vast amount of tesla s gains occurred while he was a resident aren t relevant tesla will relocate head office operations from california to austin texas credit ap it s a blind spot in the tax system said cristobal young a cornell university sociology professor who studies taxes on the rich musk is basically shirking his tax responsibilities young said california provided access to the talent he needed to build the company governor gavin newsom has also touted california s role in musk s ascension saying that its history of innovation and policies promoting clean energy paved the way for tesla to become the behemoth it is today a spokesperson for the state s franchise tax board which oversees tax collections declined to comment saying the law prohibits it from disclosing confidential information about individual taxpayers escaping california s taxes isn t as simple as hopping on a private jet the rules take into account a variety of criteria taxpayers need to show they re actually cutting ties to the state while physically relocating themselves and demonstrating they intend to remain in the new locality permanently or indefinitely according to the tax board that s a complex analysis said christopher manes an attorney in palm springs who specialises in california tax residency issues if he s claiming he s a non resident obviously california has an incentive to audit him and find out a key issue is the length of time between an official move date and when a large transaction occurs taxpayers are generally advised to wait six months to a year or risk facing california s auditors for well over a year musk has been making moves that would bolster the case that he s now a texas resident after the billionaire listed four of his bel air homes in may 2020 for us62 5 million a los angeles developer ardie tavangarian announced that he d reached an agreement to buy them the transaction took almost six months to close property records show they were transferred on december17 the records also show that musk personally stepped in as a lender on the transaction providing tavangarian s company the full purchase price in fact musk lent us62 3 million while the properties were sold for us61 9 million loading tavangarian didn t respond to multiple requests for comment a fifth bel air property sold for us7 million in october it too was financed by musk who provided a us6 7 million loan to the purchaser another was sold in june in an all cash transaction a home in the san francisco bay area took longer to offload but musk never listed it as his personal address musk can t totally escape his tax obligations to the golden state those options he exercised if treated as compensation and subject to ordinary income taxes california would generally still have a right to tax whatever was earned before he moved probably the bulk of the options that s because the options are treated much like salary as income paid to musk for his work at tesla but the timing of the exercise of the options could also be designed to reduce taxes if he waited until august next year when the options expire he runs the risk of incurring additional taxes included in the latest version of the democrats build back better act the legislation approved by the house of representatives on november 19 would create a new 8 per cent surcharge on income above us25 million for now musk has been building an empire in tax friendly texas and the billionaire appears to have held up his earlier twitter vow he has said he s living in a us50 000 house a rental bloomberg

caution the who said the recent spike of cases in south africa driven by omicron has raised concerns about increased transmissibilty and hospitalization rates but there is no conclusive evidence the omicron variant was any worse than other variants of covid 19 already are preliminary evidence shows omicron presents an increased risk of reinfection and that people who have previously had covid 19 could become reinfected more easily with omicron the who said when the two ontario cases of the new variant arrived from nigeria by plane into montreal s airport last week it was only a random testing program that identified them by which point they had travelled onward to ottawa where they remain in isolation according to ontario s chief medical officer of health dr kieran moore that suggests the new variant of concern is already in circulation in canada as other countries have similarly been discovering including cases in scotland with no link to travel and in australia and many other countries in western europe in addition to southern africa moore urged the federal government to broaden the testing of returning travellers at airports advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content u s president joe biden did not reveal any positive tests in america but made remarks calling omicron a cause for concern not a cause for panic in ontario moore called this new variant a nasty formidable foe with a worrying genetic profile that suggests increased transmissibility and said efforts are underway with federal counterparts to increase polymerase chain reaction pcr testing that reveals the genetics of a virus rather than just a positive negative result this is key to tracking different variants we were fortunate to pick up these two cases given that it was part of a random testing moore said hundreds of people have recently returned from the seven southern african countries that canada last week placed under a flight ban and efforts are being made to track them down for testing under the federal quarantine act these two ottawa cases are being monitored very closely moore said in a monday morning media briefing we are investigating other cases and i would not be surprised if we found more in ontario he said four other suspect cases are awaiting whole genome sequencing two in ottawa and two in hamilton advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content moore said he knows the news about this new variant feels concerning but he pointed to the robust testing system as reason for reassurance to me the system s working he said we would just like to see it expanded south african authorities made the same point in announcing their discovery of this new variant earlier this month knowing it was risking discrimination in the global response but erring on the side of transparency moore said it has likely been in global circulation for many many weeks if not months the delta variant which accounts for nearly all current cases in canada took three or four months to become dominant after the first detected case he said omicron might take less time given initial reports about its enhanced transmissibility due to mutations in spike proteins that help the virus enter cells the crucial public health question is whether it is more virulent whether the sickness is worse early reports have suggested this is not the case and that it may even be more mild than other variants of concern but that monitoring is in its very early days the next few weeks will be critical to determining whether this new variant has an impact on hospital numbers if it does not ontario s current strategy will continue moore said he said ontario is well equipped and able to respond to emerging new variants including this one and others that inevitably arise in a global population due to the fundamental

big fall on wall street in a very thin holiday abbreviated session that drew immediate overdone calls the 100 point fall in our futures on the saturday looked too much like a double up to be accurate and so it was the asx200 opened down 100 points yesterday and ten minutes later was rallying sharply to be back to square by 1pm then in came the johnny come latelies who were too slow to move on friday and those still in panic mode to ensure another weak session for the index it s still very early days for omicron but already there are suggestions it could be a godsend as one medico put it rather than another lockdown inducing deadly variant if indeed it results in only mild symptoms and if indeed it can muscle out delta then even if it is more contagious it means the virus is heading along the right path thus are more lockdowns necessary politicians simply don t have the stomach for them dan andrews must have a very depressing weekend well australian investors are assuming lockdowns on friday a 1 0 fall for reits was one of the better performances on the day yesterday another 1 4 was the worst sector performance alongside energy 1 4 taking a 5 5 drop for eml payments eml out of the mix which follows a 30 pop last week four of the top five index losers yesterday were retail reits or in gpt group s gpt case a mixed reit including retail this suggests australians will once again not be getting out to malls and they won t be driving anywhere see energy and this will bring about more job losses mortgage foreclosures and business failures and the rba will have to stop tapering financials fell another 1 1 on top of friday s big fall we ll be back to shopping online and ordering food online so consumer discretionary fell only 0 3 and domino s pizza dmp rallied 4

otherwise materials was the best performer on the day 0 7 after commodities prices crashed left right and centre on friday night but friday s sell down had anticipated such and metal prices bounced last night technology rose 0 6 to be the only other sector winner with utilities flat wall street came surging back overnight as expected but here we re still sceptical the futures are only up 41 points this morning which would not yet eat into friday s losses rinse and repeat president biden assured americans last night omicron won t lead to any shutdowns or lockdowns state wise it s not his call to make but then delta hasn t brought about any lockdowns either and is still running riot i noted yesterday that every time the nasdaq has taken a tumble this year it s not long before the buyers move into the tech mega caps at a better price had they been there on friday night they may have been tempted but they were all at home eating turkey sandwiches so last night the nasdaq rallied 1 9 to friday night s 2 2 fall helping the s p500 back up 1 3 against 2 3 the dow only managed to wipe 200 points off friday s near 1000 point fall so in a wider market context wall street also remains tentative it s now a watch and wait situation the big question being will the current vaccines protect against omicron or do we need new ones both pfizer and moderna believe they can have initial trials completed in one two weeks biden s policy for fighting covid in the northern winter is one of vaccines boosters and testing not lockdowns medicos believe omicron may be the first step in what has long been suspected covid will not go away it will just become another seasonal standard like the flu to which it is related mild symptoms and maybe yearly variants requiring yearly shots which is good news for the likes of moderna which rose another 11 last night on top of friday night s 20 it is possible markets could go rather quiet from here until more is known but confidence will

defense attorneys wrapped up their questioning of theranos founder elizabeth holmes on monday her fourth day on the stand holmes gave emotional testimony accusing theranos ex president ramesh sunny balwani of physical and psychological abuse prosecutors now get their opportunity to cross examine holmes who is facing 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud san jose calif in emotional and at times tearful testimony monday theranos founder elizabeth holmes accused ex boyfriend ramesh sunny balwani who was also the company s president of a pattern of physical and psychological abuse including forced sex holmes 37 took the stand for her fourth and final day of questioning by her defense attorneys with the prosecution next up in what s sure to be a heated cross examination holmes faces 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for her role at the blood testing company which collapsed in 2018 a few years after being valued at 9 billion get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters while holmes mentioned balwani dozens of times in her prior three days of testimony the topic of abuse didn t come up until monday afternoon as the defense homed in on a central claim it made just ahead of the trial her attorneys wrote then that holmes suffered a decade long campaign of psychological abuse at the hands of balwani holmes told jurors on monday that for the decade they were together balwani persistently criticized her work ethic mediocrity as an entrepreneur and the fact that she came across as a little girl physical abuse would follow she said he would get very angry with me and then he would sometimes come upstairs to our bedroom and force me to have sex with him when i didn t want to because he wanted me to know that he still loved me said holmes occasionally fighting back tears when asked how balwani s behavior affected her relationship with her family holmes said it was particularly damaging i saw them less than i d ever seen them before and i spoke to them less than i had ever spoke to them before she said because i was trying to focus all of my time on the company sunny would get very upset if i was with my family he said it was a distraction to the business jeffrey coopersmith balwani s attorney declined to comment michael short bloomberg getty images during the trial s first 11 weeks the prosecution called to the stand former lab directors patients doctors business partners and investors as well as journalist roger parloff who wrote the 2014 fortune magazine cover story this ceo is out for blood the prosecution rested on nov 19 and later that day the defense surprised the courtroom in calling holmes as a witness the stanford university dropout and former silicon valley wunderkind could spend up to two decades in prison if she s convicted she has pleaded not guilty balwani who s 19 years older than holmes faces the same charges and will be on trial at a later date he has also pleaded not guilty holmes started theranos in 2003 balwani joined six years later and until his departure in 2016 served as holmes second in command in testimony last week holmes said balwani was in charge of operating the company s labs and handling financial projections holmes told jurors on monday that she met balwani in china she said she was 18 at the time and he was 38 i understood that he d been a really successful business person that he worked with bill gates in the early days of microsoft holmes said i talked to him about wanting to start a company and a company that i tried to build in high school and i asked for his advice while she was studying at stanford the following school year holmes said balwani would email her holmes dropped out of stanford her sophomore year to work on the company that became theranos kevin downey holmes attorney asked if there were other reasons she left stanford i was raped a crying holmes said police agencies told cnbc they had no record of a report under holmes name she was then asked about the affect that experience had on her life i was questioning what how i was going to be able to process that experience and what i was going to do with my life she said and i decided i was going to build a life by building this company downey asked holmes whether she talked to balwani about the incident holmes said she did and that he said that i was safe now that i had met him during the prosecution s case holmes was painted by a series of witnesses as theranos undisputed leader and the person singularly responsible for all of its key decisions she picked board members met with investors and arranged business meetings with potential partners i needed to kill the person i was while she acknowledged in her answers to the defense that some of her behavior was possibly problematic such as adding drugmaker logos to theranos lab reports holmes insisted that she didn t intend to mislead patients or investors now holmes is asking jurors to believe that for at least a decade of that time she was under the influence of balwani he told me i didn t know what i was doing in business that my convictions were wrong that he was astonished at my mediocrity that if i followed my instincts i was going to fail and that i needed to kill the person i was to become what he called a new elizabeth that could be a successful entrepreneur holmes said she added that balwani insisted that she work seven days a week if she wanted to be successful and that she only spend time with people who can help with the business he would tell me not to sleep much eat only foods that would make me pure and would make me have the most energy possible in the company she said downey read a text from balwani to holmes dated nov 30 2013 that said when ur family is here i feel very lonely holmes provided the jury with the backdrop for the text he s angry with me because he felt when my family came for thanksgiving he felt neglected she said this is one of the nights where he crying came upstairs and did things to me that i didn t want and hurt me downey asked holmes if she sometimes took notes after sunny forced intercourse with you holmes said she did and referenced a note from february 2015 she said that in the note i m reacting to one of those incidents and i m writing about the fact that i couldn t move and couldn t sit up and that i was lying there swollen and i couldn t understand why i was hurting myself why i wasn t leaving she added he had taught me everything that i thought i knew about business and i thought he was the best business person i knew i think that i didn t question him in a way that i otherwise would have holmes said her view started to change in 2016 that s when the centers for medicare and medicaid services came in for an inspection after a series of stories from the wall street journal exposed theranos false promises and technological deficiencies i had gone into that inspection thinking that we had one of the best labs in the world and the findings from that inspection were so fundamentally different than what i had believed holmes said she said that following the failed inspection she hired two lab directors and brought in other lab experts all to the dismay of balwani who left the company soon after those decisions he wasn t who i thought he was holmes said and i realized if i was going to fix the issues and allow the company to see through its potential i had to do that without him in the company still holmes said in response to a series of questions by her attorney that balwani didn t force her to make any statements to investors business partners or journalists about theranos downey asked what impact if any did your relationship with mr balwani have on your work at theranos i don t know she said he impacted everything about who i was and i don t fully understand that at the close of downey s questioning holmes was asked about the value of the company she said it had been worth 9 billion holmes owned 50 giving her a net worth of about 4 5 billion she said matching the value ascribed to her by forbes magazine in 2015 a year later those shares were worthless holmes told downey that she had a chance to sell her stock to new investors who were connected to various board members when asked if she ever sold she said no i didn t want to holmes said i believed in the company and i wanted to put everything that i had into it do those shares have any value now downey asked no holmes said the court went into recess shortly before 4 p m california time the government s cross examination will begin tuesday morning holmes attempted to make eye contact with each of the jurors as they filed out of the courtroom most did not look at her correction balwani is 19 years older than holmes an earlier version misstated the age difference watch

although cyber monday which encourages people to flock online for deals after black friday is meant to be the year s biggest day for online shopping some factors this year led observers to wonder whether it would rake in as much revenue as expected for retailers this cyber monday consumers are expected to spend between 10 2 billion and 11 3 billion which would still make it the biggest online shopping day of the year according to adobe which maintains the adobe digital economy index that tracks online holiday spending supply chain issues which led to customers buying earlier this year and to fewer discounts could make cyber monday anti climactic even acknowledging these issues it will probably be a pretty strong cyber monday said gabriella santaniello founder of retail research firm a line partners based in los angeles what could the numbers from cyber monday look like and what is the best strategy for people looking to find deals crowds pack woodfield mall in schaumburg for black friday holiday shopping on nov 26 2021 supply chain problems and early shopping the phrase supply chain is being used more and more and for good reason according to paula rosenblum co founder and managing partner at rsr research a retail technology research firm supply chain is really a big deal rosenblum said pandemic related shortages leading to less space in container shippings and fewer workers as well as truck driver shortages have caused shipping prices to double as a result news of product supply shortages has prompted people to buy things earlier from the consumer s perspective there has been an expressed feeling of if i want it i d better go get it said rosenblum the fact that people started shopping earlier in the year just spreads the sales out she said the prime day for shopping happened in october rosenblum said meaning that there is now less of a sense of urgency when it comes to cyber monday many people have either already bought what they wanted or they re planning to buy gift cards for use after holiday shopping has died down and supply chain issues are resolved she said a shrewd consumer will buy gift cards rosenblum said the pandemic and omicron a new variant this year s spending on black friday and thanksgiving were lower than expected according to adobe s report this marks the first time we have seen decreased spending on the big shopping days since 2012 according to the adobe report one contributing factor according to rsr research s rosenblum was news of the new covid 19 variant omicron which hit at the worst possible time at a time when you wanted people to be out shopping and feeling good about the future planning trips people were incentivized to hold onto their money in case of another lockdown she said drumming up demand but retailers are employing strategies to increase consumers motivation to shop according to a line partners santaniello some refrained from running promotions over the weekend and instead ran them on monday to make it seem like a bigger deal said santaniello others started their black friday promotions early feeding into consumers desire to buy early in anticipation of low stock by the time black friday rolled around there was this perception that we were going to get to thanksgiving and there was going to be nothing santaniello said but this turned out to not be the case largely because of efforts by retailers to spend more money on airfreighting and logistics to bring their products into stores according to santaniello the move was unappealing to investors because it lowered stock prices but good for consumers because it brought more inventory into stores she said santaniello said retailers could be offsetting increased costs by offering less free shipping she said she is interested to see what the final retail profits look like after cyber monday as online profits are usually lower than from in store sales specific products and best deals for cyber monday according to adobe s report people looking to find deals are most likely to find them on tvs which are discounted by 16 apparel marked down 15 computers by 14 appliances by 8 furniture and bedding reduced by 4 and sporting goods marked down by 9 certain products clearly have been affected by supply chain problems santaniello said an example is outerwear which usually appears like clockwork in october when the weather begins to turn cold but instead came in at more of a trickle this year you could tell there were issues she said the associated press contributed jyan chicagotribune com
musk faces a much more favourable financial environment in texas the state has no state income tax or capital gains tax on individuals musk didn t respond to a request for comment musk who has a us296 billion fortune according to the bloomberg billionaires index has for years achieved a lower tax bill by borrowing against his tesla shares rather than selling them a december 2020 regulatory filing shows that various investment banks have lent him us515 million the number of shares he s pledged means he s potentially borrowed billions more before november the last time musk sold stock was in 2016 that s a pretty savvy planning technique because you can borrow forever and if you do it right you can extract value that s not taxable to you shaver said there s an interest charge on it but that s cheaper than the tax rate in the past month musk has unloaded almost us10 billion of tesla stock after an unusual twitter poll asking if he should sell part of his stake he would typically pay a 23 8 per cent rate that applies to long term capital gains that applies not on the entire amount but instead only on the gain on shares since he acquired them some of the shares being sold are the result of the exercise of options and have no capital gains component but he s sold about 5 4 million of shares that he already owned since tesla s stock price is up more than 1 500 per cent in the last two years and far far more since the company was founded in 2003 that means he ll owe 23 8 per cent on nearly the entire sale price of those shares that would come to at least us1 35 billion based on us5 8 billion of shares sold so far if musk sells a full 10 per cent of his stake excluding the options the total tax due could increase to about us4 35 billion based on tesla s current share price the total could be slightly lower if musk sells shares with a higher cost basis california would ordinarily tack an extra 13 3 per cent on his bill that would amount to us2 4 billion if musk hadn t exited the state the fact that the vast amount of tesla s gains occurred while he was a resident aren t relevant tesla will relocate head office operations from california to austin texas credit ap it s a blind spot in the tax system said cristobal young a cornell university sociology professor who studies taxes on the rich musk is basically shirking his tax responsibilities young said california provided access to the talent he needed to build the company governor gavin newsom has also touted california s role in musk s ascension saying that its history of innovation and policies promoting clean energy paved the way for tesla to become the behemoth it is today a spokesperson for the state s franchise tax board which oversees tax collections declined to comment saying the law prohibits it from disclosing confidential information about individual taxpayers escaping california s taxes isn t as simple as hopping on a private jet the rules take into account a variety of criteria taxpayers need to show they re actually cutting ties to the state while physically relocating themselves and demonstrating they intend to remain in the new locality permanently or indefinitely according to the tax board that s a complex analysis said christopher manes an attorney in palm springs who specialises in california tax residency issues if he s claiming he s a non resident obviously california has an incentive to audit him and find out a key issue is the length of time between an official move date and when a large transaction occurs taxpayers are generally advised to wait six months to a year or risk facing california s auditors for well over a year musk has been making moves that would bolster the case that he s now a texas resident after the billionaire listed four of his bel air homes in may 2020 for us62 5 million a los angeles developer ardie tavangarian announced that he d reached an agreement to buy them the transaction took almost six months to close property records show they were transferred on december17 the records also show that musk personally stepped in as a lender on the transaction providing tavangarian s company the full purchase price in fact musk lent us62 3 million while the properties were sold for us61 9 million loading tavangarian didn t respond to multiple requests for comment a fifth bel air property sold for us7 million in october it too was financed by musk who provided a us6 7 million loan to the purchaser another was sold in june in an all cash transaction a home in the san francisco bay area took longer to offload but musk never listed it as his personal address musk can t totally escape his tax obligations to the golden state those options he exercised if treated as compensation and subject to ordinary income taxes california would generally still have a right to tax whatever was earned before he moved probably the bulk of the options that s because the options are treated much like salary as income paid to musk for his work at tesla but the timing of the exercise of the options could also be designed to reduce taxes if he waited until august next year when the options expire he runs the risk of incurring additional taxes included in the latest version of the democrats build back better act the legislation approved by the house of representatives on november 19 would create a new 8 per cent surcharge on income above us25 million for now musk has been building an empire in tax friendly texas and the billionaire appears to have held up his earlier twitter vow he has said he s living in a us50 000 house a rental bloomberg

bond yields and crude oil also recovered chunks of friday s knee jerk reaction to run toward safety and away from risky investments wall street is steadying itself monday from last week s slide caused by the newest coronavirus variant as investors wait for more clues about just how much damage it may do to the economy the s p 500 was 1 6 higher in afternoon trading to recover more than two thirds of its drop from friday which was its worst since february bond yields and crude oil also clawed back chunks of their losses from friday when investors impulse was to run toward safety and away from risky investments with vaccines in hand and with the benefit of a weekend to mull whether friday s sharp market moves were overdone analysts said the world may be in better position to weather this newest potential wave plus friday s tumble for markets may have been exacerbated by many traders taking the day off following thanksgiving but while the market was steadying itself caution was still hanging over the market due to the discovery of the variant now known as omicron the variant appears to spread more easily and countries around the world have put up barriers to travel in hopes of stemming it still to be seen is how effective vaccines currently available are for the variant and how long it may take to develop new omicron specific vaccines there are still more questions than answers regarding the new variant said ryan detrick chief market strategist for lpl financial at the same time we ve been living with covid 19 for almost 20 months now and we ve seen multiple variants given the uncertainty the dow jones industrial average wavered between a loss of 3 points and a gain of 388 points through the day it was most recently up 343 points or 1 at 35 242 as of 1 p m eastern time the most powerful lift for stocks came from those that have been able to grow strongly almost regardless of the economy s strength or pandemic s pall gains for five big tech oriented stocks microsoft tesla apple amazon and nvidia alone accounted for more than a third of the s p 500 s rise the gains for tech oriented stocks also helped to drive the nasdaq composite up a market leading 2 1 moderna jumped 10 2 for the biggest gain in the s p 500 adding onto an even bigger gain from friday after it said it s testing the effectiveness of its vaccine against omicron its ceo said in a televised interview on abc that it could take two to three months for a vaccine developed specifically for the variant to begin manufacturing travel related stocks started the day with gains but fell back as more caution filtered into the market and as travel restrictions around the world remained in force but they rose once again after president joe biden said he wasn t considering a widespread u s lockdown he said the variant was a cause for concern and not a cause for panic that also gave some broad reassurance to investors worried that a clampdown on the virus could leave the economy as collateral damage the small stocks in the russell 2000 index for example rose 0 9 after erasing a 0 6 loss from earlier in the day it had been up as much as 1 6 early in the morning the yield on the 10 year treasury climbed to 1 52 from 1 49 late friday recovering a slice of its steep slide from 1 64 that day it tends to rise and fall with expectations for the economy s strength and for inflation the vix an index that measures how worried investors are about upcoming drops for the s p 500 also eased significantly but it s not all the way back to where it was before omicron besides waiting on more clues about how much economic damage omicron will ultimately do the market has several big mileposts this week that could swing prices the headliner is likely friday s jobs report where economists expect to see an acceleration in hiring by employers during november omicron adds more risk to a global economy already contending with paralyzing uncertainty travel bans including recent decisions by japan and israel to bar foreign visitors threaten to disrupt global business global supply chains already gummed up by bottlenecks could be further ensnarled if outbreaks shut down factories ports and freight yards shipping problems would risk pushing prices higher adding to inflation pressures in response the world s central banks could raise interest rates and imperil the recovery from last year s brief but intense coronavirus recession omicron reinforces that the economy remains tethered to the pandemic mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said on twitter monday with each new wave of the pandemic the economy will suffer slower growth and higher inflation the u s economic recovery lost significant momentum when the highly contagious delta variant hit over the summer economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 2 1 from july through september from 6 7 from april through june and 6 3 from january through march the s p 500 had its worst onth of the year in september falling 4 8 still more americans are vaccinated now and the economy has shown resiliency regaining speed after the summer slowdown zandi tweeted that the most likely scenario is the economy will manage through each wave better than the one before it of course the only way to know which scenario will ultimately occur is to wait to see it through and that uncertainty in the meantime could lead to more up and down swings for the stock market which has surged more than 24 this year and set a record as recently as nov 18

defense attorneys wrapped up their questioning of theranos founder elizabeth holmes on monday her fourth day on the stand holmes gave emotional testimony accusing theranos ex president ramesh sunny balwani of physical and psychological abuse prosecutors now get their opportunity to cross examine holmes who is facing 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud san jose calif in emotional and at times tearful testimony monday theranos founder elizabeth holmes accused ex boyfriend ramesh sunny balwani who was also the company s president of a pattern of physical and psychological abuse including forced sex holmes 37 took the stand for her fourth and final day of questioning by her defense attorneys with the prosecution next up in what s sure to be a heated cross examination holmes faces 11 counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for her role at the blood testing company which collapsed in 2018 a few years after being valued at 9 billion get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters while holmes mentioned balwani dozens of times in her prior three days of testimony the topic of abuse didn t come up until monday afternoon as the defense homed in on a central claim it made just ahead of the trial her attorneys wrote then that holmes suffered a decade long campaign of psychological abuse at the hands of balwani holmes told jurors on monday that for the decade they were together balwani persistently criticized her work ethic mediocrity as an entrepreneur and the fact that she came across as a little girl physical abuse would follow she said he would get very angry with me and then he would sometimes come upstairs to our bedroom and force me to have sex with him when i didn t want to because he wanted me to know that he still loved me said holmes occasionally fighting back tears when asked how balwani s behavior affected her relationship with her family holmes said it was particularly damaging i saw them less than i d ever seen them before and i spoke to them less than i had ever spoke to them before she said because i was trying to focus all of my time on the company sunny would get very upset if i was with my family he said it was a distraction to the business jeffrey coopersmith balwani s attorney declined to comment michael short bloomberg getty images during the trial s first 11 weeks the prosecution called to the stand former lab directors patients doctors business partners and investors as well as journalist roger parloff who wrote the 2014 fortune magazine cover story this ceo is out for blood the prosecution rested on nov 19 and later that day the defense surprised the courtroom in calling holmes as a witness the stanford university dropout and former silicon valley wunderkind could spend up to two decades in prison if she s convicted she has pleaded not guilty balwani who s 19 years older than holmes faces the same charges and will be on trial at a later date he has also pleaded not guilty holmes started theranos in 2003 balwani joined six years later and until his departure in 2016 served as holmes second in command in testimony last week holmes said balwani was in charge of operating the company s labs and handling financial projections holmes told jurors on monday that she met balwani in china she said she was 18 at the time and he was 38 i understood that he d been a really successful business person that he worked with bill gates in the early days of microsoft holmes said i talked to him about wanting to start a company and a company that i tried to build in high school and i asked for his advice while she was studying at stanford the following school year holmes said balwani would email her holmes dropped out of stanford her sophomore year to work on the company that became theranos kevin downey holmes attorney asked if there were other reasons she left stanford i was raped a crying holmes said police agencies told cnbc they had no record of a report under holmes name she was then asked about the affect that experience had on her life i was questioning what how i was going to be able to process that experience and what i was going to do with my life she said and i decided i was going to build a life by building this company downey asked holmes whether she talked to balwani about the incident holmes said she did and that he said that i was safe now that i had met him during the prosecution s case holmes was painted by a series of witnesses as theranos undisputed leader and the person singularly responsible for all of its key decisions she picked board members met with investors and arranged business meetings with potential partners i needed to kill the person i was while she acknowledged in her answers to the defense that some of her behavior was possibly problematic such as adding drugmaker logos to theranos lab reports holmes insisted that she didn t intend to mislead patients or investors now holmes is asking jurors to believe that for at least a decade of that time she was under the influence of balwani he told me i didn t know what i was doing in business that my convictions were wrong that he was astonished at my mediocrity that if i followed my instincts i was going to fail and that i needed to kill the person i was to become what he called a new elizabeth that could be a successful entrepreneur holmes said she added that balwani insisted that she work seven days a week if she wanted to be successful and that she only spend time with people who can help with the business he would tell me not to sleep much eat only foods that would make me pure and would make me have the most energy possible in the company she said downey read a text from balwani to holmes dated nov 30 2013 that said when ur family is here i feel very lonely holmes provided the jury with the backdrop for the text he s angry with me because he felt when my family came for thanksgiving he felt neglected she said this is one of the nights where he crying came upstairs and did things to me that i didn t want and hurt me downey asked holmes if she sometimes took notes after sunny forced intercourse with you holmes said she did and referenced a note from february 2015 she said that in the note i m reacting to one of those incidents and i m writing about the fact that i couldn t move and couldn t sit up and that i was lying there swollen and i couldn t understand why i was hurting myself why i wasn t leaving she added he had taught me everything that i thought i knew about business and i thought he was the best business person i knew i think that i didn t question him in a way that i otherwise would have holmes said her view started to change in 2016 that s when the centers for medicare and medicaid services came in for an inspection after a series of stories from the wall street journal exposed theranos false promises and technological deficiencies i had gone into that inspection thinking that we had one of the best labs in the world and the findings from that inspection were so fundamentally different than what i had believed holmes said she said that following the failed inspection she hired two lab directors and brought in other lab experts all to the dismay of balwani who left the company soon after those decisions he wasn t who i thought he was holmes said and i realized if i was going to fix the issues and allow the company to see through its potential i had to do that without him in the company still holmes said in response to a series of questions by her attorney that balwani didn t force her to make any statements to investors business partners or journalists about theranos downey asked what impact if any did your relationship with mr balwani have on your work at theranos i don t know she said he impacted everything about who i was and i don t fully understand that at the close of downey s questioning holmes was asked about the value of the company she said it had been worth 9 billion holmes owned 50 giving her a net worth of about 4 5 billion she said matching the value ascribed to her by forbes magazine in 2015 a year later those shares were worthless holmes told downey that she had a chance to sell her stock to new investors who were connected to various board members when asked if she ever sold she said no i didn t want to holmes said i believed in the company and i wanted to put everything that i had into it do those shares have any value now downey asked no holmes said the court went into recess shortly before 4 p m california time the government s cross examination will begin tuesday morning holmes attempted to make eye contact with each of the jurors as they filed out of the courtroom most did not look at her correction balwani is 19 years older than holmes an earlier version misstated the age difference watch

listen to this article listen to this article editor s note this article distributed by the associated press was originally published on the conversation website the conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news analysis and commentary from academic experts by matthew e kahn university of southern california as climate change fuels large scale natural disasters the real estate mantra of location location location is taking on new meaning in 2021 homeowners have contended with threats including paralyzing cold on the great plains wildfire evacuations in the west and flooding from the south to new york city and new england buying a house is complicated enough in a market that has become supercharged in many u s cities emerging climate change risks will further complicate those decisions investors will be less likely to regret their decisions if they do due diligence in researching local climate risks mortgage lenders will face less risk of borrowers defaulting and insurers will face fewer losses if they factor climate risks into decisions on loans and insurance policies i study environmental economics and in my recent book adapting to climate change markets and the management of an uncertain future i explore how the rise of big data will help people firms and local governments make better decisions in the face of climate risks i see the emergence of a climate risk analysis industry for real estate as a promising development but believe the federal government should set standards to ensure that it provides reliable accurate information prices send climate signals but not everyone listens home prices reflect implicit judgments about whether properties are good investments including the house and the area around it for example the current median home value in california is nearly 720 000 more than twice the national median this difference reflects a judgment that california offers a desirable climate lifestyle and job opportunities people who buy property in california are betting that the state will continue to be a great place to live in the future if climate change devastates large portions of it buyers could regret their investment recent research studying u s real estate shows that flood risk and fire risk are reflected in current housing prices properties that are perceived to be riskier sell for a lower price but it s not clear whether these climate price discounts fully compensate buyers for the risks they are exposed to concern about emerging climate risks varies due partly to the partisan divide it s fair to assume that some buyers will be eager to purchase homes in locations that others view as too risky when people disagree about the probability of a bad outcome the more optimistic bidder is more likely to purchase the asset climate change is making extreme weather events such as tropical storms and flooding more frequent and intense in many places will people s risk perceptions shift along with these changes studies show that many people underestimate climate risks to housing as nobel laureate economist george akerlof has shown asymmetric information in markets when sellers know more about a product than buyers can impede trade buyers rightly fear getting stuck with a lemon whether it s a used car or a house that floods with every big storm in the auto market rating systems like carfax help level the playing field in the real estate industry climate concerns are creating an opportunity for a nascent industry of climate risk screening modelers offering similar service for homebuyers like standard poor s but for climate risk just as moody s and standard poor s rate private companies creditworthiness to help inform investor decisions a growing set of firms seek to assess spatially refined climate risks ranging from flooding to extreme heat and wildfire risk these companies include climate check first street foundation jupiter intelligence moody s esg solutions group and rms climate risk raters use recent natural disasters to compare the geography of recent flood events to what their model predicts typically they combine peer reviewed research in climatology and hydrology with a climate change model to generate risks maps first street foundation has posted a step by step overview of its modeling approach like any emerging industry spatially refined climate prediction has grown unevenly some models are scientifically sound and highly precise while others are lower quality in a normal market consumers would select the winning products through market competition but for climate risk forecasts it may take years to assess which offerings are most reliable i believe the federal government should play a role in screening the new generation of climate risk products regulators could work with the national science foundation to create a jury of experts to evaluate the new products one way to quality check these offerings would be to foster a competition in which teams post forecasts about the likely locations of disasters in 2022 and then are ranked early in 2023 based on how well they predicted actual outcomes this kind of annual review could nudge participants to upgrade their models regularly one potential example is algorithmic trading competitions in financial markets in which contestants develop new models to accurately predict how the stock market will respond to large trades saving lives and protecting assets climate risk assessment firms could help make the u s real estate sector more resilient by helping homebuyers become more sophisticated and realistic property shoppers lending patterns will shift as banks offer borrowers less generous terms for riskier properties this incentive should nudge people to bid more for relatively safer properties and to seek to live in less risky areas such shifts in turn could nudge changes in local land use and zoning laws to upzone allow higher value or denser uses in relatively safer areas building more homes in less risky areas would make climate adaptation more affordable climate change confronts people with fundamental uncertainty i see developing the skills and infrastructure to better predict local climate risks as a useful strategy for adapting to climate risks if forecasters can develop trusted predictive models people will face less future regret about their real estate investments and less risk in their daily lives matthew e kahn is provost professor of economics and spatial sciences at usc dornsife college of letters arts and sciences like this

new rules on masks travel and self isolation will not stay a day longer than necessary sajid javid promised last night as the government rejected calls from labour and the snp for tougher curbs the health secretary defended the decision to resurrect covid restrictions saying the responsible steps were proportionate to the threat that we face from the new omicron strain from today it will be mandatory to wear a face mask in shops and on public transport with fines of 200 anyone identified as a contact of someone testing positive will be required to self isolate for ten days even if they are fully vaccinated and travellers returning from abroad will be ordered to isolate at home until they have received a negative pcr result which typically takes three days the health secretary defended the decision to resurrect covid restrictions saying the responsible steps were proportionate to the threat that we face from the new omicron strain the rules will initially last for three weeks although whitehall sources last night acknowledged they were likely to continue into the new year the corona strains that simply vanished by shaun wooller health correspondent for the daily mail earlier covid variants caused alarm when they first emerged but fizzled out without having a major impact on britain the beta variant was first detected in south africa and the gamma variant in brazil scientists warned that mutations within these strains meant they could partially evade existing immunity and may be more infectious however there have only been around 1 000 cases of beta in the uk and fewer than 300 gamma experts say the latest variant omicron could also prove to be a flash in the pan the beta variant was detected in october 2020 and at its peak in december accounted for 52 per cent of cases in africa but globally it never accounted for more than 2 per cent of cases at any point and it reached a high of just 0 7 per cent in europe including the uk the gamma variant accounted for 78 per cent of cases in south america at its peak but this also remained fairly contained accounting for a high of 8 per cent of cases worldwide and 0 2 per cent in europe including the uk beta and gamma now each account for a mere 0 1 per cent of cases globally compared to over 98 per cent for delta dr simon clarke associate professor in cellular microbiology at reading university said of omicron people should not panic it may cause us real problems but that is far from certain at this point advertisement labour and the snp yesterday called on boris johnson to impose tougher restrictions in a joint letter scottish and welsh first ministers nicola sturgeon and mark drakeford said travellers should be forced to self isolate for at least eight days regardless of their vaccination status or where they had come from the two leaders claimed that public health advice is unequivocal that this is the best and safest way to protect against the importation of this variant miss sturgeon said that while she was hoping for the best people should prepare for the worst both leaders are also urging people to work from home and they demanded treasury guarantees that they would be funded to operate their own furlough schemes if they wanted to order businesses to close down labour also went further in england demanding that masks should be made compulsory in pubs and restaurants downing street rejected the call to extend self isolation for travel the pm s official spokesman said we believe our approach is proportionate given the evidence we currently have introducing further isolation and testing would have a deleterious effect on the travel industry and indeed those who are planning to go travelling no 10 also rejected the idea of ordering office staff to work from home again saying it was a matter for employers mr javid indicated that ministers were wary of taking any action that could further damage the hard hit hospitality sector he tried to reassure mps the measures were a precaution to give scientists time to analyse the threat posed by omicron he said the variant may have given the virus extra legs in the race between the disease and vaccines but he added if it emerges that this variant is no more dangerous than the delta variant then we won t keep measures in place for a day longer than is necessary mr javid said hospitalisations would be what matters more than anything in deciding whether more measures are needed former welsh secretary alun cairns said the government was right to reject calls for tougher mea sures saying many had been in place in wales since summer yet infection rates are still much higher the new rules came into force at 4am today and will stay in place initially until december 21 mps will vote on the regulations tonight with ministers braced for a rebellion by tory mps opposed to the return of any restrictions pictured the new coronavirus rules coming into force today across england in a bid to curb the spread of the omicron variant i ve seen nothing in this variant that warrants britain s extreme response to it commentary by dr angelique coetzee as chair of the south african medical association and a gp of 33 years standing i have seen a lot over my medical career but nothing has prepared me for the extraordinary global reaction that met my announcement this week that i had seen a young man in my surgery who had a case of covid that turned out to be the omicron variant this version of the virus had been circulating in southern africa for some time having been previously identified in botswana but given my public facing role by announcing its presence in my own patient i unwittingly brought it to global attention quite simply i have been stunned at the response and especially from britain and let me be clear nothing i have seen about this new variant warrants the extreme action the uk government has taken in response to it no one here in south africa is known to have been hospitalised with the omicron variant nor is anyone here believed to have fallen seriously ill with it yet britain and other european nations have reacted with heavy travel restrictions on flights from across southern africa as well as imposing tighter rules at home on mask wearing fines and extended quarantines the simple truth is we don t know yet anywhere near enough about omicron to make such judgments or to impose such policies in south africa we ve retained a sense of perspective we ve had no new regulations or talk of lockdowns because we re waiting to see what the variant actually means nothing has prepared me for the extraordinary global reaction that met my announcement this week that i had seen a young man in my surgery who had a case of covid that turned out to be the omicron variant writes dr angelique coetzee we ve also become accustomed here to new covid variants emerging so when our scientists confirmed the discovery of yet another nobody made a huge thing of it many people didn t even notice but after britain heard about it the global picture started to change even as our scientists tried to point out the huge gaps in the world s knowledge about this variant european nations immediately and unilaterally banned travel from this part of the world our government was understandably ang ered by this pointing out that excellent science should be applauded not punished if as some evidence suggests omicron turns out to be a fast spreading virus with mostly mild symptoms for the majority of the people who catch it that would be a useful step on the road to herd immunity we ll learn in the next two weeks if that s the case even as our scientists tried to point out the huge gaps in the world s knowledge about this variant european nations immediately and unilaterally banned travel from this part of the world stock image the worst situation of course would be a fast spreading virus with severe infections but that s not where we are at the moment here in south africa what i and my gp colleagues are seeing doesn t in any way warrant the knee jerk reaction we ve seen from the uk for one thing we re not at least for now treating patients who are severely ill take my first omicron case the young man i mentioned earlier it didn t occur to him that he had covid he thought he d had too much sun after working outside after he tested positive so did his wife and four month old baby so far the patients who ve tested positive for omicron here have been mainly young men a mixture of vaccinated and unvaccinated though in our statistics unvaccinated can also mean single vaccinated only yesterday i saw five more patients who had tested positive for the new variant they all had a very mild illness so at the moment i m afraid it seems to me that britain is merely hyping up the alarm about this variant unnecessarily yes the picture might one day look different i have yet to see older unvaccinated people infected with the new variant for example and they might well present with a more severe form of the disease but the reality is that covid is something we have to learn to live with look after yourself and get your vaccines above all don t panic and that goes for governments as well dr coetzee is chair of the south african medical association

an outstanding article by joel kotkin at the claremont institute is a must read it s long but it consolidates and clarifies exactly what is going on in our society from the article we can see how government large corporate powers dependency on china the great reset and our cultural revolution all collude to destroy the lower and middle classes it s long and deep so we summarized it here but we hope you read it a lot is left out in this summary the merging of the soulless and the greedy there is a new communism in town it is the convergence of the chinese maoist ideology and the corporate mentality china has adopted a communist version of capitalism and the united states in fact the entire resetting western world is adopting capitalism with a more tyrannical authoritative mission the two worlds of china and america are converging joel kotkin writing for the claremont institute sees it as a new alliance between large corporate powers wall street and the progressive clerisy nonprofits cowed media and their academic mentors in government and media the corporations embrace stakeholder capitalism to please regulators the woke employees to make themselves feel good they resemble fascist states you can accumulate capital but you are not permitted to dissent western complicity differs from fascism or socialist corporate standards in that it sees no advantages in increasing material consumption of the populace but sees value in giving advantages to racial or lifestyle minorities china and america becoming one the concentration of power in chinese and american corporatism is in few hands it s true antecedents are not in marxism but in european fascism in other words the feudal state mussolini used corporate power since it is essential to the ideology of fascism when he succeeded some italian industrialists were glad to see the end of class based chaos their autonomy of private interests parallels today s stakeholder capitalism and the environmental great reset as in the fascist state corporations now take it on themselves to be conscious change agents for particular political and moral agendas two doctrines guide these actions first stakeholder capitalism which holds that corporations must push onto society doctrines concerning gender systemic racism and other elements of the woke agenda second the great reset which seeks to have companies essentially save the planet by slowing material growth for the working and middle classes while maintaining rich profit opportunities through disruption of energy and other industries both doctrines currently guide the majority of america s major corporations china already followed this model and we are right behind them it allows monopolies to flourish chinese authorities see that a conflictual competitive system like that usually dominant in america will hold back national economic priorities and damage the social fabric under the rubric of corporate social responsibility the state still holds the command keys and although entrepreneurs are allowed to get rich they cannot deviate much from the state orthodoxy the ccp does not allow corporations to set their own agenda democrats play the role of xi jinping the democrat party plays the role of xi jinping in the united states they pretend it s like fdr s new deal but the new deal was trying to expand ownership and productivity not constrict the populace and depress the standards of living the usa has been on the path toward corporate government autocracy for years since the late 1990s it s notable in finance technology and media a tenth of the us economy is comprised of industries with only four firms dominating more than two thirds of the market in finance for example local banks are disappearing from 1983 to 2018 the number of banks fell from 11 000 to almost 4 000 technology and social media is even more concerning it s an oligarchy only meant to help a handful of investors and top execs cov accelerated the process today a handful of giant corporations account for nearly 40 percent of the value of the standard and poor index a level of concentration unprecedented in modern history the leftist blog the bellows notes that last year amazon tripled its profits and jeff bezos made 70 billion while billionaires had earned over 1 trillion since march alphabet amazon apple facebook and microsoft now make up 20 percent of the stock market s total worth overall in 2020 the top seven tech firms added 3 4 trillion in value and they love it these corporations now look for ways to take over key markets and make more money progressives embrace corporatism these recent trends mark a significant break in the american tradition of individualist competitive capitalism america s companies were once dominated by small family owned and regional companies no longer progressives used to want corporate power limited now they embrace bigness and power monopolistic power and bailouts allow corporations to operate with virtual impunity instead of a competitive economy we see aldous huxley s scientific caste system where the highly credentialed and technologically dominant have almost total reign tech oligarchs notes the french socialist economist thomas piketty see themselves not merely as business people but as exemplars whose success serves to destroy artificial inequalities while highlighting natural inequalities the new aristocracy regards itself as intrinsically more deserving of their wealth and power than the old managerial elites or the grubby corporate speculators they believe that they are not just creating value but building a better world these are not just the rich and well placed but also the elect neo democratic party the current democratic party may represent the apotheosis of the new corporate state it raises record sums from the corporate elite notably the tech oligarchs and their wall street allies among financial firms communications companies and lawyers biden outraised trump by five to one or more equally important the tech giants actively helped direct biden s presidential campaign providing digital savvy with mark zuckerberg himself financing election day operations in many critical states time magazine s approving exposé of the corporate elites scheme to unseat president trump noted that an informal alliance between left wing activists and business titans had succeeded in influencing election results through both cash donations to democrats and manipulation of media for political ends the oligarchs often couched their support in progressive and even patriotic rhetoric that also served their economic interests they turned back real progressives like sanders and warren the massive lobbying operation backs them up they have even found allies among some right wing libertarians including the cato institute and the heritage foundation which doggedly justify censorship and oligopoly on private property grounds little attention is paid to this growing concentration of market power the biden led democratic party promises a fresh springtime for oligarchs the prominence of corporate lobbyists in the new administration all but assures that biden like barack obama will wink and nod as microsoft amazon apple facebook and google acquire or crush competitors and function increasingly beyond constitutional limits of censorship to control and limit political debate biden s regime will encapsulate china like harmony the rise of stakeholder capitalism the corporate elites now see themselves as conscious and empowered shapers of social reality so they push stakeholder capitalism this shift mirrors their chinese counterparts many corporations now see themselves as instruments of political and cultural conditioning well beyond serving customers and shareholders chinese social media have worked overtime to assure the world that the pandemic was not generated in china while spreading the falsehood that instead america is to blame rather than seeing covid 19 as a failure of chinese society they are using it as proof that beijing has developed the ultimate new policy role model for addressing it in america and the west stakeholder capitalism increasingly resembles not the current chinese model but something more akin to china during the cultural revolution a half century ago with the rise of a virtuocracy based on revolutionary purity class and even ethnic background anyone who doesn t toe the line could be canceled wokeness toxic masculinity anti racism racism are all cudgels used and embraced by corporations the universities especially the elite ones have been taken over with the hyper liberalism cancel culture and a kind of corporate vigilantism one observer notes that it also allows the wealthiest people on the planet the benefit of sounding progressive inclusive and egalitarian while obscuring the class interests of those pushing it some tech companies are even afraid of their own employees charitable foundations also push the agenda the great reset in 1972 the sociologist daniel bell predicted a shift in elite attitudes as companies turned from making things to essentially selling ideas he also identified the change in the nature of corporate ownership which was moving from families to ever larger financial institutions these things he noted changed the cultural value system the new capitalist ideal was more sensate more bohemian than traditionally bourgeois less shaped by the protestant ethic family local community and religion increasingly he predicted the corporate class would function free of any such moral grounding and instead seek status and its badges not work these he suggested would emerge as the mark of success progressive morality seizing on the opportunity presented by the covid 19 pandemic the great reset introduced by the world economic forum s klaus schwab proposes that large corporations reject their traditional goals and market capitalism in favor of serving racial and gender equity or saving the planet the great reset advocates the reevaluation of the principles of democracy particularly if they are perceived as not meeting the values embraced in the reset eric heymann a senior executive at deutsche bank suggests that to reach the climate goals of davos corporations will have to embrace a certain degree of eco dictatorship corporations must explicitly embrace top down authoritarianism no more competition individual rights and merit people like bill gates say science and math are racist for focusing on grades and performance schools are picking up on the message no longer do they look for the best they embrace the new standards for hiring which are no standards really except those that are woke the irony is they see no conflict in supporting china despite its racist human rights abuses the class politics of scarcity in the world being proposed by advocates of the great reset particularly its environmental policy the clear losers are the middle and working classes many of whom are increasingly alienated from the agenda of the corporate state the new corporate agenda increasingly embraces the idea of degrowth a conscious slowing of economic growth at a time of increased class stagnation by embracing the notion of austerity for the masses environmental extremists love it it seems odd that companies would embrace slower growth but this view is based on the notion that without massive shifts in how people consume the planet will become uninhabitable there s also an element of political pressure as firms face the possibilities of protests lawsuits and even jail time if identified as climate criminals these views have gained support in the un and also among parts of the democratic party the apocalyptic predictions are wrong but the left embraces them they do offer new opportunities for corporations with solar and electric it s the climate industrial complex it helps the rich kills off the middle class degrowth will hold little opportunity for the mass of people instead only leading to the sullen acceptance of what fritz varhenholt a long time environmental advocate in the german social democratic party calls deindustrialization and loss of prosperity the reality of this grim future is already evident in places like california where the climate change agenda has achieved near religious status and has produced policies that slow growth on the periphery the one place where middle class families could afford homes dropping homeownership rates there for younger people far more than elsewhere something we also see in such climate centered environments as canada and australia in britain the government s climate change committee is now considering legislation that will make it impossible to sell single family homes including those built decades ago that do not meet stringent energy standards prospects are worse for the poor they will suffer energy poverty monopolizing ideas efforts to sell the new corporate order will likely run into widespread and growing skepticism toward both mainstream and social media success thus requires adopting the surveillance and algorithmic based propaganda now common in china america s tech firms already assist china in deploying such technologies and they could employ them here albeit without government control they have to redirect people s minds jerry brown the former governor of california openly favors applying the coercive power of the state to achieve environmental goals while promoting the brainwashing of the uncomprehending masses a concept very much congruent with the logic behind chinese thought control remarkably even prominent journalists at the new york times and other mainstream outlets advocate ramping up further censorship increasingly with widespread congressional support these views may well reflect the shift in journalistic ethics which have increasingly rejected standards of objectivity or even the need to give readers alternative views although censoring or demonetizing competitors may also bring some financial rewards as well tech firms are already there more and more companies like facebook and google seek to eliminate view that violate their worldview they are called to do it by the ever growing numbers of prominent liberal legal scholars and their role model is chinese repression it s even used against allies when they stray in the smallest ways as matt tabibi has noted in the case of hunter biden s incriminating computer major outlets like npr simply refused to cover the story while twitter and facebook succeeded in deplatforming the new york post america s oldest newspaper twitter and facebook felt empowered to curb president trump and his administration for its numerous inaccuracies but never censored often equally absurd anti trump conspiracies in a remarkable act of corporate coordination the oligarchic firms demonetized and removed from the cloud the parler website which was accused of sparking violence although other sites including facebook and twitter played a bigger role in helping the capitol hill lunatics to organize concern over such bans is shared by those like the german chancellor angela merkel and the russian dissident alexei navalny who have lived under autocratic regimes china has already shown how technology can monitor personal posts and opinions that stray from orthodoxy often with the help of american companies ultimately a handful of firms in the bay area and the puget sound could employ techniques of information control and surveillance that would have delighted stalin hitler or mao as aldous huxley warned a thoroughly scientific dictatorship will never be overthrown the great divergence national versus global china is nationalistic they don t embrace ideas that conflict with their national prosperity on the other hand the american corporate state does not welcome national interest or liberal democracy but rather a common future in cyberspace with autocratic china both michael bloomberg and tim cook have said xi is not a dictator contradictions the corporate state and the socialist left the increasingly obvious abandonment of the nation by its elite could pose an existential threat to the durability of the corporate state certainly more radical elements including black lives matter who receive large funding from the oligarchs may not long be satisfied with virtue signaling by corporate chieftains indeed without the unifying menace of trump as christopher caldwell noted in the new republic the national front forged by biden which includes near unanimous support from the corporate state could unravel driven by ideology the progressive movement could morph in directions that resemble those of the jacobins of the french revolution with their disdain for the privacy of individual citizens as well as their desire to remove heads or the red guards unleashed during the cultural revolution in china who were initially embraced even by moderate leaders like deng in the late 1960s corporate oligarchs are at odds with some of the ideology and the greenies or the aoc s who don t think there are good billionaires they will get sick of the oligarchs the corporate oligarchs could find they have virtue signaled their way into a confiscatory system of socialism contradictions over class and culture at the same time the corporate state faces a grassroots challenge usually associated today with the right the attempts to curb companies in the fossil fuel real estate aviation and automobile sectors for climate reasons may not appeal much to oil riggers factory employees or construction workers who drive old trucks these workers also will find out that most green jobs turn out to be mainly ephemeral essentially positions that are already present and where they actually exist pay far lower salaries are usually shorter term and are far less likely to be unionized particularly as compared to the roughly 750 000 high paying jobs in the fossil fuel sector not surprisingly rapid decarbonization has elicited opposition not only from conservatives but from unions and not only in energy but also in manufacturing construction and logistics some democrats see their constituencies being abandoned other parts of the elite agenda for example the notion of forcibly densifying suburbs and restricting single family zoning are also not likely to play well with the general public homeownership the primary way middle and working class people achieve wealth is often decried by progressives while many on wall street look forward to a fully rentership society oligarchs living in unimaginable splendor may want the plebs to live in rented small apartments in their degrowth universe but this is not likely to be a popular stance cultural radicalism is not embraced by america they will get pushback only 8 of the population embrace political correctness new alliances a new resistance for now our constitution provides some room for action strong actions to break up or at least restrain the acquisitions of the largest firms notably in tech and finance are a viable response breaking up these firms or turning them essentially into regulated utilities also makes sense certainly other actions to guarantee free speech rights and to preserve some degree of local autonomy have appeal across the political spectrum there is opportunity here conservatives could find some common cause with socialists in rebelling against limiting power to a few the middle class and working class must engage the main street merchant the small bank and the independent artisan need to unite against the overweening power and self confidence of the corporate state we have not yet reached huxley s brave new world or even china s high tech police state though we are headed in that direction our classes are not yet fully shaped by the whims of cadres or determined in birthing vats the sinews of civic culture to some degree remain churches independent journals local associations small businesses that can flex against the imposition of a scientific dictatorship but the battle against the corporate state can only succeed if citizens put aside their political blinders and understand that the consolidation of political and economic power represents a fundamental challenge to maintaining a functional as opposed to a merely nominal democracy this is neither a right nor a left wing issue but an imperative if we wish to preserve our republic before it is too late related

in early 2016 i flew to san francisco for a week of meetings with the top brass at twitter jack dorsey one of the cofounders of the social media start up had recently returned to the company as ceo taking over from dick costolo who had taken twitter public a couple of years earlier this wasn t the first time dorsey had run twitter as i detailed in my book on the early days of twitter hatching twitter dorsey had served as ceo during the company s nascent years before being kicked out because he had no idea how to run a company evan williams twitter s other cofounder took over dorsey incensed by the fact that he had been ousted then came back to oust williams and the ceo musical chairs went on for nearly a decade until dorsey again returned to lead twitter during the trump era my question for the executives i was meeting with that year was simple what happens if dorsey was once again unsuccessful in growing twitter to its full potential who would take over next at the time i was told by the board of twitter that there is no plan b it was jack dorsey or bust on monday five years after that proclamation dorsey announced he was resigning from twitter plan b it turns out is the company s chief technology officer parag agrawal in a resignation letter dorsey said after almost 16 years of having a role at our company from co founder to ceo to chair to exec chair to interim ceo to ceo i decided it s finally time for me to leave but what changed why is dorsey leaving now was he ousted or is he resigning of his own accord the answer to those questions varies depending on who you ask i spoke to almost half a dozen people familiar with the company s inner workings and while they were not directly involved in dorsey s resignation these are people who have a deep understanding of the place and as such theorized that dorsey is being ousted as ceo rather than leaving of his own accord twitter itself did not immediately respond to a request for comment in 2020 elliott management a hedge fund known for activist investing that controls roughly 48 billion in assets had purchased 1 billion of twitter stock and began a campaign to demand changes at twitter with a specific goal in mind getting rid of dorsey at the time dorsey refused to step down as ceo using the argument that he was a founder of twitter and therefore the only person who could run it according to people who were familiar with dorsey s thinking at the time earlier this year in april when it was announced that elliott management s activist investor jesse cohn was planning to step down from the board of directors it appeared that dorsey had survived the succession like coup i then heard rumblings from someone close to twitter s board over the summer that there was indeed a ceo search taking place at the company but i had assumed at the time that it was just theater given that dorsey has largely been unfireable for the past nearly 16 years and has always managed to stave off attempts to expel him from the company in may elliott management increased its holding in twitter buying more than 200 million of stock when the company s value fell by more than 15 following a sluggish earnings report looking back now it appeared that dorsey s death knell had been rung while one former high level employee at twitter believes that dorsey may have indeed decided to step down of his own accord the employee acknowledged that his resignation was handled in a very peculiar way rather than have an overlapping transitionary period where dorsey trains his replacement the switch is happening immediately which the former employee said was very weird for others what s most telling that dorsey likely didn t have much of a say in this matter is that he is not only stepping down as ceo effective immediately but that he is leaving the board of twitter in may in the past when founders and ceos step down they often stick around indefinitely to help guide the direction of a company given their own understanding of a business bill gates remained on the board of microsoft about 20 years after he resigned as ceo and only left when the board opened an investigation into a prior romantic relationship he had with a microsoft employee that was deemed inappropriate eric schmidt and larry page both of whom served as ceos of google stayed on the board for some time after stepping down page is still on the board of alphabet even twitter s cofounder evan williams remained on the board of twitter for over a decade after he was pushed out by dorsey the problem with keeping dorsey on the board now is that each time he has stepped down in a leadership role at the company in the past and in turn stayed on the company s board he has managed to connive his way back to becoming ceo the only true way to ensure that doesn t happen again one former employee theorized to me is to cut him out of the company entirely

financial markets have been on a rollercoaster ride since the middle of last week we wanted to believe we were getting close to the end of covid but the latest jitters from omicron variant signaled the inevitable covid winter surge might already be here omicron is the latest covid test for the economic outlook and we won t have a clear picture until a couple more weeks friday s turmoil looked a lot worse given the lack of liquidity options volatility and overall frothy levels for equities us stocks are rebounding as optimism grows that the omicron variant is a cause for concern but not a cause for panic and could potentially be the catalyst needed to get more of the country vaccinated investors will learn over the next couple of weeks if the omicron variant causes more severe disease than the other variants so far the mrna vaccines have proved effective against other variants such as delta and optimism is that even they will eventually need to get tweaked that could be done in a few months time risk appetite got a boost from both the pfizer ceo and president biden calmed markets nerves that we won t go back to the darkest days of the pandemic the pfizer ceo bourla said he thinks the data will ultimately show the current vaccine will protect less against omicron but will likely still offer some protection president biden said the us won t need shutdowns to curb the omicron variant us data pending home sales unexpectedly surged in october as rents skyrocketed and buyers were highly motivated as borrowing costs seem poised to increase steadily as the fed positions itself to raise rates us pending homes sales increased by 7 5 from a month earlier which was a 10 month high the dallas fed manufacturing survey came in slightly below expectations but still showed manufacturing activity is healthy and the outlook has dramatically improved the index for general activity came in at 11 8 a miss of the 17 0 consensus estimate and drop from the 14 6 reading in october the six month outlook almost doubled to 28 6 while the raw materials price index hit a series high oil oil prices rebounded for two key reasons the omicron variant seemed like it would most likely be short term disruptive to the crude demand outlook and on growing expectations that opec will refrain from increasing production by 400 000 bpd the chairman of the south african ministerial advisory committee on vaccines noted that the cases so far had all been mild mild to moderate which was a good sign as long as south africa does not see a massive uptick in hospitalizations optimism will grow that this new variant won t lead to a wrath closing of borders highly vaccinated countries will continue to thrive and political pressure will grow to get those countries with low vaccination rates more supplies opec pushed their meetings to better assess the impact of the omicron variant which will most likely be followed by a delay in delivering an extra 400 000 barrels a day in january following the global strategic reserve releases and the announcement of dozens of countries restricting travel to and from south africa and neighboring nations opec and its allies can easily justify an output halt or even a slight cut in production crude prices gave back some its gains after us state department advisor reminded traders the us could release more oil gold gold prices remained heavy as omicron panic eased the dollar rally returned and after another round of strong us economic data wall street is quickly shaking off last week s de risking theme that triggered safe haven demand for bullion president biden said economic lockdowns in response to the omicron variant are off the table which means gold could be in trouble if this latest variant mostly yields longer supply chain issues that might fuel the inflation is persistent argument if supply chain issues deteriorate even further that could lead to faster tapering and quicker rate hikes by the fed cryptos cryptocurrencies are rebounding after last week s widespread panic selling from the omicron variant blew past many stops the crypto selloff was an overreaction and buyers are quickly reemerging as traders reassess the impact of a new coronavirus variant bitcoin is a part of today s broad risk rally that stemmed from easing covid fears but will likely struggle to completely get its groove back until vaccine efficacy results in the coming weeks confirm highly vaccinated countries are going back to lockdown mode bitcoin rose 3 5 to 58 284 which makes the year to date gain at 101 ethereum is back above 4400 and is almost 500 higher this year the top two cryptos seem like they may consolidate here but if the fed accelerates their taper plans and prospects of rate hikes grow a return to record highs seen earlier in november will be hard to do

highlights this variant is a cause for concern not a cause for panic biden said the white house said there were no plans to curtail biden s travel as a result of the new variant if people are vaccinated and wear their mask there s no need for lockdowns joe biden said the new coronavirus variant omicron is a cause for concern but not a cause for panic united states president joe biden has said adding that he was not considering any widespread us lockdown advertisement the us president urged americans anew to get fully vaccinated including booster shots and return to face masks indoors in public settings to slow any spread speaking monday at the white house biden said it was inevitable that the new variant would reach the us but he also said the country has the tools necessary to protect americans particularly the approved vaccines and booster shots when omicron arrives and it will biden said america will face this new threat just as we ve faced those that have come before it he appealed to the roughly 80 million unvaccinated americans aged 5 and up to get their shots and for the rest of the country to seek out booster shots six months after their second dose he also encouraged everyone to get back to wearing face masks in all indoor public settings a pandemic precaution that has fallen out of use across much of the country biden was joined by dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert and the president s covid 19 adviser who said earlier monday that scientists hope to know in the next week or two how well the existing covid 19 vaccines protect against the varian t and how dangerous it is compared to earlier strains we really don t know fauci told abc s good morning america calling speculation premature the new variant poses the latest test to biden s efforts to contain the pandemic mitigate its impacts on the economy and return a sense of normalcy to the u s during the holiday season this variant is a cause for concern not a cause for panic biden said as u s financial markets rebounded monday after falling sharply on friday the white house said there were no plans to curtail biden s travel as a result of the new variant biden last week moved to restrict travel from south africa and seven other countries in southern africa effective monday in a bid to give scientists time to learn more about the new variant and for more americans to get vaccinated before it hits the u s south african officials have argued they are being punished for speedily identifying and reporting the new variant as omicron spreads across the globe white house press secretary jen psaki said monday we will continue to assess what steps we need to take to protect the american people some other nations are reinstating severe travel and business lockdowns to prevent the omicron variant from spreading but biden indicated the u s was not following suit if people are vaccinated and wear their mask there s no need for lockdowns he said fauci said earlier on cbs mornings that limiting travel from the countries where omicron was first identified buys you a couple of weeks because if you can keep things out in force for a couple of weeks you can do a lot of things advertisement pharmaceutical companies are already adjusting their existing covid 19 vaccines to better attack the omicron variant but fauci said americans should make it a priority to get either their first shots or a booster dose now rather than waiting for a new formulation i would strongly suggest you get boosted now he said advertisement he added that depending on what scientists learn about the omicron variant in the coming weeks we may not need targeted boosters to contain that strain of the virus biden said his administration was sparing no effort at removing all roadblocks to keep the american people safe including working with drug manufacturers on potential new boosters and testing targeted specifically at the new variant any omicron specific vaccine probably could not begin to be produced for another two or three months so getting boosters now is a very important initial line of defense dr paul burton chief medical officer for the vaccine maker moderna said monday burton said moderna and other vaccine companies are testing existing covid 19 vaccines to determine how effective they are against the omicron variant if we need to manufacture an omicron specific variant it s going to take some weeks two to three months is probably what we re looking at to be able to really begin to manufacture burton told abc noting that the new variant like earlier ones sprang up overseas in areas with lower vaccination rates biden said it was both a moral imperative and in america s self interest to speed up global vaccinations he noted that the u s has already donated more than 275 million doses more than the rest of the world combined and is on pace to deliver more than 1 1 billion doses globally by september 2022 now we need the rest of the world to step up as well biden said we can t let up until the world is vaccinated with ap inputs also read omicron covid variant risk very high warns who also read all adults in britain

on tuesday november 23 the white house announced plans to make 50 million barrels of crude oil available to the market through a combination of exchanges and accelerating previously announced sales with these sales and several other legislated drawdowns spr inventories could decline from 618 million barrels as of october 1 2021 to about 314 million barrels by the start of the 2032 fiscal year the lowest level since march 1983 the infrastructure investment and jobs act passed earlier this month includes a provision to draw down 87 6 million barrels of crude oil from the u s strategic petroleum reserve spr in fiscal years fy 2028 through 2031 the spr was established in the 1970s to alleviate the effects of unexpected oil supply reductions the reserve was designed to hold up to 714 million barrels of crude oil across four storage sites along the gulf of mexico where much of the u s petroleum refining capacity is located crude oil can be released from the spr under four conditions emergency drawdowns test sales exchange agreements and nonemergency sales emergency drawdowns and test sales are relatively rare the most recent emergency drawdown occurred in 2011 in response to production disruptions in libya and the most recent test sale occurred in 2014 the spr has released crude oil under exchange agreements 12 times since 1996 most recently after hurricane harvey in 2017 in these exchange agreements crude oil is released to private companies and repaid in kind by specified dates with additional barrels similar to monetary interest on a loan congress has also authorized nonemergency sales of spr crude oil to respond to lesser supply disruptions or to raise revenue for the u s treasury for example the fixing america s surface transportation act passed in 2015 and the bipartisan budget act of 2018 collectively call for the sale of more than 160 million barrels of crude oil from the spr in fys 2022 through 2027 one of the spr s core missions is to hold enough oil stocks to fulfill u s obligations under the international energy program the 1974 treaty that established the international energy agency iea as a member of the iea the united states is obligated to maintain stocks of crude oil and petroleum products both public and private to provide at least 90 days of u s net import protection the u s department of energy calculates this value by dividing the spr inventory level by eia s sum for net crude oil and petroleum product imports as net imports of crude oil and petroleum products into the united states declined in recent years the volume needed to meet the 90 day import coverage also fell in october 2019 the united states exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported becoming a net exporter for the first time in eia data which dates back to 1977 iea members who are net petroleum exporters do not have stockholding obligations although the united states has occasionally imported more petroleum than it exported in some months since late 2019 spr inventory levels have continued to provide sufficient coverage for net import protection source eia

do we need to expedite vaccine distribution around the world absolutely did the latest variant of covid 19 result from hoarding of vaccines by wealthy nations that depends on the definition of wealthy and the precise origin of omicron epidemiologists first identified the new variant in south africa which might play hob with the associated press rush to judgment on the cause of the variant advertisement the emergence of the new omicron variant and the world s desperate and likely futile attempts to keep it at bay are reminders of what scientists have warned for months the coronavirus will thrive as long as vast parts of the world lack vaccines the hoarding of limited covid 19 shots by rich countries creating virtual vaccine deserts in many poorer ones doesn t just mean risk for the parts of the world seeing shortages it threatens the entire globe that s because the more the disease spreads among unvaccinated populations the more possibilities it has to mutate and potentially become more dangerous prolonging the pandemic for everyone the virus is a ruthless opportunist and the inequity that has characterized the global response has now come home to roost said dr richard hatchett ceo of cepi one of the groups behind the u n backed covax shot sharing initiative except that south africa wasn t a vaccine desert virtual or otherwise a week ago just prior to the emergence of omicron reuters reported that south africa had stopped accepting new shipments of vaccine doses thanks to a glut the problem in that country was uptake not provisions south africa has asked johnson johnson jnj n and pfizer pfe n to delay delivery of covid 19 vaccines because it now has too much stock health ministry officials said as vaccine hesitancy slows an inoculation campaign about 35 of south africans are fully vaccinated higher than in most other african nations but half the government s year end target it has averaged 106 000 doses a day in the past 15 days in a nation of 60 million people earlier this year the programme was slowed by insufficient doses now deliveries have been delayed due to oversupply making the country an outlier in the continent where most are still starved of vaccines nicholas crisp deputy director general of the health department told reuters that south africa had 16 8 million doses in stock and said deliveries had been deferred advertisement so much for the vaccine desert as well as the class warfare argument is south africa a wealthy nation not particularly but they re hardly poor either a 2020 ranking by total national wealth puts them 43rd trailing vietnam and even bangladesh but still firmly in the upper third of global rankings did omicron generate in south africa that may never be determined it certainly might have originated in a poorer neighboring country but there s no evidence to support that in contrast omicron got identified in south africa first and that s also where transmission of the variant appears to be the most intense at the very least attributing omicron to vaccine deserts is premature and unsupported by evidence this looks suspiciously like narrative journalism an attempt to tell a preferred story and jump to conclusions without regard to evidentiary support if anything one could wrap this around vaccine hesitancy rather than hoarding and perhaps get a little closer to the truth however even that s more correlative and conjecture than scientific fact viruses mutate over time anyway but there s no scientific threshold for viral mutation potential at certain levels of herd immunity if omicron emerged from a population that s 35 immunized by vaccination then it could just as easily have emerged here in the us from states where full immunization by vaccination is only moderately better it could also emerge in places where vaccination rates are higher but recent transmissions intensified through a significant random mutation there is presumably more likelihood of that happening in lower immunization level populations which is why we want vaccines to be distributed as widely and quickly as possible but that also requires a population willing to get immunized which was the actual problem in south africa not vaccine shortages advertisement also let s remember that mutation isn t impossible in higher vaccinated populations with more cooperation in vaccination either the spike in cases in our cold weather states could also generate a new variant at some point hopefully it won t but it could one last point thus far we have focused on vaccine related acquired immunity we still aren t measuring infection acquired immunity probably because we still aren t doing wide population testing for any reason at the moment that would factor into variant potentials too assuming that and this is still an assumption that immunity blocks transmission and mutations entirely do we know this to be the case it certainly doesn t seem that way and that might make vaccine deserts even less relevant to mutations the fact that the vaccinated can still be infected and perhaps even contagious argues against the idea that mutations only happen in vaccine deserts that doesn t mean we should discount the issue of vaccine deserts and mutation potential but the real priority for wide distribution of vaccines is preventing as many critical cases of acute covid infections and saving lives if we re prioritizing a defense against mutations it becomes a risk reward calculation until we have vaccine doses in the billions we are forced to deal with a shortage structure which requires rationing rationing will always have to take national interests into consideration as well as international and humanitarian interests the countries that produce the vaccines will always want to protect their own citizens first and then take care of others next especially representative republics with real accountability to voters they will prioritize saving lives now over potential mutations to come and for good reason advertisement the best strategy would be to distribute vaccine production as widely as possible that lands the output where it s needed and where it won t require as much competition in a shortage environment but even then just because a country has the vaccines doesn t mean they ll go into arms as south africa and the united states has discovered that s a trust desert issue not a vaccine desert issue

jack dorsey s announcement monday that he is exiting twitter after co founding the company and serving as its ceo for the last six years is a seismic shift for a social media company at the heart of politics and the news media the eccentric ceo s departure comes as twitter has set high new goals for user and revenue growth and rolled out a series of new products it also takes place as twitter remains under the microscope for the role it and other social media firms have played in stoking an increasingly divided nation twitter was the social media forum of choice for president trump who was only removed from the platform after the jan 6 attack on the capitol by a mob of his supporters dorsey will be replaced atop twitter s hierarchy by former chief technology officer parag agrawal who joined the company in 2011 as a software engineer the change in leadership offers an opportunity for twitter to shift course in any number of ways but does not necessarily mean that major changes are imminent according to a number of close observers it s a very big event obviously at a very important company paul barrett deputy director of the nyu stern center for business and human rights told the hill i don t think it necessarily indicates that either there s something really bad going on or that the company is going to take a dramatic change in direction twitter s stock spiked on initial reports of dorsey s departure but lost all of that gain by the end of the day monday a sign that the market is split on what the future holds for the platform investors will consider revisiting the stock said eric schiffer chairman of consulting firm reputation management pointing to worries about dorsey juggling running both twitter and his online payment processor square but others will view it as a negative because jack is such a visionary and has been able to certainly grow shareholder value he added dorsey faced an attempt to push him out of leadership at twitter in 2020 by the activist investor elliott management reportedly because of his dual ceo roles the firm endorsed agrawal as well as salesforce chief bret taylor as new board chairman in a statement monday agrawal who was appointed cto in 2017 has kept a relatively low profile compared to his predecessor as a product focused technologist according to syracuse associate professor jennifer grygiel he is less likely to get involved in ideological debates as dorsey was i think he ll just lean into his comfort zone they told the hill the new ceo has already drawn the ire of conservatives a handful of right wing provocateurs baselessly claimed monday that dorsey stepping down would lead to censorship of their posts the account for republicans on the house judiciary committee resurfaced an old tweet of agrawal s quoting a segment about stereotypes from the daily show didn t think it could get much worse than jack dorsey the account tweeted but yikes the platform s relationship with the right could be a key factor in evaluating dorsey s legacy especially given his ties to figures like stop the steal organizer ali alexander who helped organize the washington rally that preceded the jan 6 capitol attack alexander is among those who has been subpoenaed by the jan 6 panel twitter has become synonymous with online harassment largely because they ve cultivated a user base of right wing extremists said michael edison hayden a senior investigative reporter at the southern poverty law center dorsey was the ultimate decision maker with how the platform handled trump s account as well critics argued he let trump post on twitter for or too long and without any meaningful restrictions even as the former president spreading misinformation ranging from the election being stolen to the risk of covid 19 being overblown he used facebook and other things for reach afterwards but it was that real time nature of twitter that he really truly did weaponize grygiel said that was on jack dorsey s watch dorsey s decision to step down makes him the latest big tech founder to hand the reins off following amazon s jeff bezos microsoft s bill gates and google s sergey brin and larry page there s a lot of talk about the importance of a company being founder led dorsey wrote in an email announcing his departure ultimately i believe that s severely limiting and a single point of failure that prediction will now be put to the test at twitter
real estate strategy for the abu dhabi investment authority used to be simple and could be boiled down to one word diversification the giant middle eastern sovereign wealth fund bought trophy retail and office assets in big global cities and that was enough to turn it into the biggest real estate owner in the world for the past five years or so however things have not been so straightforward due to changes in the market and because of unique problems faced by this particular behemoth namely a steady exodus of top management now it has decided to pivot a strategy document quietly published on the opaque fund s website last month sheds some light on a strategic overhaul it suggests adia is moving away from a strategy of trying to profit from the real estate market through diversification coming closer in ethos to big private equity funds like blackstone and carlyle according to the document it plans to pick a few strategies and go big on them and where adia goes other sovereign wealth funds often follow abu dhabi the home of the world s third largest sovereign wealth fund in previous cycles we were successful in building a broadly diversified and well distributed real estate portfolio from both a sub sector and geographical point of view adia deputy director of real estate and infrastructure salem al darmaki said in the strategy paper through extensive in house research and analysis of global trends we identified up to seven macro thematic strategies such as the digitalisation of society for instance where we see longterm opportunity these themes will direct our investment activity over the coming years this top down view is merged with bottom up high conviction investment ideas al darmaki added that means tapping adia s teams geographic and sector expertise as well as relationships with specialist partners to seek very specific pockets of value in market specific opportunities this is about aligning our investment activity more directly with our view of the future at a more granular level while maintaining the flexibility to capitalise on market opportunities al darmaki said adia declined to comment on questions from bisnow about its revised real estate strategy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis adia was at the forefront of one of the big recent shifts in how large pension funds and sovereign wealth funds decide to invest in real estate in the run up to the crisis big institutions like these gave a significant portion of their real estate allocations to fund managers to invest on their behalf but those investments often fared poorly in the post lehman downturn crucially the institutions didn t have the ability to guide decisions being made by the managers after handing over the money and ceding control adia and other funds like it such as dutch pension fund apg and norway s norges bank investment management decided to build in house teams to invest directly on their own behalf or in joint ventures with sector specialists for adia this strategy allowed it to allocate a significant part of the income created by its oil reserves and build on what was already a large real estate portfolio the fund doesn t publish precise figures but global swf estimated its total asset under management at 849b at the end of 2020 making it the world s third largest wealth fund its real estate holdings are 49b according to pere magazine making it the world s third largest real estate owner as opposed to an investment manager like blackstone or brookfield behind apg and german insurance company allianz but that figure saw it fall from the top spot for the first time in recent years not being the biggest is not inherently a bad thing but it does indicate how adia has had something of a tough period in the asset class in recent years pere in an analysis of adia s real estate strategy revealed that in the past 18 months adia global head of real estate tom arnold left the firm along with americas head gerald fang european head pascal duhamel and acting asia head anthony bertoldi all of these positions are still open the queensmere shopping centre in slough part of adia s development scheme pere also pointed out that when it comes to direct real estate purchases adia has been a net seller each year since 2015 citing data from real capital analytics and in 2020 and 2021 adia has not made a single direct purchase that doesn t mean it hasn t been investing however and the investments it has made indicate how it is changing both the strategy of where and how it invests in its strategy paper adia pointed out that direct real estate deals either solo or in joint ventures are no longer going to be its primary focus we are agnostic to the best mode of access for each opportunity al darmaki said we can back one of our convictions by investing in public or private equity or debt or a combination of all four we have no pre allocated budgets for direct indirect and listed investments and instead will be led by what makes most sense in each situation on a global relative value basis as an example al damarki said that when stock markets dropped at the beginning of the pandemic adia saw value in real estate shares and bought heavily for instance when public markets dropped sharply at the start of the covid 19 pandemic we were able to move at speed and scale into listed opportunities taking advantage of the dislocation between public and private markets and executed a number of sizable investments in our areas of focus he said like private equity firms such as blackstone and brookfield al damarki said adia would be undertaking a smaller number of larger deals in sectors where it had high conviction he did not cite specific sectors but the fund s annual review pointed to recent investments in a chinese logistics platform managed by prologis and indian mortgage lender hdfc pere said adia has invested in gaw capital s asian data centre business idc and provided more than 500m to a 3 5b u s student accommodation vehicle managed by athens georgia based student specialist landmark properties such allocations don t necessarily show up in the deal numbers but indicate that adia is still putting new money into real estate just in a different manner than before life sciences and residential were two of the other investment themes mentioned by adia in its annual report in the uk it is undertaking a mixed use scheme in slough 25 miles to the west of london that includes building 2 500 homes 334k sf of retail and 538k sf of offices on a 14 acre site previously taken up by two shopping centres the scheme indicates that like many investors adia is wary about the future of offices and is far more bullish on residential a previous pre pandemic iteration of the scheme called for 1 100 new apartments and between 1 8m and 2 3m sf of offices while it is too early to fully assess the long term impact of the rapid shifts in consumer behaviour caused by the pandemic the risk of asset obsolescence has significantly increased for real estate investors adia said in its annual report early signs suggest that accelerated moves to more remote working and online shopping along with less international travel represent permanent changes although by what degree is still hard to determine

inflation is soaring businesses are struggling to hire and president joe biden s poll numbers have been in free fall the white house sees a common culprit for it all covid 19 biden s team views the pandemic as the root cause of both the nation s malaise and his own political woes finally controlling covid 19 the white house believes is the skeleton key to rejuvenating the country and reviving biden s own standing but the coronavirus challenge has proved to be vexing for the white house with last summer s premature claims of victory swamped by the more transmissible delta variant millions of americans going unvaccinated and lingering economic effects from the pandemic s darkest days all of that as yet another variant of the virus omicron emerged overseas it is worrying public health officials leading to new travel bans and panicking markets as scientists race to understand how dangerous it may be although the economy has actually been coming back there are multiple signs that covid 19 will leave its scars even if the pandemic fades for now in the administration s view an intransigent minority that is resisting vaccination is spoiling the recovery for the rest of the country forcing masks on the vaccinated and contributing to lingering anxiousness everywhere you look asked why americans aren t getting the message that the economy is improving white house press secretary jen psaki said this past week we re still in the middle of fighting a pandemic and people are sick and tired of that we are too the state of affairs she said affects everything from how people feel about sending their kids out the door to the price for a gallon of gas the administration views vaccination mandates as critical not only to preventing avoidable illness and death but to safeguarding the economic recovery and salvaging biden s political position we have the tools to accelerate the path out of this pandemic widely available white house covid 19 coordinator jeff zients told a coronavirus briefing while he ruled out large scale lockdowns like the united states experienced in 2020 and like those popping up again across europe zients renewed the administration s appeals for more americans to get their shots but on friday the discovery of the new variant in southern africa had much of the world acting to shut down travel from the region and contain a threat that the world health organization suggested could be worse than the ravaging waves from delta inside the white house and among allies of the president there has been frustration for weeks over the slow government action to approve booster shots for all adults the regulatory process they fear contributed to misinformation and confusion around the boosters and means the nation isn t optimally protected for the holiday season biden on friday appealed for unvaccinated americans to be responsible and get the shot and for those eligible for a booster to get that too that is the minimum that everyone should be doing we always talk about whether this is about freedom but i think it s a patriotic responsibility to do that still for all the hand wringing over biden s sagging standing with americans democrats say a turnaround may be within reach from trump to biden people have gone from feeling like it s mourning again in america to feeling on the cusp of morning again in america said party strategist jesse ferguson getting past the pandemic unlocks the door for the economy for our way of life and for people feeling less divided he added to biden s critics though it s a stretch to blame all the nation s problems on covid 19 or to think that containing the virus will solve them senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky in fact puts the blame for high prices on biden s big pandemic relief package saying recently there is no question what is keeping working americans awake at night inflation the runaway prices and unpredictability that democrats policies have fueled the lingering effects of the virus have taken a toll on the president s approval ratings even if his handling of the virus has been seen as a relative strength in an october ap norc poll 54 of americans said they approved of biden s job on the pandemic that was somewhat higher than his approval rating overall and much higher than approval on his handling of the economy at 48 and 41 respectively as recently as july 66 had approved of biden on covid 19 and 59 approved of his job performance overall in last month s poll only about one third of americans said the nation was heading in the right direction down from about half in late february views of the economy have dimmed as well with only about one third saying conditions are good compared with close to half in september to the white house fixing blame on the pandemic is emerging as a modern version of the old it s the economy stupid mantra from the bill clinton years when psaki was pressed on what the administration was doing to contain higher prices she replied we know what the root causes of those are right global supply chain issues the best thing we can do as the government is to get the pandemic under control that s what the president s number one focus is the same message ripples throughout the administration as long as the pandemic continues there will be pandemic driven shortages which is why the best way to fix that is to end the pandemic transportation secretary pete buttigieg said recently stressing the need for vaccination energy secretary jennifer granholm speaking about the administration s response to spiking gasoline prices said getting people vaccinated was the ultimate answer economists largely endorse the sentiment but caution that the solution is not simple the root of the problems in the economy is the virus said harvard economist james stock and the best way to minimize the spread of the virus is to increase vaccinations it s the number one economic policy in my mind but with experts predicting that covid 19 is becoming endemic stock said you ve got to be realistic that it s not going to go away even if the virus fades economists warn there will be harmful lingering effects goldman sachs noted in a recent analysis that roughly half of the 5 million people who have left the labor force since the pandemic have retired making it harder for businesses to regain lost jobs work by stanford university economist nicholas bloom and others indicates that companies expect more people to keep working from home and shopping online a problem for local retailers that depend on office workers to buy lunch and people to return to stores just 5 of americans total work days were at home pre pandemic a figure that is now 25 according to bloom more than three quarters of workers surveyed by his colleagues and him would prefer to have at least one day a week working from home and nearly one third would rather work from home for all five days this could make it harder for employers to evaluate their workers and efficiently use office space the administration is also dealing with a global economy so solving pandemic issues at home has its limits coronavirus outbreaks in asia shut down computer chip plants worsening the shortage of semiconductors one sign that vaccination worldwide could be as critical as the administration s domestic efforts one of the

roosevelt room 12 01 p m est the president good morning folks i hope you all had a happy thanksgiving able to get together with your family and friends and it was great to see so many families getting together this thanksgiving after being apart last year and we have much to be grateful for as a nation when i was elected i said i would always be honest with you so today i want to take a few moments to talk about the new covid variant first identified last week in southern africa it s called the omicron it is and to their credit the scientific community in south africa quickly notified the world of the emergence of this new variant this kind of transparency is to be encouraged and applauded because it increases our ability to respond quickly to any new threats and that s exactly what we did the very day the world health organization identified the new variant i took immediate steps to restrict travel from countries in southern africa but while we have that travel restrictions can slow the speed of omicron it cannot prevent it but here s what it does it gives us time it gives us time to take more actions to move quicker to make sure people understand you have to get your vaccine you have to get the shot you have to get the get the booster if you re sooner or later we re going to see cases of this new variant here in the united states we ll have to face this new threat just as we have faced those that have come before it today there are three messages about the new variant that i want the american people to hear first this variant is a cause for concern not a cause for panic we have the best vaccine in the world the best medicines the best scientists and we re learning more every single day and we ll fight this variant with scientific and knowledgeable actions and speed not chaos and confusion and we have more tools today to fight the variant than we ve ever had before from vaccines to boosters to vaccines for children five years and older and much more a year ago america was floundering against the first variant of covid we beat that variant significantly and then we got hit by a far more powerful threat the delta variant but we took action and now we re seeing deaths from delta come down we ll fight the you know and look we re going to fight and beat this new variant as well we re learning more about this new variant every single day and as we learn more we re going to share that information with the american people candidly and promptly second the best protection i know you re tired of hearing me say this the best protection against this new variant or any of the of the variants out there the ones we ve been dealing with already is getting fully vaccinated and getting a booster shot most americans are fully vaccinated but not yet boosted if you re 18 years or over and got fully vaccinated before june the 1st go get the booster shot today they re free and they re available at 80 000 locations coast to coast a fully vaccinated boosted person is the most protected against covid do not wait go get your booster if it s time for you to do so and if you are not vaccinated now is the time to get vaccinated and take your children to be vaccinated every child age five or older can get safe effective vaccines now while it will be a few weeks before we know everything we need to know about how strongly the existing vaccines protect against the new variant dr fauci who is with me today of our medical team and believe that the vaccines will continue to provide a degree of protection against severe disease and as an additional protections please wear your masks when you re indoors in public settings around other people it protects you it protects those around you third in the event hopefully unlikely that updated vaccinations or boosters are needed to respond to this new variant we will accelerate their development and deployment with every available tool i want to reiterate dr fauci believes that the current vaccines provide at least some protection against the new variant and the boosters strengthen that protection significantly we do not yet believe that additional measures will be needed but so that we are prepared if needed my team is already working with officials at pfizer moderna and johnson johnson to develop contingency plans for vaccines or boosters if needed and i will also direct the fda and the cdc to use the fastest process available without cutting any corners for safety to get such vaccines approved and on the market if needed and we will do that the same way if any modifications are needed or current treatments need used to help those with who get ill with the covid virus look i m i m sparing no effort and removing all roadblocks to keep the american people safe all of this is confusing to a lot of people but if it s confusing to you let me close with this simple message if you are vaccinated but still worried about the new variant get your booster if you aren t vaccinated get that shot go get that first shot my team at the white house will provide me with daily updates this week and on thursday i ll be putting forward a detailed strategy outlining how we re going to fight covid this winter not with shutdowns or lockdowns but with more widespread vaccinations boosters testing and more i promised every american that there will be always be the latest vaccines available and the booster shots available to them and for free and everywhere available every single american free of charge and i will keep that commitment but we need to do more than vaccinate americans to beat the pandemic we have to vaccinate the world as well and america is leading that effort we ve shipped for free more vaccines to other countries than all other countries in the world combined over 275 million vaccines to 110 countries now we need the rest of the world to step up as well let me be clear not a single vaccine shot americans ever send to the rest of the world will ever come at the expense of any american i will always make sure that our people are protected first but vaccinating the world is just one more tool in how we need to meet our moral obligation as americans and how to best protect americans as well the delta variants and now the omicron variant all emerged elsewhere in the world so we can t let up until the world is vaccinated we re protecting americans by doing that as well as we continue this effort let s remember where we stand we re in a very different place as we enter the month of december this month compared to where we were last last sept last christmas last christmas fewer than 1 percent of american adults were vaccinated this christmas the number will be over 71 percent including more than 86 percent of seniors last christmas our children were at risk without a vaccine this christmas we have safe and effective vaccines for children ages five and older with more than 19 million children and counting now vaccinated last year a majority of schools were closed this year 99 percent of our schools are open and let me reiterate once more we also now have booster shots that provide extra protection they are free and convenient there is still time to get your first two shots or your booster shot or get your children vaccinated before christmas all three are available and can be done before christmas if you and your family are fully vaccinated you can celebrate the holidays much more safely and given where we were last year that s a blessing that none of us should take for granted we re throwing everything we can at this virus tracking it from every angle and that s what we have to keep doing that s how we reopened our country that s how we reopened our businesses that s how we reopened our schools that s how even with a pandemic we ve generated a record job creation a record economic growth in this country we ve moved forward in the face of covid 19 we have moved forward in the face of the delta variant and we will move forward now in the face of the omicron variant as well so thank you may god bless our troops and i hope you all have i ll be speaking before then but a merry christmas as we approach it questions q cross talk the president let me call on nancy of bloomberg q thank you so much president biden do you think that other countries will be reluctant to report variants or other strains given the travel ban that you put so quickly on south africa the president no i don t think so i don t think that s what s going to happen and i want to again the reason for the immediate travel ban is there were a significant number of cases unlike any other country well the few around south africa in the world we needed time to give people an opportunity to say get that vaccination now before it it s going to move around the world i think it s almost inevitable there will be at some point that that strain here in the united states but i don t i don t think anyone is going to be reluctant to report we have also moved to do more for example we ve provided more vaccines as i said than all other countries in the world combined and we ve provided significant vaccines as well to south africa and that region as a matter of fact south africa doesn t need any more vaccine they re having trouble getting it out into people s arms and the reluctance is there but no i don t think it s going to have that effect let me call on alexis alexis q alex q we ve got two alex s laughter the president oh alex of reuters q yes thank you so much mr president i wanted to ask if the u s is doing anything to screen international travels for this variant and what is being done if anything internally to see if the virus this variant has already arrived the president well there s a lot being done i m going to turn to dr fauci to answer the last question about what s been done doc dr fauci thank you mr president we already have in place when people come into the united states they have to be tested before they get on and they have to show vaccination documentation so even before omicron came in we have a situation where we ll be able to test and in talking about testing fortunately for us the pcrs that we mostly use would pick up this very unusual variant that has a real large constellation of mutations fortunately for us that the pcrs that we do do pick it up the president and we re following extremely closely the medical community the covid team any developments as it relates to how severe it is how quickly it mutat how quickly it spreads how dangerous it is et cetera we have more work to do in that area and wall street journal sabrina q thank you thank you mr president the uk europe and a growing number of countries have confirmed cases of omicron are you considering additional travel restrictions on countries where the variant has been detected and just separately you ve urged americans to wear masks in indoor public spaces but many states and cities including washington d c have lifted mask mandates so are you calling on state and local and officials to reinstate mask mandates the president with regard to the last question the answer is i encourage everyone to wear a mask when they re indoors in a crowded circumstance like we are right now and unless you re eating or speaking at a microphone and secondly the degree of the spread impacts on whether or not there is a need for any travel restriction but that s not i don t anticipate that at this point and we ll see we ll see where that works and so the other alex doesn t have a heart attack i want to call on him is it is it q yes q mr president hi q two female alex s q two girl alex s q yeah no i m not an alex but i d love to ask one question and then the other alex q can we both ask questions the president okay let me ask the other alex and then you sir q thank you very much q mr president is this the new normal that americans should expect anticipating future potential variants should we expect intermittent travel restrictions and potential drops in the stock market going forward do you have any words of reassurance that this won t become the new normal and then for both you and dr fauci dr fauci said earlier on cbs that lockdowns shutdowns are off the table for restraining covid going forward you said that won t be part of your plan on thursday but why is that why are you taking that off the table the president well to answer your first question first the answer is i expect this not to be the new normal i expect the new normal to be everyone ends up getting vaccinated and the booster shot so we reduce the number of people who aren t protected to such a low degree that we re not seeing the spread of these viruses now we it remains to be seen exactly what the elements of this particular strain are but if they re as i hope then it s not going to be fundamentally different than in the past and in terms of what was the second part of the question q are lockdowns off the table the president yes for now yes q in dealing with this fau dr fauci why is that the president well because we re able to if people are vaccinated and wear their masks there s no need for the lockdowns q sir this the president my last question q yes going on from that question we ve got the christmas period coming up a huge amount of travel would you give it any thought to domestic flights requiring tests or vaccine before people get on planes the same as they do for international flights the president well at this point that s not been recommended i would wait for my the scientific community to give give me a recommendation on that q are travel restrictions too late to be effective sir given that dr fauci says this new variant could already be here the president you understand the point of the of the travel restrict of the restrictions to give us time to get people to get protection to be vaccinated and get the booster that s the reason for it thank you all so very very much i appreciate it thank you and i m sure i ll see you between now and christmas but hope you had a good thanksgiving thanks 12 17 p m est

years helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers getting rich is pretty high on most people s list of financial hopes and aspirations after all it will allow you to not only have more security when making financial decisions but also have more options such as retirement plans or if you want to start investing elsewhere any financial advisor would tell you your long term personal finances and growth depend on more than just what you put in a savings account read what to do if you owe back taxes to the irs how to get rich 5 ways the problem with the idea of getting rich though is that it takes a lot of time and effort get rich quick schemes are almost always nothing but a way to prey on those who are trying to earn more money while struggling financially unless you are born into a wealthy family and a large inheritance is passed to you you will likely have to become rich through a combination of hard work and financial diligence here are five ways experts advise on how to become rich avoid or pay down debt spend intentionally and minimize debt invest in a diversified portfolio work on your career start a side hustle 1 avoid or pay down debt debt especially high interest debt is not necessarily bad in all instances but it is something to be avoided most of the time for instance student loans can be beneficial if the principal and interest rate are not excessive and they help you pursue a lucrative career some experts would contend that student loans are bad debt but i disagree said robert johnson chairman and ceo at economic index associates i would categorize modest student loan debt as being good debt in my opinion student loans get a bad rap again the emphasis is on how you use them student loans can certainly be bad if the numbers don t work in your favor there is no doubt that the system has been abused and that some students have accumulated a mountain of debt and have earned degrees that simply won t provide the earning power to pay that debt back johnson said johnson also emphasized that credit card debt is always bad debt and should be prioritized over student loans ariel acuña founder of independent wealth management firm ltg capital llc recommended putting at least 20 of your paycheck toward debt if you have it 2 spend intentionally and minimize costs if you want to become rich it s important to minimize your costs and be more intentional with your spending this is the second step because it should be one of the first things you do as it leads to saving money spending intentionally and minimizing your costs will require you to keep a budget in doing so you can keep track of exactly how much you spend and where you spend it acuña recommends a checklist of how you will spend develop a prioritized checklist for how you re going to spend your paychecks when you receive them this includes allocating money to debt reduction savings fun emergencies etc your goal should be to minimize costs as much as possible so you can put that money toward building wealth jeff burrow president and lead advisor at sierra ocean said you should ravenously find ways to limit your lifestyle costs and save 25 of your income 3 invest in a diversified portfolio while there are limits to how much you can put into a 401 k or ira those limits are high enough that many people are not able to reach them and if you do you can always invest more in a taxable brokerage account thus if you want to become rich you should invest as much as you can there is no upper limit to that amount there are many different investment strategies but most experts recommend putting most of your money in the stock market to get rich some recommend a smaller portion of real estate or even speculative investments burrow recommends a portfolio of 65 stocks 25 real estate and 10 speculative asset of choice you will want to invest that money in a tax advantaged account such as a 401 k or ira first that will help you minimize your tax bill and thus increase your returns over time if you manage to max out all tax advantaged accounts you can move to a brokerage account 4 work on your career there is no substitute for higher income as they say there is only so much you can cut in terms of expenses but there is no limit to how much your income can increase at least in theory ensure that as you advance in your career business main occupation you always save more than you spend as you earn raises and increase your gross income burrow said lifestyle cost creep will absolutely wreck a plan to get rich as quickly as possible of course increasing your income will be contingent upon the job you have those working hourly jobs for example may have minimal leverage to increase their income but if it is possible for you to move up the corporate ladder that can be a powerful way to become rich as you will be able to save and invest more 5 start a side hustle the idea of a side gig or extra work is nothing new but if you have some extra time and you can pick up some extra work for a few hours a week that can be a powerful way to increase your income gig economy work such as uber and taskrabbit make it easy to find flexible work and there is no shortage of lists of types of side hustles to be found online finding a side hustle is sometimes easier said than done but this can be extra money that you can continue to invest further immediately go try and find two to three side hustles that can boost your take home income save as much of that as you can burrow said final take to go in
