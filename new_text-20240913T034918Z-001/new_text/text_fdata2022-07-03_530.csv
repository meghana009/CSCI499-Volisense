the mall of america is one step closer to becoming the home of a supersized water park decades in the making after its owners found a way to borrow the money they need to build it but economic conditions are creating new challenges for the project most recently estimated at 430 million and the clock is ticking a state provision temporarily giving cities more flexibility in how they spend tax increment financing tif dollars a key part of plans to fund the water park is set to expire at the end of the year our hope is to place the financing yet this summer and start construction this fall however the current financing and construction market challenges may delay this project until conditions improve the mall of america said in a statement the st paul port authority could issue up to 445 million in taxable conduit revenue bonds which will be sold only to qualified buyers who could earn interest up to 12 investors not the city of st paul or bloomington taxpayers will take on the risk associated with the bonds which will be backed by the water park s future revenue and assets if the water park fails to turn a profit bondholders will lose out interim port authority president todd hurley said the project is likely the authority s largest bond issuance to date the agency agreed to serve as the conduit because the project aligns with its economic development goals for the region he said the 360 000 square foot attraction dubbed mystery cove water park would feature waterslides a 1 400 foot lazy river and a wave pool with an indoor beach front a 1 600 stall parking ramp would be built on the site which is owned by triple five the company that owns the mall of america there would also be space for a hotel and future commercial expansion though bloomington and its own port authority have the power to issue bonds the city and agency wanted to maintain a more traditional role with a focus on the project s tax increment financing said schane rudlang administrator of bloomington s port authority tif is a tool cities and other public authorities use to pay for development in the public interest by capturing the incremental property tax increases those developments create triple five has been interested in building the mall of america water park since the 1980s an economic impact study commissioned in 2018 estimated the project would attract more than 900 000 visitors and generate 15 million in tax revenue each year around that time triple five worked with the bloomington port authority and city council to devise a unique and complex nonprofit model to finance build and own the water park but the covid 19 pandemic put the project on hold a new financing path opened up last year when the state legislature gave cities special permission to use tif to spur private development and create jobs a provision aimed at boosting economic recovery in the wake of the pandemic according to the law the tax increments must be obligated by the end of this year and used for projects that will start construction before 2025 bloomington and its port authority voted in march to create a tif district that will generate 105 million for water park development most of which will go toward roads infrastructure and parking uncertainty remains because development costs keep growing between inflation labor and supply shortages and rising interest rates the estimated costs that the mall of america expects to shoulder have grown to 325 million up from a roughly 260 million pre pandemic price tag lisa washburn a municipal market analytics managing director who leads the massachusetts based firm s consulting division pointed out that pre pandemic financing plans for the water park guaranteed the debt with a pledge to raise sales taxes at the mall of america if park revenue fell short that plan was scuttled as the project s costs and risks are rising she said in the prior iteration of the transaction the par amount of the bonds was lower the issue was going to be tax exempt the rate environment was more favorable covid hadn t emerged inflation wasn t a meaningful factor and the risk of recession wasn t escalating she said i wonder and am skeptical of how this all pencils out in the feasibility report a statement from the mall of america said the new financing strategy allows developers to avoid restrictions associated with tax exempt ownership and financing triple five and underwriting firm barclays believe the municipal bond market is deeper than the private bond market which would result in lower borrowing costs the statement said it added that project leaders have no plans to lobby the legislature to change its deadline and believe there is still adequate time to work through the challenges rudlang of the bloomington port authority was similarly hopeful we re working hard on it he said

by hope karnopp wisconsin watch on a mid june weekend raquel urbina made seven trips to milwaukee area grocery stores in search of the hypoallergenic baby formula she needs to feed her 10 month old daughter she had little time to spare her monthly supplemental nutrition benefits through the state s women infants and children wic program were set to expire in a few days on that sunday she finally succeeded in what felt like a treasure hunt she found four cans of reckitt mead johnson s enfamil nutramigen formula at a walmart in greenfield wisconsin about 10 miles from her home stressful hunts for baby formula have dominated life for months for millions of parents and caregivers who rely on it to feed their children the formula shortage resulted from pandemic related supply chain issues and two shutdowns of an abbott nutrition plant in sturgis michigan first amid an investigation into reports of bacterial infections and more recently due to flooding federal rules require wic programs to choose one vendor to provide formula and abbott is the sole supplier in most states the shortage affects parents of all backgrounds but urbina and others who navigate formula purchases through wic face particular challenges not all retailers accept wic and before parents try to find formula in stores they must first confirm which products the state allows them to buy with their benefits options limited in wic under wisconsin s contract with abbott that began in 2021 wic participants can normally spend their benefits only on five abbott manufactured similac formulas unless they request a special medical formula the wisconsin department of health services which administers wic allowed parents to purchase other brands and sizes of formula soon after abbott s recall but even locating scarce substitutes has proved difficult some parents have formed online communities to help including the milwaukee formula parents facebook group of which urbina is an administrator she helps approve posts in the group where more than 3 000 members swap tips offer up extra cans and post photos of grocery store aisles to alert parents about what is in stock activity in the group suggests that nutramigen remains especially hard to find that complicates life for urbina who switched brands at her doctor s suggestion following abbott s recall of certain cans of similac alimentum which she previously used but the only state approved alternatives for nutramigen are larger sized containers not different brands which urbina didn t learn until weeks after the substitutes were announced had she remained on the abbott brand she would have more options it was discouraging because as much as i understand that similac parents were affected i was a similac parent at one point and so i had to switch to nutramigen and now i m affected as well urbina said i m not given options i m not given alternatives roots of a crisis how could one plant s troubles so severely crimp the nation s infant formula supply the challenges are rooted in the market s consolidation wic officials and experts say with one manufacturing plant being closed for a few weeks it should not have this scale of a threat to the supply that our parents are facing right now said camen haessig who chairs the wisconsin wic association and directs the wood county health department s wic program states began signing exclusive contracts with formula providers decades ago to secure large rebates a trend that began amid worries about rising formula costs three companies hold the contracts across all states to provide formula through wic which accounts for about half of all infant formula purchases in the country abbott which did not respond to requests for comment exclusively provides formula to wic programs in two thirds of states reckitt mead johnson and gerber serve the remaining states while consolidation in the formula market existed before the contract system smaller companies have found it difficult to compete the ripple effects from abbott s disruption illustrate the market s vulnerabilities prompting policymakers to consider how to prevent a future crisis exclusive contracts bring savings and risk since 1989 the federal government has required states to pick one formula provider for wic or find an alternative way to save equally on costs states continue to choose a single provider thus limiting choices for enrollees they award contracts to the manufacturer who bids the lowest net price the wholesale formula price minus rebates for each container of standard formula that wic families purchase the rebates enable wisconsin to serve all eligible enrolled participants without a waiting list for more than 20 years wic has not turned away eligible applicants or put them on a waiting list due to lack of funds according to the center on budget and policy priorities a progressive leaning think tank in wisconsin about 84 000 people participated in wic in april nutritional risk household size and income level help determine eligibility a wisconsin family of two making up to 33 874 annually can qualify under dhs most recent standards in 2021 the state saved 20 3 million in rebates through the contract with abbott nationwide yearly savings from rebates are around 1 6 billion supporting one in four participants each month according to the u s department of agriculture even manufacturers who offer the most generous rebates benefit from the state contracts which increase their brand s visibility reputation and availability giving products more shelf space and even increasing sales to parents not enrolled in wic abbott offers wisconsin a range of rebates up to 134 of the wholesale price for the powdered form of similac advance a basic formula the company is also giving discounts some as high as 186 on substitutes through august 31 but alongside the economic benefits of rebates the current shortage illustrates that exclusive contracts have posed a lot of challenges haessig said when few companies with highly centralized operations command the overwhelming majority of the domestic infant formula supply a single plant being shuttered for a few weeks can have catastrophic effects dhs spokesperson elizabeth goodsitt wrote in response to emailed questions changing the bidding process could give participants more options goodsitt wrote but the financial trade off is unknown experts warn that abandoning exclusive contracts could increase program costs and jeopardize the state s ability to serve everyone who is eligible splitting out some of the contract or allowing a second company to join in the bid could help diversify the industry said steven abrams a professor of pediatrics at dell medical school at the university of texas at austin but i think everyone s got to be honest it s going to cost money because companies are unlikely to give the same level of rebates abrams said investigating consolidation preventing future shortages federal officials have voiced concerns about the infant formula industry s lack of competition and supply vulnerabilities the federal trade commission in may launched an inquiry of issues such as the effects of state wic contracts on the formula market families experiences purchasing formula through wic and the impact of mergers and acquisitions the ftc said it will evaluate the results of its inquiry with the usda to consider policies that boost market resilience the agency also investigated the formula industry in the early 1990s a district court ruled in abbott s favor after the ftc sued the company alleging that it conspired with others to rig the bid for puerto rico s contract two other companies gave the federal government 3 6 million pounds of formula through a settlement of lesser complaints in its new inquiry ftc solicited public input for a month and received just over 300 comments through late june with multiple suggesting re examining bidding practices allowing wic to contract with more than one company would benefit the program the wisconsin wic association commented the national wic association called for stronger more uniform terms in contracts to ensure that manufacturers are prepared when supply challenges arise in may president joe biden signed the access to baby formula act which requires new or renewed wic contracts to include a manufacturer s contingency plans for recalls including how a manufacturer would protect wic participants from disruptions but that protection won t immediately affect wisconsin s wic program whose contract isn t up for renewal until 2026 goodsitt said dhs is exploring intermediate steps such as amending the contract to include contingency plans when it s rigid it breaks while the formula substitutions will be available at least through august advocates hope that wic will extend flexibilities for other foods and services that the federal government allowed during the pandemic wic has rapidly adapted within months to ensure formula access during the shortage the national wic association wrote to the ftc this significant shift in program services must translate to long term stability aside from infant formula nutritional services and health care referrals wic provides access to fruits vegetables and other nutritious foods during the pandemic the federal waivers allowed wisconsin to widen food access including to milk with any fat content and different bread and juice sizes the pandemic showed that people needed flexibility to access needed nutrition said maureen fitzgerald vice president of government relations for feeding america eastern wisconsin wic is a very prescriptive program it is great for new moms and babies to get the nutrition that they need but it s also sometimes difficult because you have to have the specific brand and you have to have the specific size of that brand fitzgerald said when it s rigid it breaks frequently and that s what happened during future emergencies disasters and supply chain disruptions the access to baby formula act allows usda to adjust wic program requirements as long as the changes maintain nutritional quality usda has extended most pandemic waivers until 90 days after the national public health emergency expires which is expected to continue past mid july the national wic association wants flexibilities to continue including allowing participants to enroll or reenroll via phone or video usda early in the pandemic waived a physical presence requirement for applicants in all states a bipartisan proposal in congress to allow remote appointments permanently has yet to receive a hearing having those flexibilities has been so important for our families to be able to find our wic items because it is so specific haessig said we are advocating and hoping that those will be extended there s a lot going on and going through congress right now to advocate for those changes the nonprofit

new recipe from coast packing s corporate chef will have folks coming back for more vernon calif july 2 2022 prnewswire prweb while fried chicken caught on as a staple of fourth of july picnics right after the second world war coast packing company s corporate chef greg hozinsky is literally beefing up that tradition this year with a new recipe that bathes the bird in beef tallow our fried chicken recipe for this july 4th declares our independence from dry flavorless fowl and embraces an amazingly moist and savory way to prepare this holiday favorite chef greg says when it comes to frying chicken there are many choices of fat for deep frying so why tallow because the flavor that tallow imparts gives the dish more complexity tallow is also far superior when you want a dry non oily crisp texture really nothing compares for deep frying performance ingredients 3 ½ 4 pound whole chicken 2 cups buttermilk 2 egg whites 3 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 1 teaspoon paprika ½ teaspoon garlic powder ½ teaspoon onion powder ½ teaspoon dry thyme ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper for the dredge 4 cups all purpose flour ½ cup cornstarch 1 tablespoon baking soda 1 tablespoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon black pepper 7 8 cups of beef tallow for frying prepping the chicken start off by removing the chicken from any packaging and pat it dry most whole chickens will be around 4 lb for this recipe a chicken between 3 ½ 4 pounds works best buy a chicken already cut up or have a butcher do it for you once you learn how to do it it s worth the extra effort a 10 piece bone in chicken works best 2 legs 2 thighs 2 wings and 2 breasts cut in half for a total of 4 breast pieces to cut up the chicken start with the breast side down and remove the wings by cutting them just behind the joint this is a good time to nip off the wing tips as well next flip the chicken over with the breast side up and cut the skin where the leg meets the breast apply downward pressure on the legs and thighs until the thigh bone pops then carefully use the knife to cut on the leg and thigh then separate the leg and thigh note the line of fat on the bottom side use this as the guide and cut down to separate the leg and thigh for the breast use the knife to cut above the spine when you reach the end pull the breast up and finish cutting through saving the spine for stock with the skin side down cut through the breast plate and finish separating the breasts next split each breast crosswise trying to keep the size as equal as possible here s a tip since a picture is worth 1 000 make sure to watch the video for this recipe once the chicken pieces have been cut season well with paprika ½ teaspoon black pepper and 2 teaspoons of kosher salt this is called a dry brine let the chicken rest in the refrigerator for about an hour if possible for the dredge in a large bowl combine all purpose flour cornstarch salt pepper and baking soda mix well with a wire whisk and set aside for later while baking soda may seem an odd ingredient it works to balance out the ph levels of the chicken resulting in a crispier longer lasting crispy crust to prepare the marinade start off by separating the egg yolks and the whites being careful not to break any yolks or the whites won t whip you won t need the yolks for this recipe so reserve them for another recipe add the salt to a large bowl containing the egg whites whip until frothy but not more than is needed to create soft peaks add the remaining black pepper garlic powder onion powder cayenne and thyme and mix well pour in the buttermilk and gently stir to combine be careful to keep as much air in the marinade as possible lightly dredge the chicken in the flour mix shake off any extra then submerge in the marinade and let it marinate for about 2 hours dredging the chicken while dredging or a few minutes before you start place the 7 8 cups of beef tallow into a heavy bottom pot or deep fryer fill the pot no more than halfway if using a pot keep a digital thermometer handy the ideal temperature for frying bone in chicken is about 325 335 degrees this allows time for the chicken to cook in the fryer before it s transferred to the oven and it keeps the color golden remove a piece of chicken and place into the flour dredge using your hands to coat the chicken well don t shake off extra flour you want a nice coating the extra flour becomes the crispy bits and is often what guests like best about fried chicken repeat the process until all the chicken is coated frying the chicken pre heat oven to 400 degrees cook the chicken in batches gently placing a few pieces into the hot beef tallow here s a tip gently place the chicken into the oil as you release the chicken let it fall away from you that way if it splashes you ll avoid potential burns when choosing what pieces to fry together try to cook similar size pieces at the same time a small wing and large breast won t take the same amount of time to cook so keeping batches consistent is helpful cook chicken breasts for about 8 minutes thighs and legs for about 6 minutes and wings about 5 minutes finish everything in the oven when the chicken is golden brown remove it when the chicken comes out of the fryer transfer to a sheet pan lined with a wire rack place into the middle rack of the oven and cook each piece until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 170 degrees usually about 15 20 minutes serve hot in the sweet spirit of the fourth drizzle with just a bit of honey about coast packing company now marking its 100th year in business coast

comrades i fear that we are not ready for this jelly 13 trillion wiped off markets in worst six months on record the global market rout has wiped 13 trillion off world stocks in the worst start to any year on record as business and consumer confidence collapses amid surging inflation the msci world equity index has shed more than 20pc so far this year in the steepest first half decline since its creation led by a plunge in loss making tech companies as investors panic over the end of ultra low interest rates in the uk the ftse 100 fell 1 96pc on thursday to close out its worst month since the early days of the covid pandemic since 2008 central banks in a desperate move to gloss over the obscene greed and malfeasance of corporate banks printed 25trillion which kicked the can of reckoning down the road for a decade we ve run out of road and us federal reserve chairman jerome powell is being very clear that shit is about to hit the fan tdb recommends newzengine com powell no guarantee us fed can tame inflation spare jobs united states federal reserve chairman jerome powell said there s no guarantee the central bank can tame runaway inflation without hurting the job market speaking on wednesday us time at a european central bank forum in sintra portugal powell repeated his hope that the fed can achieve a so called soft landing raising interest rates just enough to slow the economy and rein in surging consumer prices without causing a recession and sharply raising the unemployment rate we believe we can do that that is our aim he said but the russian invasion of ukraine he said had made the job more difficult by disrupting commerce and driving up the price of food energy and chemicals the quantitive easing has artificially created the lowest interest rate in 5000 years inflation never raised its hideous hegemony upturning head since 2008 because global supply chains reaching into the deepest darkest part of non unionised labour camps in china india bangladesh etc etc etc kept labour costs suppressed in the west as domestic working classes were sacrificed for 700 iphones that sacrifice came at the political cost of trump in america and brexit in the uk the pandemic however has destroyed those supply chains and geopolitical fiction is forcing western transnationals to pull their supply chains with all the increased labour and environmental costs that entails into friendly ally territory supply side stresses can t be solved by macro inflation adjustment without enormous implosions as the true gravity of all that debt collapses in upon itself in an event horizon of a steep and deep economic depression there is ample reason to believe that the next recession will be marked by a severe stagflationary debt crisis as a share of global gdp private and public debt levels are much higher today than in the past having risen from 200 in 1999 to 350 today with a particularly sharp increase since the start of the pandemic under these conditions rapid normalisation of monetary policy and rising interest rates will drive highly leveraged zombie households companies financial institutions and governments into bankruptcy and default the next crisis will not be like its predecessors in the 1970s we had stagflation but no massive debt crises because debt levels were low after 2008 we had a debt crisis followed by low inflation or deflation because the credit crunch had generated a negative demand shock today we face supply shocks in a context of much higher debt levels implying that we are heading for a combination of 1970s style stagflation and 2008 style debt crises that is a stagflationary debt crisis my point is that an economic depression generated by geopolitical friction beyond our control is going to hit us with enormous social damage and political carnage the left must be ready for this moment unfortunately our focus is on alienating woke dogma virtue signals like hate speech booze prohibition or painting out the lion king in te reo as the greatest cultural achievement since shakespeare we need less alienating pronoun policing on the left and more focus on universal services that provide material well being to people who are hurting right now and will be suffering in 6 months we need solutions to economic turmoil that isn t going to dissipate we need to lift the yoke of taxation off working people the middle classes and beneficiaries and put it onto the 1 richest the corporations the banks and the speculators look at the banks laughing all the way to themselves thanks to the rigged capitalism they manipulate for their australian masters banks post record profits and close in on 5 billion in interest income as mortgage costs spiral the total interest hoovered up by the banks from households and businesses is on track to top 5 billion a quarter as home loan interest rates rise kpmg says we need a financial traction tax gst off food sugar tax first 20 000 tax free we need vastly more money poured directly into our welfare infrastructure paying for essential worker education and training like nurses teachers drs while bonding them here for service we need to stop underfunding our services while allowing corporations to plunder us for monopoly rentals the danger of woke middle class identity politics replacing class left analysis is that the politics devolve into a micro aggression deplatforming campaign that alienates rather than builds solidarity against free market capitalism the true demarcation of power in a democratic capitalist state is the 1 richest their 9 enablers vs the 90 rest of us identity politics simply cements into place a caste system of intersectionism alongside a terminal tribal affiliation to your skin colour gender or identity there needs to be far more common ground and shared values we need to remove the yoke of taxation from the 90 and reset it to the 10 richest the minefield of social justice and it s never ending pure temple deplatforming of everything that triggers it will only drive people further from the left in an intense economic downturn because you can t eat virtue signalling aesthetics between january and march

sir eve wilson letters june 26 a retired headteacher generously makes the point that she does not need the very large pension increase which will be awarded to most if not all public service pensioners on the occasion of the next review i don t begrudge her the windfall it is only seeking to keep pace with inflation the comparisons with less protected retirees however is alarming i am fortunate to be in receipt of a final salary pension but at best i can expect one half of it to cover inflation up to a maximum of 5 per cent the other half receives no increases at all my employer having been unable to meet the cost of continuing a discretionary increase of up to 3 per cent per annum on pre 1997 service i served for 20 years as a trustee of my employer s pension scheme and know only too well the staggering cost of purchasing annuities to fund even minimum annual increments it appears that public service pensions have no upper incremental limits something which no private sector employee can even dream of public servants enjoy virtually total job protection during their working lives and need have no financial worries in retirement either in my experience those happy recipients of taxpayers largesse be they teachers local authority employees or servants of the crown have very little understanding of just how generous are their terms of employment the cost to the treasury is stupendous and surely must be a prime candidate for a levelling up review though levelling down might be more sensible alan quinton eastbourne east sussex sir it s nice to hear that public sector pensioners are to receive an extra 2 000 letters june 26 i m in a defined benefit company pension scheme but 50 per cent of my pension is subject to a rise at the whim of the company we haven t had a penny increase in this portion since 2014 earlier this year the remainder of my pension gave me a 1 3 per cent increase of less than 20 a month different planet keith appleyard west wickham kent sir eve wilson says she realises some pensioners may struggle but that the increase the government has promised is not justified because many more pensioners are wealthy however the state pension triple lock was removed in the last budget when the chancellor broke the conservative manifesto promise to retain it thus plunging many pensioners into real poverty in fact according to a recent report by the centre for ageing better there are now more than two million pensioners living in poverty in the uk this is a shameful figure for one of the world s wealthiest economies add to this the huge rises in the cost of living especially relating to food and energy and it is clear that many probably most of those two million people will be in danger of hypothermia or malnutrition this winter i live in merseyside in a red wall district where voters who usually vote labour switched to conservative because they wanted brexit completed these voters trusted the party manifesto and expected to receive an increase in their pensions this year they have been badly let down by those to whom they gave their support as a result of this betrayal they will be at least 10 worse off each week report june 25 in this area many pensioners live in real poverty food banks are overwhelmed by new claimants many of whom are elderly and a deteriorating housing stock adds to the burden of energy price

current difficulties much of this is deserved no doubt though one must marvel at his ability to carry on with apparent good humour nonetheless i am terrified of what may happen if the plotters succeed

liberal democrats and the scottish national party at the next general election peter hancock corsham wiltshire sir from warm mediterranean shores where i am in conversation with local businessmen i

strimpel misses the mark with her hostile reaction to the us supreme court s overturning of roe v wade america is headed for another civil war where one side has to vanquish the other comment june 26 it s perfectly appropriate to criticise the legal reasoning and ruling in dobbs perhaps concluding that these are errors committed by a court but ms strimpel instead criticises the ruling as if it s the product of a legislature or of a constitutional convention the ultimate question before the court in both roe and dobbs was not the normative one of whether or not american women should have legal access to abortion instead the question was one of fact namely does the us constitution protect the right to abortion roe found that it does dobbs found that it doesn t even if the majority of justices in dobbs are mistaken no less mistaken are the many pundits who judge the court according to how well or poorly it achieves particular policy outcomes rather than according to how well or

school and doing stupid things i got stabbed at age 15 it was tough have you ever struggled to make ends meet yes i joined the army when i was 17 and left when i was 45 and for most of that time i struggled the most difficult period was when i had a young family i didn t have a great education so i wanted to give my kids the best chance in life i wanted to make sure they had everything i didn t have when i was growing up including the opportunity to go to private school i had four kids at the time i now have six and two of them went to private school so i had to earn extra money to pay for that i would moonlight doing security work every time i got leave or weekends off a lot of military guys did that that s just how it was have you ever been paid silly money yes when i eventually left the military in 2007 and got a proper job i ended up as a bodyguard to celebrities such as angelina jolie brad pitt russell crowe and michael caine i earned really good money three times as much as i was earning in the military i think it was more than 10 000 a month i also did work in the security industry in iraq after the gulf war where i earned a similar amount 10 000 to 12 000 a month i did that full time for about two years and those were the best years financially of my life what was it like guarding celebrities it was great behind closed doors celebrities are just normal people they laugh and joke and take the mickey out of each other they were always respectful to me if i ever said there was a security reason why they couldn t do something they never questioned it they trusted me 100 per cent with that sort of job you re always looking at any threats to them for example there s always a danger of kidnap or somebody wanting to do something to become famous for 15 minutes punch them or do something stupid so your role is to make sure they re protected from that and enable them to have a normal life without being harassed all the time the most expensive thing you bought for fun my motorbike a couple of years ago i bought an indian scout for 12 000 which is a lot of money to me i selfishly decided i wanted to have something just for myself that i could enjoy i try to ride it as much as i can but i ve been so busy over the past year that i ve hardly been on it in safe hands mark billingham protecting film star angelina jolie what is your biggest money mistake not buying property with a bunch of my mates when i first joined the military in the 1980s i remember them saying in 1984 that we should all chip in and buy a property at the time you could get on the housing ladder for 26 000 in surrey from buying one house between them my friends went on to purchase two or three houses each and because of all the price rises they have made a fortune i ll meet these guys now and think i regret my decision but at the time all i was bothered about was partying so i may not have much money in the bank but i have a lot of memories in my memory bank the best money decision you have made buying a three bedroom house in west palm beach in florida with my wife who is american about three years ago we bought it for 300 000 264 000 and now it s probably worth 450 000 370 000 it s near the beach and we have just built a swimming pool in the back garden we spend as much time there as possible i have a holiday home in the uk in hereford where i have a trailer a posh caravan on a leisure park do you save into a pension or buy shares no i have a military pension and i save into an isa i have never really understood pensions and the stock market i like to see where my money is or be able to touch it what is the one luxury you treat yourself to when i travel for work i love treating myself to a five star hotel with spa jacuzzi sauna and steam room i spend between 200 and 300 a night it has to be dog friendly too because my bulldog alfie goes everywhere with me if you were chancellor what would you do i d go after the super rich who seem to manage to avoid paying tax i d shut down tax avoidance schemes and then i d go heavily after the people who commit benefit fraud i d recapture all that money and use it to improve the pay of the military nhs staff the fire brigade the police and teachers what is your number one financial priority to invest in property i d like to buy six modest properties in the uk one for each of my children to make sure that should something ever happen to me i will leave each of them a place to call their own

orcas are one of the biggest ocean predators but in the waters off b c s coast researchers say the hunters are going hungry according to a new study from the university of british columbia endangered southern resident killer whales are missing thousands of their much needed daily calories they are not getting 28 716 calories or about 17 per cent of what they need daily said the study s lead author fanny couture if we talk about humans we will say that it s the equivalent of missing about one meal per day couture is a marine ecologist with ubc s institute for the oceans and fisheries she says the orcas have been in an alarming and consistent energy deficit since 2018 that means the whales used up more energy than what they consumed from food and they are very big animals with big energetic demands she said with fewer than 80 left in the wild southern residents are the smallest orca population in the pacific northwest they have not only been an iconic fixture in b c but are culturally significant to west coast first nations along with her team couture reviewed data from 1979 to 2020 in order to analyze the abundance age and size of the different salmon species the orca s consume chinook salmon represents up to 90 per cent of their food source and we do know their populations have been dwindling as well she said wild chinook also known as king salmon are prized for their large size however their stocks are in steep decline according to the pacific salmon commission which is a joint regulatory body run by canada and the united states chinook salmon populations are down 60 per cent since 1984 fisheries and oceans canada cites a number of factors for a drop in the salmon population including habitat destruction harvest and the effects of climate change there is a real urgency with all of this because the killer whales and the chinook are so connected and we need to really understand what is happening with both the prey and the predator couture said scientists say orcas are not a fasting species and depending on their size need to consume about 200 000 calories a day with such high energy demands a food shortage can devastate a population they share their food almost compulsively so the whole group tends to suffer and get thin if there is food depletion said lance barrett lennard a senior scientist with the raincoast conservation foundation barrett lennard has been studying orcas for more than 30 years and also co authored the ubc study when they go through these periods of not having enough food and being in very poor shape it can impact their ability to hunt reproduce and grow in size barrett lennard says it is often young orcas most impacted when food is scarce adding if they are not properly nourished during the first three years of life they can be around a meter shorter in length by the time they are fully grown in 2019 the federal government announced an enhanced recovery strategy for the southern resident whales that includes area based fishing closures to increase chinook salmon availability if orcas forage the areas in april ottawa put in place more measures to protect the whales in hopes of boosting their dwindling numbers but many scientists say more needs to be done to address the food shortage there has been a lot of effort and money into trying to save the endangered southern residents but clearly need to do more because the population is not recovering barrett lennard said they need safe places where they can forage and we need to keep working on increasing the salmon supply for them as for the new study couture says she hopes it highlights that both killer whales and chinook salmon are important iconic species for the west coast of canada
commercial sale of motherâ s milk under ayush licence has thrown up ethical questions you can buy literally anything these days even human breast milk india is home to the only company in asia that sells motherâ s milk for profit bengaluru based neolacta lifesciences pvt ltd after activists objected to the commercialization of motherâ s milk the food safety and standards authority of india fssai cancelled the companyâ s licence stating that sale of motherâ s milk was not permitted under its regulations however an fssai inspection revealed that the company continues to sell motherâ s milk by obtaining an ayush licence in november 2021 for its product dubbed â naariksheeraâ breast milk neolacta which was established in 2016 had originally obtained a licence from the karnataka office of the fssai in the category of dairy products â it is absolutely shocking that a company is being allowed to collect breast milk from young mothers and sell it like a dairy product with a huge price tag claiming to have added value to it â said nupur bidla of the breastfeeding promotion network of india bpni which had alerted the government to this in 2020 saurabh aggarwal md of neolacta told toi that the company has significant experience in the human milk space supplying technology to set up the first milk bank in australia he said that neolacta had over the past five years â benefited over 51 000 plus premature babies across 450 hospitals â donated breast milk is mainly used to feed premature or sick babies when mothers are unable to nurse them for a variety of reasons usually the milk is sourced through milk banks set up as non profits milk collected from donors healthy lactating mothers is pasteurised analysed for nutrient content and checked for contamination of any kind and is then frozen and stored in most milk banks especially those attached to government hospitals the donated milk is given free of cost however in many others it might be free for a few poor patients but those who can afford it are usually charged a few hundred rupees for 50 ml of donated breast milk there are over 80 non profit human milk banks in india neolacta charges rs 4 500 for 300 ml of frozen breast milk a pre term baby could require about 30 ml per day while a baby on full feed could need as much as 150 ml per day it also sells human milk derived powder that is readily available on e commerce sites as well as its own president of the national neonatology forum nnf dr siddarth ramji told toi that â as a principle we do not support commercialisation of breast milkâ but pointed out that nnf was not a regulatory body dr satish tiwari national convenor of the human milk banking association of india described it as a shame â does the company pay the mothers who are donors do they take it free and sell it at such a high cost no one knows the government should look into this â in a research article published in december 2020 titled â nurture commodified an investigation into commercial human milk supply chainsâ social scientist dr michal nahman and economist prof susan newman from the uk examined the way neolacta functioned speaking to toi prof newman said their research consultants had found evidence that women mainly in rural areas were actively being pursued by ngos and associated â health workersâ and paid either with cash or with food packets she pointed out that in the initial news reports on neolacta they freely admitted to collecting milk from women across four states but have since become more cagey about how they source the milk the article adding that in 2016 an attempt by neolacta to collect breast milk from the largest government hospital for women and children in bengaluru vani vilas was abandoned after serious concerns over the â commercial exploitation of breast milkâ â it was evident from our interviews with neolacta donors intermediaries such as ngos and community health workers and neolacta employees donor milk is not framed as a commodity in spite of the marketisation of neolacta product rather the way in which donor milk is operationalised as a â giftâ or â daanâ in the indian context is built in to how it is commodified â stated the article remuneration would depend upon the volume that women provide and 80 of the revenue would be paid to the mother with the ngo worker taking a 20 cut it added at the time of going to press the ayush ministry had not responded to this reporterâ s queries bpni wrote to the health ministry in february 2020 that â neolacta has been involved in commercializing human milkâ even though the guiding principles for using donor human milk in india in the health ministryâ s â national guidelines on lactation management centers in public health facilitiesâ clearly states â dhm donated human milk cannot be used for any commercial purposeâ with the ministry not responding bpni wrote to fssai asking how the licence was issued neolacta was established in 2016 a year after cambodia banned selling of breastmilk after a public outcry about an american for profit company ambrosia sourcing breast milk from poor women in cambodia and selling it in the us a letter from the cambodian government was quoted as stating â although cambodia is poor and life is difficult it is not at the level that it will sell breast milk from mothers â in the context of cambodia unicef had said in a statement that the trade in breastmilk was â exploiting vulnerable and poor women for profit and commercial purposesâ most countries do not allow the commercial sale of breastmilk dr arun gupta of bpni alleges that neolacta aggressively markets its products on social media â it is using the tactics of the infant formula industry in the way it is targeting healthcare providers to gain legitimacy infant formula companies harp on mothers not having enough milk and neolacta goes on about mothers producing â excess breastmilkâ which they can donate it claims that its products do not come under the ims act which regulates the marketing of infant milk substitutes but it does â said bpni complained to the national neonatology forum nnf in february 2021 the nnf responded in april 2021 to state that the nnf had already taken a decision in its executive board meeting to abstain from providing any form of encouragement to neolacta lifesciences and that a letter communicating this decision had been sent to all the members of the forum officials from the bengaluru branch of fssai inspected the neolacta unit on april 22 and found stocks of packing materials bearing the suspended fssai license which they seized the local fssai office has also asked the company to recall from the market all its products which have used the fssai licence and to disable online selling of such products the company was also issued a notice for carrying out food business without a valid fssai license a commercial company selling breast milk would court healthcare providers including doctors and hospitals to become their suppliers which would increase the cost to the healthcare system and create ethical dilemmas warned public health researcher sarah steele of the university of cambridge in a piece she wrote about commercial human milk banks in october 2021 she added that if mothers moved from donating to non profit milk banks to such companies healthcare providers would be forced to enter into contracts with such companies and this could result in the privatization of a previously public service dr sushma nangia professor and head of the neonatology department in lady hardinge medical college who established a human milk bank explained that donated breast milk might be better than infant formula but was inferior to motherâ s own milk â even for pre term babies their own motherâ s milk is best for them to thrive donated human milk is inferior to motherâ s milk as milk from different sources is pooled and vital nutrients are lost when it is pasteurized obviously there are cases where donated breast milk is needed and that is why we started a bank but we do not prescribe it for all pre term or sick babies neonatologists and the increase in the business of neonatal icus in the private sector are behind the push for donated breastmilk it has become a lucrative business this menace push for commercial donor milk can be curbed if neonatologists invest time and resources in ensuring mother s own milk for her baby rather than going for commercial donor milk and also providing unambiguous information to families that donor milk is not the same as their own mother s milk the government needs to step in and enquire where the milk is being sourced from â said dr nangia foot note if and when the ayush ministry responds the article will be updated
detroit tesla s sales from april through june fell to their lowest quarterly level since last fall as supply chain issues and pandemic restrictions in china hobbled production of its electric vehicles the company on saturday disclosed it sold more than 254 000 cars and suvs from april through june an 18 drop from the first three months of this year and also well below the pace in last year s final quarter the last time tesla sold fewer vehicles globally was in the third quarter of 2021 when it delivered 241 000 on friday the rest of the industry reported a 21 drop in sales during the second quarter as the average price for vehicles skyrocketed to a record of 45 844 amid soaring inflation according to j d power tesla s sales drop may be a harbinger of weaker second quarter earnings for the austin texas company which is the world s top seller of battery powered vehicles and has posted net profits for nearly three years tesla plans to release its full results for the april june period on july 20 like many other stocks tesla shares have been hard hit this year but the 35 decline in tesla s stock price hasn t been entirely tied to the company s see sawing fortunes tesla ceo elon musk also has made a 44 billion bid for twitter which he placed on hold after complaining that it has too many spam bot users who aren t humans much of the erosion in tesla s value has occurred since musk became twitter s largest shareholder and then launched a takeover bid that has raised concerns he has too much on his already crowded plate musk has used his own twitter account which now has more than 100 million followers to discuss the pandemic restrictions that forced the shanghai factory to temporarily close during the quarter wedbush analyst dan ives estimates that more than 40 of tesla s sales come from china and that the shanghai factory produced about 70 000 fewer vehicles due to the shutdowns but tesla signaled things are getting better saturday saying it produced more vehicles during june than in any other month in its history the company didn t disclose the number of vehicles manufactured during june as of early saturday afternoon musk hadn t tweeted about tesla s second quarter sales but he created a bit of a stir late friday with ending an uncharacteristically long nine day silence on twitter his friday tweets included one with him and four his children meeting with pope francis tesla s latest delivery numbers came out a week after the release of an interview with musk in which he described new factories in austin and berlin as money furnaces that were losing billions of dollars because supply chain breakdowns were limiting the number of cars they can produce in a may 30 interview with a tesla owners club that was just released last week musk said that getting the berlin and austin plants functional are overwhelmingly our concerns everything else is a very small thing musk said but added that it s all gonna get fixed real fast musk also has discussed making salaried workers return to offices and a possible 10 cut in tesla s work force due to a possible recession supply chain breakdowns since the onset of covid 19 two years ago have been especially debilitating for automakers who get parts from all corners of the globe a lack of computer chips needed to run cars computers compounded automakers problems and sent prices for used and new cars skyrocketing as the pandemic erupted in the u s in 2020 automakers had to shut factories for eight weeks to help stop the virus from spreading some parts companies canceled orders for semiconductors at the same time demand for laptops tablets and gaming consoles skyrocketed as people stuck at home upgraded their devices by the time auto production resumed chip makers had shifted production to consumer goods creating a shortage of weather resistant automotive grade chips although tesla has fared better than other automakers the industry still can t get enough chips
presented with an opportunity to undertake an honest review of his regime s economic performance the president major general muhammadu buhari retd relapsed into his default mode of living in denial and eerie self congratulation in an interview with bloomberg he made unfounded claims and amid the rubble of a collapsing polity insisted that he would leave nigeria in a far better place than we found it the verdict of the populace the domestic and international community is however unsparing buhari s management of nigeria s economy like virtually other areas of national life has been disastrous most nigerians can hardly wait for his term to end but as usual buhari was in a world of his own claiming successes despite the overwhelming evidence of failure he stated that the economy was on course for sustainable and equitable growth and that boko haram no longer occupied large territories for good measure he added that nigerians were now freely empowered to report corruption these unfounded claims graphically capture his detachment from the harsh reality all through his seven year presidency so far only buhari and his officials rate his performance favourably for most nigerians the wretchedness of the economy is a bitter lived experience and the consensus is that as president his incompetence has been unparalleled bizarrely buhari continues to claim superior performance compared to his predecessors he argues that the economy is better now than in 2015 when he took over he defended the central bank of nigeria s chaotic exchange rate policy everyone else views these policies as catastrophic he also spoke glowingly of his regime s efforts in infrastructure that over 800 federal roads are under construction or rehabilitation and 650 kilometres of rail lines laid helping to alleviate food inflation however nigerians are suffering immense hardship on the roads as most of these projects never seem to be completed his claim that islamist insurgents have been degraded and no longer occupied any territory in nigeria is false the governors of borno katsina kaduna niger and zamfara have confirmed the control of some local government areas he stated that corruption had reduced under him he blamed the electricity crisis on the slow legislative framework initiatives such as the anchor borrower s programme helping farmers compete against artificially lowered imports have boosted rice production to nine million metric tonnes in 2021 from around 5 4mmt in 2015 he told the news agency to be fair he made initial successes in degrading the insurgency implementing the rice production programme to major success and rolled out a slew of executive orders to facilitate investment and trade but all these early gains have given way to all round misery insecurity has emptied the farms and disrupted supply chains corruption and cronyism have degraded the naira and abp islamists fulani militants bandits are terrorising the country and road works are unending the rail projects are expensive and funded by unsustainable debt levels with the unmitigated misery confronting a majority of nigeria s 216 million people therefore his averments do not stand up to scrutiny he had promised much but delivered little the economy is on a cliff afflicted on all fronts complete with power and fuel shortages take infrastructure the 800 highways he cited are permanently under construction the lagos ibadan expressway the country s busiest has been under rehabilitation since 2013 including the seven years under the buhari regime timelines have been shifted on several occasions causing commuters much pain in the same traits are the second niger bridge sagamu benin expressway east west road ibadan ilorin expressway ilesa akure expressway and lagos abeokuta expressway the oshodi apapa expressway has been a no go area for long the only change there was undertaken by the private sector but the gridlock persists buhari s boast is empty because roads are the most significant social investment in an economy hisclaimthat without the 650km rail tracks laid food security would have been imperilled is exaggerated food is still very expensive the composite food index rose to 19 50 percent in may the united nations food and agricultural organisation says 19 4 million nigerians in 21 states and the federal capital territory would face food insecurity between june and august 2022 the world bank says nigeria requires 10 billion annually for at least 10 consecutive years to fix its dilapidated infrastructure borrowing which is the regime s favoured funding source is unwise currently nigeria spends 96 percent of its income to service debt which jumped to n41 6 trillion in the first quarter of 2022 in 2015 total national debt stock was n8 8 trillion the imf projects that by 2026 debt servicing would gulp 100 percent of federal income nigeria s debt to gdp ratio rose from 29 10 percent in2019 to 34 98 percent in 2020 in 2015 it was 20 3 percent really there is nothing to cheer while he met inflation at 9 01 percent in 2015 it rose to 16 82 percent in april and 17 71 percent in may since 2012 the united states federal reserve had set an annual target of 2 0 percent maximum inflation rate in line with other major western economies inflation is being driven by dependence on imports especially food petroleum products drug automobiles new and used and raw materials for industry with no visible economic impetus inflation conflates with the foreign exchange crisis the naira has fallen precipitously in the past seven years exchanging between n600 and n610 to 1 in the parallel market and n425 05 june 30 at the importers and exporters window as against n198 in may 2015 in buhari s nigeria things might get worse instead of privatising the four moribund refineries buhari is holding on to them at the detriment of the economy he has no excuse for this in 2022 petrol subsidies alone will gulp n4 trillion and could reach n5 trillion by december prices of diesel kerosene aviation fuel and lubricants have spiked forcing production and jobs cutbacks by manufacturers the tax policy is chaotic multiple taxation is expanding the national assembly is working on a bill that will make companies pay 1 0 percent of their profits to the nysc trust fund this is apart from the tetfund profit tax and others all this discourages economic growth the oecd says the highest tax to gdp ratio in nigeria was 9 6 percent in 2011 with the lowest being 5 3 percent in 2016 buhari s second year in office tax to gdp declined to 6 0 percent in 2019 from 6 3 in 2018 over the same period 30 african economies recorded an average of 16 6 percent the imf recommends a tax to gdp of 15 percent and above to drive economic growth in the power sector buhari s failure is monumental on may 29 2015 power generation was 2 948 megawatts in january 2019 the average national power generation was 4 056mw an increase of 1 108mw in the five months to may 2022 the sole national grid collapsed 15 times these days many businesses and homes run on generators the manufacturers association of nigeria which has rejected buhari s assertions says the electricity shortages add 45 percent extra to costs in the 2021 misery index nigeria placed 11th unemployment is at a staggering 33 3 percent many state governments struggle to pay salaries and the n30 000 per month minimum wage not surprisingly nigeria odiously became the world s global capital of extreme poverty in 2018 with 86 9 million citizens living below the 1 90 per day threshold seven million more are destined for that miserable category by december 2022 says the world bank buhari has found a ready excuse for his failures in the covid 19 pandemic and russia s war on ukraine but long before these he had thoroughly mismanaged the economy he does not even fight corruption one of his principal campaign promises his celebration of recovering n152 billion in 2021 alone pales into insignificance when juxtaposed with the n171 billion stolen by just one official indeed he has long surrendered to corruption appointing known corrupt persons into high office pardoning two

paris i m in shock a teenage boy sitting near me declared when the lights went up on a recent performance of molière s the forced marriage at the comédie française france s oldest theater company it

guilty party isn t molière wildly different takes on his work have been on show in the paris region while the comédie française whose 2022 program is entirely devoted to molière has invested in dark offbeat productions molière month a yearly theater event run by the city of versailles has delivered traditional gowns and breeches to slightly dull effect no one could accuse louis arene s version of

hard to inject a contemporary sense of absurdity into what is an average play first presented in 1664 as a three act comédie ballet a hybrid genre combining spoken dialogue with danced and sung scenes and streamlined into a one act work four years later in this production all the characters are heavily powdered and wear bald caps as well as prosthetics the size and form of their fake skulls and visible body padding were among the elements drawing cries of disgust from the adolescents in the audience the five person cast milks it all turning standard marriage jokes into ominous physical

dorimène actually isn t against the marriage seeing an opportunity to get rich and reunite with her lover once sganarelle is dead ultimately sganarelle backs out because he fears being a cuckold simultaneously hecq has been present on the comédie française s main stage in a very different capacity as the co director of a stunning staging of molière s the bourgeois gentleman with his partner valérie lesort in which he stars as monsieur jourdain the would be gentleman it means that on some days hecq leaves dorimène behind at 7 30 p m slips into monsieur jourdain s costume and steps onto a different stage an hour later the bourgeois gentleman arguably cements hecq s place as one of the comédie française s most category defying and valuable artists with his gruff voice small frame and

menafn venezuelanalysis caracas july 2 2022 venezuelanalysis com the venezuelan national assembly approved legislation establishing special economic zones sez in the caribbean country the 35 article bill is the latest effort by the maduro administration to attract foreign investment to drive economic recovery as the country remains targeted by wide reaching us sanctions following two parliamentary sessions the new law was endorsed by the pro government united socialist party psuv legislative super majority as well as right wing opposition deputies on thursday óscar figuera the lone deputy from the venezuelan communist party pcv was the only lawmaker not to vote in favor of the sez organic law figuera claimed that the project represents a threat to venezuela s sovereignty by creating areas under the control of transnational capital the approved text which venezuelanalysis has had access to states that the law aims to regulate the creation organization functioning and management of sezs special economic zones are defined as geographical areas under exceptional rules and regulations they can be geared towards a given economic activity from industry to tourism while also prioritizing imports exports or technological development the legal instrument stipulates that private investors in these economic enclaves will receive incentives such as legal assurances a host of tax breaks or exemptions and fast tracked bureaucratic procedures sezs will be created via presidential decree the newly approved legislation will likewise lead to the creation of a superintendency that answers to the country s executive it will be responsible for monitoring sez activity and proposing new ones if certain criteria are deemed to be met the sez superintendency will work alongside the international center for productive investment which is responsible for scouting investors and drawing up investment plans there are eight currently existing sezs created in 2014 under different legislation that failed to develop the maduro government pledged to reevaluate those cases while a number of governors and mayors have lobbied for sezs in their jurisdictions the project has sparked fierce debate amidst chavista ranks critics have voiced concerns that the plan clashes with the constitution while pointing to cases where similar experiments amounted to sweatshops psuv deputy oliver rivas told venezuelanalysis that the sezs should not be seen as the ultimate step towards socialism but rather as a resistance strategy in the face of us promoted economic aggression beyond dogmatically rejecting strategies we should look at examples like china and vietnam the challenges limits and counterweights they had to impose when they partially opened their markets to foreign capital he explained adding that china was able to capitalize on special economic zones to boost public policies rivas a former student organizer stressed that it is the role of the venezuelan state to control and manage sezs and turn the initial advantages for capital in income that can be used to fight inequality venezuela has been mired in a years long economic crisis that was triggered by plummeting oil prices and severely worsened by washington s sanctions regime the us treasury department has targeted several sectors of the south american nation s economy including mining banking and especially the oil industry venezuela s gdp has contracted by more than two thirds since 2014 according to the country s central bank crude production caracas main source of revenue fell to historic lows following the us coercive measures against state oil company pdvsa before modestly recovering last year in the past four years the maduro government has sought to reverse the country s economic fortunes by turning to increasingly liberal prescriptions measures have included the lifting of price and forex controls tax breaks labor deregulation and transferring state assets to private businesses authorities recently announced plans to offer 5 to 10 percent of shares of major public ventures including the largest state bank and the national telecommunications company in stock markets the economic program succeeded in bringing runaway inflation under control while higher oil production and market prices were key for the country s gdp to increase by 4 percent in 2021 the first registered economic growth in seven years multiple forecasts predict double digit growth in 2022 however a sustained recovery remains hampered by the us coercive measures despite the incentives and wide reaching instruments such as the sez law and the contentious anti blockade law foreign corporations have largely avoided coming to venezuela for fear of being targeted by us sanctions washington has threatened and targeted international companies for their venezuela dealings as part of efforts to strangle the country s economy and oust the maduro government simultaneously the

menafn gulf times as a beautiful dawn crept over lake geneva on june 17 a remarkable thing happened at the world trade organisation s headquarters after nearly six days of negotiations at the wto s 12th ministerial conference culminating in a marathon 48 hours of non stop talks ministers and senior officials from the body s 164 member states adopted a historic package of agreements the multilateral deals of a scale and scope that the wto has not achieved since the mid 1990s will help people businesses and the planet for example ministers struck a compromise on a long debated proposal to waive intellectual property protections related to covid 19 countermeasures current covid 19 vaccine supplies remain heavily dependent on the four wto members that together account for over 90 of exported doses as the pandemic has shown many import dependent regions are vulnerable to export restrictions introduced by other countries in the face of domestic crises governments at the centre of the negotiations believe that the outcome which has been criticised by public health activists for doing too little and by pharmaceutical firms for going too far will contribute to ongoing efforts to deconcentrate and diversify vaccine manufacturing capacity this is significant for the future resilience of global vaccine supplies ministers also pledged to keep cross border trade in medical supplies and components open and transparent which will help members to gain better access to products needed to fight this pandemic and to prepare better for the next one next the new agreement on fisheries subsidies finally concluded after nearly 21 years of negotiations will curb the estimated 22bn in annual government support that contributes to the depletion of marine resources by banning subsidies that contribute to illegal unreported and unregulated fishing as well as fishing in the high seas and in overfished stocks the pact represents a major step forward in protecting ocean health the agreement the first in wto history with a primarily environmental objective at its core also launches a second wave of negotiations to enhance the new rules on sustainability including by further disciplining support for overcapacity and overfishing with the world confronting the worst food security crisis in decades wto members pledged to make trade in food and agricultural inputs more predictable which will help to make prices less volatile they adopted a long standing proposal to help the world food programme by ensuring that national export restrictions do not bar the un agency from accessing supplies for the humanitarian relief it provides to millions of people in regions hit by war and natural disasters following the conference one headline proclaimed that a new dawn breaks for the global trading order but success was hardly foreordained all but a few previous wto ministerial meetings had delivered little or broke down in acrimony many observers saw little chance of anything different happening this time particularly given the backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions and the war in ukraine and yet the consensus in geneva was joined by every wto member including ukraine russia the united states china the european union and its member states australia brazil india pakistan south africa and caribbean and pacific island states this was multilateralism at its best members rose above bilateral tensions and chose to invest in the multilateral trading system that for decades has underpinned expanding global trade and prosperity the agreements have put the wto back on track as a results oriented organisation they demonstrate that multilateral negotiations which until recently were increasingly described as moribund can still deliver provided members overcome decades of distrust and work together

every month we ask our freelance writer investors to share their top ideas for dividend stock picks with you here s what they said for july sse what it does sse produces energy and runs a transmission and distribution business in scotland and england by royston wild selecting robust dividend stocks in the current climate requires extra care soaring inflation is threatening to derail the global economy and by extension profitability for uk plc this could have significant ramifications on shareholder payouts in the near term and beyond this is why i think buying sse lse sse shares could be a good idea for investors i believe the biggest threat facing this ftse 100 stock in the near term is a painful hit from any windfall tax it s my opinion that sse is as close to a stress free stock one can get in these uncertain times the business generates electricity one of life s essential phenomena it also operates a power distribution and transmission division that connects 3 8m homes and businesses i wouldn t just buy the utilities business for its robustness though i think earnings here could soar over the next couple of decades as it increases investment in renewable energy sources it hopes to increase renewables output fivefold in the decade to 2031 sse s forward dividend yield sits at a healthy 5 5 royston wild does not own shares in sse rio tinto what it does rio tinto owns and operates a number of mines around the world its largest product is iron ore by stephen wright i m looking carefully at rio tinto lse rio shares in july the stock is a dividend aristocrat meaning that it has increased its base dividend consistently over the last 25 years i think that the stock is facing some headwinds that might give investors a decent opportunity to buy shares at a reasonable price in july high commodity prices have been helpful to rio tinto s business recently and the company has done a good job of taking advantage of this but i think that this might abate slightly in july with interest rates rising and inflation still at high levels i think that demand for finished goods is going to decline i anticipate this weighing demand for rio tinto s raw materials and bringing the stock down if this happens i m looking at buying shares for my portfolio stephen wright does not own shares in rio tinto redrow what it does redrow is a ftse 250 housebuilder with a focus on building good quality mid priced homes designed for existing homeowners by roland head i find that founder led businesses are often safer investments in troubled times thanks to prudent financial management redrow lse rdw founder steve morgan has retired and only owns 15 of the business but i think his influence remains like all housebuilders redrow s share price has fallen in recent months but the stock is starting to look cheap to me with a 6 dividend yield that s covered three times by forecast earnings of course there s still a risk we ll see a much deeper slowdown than the market is expecting however redrow started the year with 240m of net cash and a 1 5bn order book that s equivalent to nine months sales my sums suggest redrow s 6 dividend yield will be safe even if we do suffer a recession for this reason i think this could be a top dividend stock to buy in july i m considering redrow for my own portfolio roland head does not own shares in redrow primary health properties what it does primary health properties is a real estate company that owns healthcare properties across the uk and ireland by edward sheldon cfa there are a few reasons i ve selected primary health properties lse php as my top dividend stock for july the main reason is that the company has defensive attributes not only does it operate in a defensive industry people aren t going to stop going to the doctor because there s a recession but a large chunk of its revenues are backed by the uk government so it s a sleep well at night stock to my mind another reason is that it owns real assets physical assets that have real value to society in the past these kinds of assets have protected investors against inflation additionally there s a nice dividend here at present the prospective yield on offer is around 4 7 this dividend stock does have a slightly higher valuation currently the forward looking p e ratio is around 20 which adds some risk however i m comfortable with the valuation here given the company s defensive attributes and attractive yield edward sheldon has no position in primary health properties warehouse reit what it does warehouse reit owns a diverse collection of well positioned warehouses across the uk primarily serving e commerce enterprises by zaven boyrazian with the pandemic accelerating the adoption of e commerce a growing problem has emerged more products are being bought and sold online requiring greater warehousing space that seems to be running out warehouse reit lse whr is one of several players trying to solve this challenge and so far it s significantly enjoying the tailwinds of surging demand with the value of its storage facilities climbing and management successfully raising rental prices free cash flow has exploded over the years resulting in an attractive dividend yield of 4 2 today a lot of its property acquisitions have been funded through debt and now that interest rates are rising margins are expected to be squeezed in fact that s why its shares have tumbled by 12 since the start of 2022 but with underlying operating margins standing at around 70 i don t see this as a major threat making the recent drop a buying opportunity for investors in my eyes zaven boyrazian does not own shares in warehouse reit hsbc what it does hsbc is a global banking and financial services firm with segments ranging from mortgages to investment banking by andrew woods hsbc lse hsba showed resilience following a fall in profit during the pandemic between 2020 and 2021 pre tax profit more than doubled from 8 7bn to 18 9bn in line with a bounce back in consumer demand and a more favourable economic environment the 2021 dividend payment of 0 25 per share equated to a dividend yield of 4 5 hsbc has been consistent with its yields over the past five years the company may now also benefit from rising interest rates in the uk and us these rates are now at 1 25 and between 1 5 and 1 75 respectively more rises may come in july interest rates are important for a business like hsbc because they can dictate how much it can charge for its lending services these products may include loans and mortgages the cost of living crisis however may deter some potential customers from taking on more debt which could be bad news for hsbc andrew woods does not own shares in hsbc phoenix group holdings what it does phoenix group holdings is the largest long term savings and retirement business in the uk it offers a range of life and pension products across several brands by harshil patel currently yielding 8 phoenix group holdings lse phnx is my top dividend stock pick for july with the average ftse 100 share yielding 4 phoenix group is a breath of fresh air when searching for dividend income with consumer price inflation rising to over 9 it comes close enough to battling rising prices 2021 was an outstanding year for phoenix it delivered record cash generation that allowed for a 3 lift in dividend with resilient cashflow and a strong balance sheet i reckon the future looks bright it has demonstrated an excellent track record with strong dividend growth over the past decade much of that growth came from new acquisitions but what s exciting is that this year s dividend growth arrived organically phoenix is proving to be a growing and sustainable business another characteristic i like is its resilience in volatile markets like the one we have currently it seems its hedging approach might make it more resilient versus many of its peers harshil patel does not own shares in phoenix group holdings unilever what it does unilever is a fast moving consumer goods company dealing with branded products in beauty personal care foods refreshment and home care by kevin godbold i m delighted unilever lse ulvr appears on my high dividend yield stock screens the company s attractions led to the valuation being too high for my taste for years until now worries about recession the war in ukraine and the cost of living crisis have all conspired to drive the stock price down this year however in april chief executive alan jope delivered a reassuring update on recent trading we are executing well in a very challenging input cost environment he said and he reckons underlying sales growth of 7 3 had been driven by strong pricing and that s excellent news because it means unilever s strong brands are maintaining pricing power that suggests an ability to protect margins in inflationary economic environments meanwhile unilever s financial and trading record is a thing of beauty and i have confidence the business can maintain its rising dividend stream in the years ahead kevin godbold does not own shares in unilever yet but likely will do soon british american tobacco what it does operating in 175 markets worldwide british american tobacco manufactures and sells cigarettes as well as other nicotine products by charlie carman unclouded by falling tobacco consumption in developed markets british american tobacco lse bats is a top ftse 100 performer in 2022 the share price has increased 30 this year to date it s a true dividend aristocrat british american tobacco shares offer a 6 dividend yield and shareholder distributions have risen consistently since 1999 in addition the company announced a 2bn share buyback programme earlier this year there are regulatory threats facing this tobacco giant in many key markets for example the us food and drug administration recently announced plans to set maximum nicotine levels in cigarettes and other tobacco products however the company aims to counteract such challenges via its reduced risk vapour products and tobacco free nicotine pouches it s targeting 50m consumers of non combustible products by 2030 the tobacco industry s demise has long been predicted but failed to materialise i believe british american tobacco shares can boost my portfolio s returns for years to come charlie carman owns shares in british american tobacco somero enterprises what it does somero is a manufacturer of laser guided equipment used to place and screed concrete slab in buildings by paul summers i m biased when it comes to somero enterprises lse som i ve held this high quality us focused company within my s s isa for a few years now quite a bit of this has to do with the dividend stream it offers as i type somero is forecast to yield almost 10 in the current financial year that s going to take an awful lot of the sting out of galloping inflation this cash return is also likely to be reasonably covered by profit meaning it should actually get paid one risk i need to continue bearing in mind here is that somero is undoubtedly a cyclical business as such the share price could head lower in the near future if a recession becomes a reality however the stock already trades at less than eight times earnings so i suspect hope a lot of bad news is already priced in paul summers owns shares in somero enterprises grafton what it does grafton is a merchant that sells all sorts of building materials these include timber decor diy items and more by john choong grafton lse gftu is one of the few potential beneficiaries of the government s new help to build scheme unlike help to buy the new initiative won t directly benefit the traditional property developers this is because the new initiative is only available for houses built by self or custom builders due to grafton s excellent relationship with independent builders it could stand to benefit from the tailwind of the new scheme while the group has a manufacturing segment the bulk of its revenue comes from its distribution businesses this is where i expect most of the growth to come from so if the group s top line receives a boost from new builds i expect both its share price and dividend pay out to increase substantially hence making its current share price cheap after all it s currently trading at a p e ratio of 9 14 not to mention grafton has healthy profit margins too which makes it an attractive stock for investors to purchase john choong has no position in grafton
fao is now providing new opportunities for the guna people by sharing knowledge about algae production and processing a new training initiative for coastal indigenous fishers particularly women provides them with alternative sources of income the guna people have lived for centuries on the edge of the caribbean sea in an autonomous indigenous peoples territory in panama it circles the same named gulf and includes an archipelago of around 300 islands naranjo grande a coastal town where the sea represents food work and life itself is located within this territory luisa lopez hurtado has lived here her entire life she has fished with her family off panama s eastern coast for as long as she can remember as a member of the guna indigenous people i grew up by the sea luisa a mother of four sons explains i used to accompany my father on his fishing trips when i was younger the guna people have relied on marine and coastal resources for their survival and livelihood for generations however luisa the president of the naranjo grande women s association claims that overfishing and climate change are making it more difficult for fishermen to make a living fish production has changed since i was a child there isn t as much fish as there used to be and lobsters which were plentiful in the past are becoming increasingly difficult to find she says this is confirmed by maria dickson a 24 year old member of luisa s women s group production has dropped significantly maria says sometimes i think they catch them when they re too small which is why they can t reproduce women play an important role in the guna community with many working in agriculture tourism and handicraft production as well as cleaning and processing fish however they are frequently financially dependent on men the sharp decline in tourism since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic combined with declining fish stocks has had a devastating impact pushing many families particularly women led households into poverty fao is now providing new opportunities for the guna people by sharing knowledge about algae production and processing a new training initiative for coastal indigenous fishers particularly women provides them with alternative sources of income the fao pilot programme supported by the panamanian administration of aquatic resources arap and the territory s indigenous government works with 20 women and five men to share knowledge on how to grow harvest and process marine algae before transforming it into commercial soaps and creams according to alejandro flores fao s senior regional fisheries and aquaculture officer for latin america and the caribbean the goal is to increase guna women s resilience and independence we wanted to collaborate with an indigenous women s organization to contribute to their economic empowerment flores says following discussions with the naranjo grande association fao and arap approached gracilarias de panama a private company specializing in the sustainable cultivation and export of marine algae the company agreed to train the group for free and to purchase their products while gracilarias assisted the guna women in increasing their capacity to cultivate marine algae fao assisted the women in the creation and administration of a rotational fund as well as in the organization of a cooperative for selling their produce participants began planting green algae in november 2021 with the first harvest taking place in february 2022 they sundried the algae and learned how to extract agar a jelly like substance from the algae s walls for use in soaps and cosmetics flores claims that the fund which was established with the proceeds of these economic activities will eventually be used to fund other projects and assist families in times of need it s early days but they ve made significant progress flores says they ve harvested twice already they feel much more empowered now and have contributed more to their families in order to be more self sufficient maria is already ecstatic about the new skills she has acquired i had no idea algae could be cultivated that surprised me she says i can t wait until we can make products and sell them both locally and to tourists that will be a huge help to our economy and i am confident it will have a positive change in the community gracilarias considers the initiative a success and a model not only for women s communities in panama but for the entire region aside from those who participated another 150 guna community members hope to participate in the project in the future gracilarias hopes to eventually collaborate with guna indigenous women on the commercialization of dried seaweed and the use of seaweed planting areas as ecotourism centres for local and foreign visitors in addition to the production of soaps and creams the project is timed to coincide with the international year of artisanal fisheries and aquaculture iyafa 2022 which emphasizes the critical role of small scale fishers and fish workers as well as their contribution to lives and livelihoods fao seeks to create a world in which small scale artisanal fishers fish farmers and fish workers are empowered to contribute to human well being healthy food systems and poverty eradication through responsible and sustainable use of marine and natural resources by recognizing the value of their work source fao

in a fluctuating market the most common advice investors get is to buy your favourite stocks on dips in a new book just keep buying american data scientist and wealth manager nick maggiulli debunks this theory by illustrating how buying the dip actually ends up underperforming the much simpler easier and age old formulae of dollar cost averaging dca in the long run although the two investing strategies might sound the same in reality they are two different concepts dca or rupee cost averaging in the indian context means investing a fixed amount at regular intervals irrespective of whether the stock prices are going up or down on the other hand buy the dip the current mantra of retail investors on dalal street indicates investing only when the stock prices are going down at the prima facie level it appears that buying the dip is a much smarter strategy than the boring dca and will outperform most of the time however historical market data indicates otherwise buy the dip underperforms dca in more than 70 of the 40 year periods starting from 1920 to 1980 this is true despite the fact that you know exactly when the market will hit a bottom says new york based maggiulli who is the chief operating officer and data scientist at ritholtz wealth management in the book published recently by harpercollins he explains that buying the dip works only when you know that a severe decline is coming and you can time it perfectly sharing the data for s p 500 maggiulli says buy the dip does well starting in the 1920s due to the severe 1930s bear market with an ending value up to 20 higher than dca however it stopped doing as well after the 1930s bear market and is continually worse its worst year of performance relative to dca occurs immediately after the 1974 bear market starting to invest in 1975 he said this 1975 2014 period is particularly bad for buy the dip fans because it misses the bottom that occurred in 1974 starting in 1975 the next all time high in the market didn t occur until 1985 meaning there was no dip to buy until after 1985 due to this unfortunate timing for buy the dip dca is easily able to outperform an economics graduate from stanford university maggiulli also runs the famous finance blog ofdollarsanddata com in the book which offers some simple practical and actionable advice on not just savings but also investing he argues that if you just keep buying a diverse set of income producing assets like stocks bonds etc you will end up building wealth with ease so how is the just keep buying mantra different from dca the difference between dca and just keep buying is that just keep buying has the psychological motivation built in it s an aggressive investment approach that allows you to put your wealth building on autopilot it s also much easier to say or remember than dollar cost averaging he told etmarkets over email backed with easy to understand data the book is interspersed with stories and anecdotes to explain all the 5ws and 1h of savings and investing maggiulli doesn t flinch from countering conventional financial wisdom and coming out with arguments like credit card debt isn t always bad and even billionaires don t feel rich
after all there remains a severe imbalance between housing demand and supply that successive governments have failed to address fully britain s population increased by 324 000 a year between 1989 and 2019 over the same period annual housing starts averaged 183 000 even a period of reduced demand caused by present economic challenges may be insufficient to correct a long standing undersupply of new homes indeed population growth is expected to average 210 000 a year between now and 2030 should house prices experience a temporary fall as is widely predicted berkeley is in an excellent position to survive its net cash of 269m may even allow it to improve its market position relative to less financially stable peers through purchasing land at more attractive prices of course it is under no pressure to do so because aided by recent acquisitions it has 8 3bn of estimated future gross margin in its land holdings this means it can be extremely selective in the land it chooses to buy over the next few years furthermore it delivers around 10pc of london s new private and affordable homes this solid foothold when combined with a long term outlook offers it a distinct competitive advantage over more short termist rivals it can capitalise on brownfield redevelopment opportunities which tend to be profitable but complex indeed the company s latest full year results released at the end of last month highlighted its relatively consistent financial performance it expects to continue this trend by generating annual pre tax profits of at least 600m over the next three financial years as a result it plans to return 282m to investors per year through dividends share buybacks or both this amounts to 254p per share which equates to 7pc of the current share price following its recent share price decline a share buyback programme could have even greater long term appeal to investors
world s richest billionaires lose 1 4tn in worst half year ever emmanuel addeh in abuja nigeria lost 1 billion in revenue during the first quarter of this year due to crude oil theft the chief executive officer of the nigerian upstream petroleum regulatory commission nuprc mr gbenga komolafe said at the weekend warning that the development was a threat to the country s economy this is coming as the world s 500 richest people lost 1 4 trillion in the first half of this year a dizzying decline that marks the steepest six month drop the worst ever for the global billionaire class nigeria loses millions of barrels of crude oil a year because of theft and vandalism including the tapping of crude from a maze of pipelines owned by oil majors komolafe according to reuters said that of the 141 million barrels of oil produced in the first quarter of 2022 only about 132 million barrels of oil were received at export terminals this indicates that over nine million barrels of oil were lost to crude oil theft this amounts to a loss in government revenue of about 1 billion in just one quarter komolafe said in a statement this trend poses an existential threat to the oil and gas sector and by extension the nigerian economy if not curbed he added crude oil theft has increased to a daily average of 108 000 barrels in the first quarter of 2022 from 103 000 barrels in 2021 the nuprc boss noted the theft has resulted in the declaration of force majeure at bonny oil gas terminal a pipeline transporting crude from the oil rich niger delta to export vessels among others creating a hostile environment and disincentive to investors president muhammadu buhari had pledged to ensure that oil theft is stopped and had set up dedicated courts to combat the problem but it persisted minister of state for petroleum resources mr timipre sylva said last week he expected to see some improvement in security in the sector enabling nigeria to meet its organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec production quota by the end of august meanwhile a three million barrel cut to daily supplies would push benchmark crude prices to 190 while the worst case scenario of five million could mean stratospheric 380 crude jpmorgan chase analysts have said this the group said would likely happen if us and european penalties prompt russia to inflict retaliatory crude output cuts

prominence during the boom in digital currencies across the last decade before the slump it traded more of the popular bitcoin and ether currencies than its four largest competitors combined 76bn worth each day according to the wall street journal although not without generating a fair share of controversy along the way thriving in the wild west binance has drawn scrutiny from regulators for

between the largely freewheeling crypto sector and the more tightly regulated conventional financial market success was a long time coming zhao seems to be pursuing a silicon valley style strategy of putting market dominance ahead of profit and prudence despite what seems like a meteoric rise his success was a long time coming says forbes he was born in 1977 in china s jiangsu province shortly afterwards his father was exiled for his pro bourgeois intellect and in the 1980s the family moved to canada arriving in vancouver at the age of 12 zhao went on to major in computer science at mcgill university in montreal then worked as an intern at a subcontractor for the tokyo stock exchange where he developed software for matching trade orders after a stint at bloomberg tradebook zhao moved to shanghai to start his first business venture fusion systems before launching a number of early cryptocurrency projects in 2013 and becoming chief technology officer of okcoin in 2017 zhao started

that powers the platform s operations the same year it was founded in its first eight months of operating it rose to become the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume within six months

patriotism that includes stooging or siding with nazis against christians to ganeemead a look at the battlefield from the perspective of a russian soldier that explains why ukraine loses for v victory the advancing army always suffers multiple times greater losses this is simply an axiom of military science nothing can be done about it it just needs to be taken into account when we hear that on the one hand there are such and such losses and on the other hand such and such then we should also clarify under what circumstances and if as a result of offensive actions then who attacked the ratio of attacking and defending forces in people in modern warfare is 11 to 1 this is because of automatic and precision weapons that is if the attacking side has reached the goal of its offensive and has suffered losses in the ratio of the defending 11 to 1 then this is considered an acceptable loss usually the losses are much less the advancing army always suffers multiple times greater losses this is simply an axiom of military science nothing can be done about it it just needs to be taken into account when we hear that on the one hand there are such and such losses and on the other such and such losses then we should also clarify under what circumstances but if we talk about losses then i would like to give a few words to the opposite side the retreating ukrainian army with every onslaught of our troops suffers serious losses i will describe in general terms one major offensive operation that took place before my eyes and the administrator has something to do with ensuring the success of this operation before attacking ukrainian positions they are subjected to massive artillery fire so massive that i m not afraid to call it artillery terror even before the end of the artillery preparation the forces of our infantry begin to advance in the direction of the enemy to the line at the end of the artillery preparation the enemy not yet having time to recover and sum up the damage suffered is faced with an assault on his positions if suddenly the enemy finds the strength to provide at least relatively stubborn resistance then our infantry does not attack but retreats in an organized manner to the original one and the artillery terror begins again and again our infantry approaches this can be repeated 2 3 4 or even more times until the enemy finds himself in a position in which it is simply pointless to continue fighting the losses in killed and wounded are large the fortifications have been severely destroyed equipment and warehouses have been destroyed most often the next attack of our infantry ends with the fact that we go to the positions that were broken and left by the enemy in one of these operations i witnessed a radio conversation between the colonel and the company commander where the colonel shouted with courage in excitement have you managed to kill anyone at all kill them all the f__k you took their positions occupy and kill anyone who resists you can t imagine 32 9kviews edited 09 57 for v victory crests are seriously depleted of resources for example the ratio of artillery activity at the beginning of the operation i described above was approximately 60 40 by the end the tufted artillery was practically silent part of the artillery was knocked out by counter battery work part by aviation but for the most part the lack of ammunition it should be understood that as well as technical depletion it is worth including human depletion as well khokhols from the beginning of the conflict do not consider losses they simply do not keep any detailed statistics in principle mark my words when the war ends and the time comes to collect the stones the losses of the ukrainian army will in principle be impossible to calculate even approximately crests have a lot of different foreign weapons that s just the use of these weapons is not enough for you to understand for us this is no longer any interesting trophies ukrainians are knocked out of their positions and these various grenade launchers are lying around everywhere from american to turkish and german and we continue to stomp on them without any interest in them we have nowhere to put our grenade launchers and then there is this exotic rubbish well they shot from them for comparison they realized that there was not much difference and that s it crests simply ran out of soviet stocks along the borders so they use imported ones which are supplied to them in large volumes and as you may have guessed they generally do not help them much and in the beginning such finds were considered trophies they were given medals and paid according to the price list now if you drag a javelin to the cp they will just send you the f__k now you can get something for which you can still get something you can only bring it with the help of an experienced driver or trawl we erase them into atoms slowly methodically confidently and they cannot make up for this with any imported fittings and most importantly what comes to them albeit through a__ pain that the human resource is exhausted and even if no one keeps statistics there but in real terms they see and understand that they end literally and inevitably 66 0kviews 11 07 to all excellent rybar video of where ukrainians and russians are heading to for the next battle i had posted this earlier from a

excuse for western leaders to have been forcing hohhols to fight under such conditions that is basically sinful in my view in past ages god has destroyed entire nations for that kind of thing my own writeup of the thing by 5 posted onby ganeemead there is no definition of patriotism that includes stooging or siding with nazis against christians to cathi obviously also the whole thing about attackers needing a many to one edge in numbers does not apply when infantry and artillery are being used in the manner your source describes by 6 posted onby ganeemead there is no definition of patriotism that includes stooging or siding with nazis against christians to ganeemead i haven t watched this one but i saw a similar video on sievierodonetsk they trotted out frightened elderly civilians who were unwilling to evacuate because those homes were all they have and some claimed to welcome the russians and claimed ukraine had been shelling them for years but there is several problems with this they see russia is advancing and don t want russia eliminating them so they pretend to welcome the russians remember the turncoats in france who welcomed and worked with the germans these cities are pretty far from the rebel occupied territory and i don t believe there was much fighting in those areas since 2014 i can t find any references to fighing in sievierodonetsk that is before the war started in 2022 i think these scared elderly people are saying what the russians want them to say because they have been occupied by the russians international observers said the russian claims about ukraine shelling civilians in the rebel occupied areas weren t true which again makes me think these are bogus claims made under duress in order to survive the russian occupation to ganeemead obviously also the whole thing about attackers needing a many to one edge in numbers does not apply when infantry and artillery are being used in the manner your source describes most people do not understand how this war is being fought i keep reading posts mocking putin for having made so little territorial gains in x number of months suggesting his war is failing they couldn t be more wrong most people do not understand how this war is being fought i keep reading posts mocking putin for having made so little territorial gains in x number of months suggesting his war is failing they couldn t be more wrong first putin initially had no intention of making this an all out war so he never mobilized russian forces he only brought in 200 000 troops so he obviously had no intention of a full steam ahead clash obviously he never had superior forces numbers zelensky has claimed he has 750 000 troops though experts say it was about 1 3 of that but whatever it was more than putin brought to the battle putin s battle plan had been to fight in a way that minimized russian casualties he did not want to have to take russia into full mobilization and his goals were never territorial gains initially anyway he wanted to kill ukraine s military and their nazis nationalist troops remember initially he did not even intend to stay in ukraine and that only changed after zelensky reneged on concessions made in istanbul and putin realized that nato s plan was to take out putin russia he reworked his plan and decided russia would have to stay forever in early may i posted a video from a russian soldier in izium he described the same scenario that today s soldier did 24 7 longer reaching artillery fire than the ukrainians had and a resulting casualty ratio of 7 u to 1 r saying casualties were rare except for the initial few days when they were 500 and that those commanders had been jailed and new tactics initiated he said putin s orders were to hold back advance slowly and limit russian casualties it s too bad that today s soldier is right and that ukraine is truly not keeping casualty statistics so the world will never know how many young men had their lives snuffed out by that evil corrupt grifter to ganeemead when the woman talks about waiting she means waiting for eight years while being subjected to constant shelling and terrorism by the kiev regime and its nazi military funny the timing it seems that life was fine or at least ok in ukraine at least this part until the neocons finally installed their man in 2014 then it went to hell

they pretend to welcome the russians anything s possible but their performances top notch if they re acting and they don t look like actors remember the turncoats in france who welcomed and worked with the germans depends where in france if it was a german area in france maybe they weren t turncoats these cities are pretty far from the rebel occupied territory and i don t believe there was much fighting in those areas since 2014 i can t find any references to fighing in sievierodonetsk that is before the war started in 2022 probably the case the neocon run ukraine rolled over this russian speaking area and life has sucked then and then you have the azov types that the russian speakers have to deal with i think these scared elderly people are saying what the russians want them to say because they have been occupied by the russians if and when russia makes it to ukrainian speaking areas that will have more likelihood international observers said the russian claims about ukraine shelling civilians in the rebel occupied areas weren t true which again makes me think these are bogus claims made under duress in order to survive the russian occupation the above claims were published throughout the western media before 2022 when there wasn t a clear cut bias so given the credibility of the west and the media since this war started i wouldn t trust international observers one bit at this point by 10 posted onby bobl my hatred of necons globalists exceeds my love of ukraine or any other country other than the us to ganeemead when the woman talks about waiting she means

recipe for disaster to ganeemead the stakes in this war are much higher and different than the western media has portrayed them the motivation of biden to keep this war going is about his desperation to conceal his own corruption in ukraine and the financial benefits many american politicians have received by the massive long term money laundering in that country ukraine has been the main huge slush fund for american politicians for many years the usa as a country has no strategic interest in ukraine but american politicians have become extremely wealthy ripping off ukraine as eager

you post that one poor old woman was totally terrified of something the hohos had been doing for eight years we waited are they all gone are they all gone ушли ушди you think maybe zelensky had taught

so why when the big political story was being unveiled at holyrood was i distracted by a square go at the battered bus shelter of social media for those that have memories dating back to 2012 the twitter wars have never fully subsided now they are back in earnest every statement contradicted and every thesis squashed with a meme or a put down the question is can complexity of debate survive the squabbling banalities and thrive this time round read more alex cole hamilton told off by ballot box scotland after scottish independence claim the fight i want to bring to your attention had two combatants they clearly knew each other of old and may well have been harbouring bad blood from previous meetings but that was not what i took from their battle strangely neither party won and there were no earth shattering observations but unlike so many passing twitter spats it stayed with me for two or three days fleeting and inconsequential but strangely relevant to scotland and its future the fight was about sauchiehall street that furry old artery through glasgow never has a street suffered so badly from arteriosclerosis the battle started in earnest when lawrence donegan a former pop musician with lloyd cole and the commotions now resident in california returned home to scotland his comments were not kind to the buckled old boulevard of his past back in glasgow he announced went for a walk up sauchiehall street what a bang up job the snp council has done of turning one of scotland s most famous streets into a filthy derelict wasteland onwards to a glorious independent scotland with these incompetent cos play tories in charge sauchiehall street is a mess and in that respect donegan s disappointment has merit but as with so many issues we will face in the years to come while simplicity comes easy resolving complexity is a very different skill first let s dispense with a damning touch of nostalgia we are all prone to about our younger days lawrence grew up in post punk glasgow where a mere block stretching down from the art school past the variety bar was nico s brasserie where shock horror you could buy a cappuccino and drink beer from the bottle it was an important cultural space in glasgow nico s was the gathering place of london a r men sent north to discover new bands and so was easy pickings for those that wanted a night out courtesy of a record company corporate credit card i share lawrence s nostalgia for that era when the art school had not been burned to the ground and glasgow reeked of youthful creativity today that once vital block is a sad travesty of its former self that said the decline of sauchiehall street has a much longer history only hastened by covid lockdown many of the shops and bars that have been shuttered are not under the direct influence of local government irrespective of who holds a majority chain store capitalism has been a cruel contributor to many cities and a checklist of now dilapidated streets would stretch from aberdeen to brighton there is not a council across the uk that is not worried about its high streets and no municipality that has the perfect answer complexity runs deep the rise of online shopping and the move to suburban shopping malls has delivered a brutal blow to high street shopping more people visit braehead and the forge shopping centre in a day than walk down sauchiehall street in a week nor is it entirely fair to say that the snp led council have done nothing and are the sorcerers of a putrid decline sauchiehall street now has more pedestrian spaces more cycle lanes and more outdoor spaces for cafes and bars than ever before but lockdown rendered them near redundant another factor in all of this is local entrepreneurship as sauchiehall street has declined so glasgow s neighbourhood villages have thrived the west end and finnieston strathbungo on the southside and dennistoun to the east have all seen noticeable shifts in retail with cafes craft shops turkish barbers pop up shops and artisan bakeries while i would not blame the snp led council i cannot truthfully ascribe this notable success to the administration either it is more a by product of cheaper rents shorter leases and a just do it entrepreneurship led largely by the young who have shown a recognisable desire for personal independence in employment another reason why sauchiehall street look so bad is that it has one of the worst entrances to any major street in europe the carbuncle building that sits astride the motorway and the busy intersection at charing cross is hazardous ugly and an affront to the public realm for many glaswegians the destruction of the old charing cross was an unforgivable act of urban vandalism only the spectacular mansions building reaching up through six stories of red sandstone to two magisterial turrets has survived for all the many things that people may choose to blame on glasgow s snp led council building the m8 motorway through the city is not one of them nor in the spirit of understanding complexity is it entirely fair to blame labour party domination either if you return to the immediate post war period two major factors were dominating urban planning in the western world the interstate highway system in america which was a corollary of the rising sales of family cars and the civic ambition to build better housing for ordinary people we can be clever with hindsight now but at the time there were few dissenters i have studied the building of interstate i 375 one of the major arteries through detroit it has remarkable similarities with what was about to happen to glasgow access to the road required the destruction of black bottom an african american community whose residents were displaced to either new build council housing or peripheral communities in glasgow access and feeder roads changed kinning park the gorbals and charing cross forever cutting argyle street in two and destroying the grand entrance to sauchiehall street to walk the length of argyle street from trongate to the kelvin you must first navigate a chicane of pedestrian bridges that deposit you in anderston where the global glory of the hilton hotel chain enjoys greater access to the city it is easy to mock now but the labour led council of the time were driven by improved transportation slum clearance the urgent need for new housing stock and the ideological grip that americanisation had on public discourse back then very few warned of the dangers to the public realm and the culture of preservation we increasingly value now and such was the power of labour s working class vote that utilitarian social provision would almost certainly have triumphed over heritage the problem with holding fast and hard views on any subject is that as values and attitudes change life can pull a curtain over complexity and so stifle progress so much still has to be fought for a solution to drug deaths greater support for mental health and re aligning our national health service free where it can be at the point of need none of this is simple or solved by slogans read more power grab shows uk government treats devolved nations like children i am convinced in my views that scotland should and will become an independent country but that alone does not iron the creases out of the challenges we face many unanswered questions remain unanswered whether they are about change or the preservation of a failing status quo that labour of all parties should be raging against online disputes will be a prominent feature of the campaigning yet to come but social media by its very nature is best suited to certainties to slogans to put downs and to glib generalisations that is why the more honest and testing debates will be in the public meetings in the village and town halls in civic society conversations and in the long drunken nights that lie ahead let complexity lead us forward and let simplicity be our mortal enemy
delft netherlands ikea officials said this week that the furniture retailer s warehouses in europe are as full as they were before the covid 19 pandemic they noted that being fully stocked is due to the easing of transport bottlenecks in the region in order to reduce global supply chain disruptions during the pandemic and meet record demand the company has been narrowing its range leasing more ships buying containers and re routing goods between warehouses tolga oncu retail manager at ingka group told reuters that in europe the company s slimmed down range of goods was now fully stocked in an interview at the opening of ikea s first inner city store in stockholm sweden oncu said if you look at europe our stores are back at the same inventory levels as we were in 2019 this has happened just recently and now is the time to again start widening the range meanwhile those is the swedish fashion industry said that while it was still being affected supply chain disruptions and delays were gradually easing some 70 percent of ikea s products are manufactured in europe relatively close to its largest sales markets while warning that problems remained elsewhere with regards to europe oncu said we have started to see that some transport corridors are improving the flow of goods is improved and lead times from suppliers to our stores are shortening what we see in europe is that the corridors that were clogged are becoming unclogged the suppliers of our transports are telling us we have more capacity now to transport your goods he added
risk is an inherent part of business and managing its potential consequences means anticipating those events that could generate adverse and costly outcomes for an organization while taking actions to advert and or diminish the effects of such events futures contracts forward contracts swaps inverse floaters and options are a group of financial instruments called derivatives that are available to hedge against financial risk these securities are an agreement to buy or sell an asset whose value is set by the market price or interest rate of some other security derivatives are useful in corporate risk management yet because they are complex highly leveraged and complicated they can lead to significant losses if not properly exercised inappropriate uses of derivatives have led to highly publicized failures for instance britain s barings bank which financed america s 1803 louisiana purchase collapsed in 1995 when one of its derivatives traders lost 1 4 billion for nearly 20 years california s orange county successfully managed an investment fund that generated outstanding returns as long as interest rates declined but when interest rates increased the purchase of very risky derivative products resulted in the fund losing about 2 billion still when properly implemented such as hedging rather than speculating to increase profits derivatives have significant benefits which is why a high percentage of american companies use derivatives regularly a particular derivative known as futures is useful for managing and reducing a variety of risks related to interest rate stock price and exchange rate fluctuations long hedges are futures contracts that are bought to guard against price increases while short hedges are futures contracts that are sold to guard against price declines the futures markets allow a firm to be protected against changes that occur between when a decision is made and when a transaction is completed a firm s risk aversion and its ability to assume the risk in consideration influence its decision to hedge and the futures markets allow a firm flexibility in the timing of its financial transactions show spoiler b 1 company a records its

hedge with its foreign trading partner d the company could sell futures contracts to both its supplier and its foreign trading partner e the company could buy futures contract from both its supplier and its foreign trading partner a derivatives are too complex to be soundly used b derivatives are one of the best financial tools available for managing the risks associated with interest rate stock price and exchange rate variability c derivatives are beneficial to circumvent potential risks a company may face d a firm needs to have flexibility in the timing of its financial transactions e in spite of their pitfalls derivatives are necessary to help a company speculate against risks a because derivatives are complicated and highly leveraged these financial instruments need to be carefully scrutinized b derivatives are best implemented when a company is speculating to maximize its profits c companies use derivatives because of their potential benefits d many firms employ derivatives as a vehicle to manage inherent risks e whether a firm decides to hedge may be influenced by its willingness to assume certain risks a ignite continued research into the mechanism of derivatives b

recent nosedive linked to improved weather conditions on prairies and fund investors reducing their long positions the canola market has likely peaked and will not fully recover from last week s carnage says an analyst both mike jubinville and i feel that it s going to be very very tough to get back to the previous highs right now said marketsfarm analyst bruce burnett the november canola futures contract plummeted almost 200 per tonne between june 1 and june 24 an 18 percent drop prices rebounded 19 per tonne on june 27 but nothing close to addressing the massive market correction that took place last week advertisement read also coming canola crush capacity delayed saskatoon canada s canola crush buildout is not going as smoothly as planned according to the u s department of agriculture i don t know if we ve ever seen a drop quite that large in that short a period of time said ken ball adviser with pi financial it took about a month and a half for the market to fall that much after the 2008 highs good weather conditions in western canada with the notable exception of the water logged regions of manitoba and eastern saskatchewan likely got the ball rolling canola is generally off to a uniformly excellent start on the prairies probably better than we ve seen for quite a long while he said burnett attributes the freefall to another factor this was more the funds getting out of dodge he said advertisement that was part of this whole carnage that we saw managed money reduced their long position by 6 889 contracts in the june 21 weekly commitment of traders report compiled by the united states commodity futures trading commission they also added 429 short contracts burnett doesn t think that situation was unique to canola funds are reducing their long positions in a lot of commodities ball agrees that was a key factor soaring interest and inflation rates falling stock markets and the general unease surrounding the war in ukraine has made the funds anxious on top of that there has been some predator selling where the shorts in the market sense that the longs are under pressure and are selling to drive down prices even further ball thinks the pendulum may have swung too far as it often does when money rushes in or out of commodity markets advertisement canola is now just insanely attractive to crushers or any commercial buyer he said it s probably cheaper than it deserves to be his crush margin index late last week was at 205 per tonne up from 25 per tonne in april that means canola seed values have dropped 180 per tonne more than oil and meal values that s dreamland for a crusher that s actually fantasyland said ball burnett said the ice canola contract likely took some of its cues from the paris rapeseed november 2022 futures contract which has fallen 13 percent since june 1 advertisement strategie grains is forecasting 18 3 million tonnes of european union rapeseed production about one million tonnes more than last year harvest starts soon canadian canola prices are transitioning from old crop to new crop and he agrees with ball that new crop prospects are vastly improved from last year with the drought lifted in most canola growing areas prices have dropped but they are still close to 20 per bushel which is sensational from a historical perspective burnett said prices will be largely weather dependent from now until the end of harvest they could rally if conditions take a sudden downturn in july or august or there is a surge in demand forcing the commercials to buy more ball concurs that weather will be the big determining factor from here on out there are going to be some lost acres in the eastern prairies but he recently spoke to growers in alberta who are thrilled with the change of fortunes in their province they re talking already about getting back up into some of those big booming 60 to 70 bushel per acre yields he said but they still have a long way to go

sahm a former fed economist characterized him as washington s best liked man in a march 2021 profile in the new york times new york magazine deemed powell the world s best bureaucrat times have since changed the labor market has quickly rebounded but inflation now poses the greatest risk to the economic recovery that problem is the fed s to solve and powell is catching just as much flak today as he was winning acclaim one year ago it doesn t help that the fed s popularity had such a long way to fall the central bank was able to shine as an independent within government agency during the kind of crisis that required rapid action kaleb nygaard a senior research associate at the yale program on financial stability and a former chicago fed analyst told insider advertisement while congress was still finalizing its first round of stimulus checks and boosted unemployment benefits the fed had already rolled out all the tools in its toolbox and then some the government actually did pretty well during that first bit in responding to the economic crisis but the fed was able to go super fast which is exactly what you want them to do nygaard added that independence is now acting against the fed s broad appeal the biden administration has punted most of the inflation problem to the central bank with brian deese director of the national economic council telling bloomberg tv on june 10 that the fed has the tools that it needs and we are giving them the space that it needs to operate chief among those tools are higher interest rates and the fed has been using them at a historic pace officials raised the fed s benchmark interest rate by 0 75 percentage points on june 15 marking the largest one off hike since 1994 by lifting rates the central bank aims to slow americans spending and close the gap between supply and demand the increases represent the central bank s best bet for cooling inflation but the same lawmakers that cheered the fed s emergency measures in 2020 are pushing back advertisement the risk is that the measures you re taking will slow down other parts of the economy without getting us the benefit of lower prices sen chris van hollen of maryland told powell higher rates also slow economic growth meaning companies will likely hire at a slower pace and issue smaller raises in the near future several senate democrats hammered powell in a tuesday hearing arguing the fed was slowing the labor market s recovery in hopes of cooling inflation republicans meanwhile pilloried the fed chair for not raising rates sooner and allowing inflation to reach 41 year highs everyday americans aren t happy with the tradeoff either consumer sentiment sits at its lowest recorded level since the late 1970s as households cite inflation for their growing pessimism google searches for recession surged to record highs amid fears that the fed s aggressive hiking plans could slow economic growth to a halt labor activists staked out the federal reserve building in washington dc earlier in june urging policymakers to keep pursuing maximum employment rate hikes might slow inflation they argued but it will slam the brakes on job creation while the unemployment rate for minorities sits well above that for white americans we stand opposed to the federal reserve taking any action that throws black workers under the bus for inflation that we did not cause jennifer wells deputy director of black led organizing at community change said at the june 14 protest we have such a long way to go and they are in that room making decisions to slow what little we have down advertisement powell has defended the fed s decision making throughout arguing on tuesday that officials would ve likely started raising rates earlier if they had known that factors like war and rolling lockdowns in china would complicate the problem he also pointed to the labor market s strength as a sign that the economy is resilient and can withstand higher rates until inflation slows however the fed is playing catch up the central bank took a gamble early in the pandemic nygaard said allowing inflation to run hotter than usual in pursuit of a faster labor market recovery the plan reflected lessons learned from the great recession and the sluggish rebound that followed policymakers saw the risk of overreacting as less than the risk of under reacting but that bet simply didn t work out in the fed s and the country s favor nygaard added they gave it more odds that this would bring employment back without causing inflation it just so happened that inflation got out of hand he said they were on the wrong side of the bet even through it was the right bet to make

the us and western allies have been supplying ukraine with soviet era military weapons for months now but that too is beginning to run out according to a senior us defense official to bypass the shortage the us is trying to simultaneously acquire more soviet equipment and facilitate a switch to nato armaments in ukraine the soviet type equipment stocks are dwindling that doesn t mean we ve reached rock bottom there are still sources of ammunition there are sources of equipment the senior us defense official said in a briefing on june 24 why is ukraine using soviet era weapons once part of the soviet union ukraine s army and its defense industry were built around soviet and russian standard equipment small arms tanks howitzers and other weapons not interchangeable with those of neighbors to the west most of the equipment in the ukrainian military at the beginning of the war was soviet era said mark cancian a senior adviser with the center for strategic and international studies in addition to the tanks ukraine s aircraft and artillery originate from that period artillery in particular has proved decisive in fighting the russians since the war began he added to try and facilitate the soviet era gear ukraine s allies offered up their own stockpiles of russian standard equipment to fill in the ever dwindling stockpiles of ukraine the united states is leading the effort to transfer ammunition parts and additional supplies from ex soviet countries that would match ukraine s needs there are still countries all around the world who we re talking to who want to be able to make their own transition to nato type equipment and are very much willing to provide their equipment the defense official said a challenge to resupply the reliance on soviet and russian weaponry has at times made it a challenge for the united states and nato to provide the weapons ukrainian troops need us artillery pieces provided to ukraine use 155 mm rounds for example which are incompatible with their own howitzers the united states must also send the weapons themselves to properly arm ukraine s artillery capabilities while also providing training to artillerymen in another country while soviet era arms keep coming eastern european countries have been more than happy to offload their old equipment to ukraine in exchange for newer models from the us and nato it s a win win win situation cancian said what we are looking at is not just how we source the soviet type equipment and not just how we source nato equipment to transition it to ukraine we re also looking at how we re ramping up production lines of us and nato equipment so that we can backfill other countries and ourselves so it s a multi pronged effort the defense official added what we are looking at is not just how we source the soviet type equipment and not just how we source nato equipment to transition it to ukraine we re also looking at how we re ramping up production lines of us and nato equipment so that we can backfill other countries and ourselves so it s a multi pronged effort us defense ministry official transitioning to nato gear while the aid does include soviet era ammunition rockets and artillery for ukraine to use for the fight now the biden administration also foresees ukraine and its neighbors using more western equipment over the long term according to a us defense ministry statement transitioning from that equipment to nato standard is something that will take years even decades cancian said so this is not something that s going to happen overnight but i think both sides want to start the process we support the idea of bringing a lot of advanced equipment including also western modern equipment and many different types of equipment nato now has tasked to help ukraine transition from old soviet era equipment to modern nato standard equipment nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said following the meeting of the north atlantic council at the level of heads of state and government ukraine needs a wide range of modern heavy nato standard equipment ukraine needs a wide range of modern heavy nato standard equipment nato secretary general jens stoltenberg but as the war enters its fifth month the west still has not supplied heavy weapons in the numbers that ukraine says it needs said fabrice pothier a former head of policy planning at nato there is a political calculation that we should give a bit more but not so much that somehow we can feed and trigger an escalation that gets out of control and in a way i understand the logic but i think it s profoundly wrong because fundamentally that means we are asking zelensky to fight with one hand the back pothier told voa
former republican gov paul lepage is taking a new tack in his quest to reduce and ultimately eliminate the state s income tax a key talking point in his campaign to unseat democratic gov janet mills this fall lepage told reporters at a maine republican party unity rally in lewiston last month that he no longer wants to start by reducing taxes for upper income brackets and does not intend to make up for the lost state revenue by increasing the sales tax both of which he unsuccessfully pursued as governor instead lepage says he would begin by exempting all seniors from income taxes and then phase out income taxes for others from the bottom up by increasing the amount of income that is tax exempt each year and rather than increasing sales and other taxes to make up for lost revenue lepage said he expects increased economic activity resulting from more people staying in maine or moving back from zero income tax states such as florida would make up for half the cost unidentified budget cuts would make up the rest he said first year seniors no more income tax that s my first one lepage said we might look at the top rate but i think the way to get rid of the income tax is rather than look at the rate increase the exemption it s unclear what triggered the changes to lepage s income tax plan but his previous strategy failed when he was in office in part because of opposition within his own party to raising the sales tax it also comes as lepage has sought to soften his image as he courts independent voters he will need if he is going to unseat mills and earn an unprecedented third nonconsecutive term in office advertisement like other critics of the income tax lepage argues that eliminating it will create economic growth by encouraging more people to stay in the state including high income earners we have so many of our seniors that leave us for six months and a day because of the income tax lepage told lewiston republicans we re losing their capital their intellectual capacity that help s our small businesses their children will want to follow when their parents and grandparents leave it s a domino effect and we need to stop it you can all go to walt disney in january and february but the other 10 months stay in maine and help us become very prosperous opponents however argue that eliminating the income tax will blow a hole in the state budget requiring drastic cuts to services and staff and forcing increases in sales and property taxes which disproportionately affect people with lower incomes and people would still leave the state to escape winters they say mills has not pursued any major shakeup in the state s overall tax structure but has moved to reduce tax burdens on seniors and lower income taxpayers and relieve pressure on property taxes including by increasing the share of education costs paid for by the state mills staff did not respond to requests to interview the governor for this story or respond to the details of lepage s new plan as part of a bipartisan budget plan passed in april mills returned half of a projected 1 2 billion revenue surplus to most taxpayers reduced income taxes for retirees and increased funding for property tax relief and the earned income tax credit advertisement in addition to sending 850 checks to qualifying taxpayers to help deal with inflation mills and the legislature reduced income taxes for public and private pensioners by increasing the deductions for residents from 10 000 to 25 000 providing 36 8 million in tax relief next year that will average 560 per person by 2025 that deduction will increase to 35 000 per individual which would mean average savings of about 795 per person the budget deal also includes an additional 7 million in additional property tax relief for about 100 000 low and middle income homeowners and renters who are eligible for up to 1 000 a year or 1 500 a year for seniors mills also worked to increase the earned income tax credit which provides a refundable tax credit to working maine people and families that s estimated to help 100 000 maine people with incomes of less than 57 414 by increasing the maximum benefit by an average of 400 per family bringing the total eitc benefit per family to an average of 764 per year campaign manager alexandra raposo also said that mills has resisted efforts by members of her own party to increase taxes on the maine people the bottom line is that governor mills has cut taxes and put more money back into the pockets of maine people especially hard working middle class mainers while ensuring that the budget is balanced and that the state meets its obligations to deliver crucial services raposo said she is not interested in repeating lepage s tax shift scheme where he claimed to cut taxes for maine people when he really just shifted their tax burden reducing and eliminating the income tax has been a longstanding and elusive goal for lepage who ran into opposition from his own party during his eight years as governor advertisement lepage and the republican majority in the legislature successfully lowered the top income tax rate from 8 5 percent to 7 15 percent in 2013 but efforts in 2015 to further reduce or eliminate the income tax faced opposition from both republicans and democrats because it would have required an increase in sales taxes to make up for the lost revenues that proposal would have lowered the income tax rate to 5 75 percent by 2019 at a cost of 1 8 billion a year which lepage sought to offset by increasing the sales tax from 5 5 percent to 6 5 percent the sales tax had increased from 5 percent to 5 5 percent as part of the 2013 budget which was adopted after the legislature overrode a lepage veto that increase was meant to be temporary but was made permanent in 2015 once again in a budget adopted despite a lepage veto who vowed to veto all legislation until the legislature passed a constitutional amendment to eliminate the state s income tax last month lepage downplayed the possibility of sales tax increases to make his plan work i don t think we need to he told reporters in lewiston now that i saw what happened when we reduced we went from 8 5 percent down to 7 15 in the income tax and the next year revenues were historical revenues and what we learned was every dollar we cut in taxes 96 cents comes right back into your economy so it grows the economy i m not saying there isn t some adjustments that need to be made he added but i don t believe it should be on the backs of our elderly lucy dadayan a senior research associate for the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and the brookings institution called lepage s plan to phase out the income tax an election year gimmick and irresponsible given an uncertain economic outlook that includes a possible recession looming on the horizon she said about a dozen states have moved to reduce income taxes in the last few years which she expects to be temporary especially if a recession takes hold advertisement we are in a very uncertain fiscal time dadayan said it s important to keep in mind that the sectors that led to revenue growth are likely temporary and that states should not be making drastic decisions with budgets and should be mindful about fiscal uncertainties we might already be in a recession we already see a declining or volatile stock market which will definitely have an impact on income tax revenues on the state budget i think no drastic measures should be taken in a time of uncertainty seven states including florida texas and alaska have no income taxes new hampshire and tennessee only tax capital gains though they recently decided to eliminate that tax dadayan said such a move would be difficult for maine she said because historically at least a third of the state s revenue comes from income taxes and the state lacks an alternative special revenue source such as the oil industry in texas and alaska income taxes provide roughly 2 billion a year to the state or 44 percent of all revenue eliminating income taxes for people over the age of 65 could cost as much as 441 million based on 2020 tax information according to the state s budget agency dadayan pointed to kansas as a cautionary tale adding that studies have repeatedly shown that income tax cuts don t usually generate the additional economic activity promised in 2012 republican gov sam brownback signed a bill ushering in the largest tax cut for businesses and individuals in kansas history eliminating about 230 million in taxes during the first year and a projected 935 million annually after six years the legislation was drafted by the american legislative exchange council a conservative think tank but increased economic activity did not replace the lost revenue in the short term as brownback promised forcing the republican legislature to roll back the tax cuts in 2017 a report published in 2015 by the center on budget and policy priorities a progressive think tank concluded that income tax cuts have not proved to generate economic growth the report mentioned maine as one of the states to have cut income taxes based on this assumption advertisement this approach is not supported by the preponderance of the relevant academic research and has not worked particularly well in the past the report states the states that tried deep income tax cuts over the last three decades have not seen their economies surge as a result lepage argues that maine s income taxes are a big reason why retirees move to florida for six months and a day and that eliminating them would keep more retirees here and even encourage them to move back he concedes that retirees may still go to florida to avoid the cold snowy months but their additional months in maine will help fuel the economy creating more revenue for the state in fact lepage moved to florida shortly after leaving office in 2019 citing the lack of income taxes as a reason he re established residency in maine in 2020 with the goal of challenging mills this fall mike santo a certified public accountant and chairman of the maine society of cpa s taxation committee said that income and other taxes do play a large role in retirement planning for upper middle class and wealthy retirees especially those who are looking to sell a business for example he said someone earning 100 000 in retirement could save 7 000 a year by moving to florida but other factors such as the climate and personal circumstances also play a big role most of these people are older and they just don t want to be here when it s cold santo said advertisement santo said that eliminating the income tax could entice more retirees to maintain their maine residency but it s difficult to say whether enough people would do so to make up for lost state revenue they might still be going to florida for a few months but they may be coming back sooner because they re no longer worried about that six months and a day rule he said it s definitely tough to say that if all of the people coming back would make up that 50 percent of lost revenue from income taxes rep sawin millett r waterford whose expertise on the state budget is respected by both republicans and democrats acknowledged lepage s shifting rhetoric on income taxes and recent calls for a bottom up phaseout that is a new focus this year millett said it s always good to avoid having to tax people who are living hand to mouth if the number is a reasonable number somewhat below a livable wage i think it does make sense millett said it s a legitimate idea that the income tax cuts could generate more economic activity to help offset revenue losses but it would be difficult to put that plan into motion in terms of the budget he said because the budget process does not allow for predictions about how people will behave if income taxes are reduced or eliminated we don t do dynamic fiscal notes in other words you can t really book savings based on taxpayer behavior that hasn t yet occurred millett said you can t do that without evidence that they have returned before you can actually book it advertisement while lepage predicts that increased economic activity would cover half of the lost revenue he also vowed to make up the other half by cutting government waste which he says includes a significant part of the state s workforce during his first two terms lepage targeted safety net programs such as general assistance and other welfare programs for cuts as well as municipal revenue sharing which added pressure to local property taxes in interviews after the republican rally last month lepage said he would target the state s workforce saying he saved the state 275 million by reducing the state s workforce from 14 300 workers to 11 900 he said one area for possible cuts would be the department of transportation state employees we have way too many lepage said we re not an employment agency what we should be doing is having efficient workforce and we should have people going to work we have to become efficient as a government and we re no longer efficient because people work remote so somebody has got to get back on top and see where the waste is there is a lot raposo mills campaign manager said the governor is open to ideas while criticizing lepage s budget management the fact is when lepage says he would cut government waste maine people know that he means he ll come after health care education and public health all of which were either cut outright denied or underfunded while he was governor and all of which gov mills and the legislature have fought to restore or properly fund she said gov mills remains open to real tax cut proposals that truly reduce costs for maine people while maintaining the critical services they rely on related headlines mills lepage look ahead to november in maine governor race send questions comments to the editors

fourth of july weekend no doubt seems a weird time to appeal to readers to help someone in distress but adversity has no respect for calendars if you are fortunate enough to be having a pleasant holiday weekend i hope you ll be generous and go to betty jo s go fund me page right now any amount even 5 would be appreciated but if you can give 25 or 50 or 250 even better since i ve come to the south and hired aides for my mother i ve seen more of the hardships that the working poor face and they seem to be much worse than in new york where social safety nets are better so as much as the us needs fundamental reforms in the meantime we have pressing cases in the here and now despite her southern sounding name betty jo is from the northeast of blackfoot and french stock her past life includes working in her mother s home cleaning business driving a taxi in new york city and later in birmingham working at dollar general and making deliveries for dominos pizza betty jo was my deceased mother s best aide always cheerful and a hard worker she d come in most mornings to get my mother out of bed and take care of her during the day even though my mother was wheelchair bound and it would take muscle to transfer her while betty jo has a rod her lower back and walks with a limp 1 betty jo was proactive anticipating my mother s needs and taking it upon herself to perform additional tasks like diagnose and sometimes even treat car issues she and her deceased husband had a yard care business and three bay car repair shop she was also the only aide to press and sometimes succeed with getting my self professed couch potato mother to perform her physical therapy exercises betty jo never missed a session coming even when she had migraines my mother would send her home early then or when her back was bothering her i ve continued to employ betty jo at even higher rates since she is task focused on my estate related duties while caretaking involves some idle time betty jo would try not to talk about her health and financial problems but they ve become too pressing to ignore she had brain cancer 11 years ago that had metastasized she had an operation and then chemo and radiation therapy even though her treatment did get the cancer the radiation therapy damaged her liver she was also left with medical debt which she kept paying even after the statute of limitations has expired betty jo is very skilled about mechanical matters but is unsophisticated about the law 2 low income people are already in a precarious position and debt puts them on a treadmill they often wind up incurring new debt or get behind on expenses to meet other obligations betty jo has had a run of bad luck her old car had failed but she was able to use unemployment money to buy a not terribly expensive used car but she didn t buy comprehensive coverage the car was hit within two months of her buying it by drunks with no insurance expired drivers licenses and even expired car tags she needed a car for her aide and taxi work and had to buy again when used car prices had jumped sharply due to covid her purchase was a borderline lemon and has needed more repairs than it ought to betty jo has also not been able to afford her liver shots on a consistent basis that plus stress due to her partner of six years leaving her to go back to atlanta3 the emotional blow the having to move the obstacles to her getting a lease crashed her white cell count her soon to be ex found her passed out on the floor she d apparently been there for four hours he took her to the hospital the hospital tossed her out after one night saying they would have kept her longer if she had health insurance betty jo has been in terrible shape for three weeks unable to keep down one of the medications and having intermittent migraines 4 nevertheless her white cell count is getting better and her energy level has improved so she is on the mend but the loss of income and the incoming medical bills have made her bad situation much worse and the added stress isn t helping her recovery without my help she would be living in her car at the end of july but what i can give her isn t enough to pay for her medical emergency her treatment going forward and get her head enough above water that she can put down a big enough deposit to rent a studio please help she s become important to me i hate seeing someone who has no malice and is industrious and conscientious wind up in such a desperate state due to how our medical system places profit over people go to gofundme your gift will make a difference one reader told a story from his childhood when he went with his father to the beach they saw newly hatched turtles trying to get to the sea the boy exclaimed dad they won t make it they will die his father said not this one as he carried it to the water update it s 5 30 am and we already have donations coming in thanks so much _______ 1 betty jo s late teens boyfriend ran over her because she hadn t gotten back from an errand for him fast enough snapping her spine just below her rib cage she said there were tire marks on the dress she was wearing she was paralyzed below her waist and told she would never walk again three years after the assault she had the back surgery that enabled her to use her lower body again 2 you might ask why she did not declare bankruptcy that costs money and she came from a circle where no one does that i suspect it never occurred to her and she never would have been able to work for dollar general had she done so and that position did give her health insurance and a not bad income before they fired a lot of staff during covid 3 far more detail than you want to know but short version is the pretext is to take care of his mother but his mother and his relatives have made clear they are not happy about how he is treating betty jo 4 im doc says liver meds can do that i m getting the name of what she is taking

patience can pay off handsomely when you own stakes in innovative high growth companies this has been one of the most challenging years for wall street and investors in the past half century in terms of peak to trough decline the benchmark s p 500 and growth oriented nasdaq composite have tumbled as much as 24 and 34 respectively this places both indexes in a bear market while bear markets can undoubtedly cause fear and test the resolve of investors they re also a proven opportunity to buy game changing businesses at a discount as a reminder every stock market correction and bear market throughout history has eventually been erased by a bull market rally the current bear market is an especially good time to scoop up supercharged growth stocks that ve been beaten down by short term fear the following three monster growth stocks all have the potential to turn an initial investment of 200 000 into 1 million by 2030 nio the first fast paced company with the potential to quintuple investors money over the coming eight years is china based electric vehicle ev manufacturer nio nio 5 35 over the next couple of quarters there s no question that auto stocks are going to face a veritable mountain of headwinds automakers are contending with semiconductor chip shortages provincial covid 19 shutdowns in china that have led to parts shortages and historically high inflation which is eating into their operating margins yet nio has demonstrated that it has the ability and innovation to become a leading ev producer in china the largest auto market in the world once supply chain issues become a thing of the past nio shouldn t have any trouble ramping up production in a two year stretch the company went from producing fewer than 4 000 evs in a quarter to north of 25 000 in fact production from november and december 2021 alluded to an annual run rate near 130 000 evs without supply constraints i believe nio can ramp to an annual run rate of more than 500 000 evs in 12 months or less what s even more critical to nio s success is its ongoing innovation for instance it recently introduced two sedans the et7 and et5 which ll compete directly against tesla s flagship

insurance company trupanion trup 5 22 the big knock against trupanion is that it s chosen subscriber expansion over near term profits reinvesting in its platform isn t cheap and has resulted in larger losses over the past couple of years but patience can pay off handsomely when investing in the pet industry especially when you have as many competitive advantages as trupanion perhaps the most important thing to understand about pets is that owners will open up their wallets in any economic environment for their four legged feathered and scaled family members data from the american pet products association shows that it s been more than a quarter century since u s year over year spending on pets declined on a more company specific basis trupanion s opportunity lies with its enormous pool of potential members to date the company has only penetrated about 2 of the u s and canadian pet market that compares to a 25 insured rate for pets in the united kingdom if trupanion were able to grow enrollment to 25 of companion animals in the u s it would have an addressable market worth more than 38 billion in other words the pet insurance industry is still in its infancy trupanion is also the only large pet insurance company that provides vet clinics with software to handle payment at the time of service it s one of many reasons trupanion s rapport with vet clinics is unmatched cresco labs a third monster growth stock that can turn a 200 000 investment into 1 million by 2030 is cannabis multi state operator mso cresco labs crlbf cresco ended march with 50 operating dispensaries in 10 states since february 2021 few industries have been more universally disliked by wall street than cannabis the expectation had been that a democrat led congress along with the election of democrat joe biden as president would quickly lead to cannabis reforms passing at the u s federal level but with no marijuana legalization or banking reforms becoming law pot stocks have fallen into a 16 month downtrend while the weed industry has been a buzzkill for more than a year it also offers an intriguing opportunity for patient investors to take advantage of rapid growth in legalized states after all three quarters of all states have given the green light to marijuana in some capacity that s music to the ears of the largest msos such as cresco cresco s most front and center growth opportunity derives from its retail presence cresco has been targeting a number of limited license states such as illinois ohio and massachusetts regulators purposely limiting the number of dispensary licenses issued gives cresco s retail stores a fair chance to build up awareness of its brands and garner a loyal following cresco labs is also in the midst of a transformative deal that ll see it acquire mso columbia care cchwf 4 89 in an all share deal assuming the deal closes cresco labs would have over 130 retail locations in 18 markets columbia care has regularly used acquisitions as a means to expand in buying columbia care cresco would be turning the tables and gain immediate exposure in a number of high dollar markets lastly cresco labs is the u s s largest wholesale cannabis provider wall street often dismisses wholesale marijuana due to its less favorable margins when compared to retail sales however cresco holds a cannabis distribution license in california the largest pot market in the country this allows it to place its proprietary products into more than 575 dispensaries in the golden state this volume advantage more than outweighs the weaker margins associated with wholesale cannabis

former republican gov paul lepage is taking a new tack in his quest to reduce and ultimately eliminate the state s income tax a key talking point in his campaign to unseat democratic gov janet mills this fall lepage told reporters at a maine republican party unity rally in lewiston last month that he no longer wants to start by reducing taxes for upper income brackets and does not intend to make up for the lost state revenue by increasing the sales tax both of which he unsuccessfully pursued as governor instead lepage says he would begin by exempting all seniors from income taxes and then phase out income taxes for others from the bottom up by increasing the amount of income that is tax exempt each year and rather than increasing sales and other taxes to make up for lost revenue lepage said he expects increased economic activity resulting from more people staying in maine or moving back from zero income tax states such as florida would make up for half the cost unidentified budget cuts would make up the rest he said first year seniors no more income tax that s my first one lepage said we might look at the top rate but i think the way to get rid of the income tax is rather than look at the rate increase the exemption it s unclear what triggered the changes to lepage s income tax plan but his previous strategy failed when he was in office in part because of opposition within his own party to raising the sales tax it also comes as lepage has sought to soften his image as he courts independent voters he will need if he is going to unseat mills and earn an unprecedented third nonconsecutive term in office advertisement like other critics of the income tax lepage argues that eliminating it will create economic growth by encouraging more people to stay in the state including high income earners we have so many of our seniors that leave us for six months and a day because of the income tax lepage told lewiston republicans we re losing their capital their intellectual capacity that help s our small businesses their children will want to follow when their parents and grandparents leave it s a domino effect and we need to stop it you can all go to walt disney in january and february but the other 10 months stay in maine and help us become very prosperous opponents however argue that eliminating the income tax will blow a hole in the state budget requiring drastic cuts to services and staff and forcing increases in sales and property taxes which disproportionately affect people with lower incomes and people would still leave the state to escape winters they say mills has not pursued any major shakeup in the state s overall tax structure but has moved to reduce tax burdens on seniors and lower income taxpayers and relieve pressure on property taxes including by increasing the share of education costs paid for by the state mills staff did not respond to requests to interview the governor for this story or respond to the details of lepage s new plan as part of a bipartisan budget plan passed in april mills returned half of a projected 1 2 billion revenue surplus to most taxpayers reduced income taxes for retirees and increased funding for property tax relief and the earned income tax credit advertisement in addition to sending 850 checks to qualifying taxpayers to help deal with inflation mills and the legislature reduced income taxes for public and private pensioners by increasing the deductions for residents from 10 000 to 25 000 providing 36 8 million in tax relief next year that will average 560 per person by 2025 that deduction will increase to 35 000 per individual which would mean average savings of about 795 per person the budget deal also includes an additional 7 million in additional property tax relief for about 100 000 low and middle income homeowners and renters who are eligible for up to 1 000 a year or 1 500 a year for seniors mills also worked to increase the earned income tax credit which provides a refundable tax credit to working maine people and families that s estimated to help 100 000 maine people with incomes of less than 57 414 by increasing the maximum benefit by an average of 400 per family bringing the total eitc benefit per family to an average of 764 per year campaign manager alexandra raposo also said that mills has resisted efforts by members of her own party to increase taxes on the maine people the bottom line is that governor mills has cut taxes and put more money back into the pockets of maine people especially hard working middle class mainers while ensuring that the budget is balanced and that the state meets its obligations to deliver crucial services raposo said she is not interested in repeating lepage s tax shift scheme where he claimed to cut taxes for maine people when he really just shifted their tax burden reducing and eliminating the income tax has been a longstanding and elusive goal for lepage who ran into opposition from his own party during his eight years as governor advertisement lepage and the republican majority in the legislature successfully lowered the top income tax rate from 8 5 percent to 7 15 percent in 2013 but efforts in 2015 to further reduce or eliminate the income tax faced opposition from both republicans and democrats because it would have required an increase in sales taxes to make up for the lost revenues that proposal would have lowered the income tax rate to 5 75 percent by 2019 at a cost of 1 8 billion a year which lepage sought to offset by increasing the sales tax from 5 5 percent to 6 5 percent the sales tax had increased from 5 percent to 5 5 percent as part of the 2013 budget which was adopted after the legislature overrode a lepage veto that increase was meant to be temporary but was made permanent in 2015 once again in a budget adopted despite a lepage veto who vowed to veto all legislation until the legislature passed a constitutional amendment to eliminate the state s income tax last month lepage downplayed the possibility of sales tax increases to make his plan work i don t think we need to he told reporters in lewiston now that i saw what happened when we reduced we went from 8 5 percent down to 7 15 in the income tax and the next year revenues were historical revenues and what we learned was every dollar we cut in taxes 96 cents comes right back into your economy so it grows the economy i m not saying there isn t some adjustments that need to be made he added but i don t believe it should be on the backs of our elderly lucy dadayan a senior research associate for the tax policy center a joint venture of the urban institute and the brookings institution called lepage s plan to phase out the income tax an election year gimmick and irresponsible given an uncertain economic outlook that includes a possible recession looming on the horizon she said about a dozen states have moved to reduce income taxes in the last few years which she expects to be temporary especially if a recession takes hold advertisement we are in a very uncertain fiscal time dadayan said it s important to keep in mind that the sectors that led to revenue growth are likely temporary and that states should not be making drastic decisions with budgets and should be mindful about fiscal uncertainties we might already be in a recession we already see a declining or volatile stock market which will definitely have an impact on income tax revenues on the state budget i think no drastic measures should be taken in a time of uncertainty seven states including florida texas and alaska have no income taxes new hampshire and tennessee only tax capital gains though they recently decided to eliminate that tax dadayan said such a move would be difficult for maine she said because historically at least a third of the state s revenue comes from income taxes and the state lacks an alternative special revenue source such as the oil industry in texas and alaska income taxes provide roughly 2 billion a year to the state or 44 percent of all revenue eliminating income taxes for people over the age of 65 could cost as much as 441 million based on 2020 tax information according to the state s budget agency dadayan pointed to kansas as a cautionary tale adding that studies have repeatedly shown that income tax cuts don t usually generate the additional economic activity promised in 2012 republican gov sam brownback signed a bill ushering in the largest tax cut for businesses and individuals in kansas history eliminating about 230 million in taxes during the first year and a projected 935 million annually after six years the legislation was drafted by the american legislative exchange council a conservative think tank but increased economic activity did not replace the lost revenue in the short term as brownback promised forcing the republican legislature to roll back the tax cuts in 2017 a report published in 2015 by the center on budget and policy priorities a progressive think tank concluded that income tax cuts have not proved to generate economic growth the report mentioned maine as one of the states to have cut income taxes based on this assumption advertisement this approach is not supported by the preponderance of the relevant academic research and has not worked particularly well in the past the report states the states that tried deep income tax cuts over the last three decades have not seen their economies surge as a result lepage argues that maine s income taxes are a big reason why retirees move to florida for six months and a day and that eliminating them would keep more retirees here and even encourage them to move back he concedes that retirees may still go to florida to avoid the cold snowy months but their additional months in maine will help fuel the economy creating more revenue for the state in fact lepage moved to florida shortly after leaving office in 2019 citing the lack of income taxes as a reason he re established residency in maine in 2020 with the goal of challenging mills this fall mike santo a certified public accountant and chairman of the maine society of cpa s taxation committee said that income and other taxes do play a large role in retirement planning for upper middle class and wealthy retirees especially those who are looking to sell a business for example he said someone earning 100 000 in retirement could save 7 000 a year by moving to florida but other factors such as the climate and personal circumstances also play a big role most of these people are older and they just don t want to be here when it s cold santo said advertisement santo said that eliminating the income tax could entice more retirees to maintain their maine residency but it s difficult to say whether enough people would do so to make up for lost state revenue they might still be going to florida for a few months but they may be coming back sooner because they re no longer worried about that six months and a day rule he said it s definitely tough to say that if all of the people coming back would make up that 50 percent of lost revenue from income taxes rep sawin millett r waterford whose expertise on the state budget is respected by both republicans and democrats acknowledged lepage s shifting rhetoric on income taxes and recent calls for a bottom up phaseout that is a new focus this year millett said it s always good to avoid having to tax people who are living hand to mouth if the number is a reasonable number somewhat below a livable wage i think it does make sense millett said it s a legitimate idea that the income tax cuts could generate more economic activity to help offset revenue losses but it would be difficult to put that plan into motion in terms of the budget he said because the budget process does not allow for predictions about how people will behave if income taxes are reduced or eliminated we don t do dynamic fiscal notes in other words you can t really book savings based on taxpayer behavior that hasn t yet occurred millett said you can t do that without evidence that they have returned before you can actually book it advertisement while lepage predicts that increased economic activity would cover half of the lost revenue he also vowed to make up the other half by cutting government waste which he says includes a significant part of the state s workforce during his first two terms lepage targeted safety net programs such as general assistance and other welfare programs for cuts as well as municipal revenue sharing which added pressure to local property taxes in interviews after the republican rally last month lepage said he would target the state s workforce saying he saved the state 275 million by reducing the state s workforce from 14 300 workers to 11 900 he said one area for possible cuts would be the department of transportation state employees we have way too many lepage said we re not an employment agency what we should be doing is having efficient workforce and we should have people going to work we have to become efficient as a government and we re no longer efficient because people work remote so somebody has got to get back on top and see where the waste is there is a lot raposo mills campaign manager said the governor is open to ideas while criticizing lepage s budget management the fact is when lepage says he would cut government waste maine people know that he means he ll come after health care education and public health all of which were either cut outright denied or underfunded while he was governor and all of which gov mills and the legislature have fought to restore or properly fund she said gov mills remains open to real tax cut proposals that truly reduce costs for maine people while maintaining the critical services they rely on related headlines mills lepage look ahead to november in maine governor race send questions comments to the editors
