susan salisbury the palm beach post halsey griffith inc began as a 168 square foot stationery store in downtown west palm beach in 1921 and this month the family owned company that has reinvented itself several times is celebrating the iconic business s 100th anniversary founded by john l griffith and william l halsey the company has persevered in the face of hurricanes the great depression world war ii a chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1991 and a 1993 restructuring when it shifted its focus from retail to the copier business more post time addison mizner s mystery client part two longtime area residents will recall its heyday from the 1960s to the 1980s when its store at 313 datura st was the place to go for office art and engineering supplies cameras and photographic supplies books gifts and greeting cards plus it was air conditioned everyone in west palm beach shopped at halsey griffith the company s president robert l robbie siemon 72 said james waugh robert s grandfather bought halsey griffith from the founders in 1948 halsey s as it was often called became a regional chain with 11 stores from vero beach to boca raton in the 1980s halsey griffith was one of the area s top office suppliers employing 175 people and reporting annual revenue of 12 5 million many changes have occurred since then in 2016 the company rebranded itself as hgi technologies after it moved away from selling office furniture and supplies now siemon said it s a south florida leader in the copier business selling and servicing copiers printers mailing systems and document management systems more boca raton and mizner park visionary charlie siemon dies at 74 with an office in west palm beach and a distribution center in miami gardens near the golden glades interchange the now 45 employee company serves customers in palm beach broward and miami dade counties this year hgi started a new company under the halsey griffith umbrella hgi technology services a full service it company we think our it services will be a very important part of our business in the future siemon said in january siemon s son blake 48 who started working full time at the company in 1999 will become its president although robert siemon will continue to work there robert s brother james manages the financial end of the business the two have led the company since 1989 after their late father robert t bob siemon retired blake siemon a graduate of forest hill high school and florida atlantic university worked at halsey griffith s warehouse on old okeechobee road when he was in high school a lot of kids from forest hill worked there and showed up after hours to pull orders that were ready for delivery at 5 a m the next morning blake siemon said the expansion into it services focuses on customer service and good advice for small to medium sized businesses for a few years we have been helping people with efficiencies software and electronic workflow and content management it hasn t been a huge part of our business we are taking that expertise and going into it services blake said one of the most difficult periods occurred after the first office supply superstore opened in boca raton in 1988 a west palm beach location quickly followed many mom and pop office supply stores across the nation went out of business the superstores forced us to change our focus when i took over the business in 1989 we knew we had to diversify we didn t get out of the office supply business until 2018 we downsized drastically to three locations siemon said halsey griffith became an authorized ricoh copier dealer they previously had sold the copiers but unfortunately the change did not occur fast enough and the company was forced to file for bankruptcy by january 1993 however it had paid off its debt and could once again buy on credit from vendors at that point i made the decision to go to miami and run the copier division robert siemon said before that i had an outside person i commuted on tri rail for 30 years until the pandemic more what west palm beach s clematis street used to look like and why we mispronounce it a new era had begun and growth continued in the copier division putting the company back on solid footing the siemons attribute the company s longevity to a service oriented way of doing business that goes back to founders halsey and griffith and was continued under their family s ownership blake represents the fourth generation of the waugh siemon family to serve in a leadership role in the company robert said this is something we are very proud of because only 3 percent of family businesses are still in business in the fourth generation halsey griffith has experienced many ups and downs but we have been in business for 100 years siemon said halsey griffith has been a big part of the west palm beach community for the past 100 years and has employed more than 1 000 people the company was founded during the real estate boom of the 1920s when griffith and halsey like thousands of others came to west palm beach to make their fortunes griffith recognized the need for a stationery store and opened a 12 by 14 foot store on what was poinsettia avenue within a year griffith moved the store to a larger location at 220 s dixie highway and then to the guaranty building at seven stories it was one of west palm beach s first skyscrapers built it 1922 it is now on the national register of historic places and is located at the corner of south olive avenue and datura street during this time halsey approached griffith and offered to put up some money to become a partner founding the halsey griffith firm in 1923 in 1925 the downtown store was moved to 313 datura st a property halsey owned the building initially had three storefronts on the ground floor halsey s occupied one and rented the other two the top two floors were the halsey hotel the early years were not always easy the great miami hurricane hit on sept 11 1926 and halted the florida land boom then on sept 6 1928 the okeechobee hurricane struck west palm beach and caused the lake okeechobee dike to fail more than 2 500 people died in the hurricane and many of them drowned in the glades area around the lake next came the stock market crash of 1929 and the business limped along for the next 15 or so years during world war ii manufacturing restrictions on items not related to the war hampered supplies it wasn t until after the war ended those supplies began to flow and business began to improve in 1955 griffith and halsey died within six months of each other but nationwide times were good and the retail business began to expand with the first branch store opening in 1957 the final new branch debuted in port st lucie in 1990 in addition to selling office supplies and furniture we also sold art supplies the late margaret siemon wrote in a company history the famous black artists the highwaymen purchased or traded their art for paint and canvases over the years while typewriters and carbon paper are no longer used the siemons emphasize that their mission has remained the same as a trustworthy partner for florida businesses what fulfills me is that there is a legacy not just that of my family but the good name of the company that we get to carry on and apply to different things blake siemon said we are a relic of a bygone era as to how we approach business that doesn t make us inconsequential people still want first class service

facing threats to their land through tourism fueled development and sea level rise the gullah geechee culture are under siege from enemies both existential and real this story is part of turning tides a series from the savannah morning news and usa today network examining threats to gullah geechee land read more at www savannahnow com queen quet is in a battle for her people born marquetta goodwine she is the chieftess and a spokesperson of the gullah geechee people she travels up and down the coast to state capitals and to a united nations panel in switzerland to bring awareness to the issues facing her people but what goodwine fights is not a soldier it has no face and has no plan people say combat climate change climate change is not a soldier i don t have to go to war with climate change queen quet born marquetta goodwine said the issue is anthropocene it s human caused marquetta goodwine also known as queen quet is proud her people left the coastline alone particularly the stretches of salt marshes critical as habitats marquetta goodwine also known as queen quet chieftess of the gullah geechee nation is pictured at an outdoor market on st helena island on saturday april 15 2017 lauren petracca staff sea level rise and climate change are a threat to all who live along the coasts of the carolinas georgia and florida but it s black communities that bear the brunt according to princeton university higher energy costs flood risks and ocean acidification disproportionately impact communities of color it s projected georgia s coast will see up to 7 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century based on chatham county projections that means waters would engulf the majority of tybee island and several flood prone communities on the mainland for goodwine and the gullah geechee people it could mean a loss of ancestral land and a 300 year old culture goodwine wants people to understand the urgency of the moment facing threats to their land through tourism fueled development and sea level rise the gullah geechee people s culture and lifestyle are under siege from enemies both existential and real these are long term fights against the power of both waves and money the water level rises out of the drainage ditch in front of maurice bailey s sapelo island store caused by a combination of rain and salt water being pushed inland from the king tides richard burkhart savannah morning news when you look at us you re looking at who is indigenous to the soil goodwine said and who are the souls in this soil so if you don t start hearing those voices loud and clear don t be shocked when certain things that you build don t stand right and we ain t gonna stand for it the gullah geechee have been recognized through a federal cultural heritage corridor that spans from wilmington nc to st augustine fl and 30 miles inland descendants of slaves from western and central africa european settlers and native americans the gullah geechee developed distinct cultural religious and culinary practices since the first ancestors arrived from africa more than 400 years ago they speak their own language and many call the remote barrier islands that dot the coasts of the southeast states home queen quet speaks to attendees at the juneteenth event held at the jepson center for the arts austin janning for savannahnow com those islands and many of the inland communities gullah geechee call home are some of the most threatened places on the east coast if sea levels rise their projected 7 feet by 2100 then nearly 20 000 african americans will lose their homes and farms to the briny waters of the atlantic for more than a decade goodwine has traveled the world promoting her sustainability plan which has two keystone aims knowledge and reclamation the results are also two fold reduce development and displacement in the gullah geechee communities to reduce the human caused symptoms of climate change and sea level rise the coast is now the carolina and georgia gold rush everybody want to rush here goodwine explained and you re still allowing the permitting of more overbuilding which is antithetical to resilience and sustainability of the coast that has to stop so if you redirect that money into the hands of the native gullah geechee population people can sustain their land ownership they can sustain agriculture they can now purify the water a conversation albert george was born in savannah but works in charleston south carolina as a scientist and climate change advocate he helped found rice resilience initiative for coastal education which aims to break down the esoteric walls of scientific and political discussions to help the average joe prepare for climate change s impact one of the things over the last 10 years that i began to really formulate in my own mind it s like how do you get this conversation to the people who need it the most to the people who are most vulnerable to the people who have the least amount of resources the people who may not even understand what s over the horizon and that s coming in their direction colorful homes of the few families remaining on sapelo island can be seen along one of the dirt roads running through hog hammock richard burkhart savannah morning news to do this rice goodwine and a number of other grassroots organizations host community meetings seminars and listening sessions within gullah geechee and rural communities to make them aware of what the personal impact of climate change means for someone living in the watershed on wadmalaw island a rural barrier island to the west of charleston their home will be underwater by century s end or saltwater may seep into a coastal farmer s soil or the marshlands near your favorite fishing hole will acidify killing your favorite fish for george and rice the challenge is this how do we equip them with the needed tools and information that would allow them to do informed decision making around how they could potentially mitigate risk in the short midterm and long term the early morning sun breaks through as a boat cruises along hudson creek near the ferry at meridian richard burkhart savannah morning news but rice s community workshops aren t meant to be lectures they re conversations oftentimes we scientists get caught up in a very paternalistic or maternal point of view where we perceive ourselves as scientists and people who are knowledge holders as knowing all that is needed to be known george said to prepare the coast of south carolina and georgia to grow rice george said enslaved africans moved more dirt than the egyptians did when they built the great pyramids rice plantations require a specific type of environment to grow so the ancestors to the gullah geechee people recontoured the coastline to accommodate the crop george thinks we can do it again when you think about resiliency ultimately it s going to be the same equation the ability to do large scale water land engineering and to actually manage water inflows and outflows with millimeter precision george explained and instead of cultivated rice related production it s going to be for the ultimate stability of our human race high king tides have the water level almost to the parking area at the sapelo island ferry dock richard burkhart savannah morning news giving it back for goodwine the way to ensure sustainability along the coast is to return it to the hands who initially cultivated it she sees land restoration as a way to heal the coast address land ownership issues that plague many gullah geechee families and create a resilient environment for decades to come resiliency is how well a landscape and its people can recover after disasters like flooding hurricanes and drought the issues of reparations through land restoration aren t a conversation happening in the halls of lawmaking or courtrooms but goodwine doesn t care photographer frank ruggles new book chasing light features images he has captured over the years at america s national parks including this one of a yellowstone bison photo by frank ruggles goodwine wants land given back to her people so the water quality increases here in georgia so that the fish stock returns to a lot of our traditional subsistence fishing areas these are the things i fight for and maybe that s why they didn t want me to come over here because they know i ll tell the people and once the people are empowered that people will sustain themselves restoring lands to its ancestral residents has worked before in western montana the confederated salish and kootenai tribes have reclaimed management of their bison range which was confiscated by the government in the early 1900s they build highway overpasses for wildlife they expand corridors for predators to roam a wider area making the species more resilient to changes in their habitats file in this aug 3 2016 file photo a herd of bison graze in the lamar valley of yellowstone national park in wyo national park officials in wyoming have announced plans for the selective slaughter of between 600 and 900 yellowstone bison this winter to help manage population numbers ap photo matthew brown file matthew brown ap and so the relationships that the salish people have with the environment are real tight said tom mcdonald the division manager for the tribe s dept of natural resources wildlife recreation and conservation programs when you look at sustainable environments and sustainability of human beings on the landscape the traditional ecological knowledge that the tribes possess and the way that people have been living in balance with their environment for tens of thousands of years here are something that needs to be looked at and need to be followed and need to be especially paid attention to now with climate change threats and other considerations so you learn from the past and bring that forward into the future a large oak looms over one of the dirt roads on sapelo island richard burkhart savannah morning news this philosophy is antithetical to the extraction mindset of european exploration and the columbian exchange which set in motion both the decimation of indigenous peoples throughout the americas and the resulting trans atlantic slave trade but as with many native and gullah geechee communities the land is the legacy on sapelo island a georgia barrier island where the last known intact geechee community exists resident maurice bailey explains it like this you don t fish more than you need you hunt until you kill one deer or one hog enough to last you through the winter houses don t need to be any bigger than the ones you already live in let s let the people who have been here for hundreds of years stay and let them live and build the way the ancestors did queen quet said and let s see if this coast doesn t restore itself maurice bailey talks about sea level rise on sapelo island maurice bailey talks about

listen to this article listen to this article washington the federal reserve will quicken the pace at which it s pulling back its support for the economy as inflation surges and it expects to raise interest rates three times next year in a sharp policy shift the fed announced wednesday that it will shrink its monthly bond purchases at twice the pace it previously announced likely ending them altogether in march the accelerated timetable puts the fed on a path to start raising rates in the first half of next year the fed s new forecast that it will raise its benchmark short term rate three times next year is up from just one rate hike it had projected in september the fed s key rate now pinned near zero influences many consumer and business loans including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans those borrowing costs may start to rise in the coming months though the fed s actions don t always immediately affect other loan rates and even if the central bank does raise rates three times next year it would still leave its benchmark rate historically low below 1 the policy change the fed announced wednesday had been signaled in testimony chair jerome powell gave to congress two weeks ago in discussing the extraordinary support the fed supplied the economy after the pandemic struck last year the shift reflects powell s acknowledgement that with inflation pressures rising the fed needed to begin tightening credit for consumers and businesses faster than he had thought just a few weeks earlier the fed had earlier characterized the inflation spike as mainly a transitory problem that would fade as supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic were resolved the run up in prices has persisted longer than the fed expected and has spread from goods like food energy and autos to services like apartment rents restaurant meals and hotel rooms it has weighed heavily on consumers especially lower income households and particularly for everyday necessities and negated the higher wages many workers have received powell was asked at a news conference wednesday what specifically had caused the fed to pivot to a tighter credit policy it was essentially higher inflation and much faster progress in the labor market he said as a result the fed is shifting its attention away from reducing unemployment which has fallen quickly to a healthy 4 2 down from 4 8 at its last meeting and toward reining in higher prices consumer prices soared 6 8 in november compared with a year earlier the government said last week the fastest pace in nearly four decades on wall street stock prices rose modestly after the fed issued its statement and powell began speaking at a news conference investors had largely anticipated the fed s policy announcements the fed s new policy shift does carry risks raising borrowing costs too fast could stifle consumer and business spending that in turn would weaken the economy and likely raise unemployment yet if the fed waits too long to raise rates inflation could surge out of control it might then have to act aggressively to tighten credit and potentially trigger another recession fed officials have said they expect inflation to cool by the second half of next year gas prices have already come off their peaks supply chain bottlenecks in some areas are gradually easing and government stimulus payments which helped spur a spike in spending that boosted inflation aren t likely to return yet many economists expect high prices to persist that likelihood was reinforced this week by a government report that wholesale inflation jumped 9 6 for the 12 months ending in november the fastest year over year pace on records dating to 2010 housing costs including apartment rents and the cost of homeownership which make up about one third of the consumer price index have been rising at a 5 annual pace the past few months economists at goldman sachs have calculated restaurant prices jumped 5 8 in november from a year ago a nearly four decade high partly reflecting higher wage costs such increases will likely keep inflation well above the fed s 2 annual target next year the fed s monthly bond purchases were intended to hold down long term rates to aid the economy but with unemployment falling and inflation at a near 40 year high they are no longer needed like this article gain access to all of our great content with a month to month subscription start your subscription here

listen to this article listen to this article washington ap with inflation surging and unemployment falling the federal reserve said wednesday that it will shrink its support for the economy more quickly and expects to raise interest rates three times next year fed chair jerome powell said the u s economy is growing at a robust pace even as it faces risks from the pandemic and he thinks spending by businesses and consumers will remain strong but because inflation is likely to persist longer than the fed had earlier expected powell said the central bank needs to address that threat to help the economy sustain its expansion we will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched powell said at a news conference in a sharp policy shift the fed said it will withdraw its monthly bond purchases at twice the pace it previously announced and likely end them in march the accelerated timetable puts the fed on a path to start raising rates as early as the first half of next year the fed s new forecast that it will raise its benchmark short term rate three times next year is up from just one rate hike it had projected in september the fed s key rate now pinned near zero influences many consumer and business loans including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans those borrowing costs may start to rise in the coming months though the fed s actions don t always immediately affect other loan rates and even if the central bank does raise rates three times next year it would still leave its benchmark rate historically low below 1 the policy change reflects fed policymakers acknowledgement that with inflation pressures rising the fed needed to begin tightening credit for consumers and businesses faster than they had expected just a few weeks earlier the fed had earlier characterized the inflation spike as mainly a transitory problem that would fade as supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic were resolved the shift was signaled in testimony that powell gave to congress two weeks ago the run up in prices has persisted longer than the fed expected and has spread from goods like food energy and autos to services like apartment rents restaurant meals and hotel rooms it has weighed heavily on consumers especially lower income households and particularly for everyday necessities and negated the higher wages many workers have received powell was asked at his news conference wednesday what specifically had caused the fed to pivot to a tighter credit policy it was essentially higher inflation and much faster progress in the labor market he said he acknowledged the possibility that inflation won t decline as expected next year there s a real risk now powell said that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased i think part of the reason behind our move today is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk collectively the fed s policymakers forecast wednesday that inflation as measured by their preferred gauge will reach 5 3 by year s end up from their october reading of 5 they expect inflation to slow considerably to a 2 6 annual rate by the end of 2022 but that s up from its september forecast of just 2 2 the officials foresee the unemployment rate falling to 3 5 by the end of next year which would match the pre pandemic level when unemployment was at 50 year lows the fed is buying 90 billion a month in bonds down from 120 billion in october and had been reducing those purchases by 15 billion a month but in january it will reduce those purchases by 30 billion to 60 billion and will be on track powell said to end them altogether in march the bond buying has been intended to lower long term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending the fed is shifting its attention away from reducing unemployment which has fallen quickly to a healthy 4 2 down from 4 8 at its last meeting and toward reining in higher prices consumer prices soared 6 8 in november compared with a year earlier the government said last week the fastest pace in nearly four decades on wall street stock prices rose gradually and then surged after the fed issued its statement and powell began speaking at a news conference by the time powell finished the dow jones industrial average had jumped more than 300 points the fed s policy change does carry risks raising borrowing costs too fast could stifle consumer and business spending that in turn would weaken the economy and likely raise unemployment yet if the fed waits too long to raise rates inflation could surge out of control it might then have to act aggressively to tighten credit and potentially trigger another recession fed officials have said they expect inflation to cool by the second half of next year gas prices have already come off their peaks supply chain bottlenecks in some areas are gradually easing and government stimulus payments which helped spur a spike in spending that boosted inflation aren t likely to return yet many economists expect high prices to persist that likelihood was reinforced this week by a government report that wholesale inflation jumped 9 6 for the 12 months ending in november the fastest year over year pace on records dating to 2010 housing costs including apartment rents and the cost of homeownership which make up about one third of the consumer price index have been rising at a 5 annual pace the past few months economists at goldman sachs have calculated restaurant prices jumped 5 8 in november from a year ago a nearly four decade high partly reflecting higher wage costs such increases will likely keep inflation well above the fed s 2 annual target next year at his news conference powell noted that consumers the leading driver of the economy remain on solid footing fundamentally he said the consumer is really healthy and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the current fourth quarter of the year

the federal reserve will double the pace of its tapering of support for mortgage markets as falling unemployment and worries about inflation outweigh uncertainty around the potential health and economic impacts of the omicron variant under a schedule announced in november the fed had planned to trim the 120 billion in monthly asset purchases it s been making during the pandemic to keep interest rates low by 15 billion a month that would have put the fed on track to wind down its asset purchases by june at the conclusion of a two day meeting fed policymakers wednesday voted unanimously to double the pace of tapering to 30 billion a month a timetable that would end the fed s asset purchases in march with progress on vaccinations and strong policy support indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen fed policymakers said in a statement the sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic have improved in recent months but continue to be affected by covid 19 job gains have been solid in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined substantially during the pandemic the fed had been increasing its holdings of long term treasurys by 80 billion a month and adding 40 billion a month to its stockpile of mortgage backed securities in november fed policymakers agreed to start trimming those purchases by 10 billion a month for treasury securities and 5 billion for mortgage backed securities now the fed plans to accelerate tapering and reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by 20 billion for treasury securities and 10 billion for agency mortgage backed securities in january the fed will increase its treasury holdings by 40 billion and by 20 billion for mortgage backed securities that s half the pace employed during the pandemic if fed tapering continues at that pace as anticipated the fed would buy 20 billion in treasurys and 10 billion in mortgage backed securities in february in march other than replacing existing bonds as the mature the fed s pandemic relief for mortgage markets will end after release of the federal open market committee s statement 10 year treasury yields considered a barometer for mortgage rates surged as markets digested the fed s plans speed up its exit from bond markets we are phasing out our purchases more rapidly because with elevated inflation pressures and a rapidly strengthening labor market the economy no longer needs increasing amounts of policy support federal reserve chair jerome powell said at a press conference following the meeting in addition a quicker conclusion of our asset purchases will better position policy to address the full range of plausible economic outcomes we remain prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook and even after our balance sheet stops expanding our holdings of securities will continue to foster accommodative financial conditions speaking before the senate banking committee in november powell said the emergence of the omicron variant does pose downside risks to employment and economic activity and increased uncertainty for inflation this week world health organization director tedros adhanom ghebreyesus warned that the omicron variant is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant and that who is concerned that people are dismissing omicron as mild even if omicron does cause less severe disease the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems he said but prices for u s consumer goods are up 6 8 percent over the last year the fastest increase in any 12 month period since 1982 according to consumer price index numbers released friday like most forecasters we continue to expect inflation to decline to levels closer to the 2 percent longer run goal by the end of next year powell said we understand that high inflation imposes significant hardship especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food housing and transportation he said we are committed to our price stability goal we will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched improvements in job markets give policymakers leeway to accelerate tapering powell said amid improving labor market conditions and very strong demand for workers the economy has been making rapid progress towards maximum employment powell said job gains have been solid in recent months averaging 378 000 per month over the last three months the unemployment rate has declined substantially falling 0 6 percentage point since our last meeting and reaching 4 2 percent in november the recent trends have narrowed the differences in employment across groups especially for workers at the lower end of the distribution as well as for african americans and hispanics labor force participation showed a welcome rise in november but remains subdued in part reflecting the aging of the population and retirements powell has said that he wanted to see the fed finish tapering before raising short term interest rates a move that the fed could now implement as soon as march asked if the fed would pause between tapering and raising short term interest rates as it did in 2014 powell gave no assurances that would be the case i don t foresee that there would be that kind of very extended wait at this time powell said the economy is so much stronger i was here at the fed when we lifted off the last time and the economy is so much stronger now so much closer to full employment inflation is running well above target and growth is well above potential there wouldn t be the need for that kind of long delay having said that we ll make this decision in coming meetings and it s not a decision that the has really focused on yet the fed s quarterly summary of economic projections shows most policymakers on the committee are expecting three 0 25 percentage point increases in the short term federal funds rate next year forecasters expect mortgage rates to increase next year but diverge on how sharply they ll rise before the fed announced its new timetable for tapering fannie mae economists were projecting mortgage rates would average 3 4 percent during the final three months of 2022 while economists at the mortgage bankers association expected them to hit 4 percent get inman s extra credit newsletter delivered right to your inbox a weekly roundup of all the biggest news in the world of mortgages and closings delivered every

purchases of treasury securities by 20 billion in january and agency mortgage backed securities by 10 billion with similar cuts expected every month but it is prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook in january the fed will buy 40 billion of treasury securities and 20 billion mortgage backeds the dot plot shows 10 participants expect three rate hikes next year five see two two project four increases and one forecaster sees a lone 25 basis point increase this is a major pivot from the fed prompted by clearer evidence that inflation is broadening said brian coulton fitch ratings chief economist by signaling that asset purchases will now cease in march 2022 they are paving the way for an interest rate hike late next summer the way the panel describes inflation he said has changed markedly supply demand imbalances related to the pandemic are now described as contributing to elevated inflation rather than to price increases in some sectors moving forward there is less consensus with three expecting rates to climb to a range between 2 0 and 2 25 five expecting the fed funds rate target between 1 75 and 2 three projecting a 1 50 to 1 75 range five at 1 25 to 1 50 and two at 1 00 to 1 25 in 2024 five officials see rates between 1 75 and 2 0 five see them at 2 0 to 2 25 one expects a 2 25 level two see rates between 2 25 and 2 50 four expect the target between 2 75 and 3 and one sees a 3 0 to 3 25 range the long term view by most is a 2 5 target with outliers at 2 0 and 3 0 and others sprinkled between 2 25 and 2 5 the summary of economic projections shows the panel believes gdp growth will slow to 4 0 next year 2 2 in 2023 and 2 0 in 2024 with unemployment at 4 3 this year down from september s 4 8 projection and 3 5 in ensuing years in september the 2022 median rate for unemployment was 3 8 in the post meeting statement the fomc said it will not raise rates from the current zero to 0 25 range until maximum employment has been achieved the inflation expectations were raised with the median for pce this year at 5 3 up from 4 2 in the prior sep 2 6 next year up from 2 2 and 2 3 in 2023 up from 2 2 core pce expectations were 4 4 up from 3 7 in the prior sep 2 7 next year up from 2 3 and 2 3 in 2023 up from 2 2 the bar for rate hikes now rests squarely on the labor market with the statement indicating that the inflation threshold even under the fed s new flexible regime has been met wells fargo securities senior economist sarah house and economist michael pugliese said powell said the fed will take many factors into consideration in determining maximum employment including the labor force participation rate wages job openings and the quits rate what the fed sees as maximum employment might be a situation in which the labor force participation rate remains below pre pandemic levels said dws scherrmann this however implies a higher level of wages and therefore a somewhat higher level of inflation which is not what we are seeing in the updated forecasts looking beyond 2022 powell said determining when maximum employment is reached is a judgment the committee will make although in his opinion the economy has made rapid progress toward that goal while he wouldn t be pinned down on when rate hikes would start powell said there would not be a very extended wait after taper ends additionally the markets move based on announcements of what the fed plans to do he said when the employment cost index came in higher than expected right before the fomc s november meeting powell said he understood tapering would have to be accelerated and considered whether to do it at that meeting while omicron poses a risk to the economy it s uncertain at this point what its impact will ultimately be powell said data retail sales gained 0 3 in november and were 18 2 higher than a year ago economists polled by ifr markets expected a 0 8 rise sales contracted after adjusting for the surge in the consumer price index cpi for the month said grant thornton chief economist diane swonk the winter delta wave is now upon us that surge coupled with the unknown threat posed by omicron has already overwhelmed hospitals in some areas and taken a toll on reservations at restaurants the bulk of the weakness associated with the current wave of infections is expected to show up in the first quarter data although holiday sales continue at a record pace consumers are no longer the price takers they were when they were flush with cash from stimulus checks said wells fargo securities senior economist tim quinlan and economist shannon seery higher prices for gas and food is taking away wallet share from other spending categories despite the miss ing chief international economist james knightley said we shouldn t get too down about these figures the numbers for october were revised up a touch and we need to remember that retail sales are actually 21 6 higher than they were before the pandemic struck in other data released wednesday manufacturing activity in the new york state showed strength with the empire state manufacturing survey s general business conditions index climbing to 31 9 in december from 30 9 in november economists expected a 27 3 read the price indexes moderated somewhat but still suggested ongoing substantial increases in both input prices and selling prices the report said employment data showed a solid increase in employment also released import prices grew 0 7 in november after a 1 5 gain in october while export prices were 1 0 higher in november after a 1 6 jump in october economists expected imports to rise 0 7 and exports 0 5 separately business inventories rose 1 2 in october after a 0 8 increase in september economists expected a

week following the federal reserve s announcement of a speedier reduction of its monthly asset purchases in the face of persistently elevated inflation the us could now also see three interest rate rises next year it was a hawkish surprise in terms of the dot plot fixed income strategist at schwab center collin martin told market watch it just shows the power of high inflation and what it s done to the fed psyche with even the doves having turned more hawkish joseph palmer and sons director alex moffat said the federal reserve signalled it will increase the pace of the taper of its quantitative easing program and forecast three rate rises for next year beginning in january the fed will buy us 60 billion of bonds per month down from the current rate of us 90 billion per month it looks like equity investors have breathed a sigh of relief that the fed is showing it is in charge and that the fog has lifted giving them a clearer view of the way ahead we must not forget that the us is also nudging its legislated debt ceiling the congress agreed last night to raise the limit by us 2 5 trillion with only a few days to go before a potential default according to allianz investment management senior investment strategist charlie ripley the decision to speed up the pace in removing policy accommodation is welcomed by market participants but the fed is likely going to continue to tread lightly as they walk the fine line of attempting to cool inflation without slowing the economy too dramatically the reality is uncertainty surrounding fed policy is high and will likely remain that way as chairman powell attempts to unwind the largest monetary stimulus package in history without disruption chief investment officer for independent advisor alliance chris zaccarelli believes investors are still cautious given the market reaction stocks higher and bond yields marginally higher it appears that the fed had successfully communicated this news ahead of time the sectors leading the market higher utilities and healthcare are both very defensive sectors and indicate some concern about the future path of the economy zaccarelli said the big question for markets now is can the us economy digest this pace of hikes without ending up with a stomach ache principal global investors chief strategist seema shah said after the 20 months we ve had perhaps six hikes over a two year period looks overwhelming but compared to previous hiking cycles most pertinently 2004 to 2006 when the fed made 17 consecutive hikes we are tentatively confident that the us economy can handle it not only that but us inflation needs it musk s tax woes tesla ceo elon musk has labelled democrat senator elizabeth warren as a karen after she accused the billionaire and world

article article body just as the world seems to be slowly recovering from the worst of covid 19 business continuity and supply chains are emerging as major crisis risks it should be well recognised that business continuity is not the same as crisis management and that having a great business continuity plan is no substitute for a comprehensive crisis management process yet the post pandemic supply chain debacle is testing that distinction as shipping problems and staff shortages pose a genuine crisis risk for organisations of all sizes indeed the guardian recently described the supply chain crisis as a perfect storm which could blow the world economy off course australian e commerce trader peter cole put it even more bluntly when he told wired the whole system is totally f d experts and arm chair commentators are still arguing about the cause for example the bbc says disruption caused by the covid pandemic is mostly to blame and a very detailed analysis on the new york times concluded in one way or another much of the crisis can be traced to the outbreak of covid 19 however harry boardman in forbes claims covid 19 itself has played a much smaller role in giving rise to these developments than most observers suggest or even assert others say the real cause are fundamental logistics weaknesses which existed long before the pandemic for organisations struggling to recover from the immediate effects of supply chain failures and mandated shutdowns the underlying cause is somewhat moot despite the sugar hit from black friday and end of year sales some businesses still face an existential crisis with falling revenue dramatically rising transport costs seemingly endless delivery delays increasing high street rents and shortages of experienced staff although politicians may prematurely crow about claimed green shoots of recovery and voters may bleat about the misspending of taxpayer dollars on pandemic support the reality is that tens of thousands of lost jobs will never be regained many small and medium sized businesses and consultancies will close and a generation of otherwise productive workers will choose to retire early among all this gloom one ray of hope is that consumers don t appear to blame the shopping chaos on brands a new survey of us adults shows they mainly blame the government logistics companies and hoarders remember the toilet paper crisis the survey concluded that consumers facing an out of stock holiday gift are just as likely to buy a substitute from the same retailer as they are to jump to a competitor in search of the original item and massive american retailers like walmart and costco chartered container ships to ensure supplies of brand products but that s little comfort for the small retailer unable to get stock paul zahra ceo of the australian retailers association says small businesses have had a really tough year and warns the outlook remains grim they ve been absolutely decimated by this pandemic and unfortunately they ll be even more impacted by the supply chain issues they re currently experiencing while experts advise consumers to plan ahead and shop early to avoid what the guardian cleverly called the yuletide logjam the supply chain crisis to misquote charles dickens is not just about christmas present but about christmas future looking forward the chief economist at the committee for economic development of australia jarrod ball says the consensus is the supply chain crisis will not end anytime soon it won t really be until 2023 that we start to see some moderation in this and even then there is a risk of continuing worker shortages in service industries sadly 2023 is a long way off and some organisations likely won t survive to see another christmas tony jaques is an expert on issue and crisis management and risk communication he is ceo of melbourne based consultancy issue outcomes and his latest book is crisis counsel navigating legal and communication conflict

global events such as war acts of terrorism spread of infectious diseases or other public health issues recessions or other events could have a significant negative impact on a fund and its investments such events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others the outbreak of the respiratory disease designated as covid 19 in december 2019 has caused significant volatility and declines in global financial markets which have caused losses for investors while the development of vaccines has slowed the spread of the virus and allowed for the resumption of reasonably normal business activity in the united states many countries continue to impose lockdown measures in an attempt to slow the spread additionally there is no guarantee that vaccines will be effective against emerging variants of the disease because the fund is concentrated in securities issued by energy infrastructure companies it will be more susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry including high interest costs high leverage costs the effects of economic slowdown surplus capacity increased competition uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices the effects of energy conservation policies and other factors investments in securities of mlps involve certain risks different from or in addition to the risks of investing in common stocks the number of energy related mlps has declined since 2014 the industry is witnessing the consolidation or simplification of corporate structures

washington reuters u s retail sales increased less than expected in november likely payback after surging in the prior month as americans started their holiday shopping early to avoid empty shelves a rotation in spending from goods back to services also appears to have held back retail sales last month with the report from the commerce department on wednesday showing a sharp drop in receipts at electronics and appliance stores online retail sales were unchanged higher food and gasoline prices are probably curtailing discretionary spending the modest retail sales gain did not change views that the economy was regaining steam after a slowdown in the third quarter that was triggered by the covid 19 delta variant and rampant shortages in a nod to soaring inflation the federal reserve on wednesday said it would end its pandemic era bond purchases in march paving the way for three quarter percentage point interest rate increases by the end of 2022 consumers are still doing their best to keep the economy s sails full and the recovery on track said christopher rupkey chief economist at fwdbonds in new york retail sales rose 0 3 last month after surging 1 8 in october sales have now risen for four straight months they increased 18 2 year on year in november economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0 8 estimates ranged from as low as being unchanged to as high as a 1 5 increase several of the top u s retailers reported in mid november that they had noticed an earlier start to holiday shopping retail sales could remain moderate in december though higher savings and rising wages amid a tight labor market are supportive of spending trillions of dollars in covid 19 pandemic relief from governments across the globe fueled demand for goods straining supply chains the resulting shortages ranging from motor vehicles to furniture and electronics have raised goods prices consumer prices increased a solid 0 8 in november with the year on year gain of 6 8 the largest since june 1982 inflation is likely to remain high for a while a separate report from the labor department on wednesday showed import prices increased 0 7 in november consumers have been bombarded with messages about the impact of supply shortages on the availability of holiday gifts said david berson chief economist at nationwide in columbus ohio they may well have done a lot of their holiday shopping earlier than usual stocks on wall street were mixed the dollar rose against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices fell mixed bag the moderation in retail sales which are mostly goods was in part due to shortages and higher prices receipts at auto dealerships dipped 0 1 after accelerating 1 7 in october automobiles remain scarce because of a global semiconductor shortage sales at electronics and appliance stores fell 4 6 but sales at service stations increased 1 7 lifted by higher gasoline prices receipts at food and beverage stores rose 1 3 also reflecting rising inflation food and gas are forcing hard choices for consumers in other areas this holiday season said tim quinlan a senior economist at wells fargo in charlotte north carolina consumers are no longer the price takers they were when they were flush with cash from stimulus checks there were also increases in sales at building material stores as well as at sporting goods hobby musical instrument and book stores sales at clothing stores rose 0 5 receipts at restaurants and bars increased 1 0 restaurants and bars are the only services category in the retail sales report these sales were up 37 4 from last november suggesting spending was reverting back to services demand shifted to goods during the pandemic excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales dipped 0 1 data for october was revised higher to show these so called core retail sales accelerating 1 8 instead of the previously reported 1 6 core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product though inflation adjusted or real consumer spending was probably flat in november it is above its third quarter pace consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity rose at a 1 7 annualized rate in the third quarter we still think that real consumer spending growth will be strong in the fourth quarter on average with firm earlier momentum before the disappointing november said daniel silver an economist at jpmorgan in new york rising covid 19 infections could slow spending over winter with the highly transmissible omicron variant posing an additional risk the atlanta fed lowered its fourth quarter growth estimate to a 7 0 rate from a 8 7 pace earlier the economy grew at a 2 1 pace in the third quarter growth estimates for this quarter were boosted by a third report from the commerce department on wednesday showing businesses inventories accelerated 1 2 in october the winter delta

save america kill the bill and can we please get a federal reserve with a backbone here s a couple thoughts on today s wussy fed announcement that they re going to move faster on tapering bond purchases and there might be three little bitty rate hikes next year and oh yeah jay powell told the press conference he was confident inflation would drop to 2 by the end of next year wanna bet on that bet i m taking the under know who the best inflation forecaster in the country is senator joe manchin numero uno i don t even know if he talks to economists but since last winter when the 2 trillion democrat so called relief package was implemented joe manchin has been warning about inflation and that s why he has argued consistently all year that biden s big government socialist bill should be paused until inflation is clearly falling which it is not cpi up 7 ppi up 10 and today we got another whopper with an 11 7 rise in import prices how about that manchin by the way in his original memo to chuck schumer last summer called for the end of qe quantitative easing biden s build back betttter one of worst bills in american history gop rep joe manchin makes me feel proud to be a former democrat as were both of my presidential bosses ronald reagan and donald trump if today s democratic party were full of joe manchins we d probably all still be democrats the guy s a superstar he s also a better forecaster than several million economists not to speak of the white house and the fed who bungled the inflation story manchin s also right in his policy ideas pause the bill and stop qe but the jay powell fed has been nosing in favor of more spending and today he had a chance to end qe flat in its tracks but he didn t do it fed doubles taper rate to 30b a month signals interest rate liftoff so to quote our friend kevin warsh former federal reserve governor the fed is still enabling massive government spending by buying up the debt and pumping up the money supply the fed today should not only have ended qe but they should have announced their intention to start raising their target rate next month january they missed a big opportunity to show strength and determination democrat larry summers is right today s central bankers are more interested in climate change and woke social policies than fighting inflation and as john maynard keynes said decades ago inflation is the cruelest tax of all it is middle income and lower income folks who get hurt the most with skyrocketing prices for food energy homes construction gasoline meat turkeys you name it the fed is so far behind the 8 ball now that as former cea chair kevin hassett told us yesterday not only should they be raising rates immediately with a 50 basis point hike they should take actions in between meetings to keep raising rates and then in a year or 18 months inflation may start coming down finally i have another idea for a new fed chairman if joe manchin won t take the job elon musk named time s person of the year for 2021 how about elon musk time magazine s man of the year how can i say such an outrageous thing several reasons i worked with him several times in the white house and he s very smart and savvy second the mere fact that socialist elizabeth warren is attacking him for not paying his fair share of taxes is by itself a fabulous endorsement of musk s philosophy business prowess am i saying anybody warren opposes gets my stamp of approval yes i m tired of her left wing progressive woke whining and her desires to tax and regulate anything that moves in business and the economy inflation will cost most us households 3 500 analysis shows meanwhile musk who s the biggest ev car seller in the country has said publicly he does not want ev auto or battery subsidies from the federal government indeed he has come out against the entire reckless tax spend and regulate biden policies unlike gm and the unionist carmakers musk is non union and will not put his nose into the public trough get fox business on the go by clicking here my kind of guy i doubt if he ever talks to economists that s probably why he s such a good conservative libertarian thinker and incidentally musk has been selling about 3 billion worth of stock at the prevailing capitalist gains tax rate of 23 8 the musk stock sale would generate 714 million of revenues to the federal government click here to read more on fox business it s gotta be one of the biggest revenue windfalls in uncle sam s history at least from one person that s called paying your fair share liz warren my only trouble with it is i surely don t want to give you ms warren another 714 million to spend on anything save america kill the bill this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the december 15 2021 edition of kudlow

portland women in tech known as pdxwit is celebrating 10 years as a community resource and next year will see the group expand even further we contacted executive director elizabeth stock to talk about how the group has changed since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic how it has professionalized and what s in store hint it involves taking its work to other cities and taking work directly to companies want more portland startup news sign up for the beat delivered to your inbox twice weekly how has pdxwit shifted in the last 18 months due to the pandemic especially now that it seems things will be changed for the foreseeable future prior to march of 2020 much of our identity as an organization was wrapped up in bringing people together in person or at least that s what i thought now that i have some perspective and distance from those early months of the pandemic i am realizing that our identity wasn t about bringing people together in person it was just about bringing people together and our commitment and ability to that has only gotten stronger over the course of the last 18 months in addition to converting pdxwit to a fully virtual environment we also changed our mission statement earlier this year to be more reflective of the work we do we ve made a conscious decision to speak up and out on what we believe in and be clear on what we are not ok with maybe some of that courage has come from having some years under our belt but i also believe the pandemic has brought a lot into focus for all of us when it comes to what is important and what we need to stand up for the group has become more professionalized with you as ed and staff and an expanded board how has that changed the organization and its work having a variety of skills and perspectives executing on day to day operations and driving strategy forward has been critical to our success our operations manager dawn mott has worked closely with volunteers and community members to build out affinity spaces for many populations either working or hoping to work in tech including native americans in tech and people with disabilities our communications specialist isabel rodriguez has brought their expertise in data analytics to the team and is laying the foundation for our 2022 state of the community survey to go national while we have always been a force having an expanded board and staff team over the last few years has really taken our work to the next level having said that we continue to lean hard on our volunteer community who are highly involved in the work we are doing every day elizabeth stock executive director of pdxwit pdxwit you have been with the group since 2018 what brings you joy in what can be a challenging field to work in by that i mean working in support for marginalized people in an industry that can seem so lacking in change i am lifted up by the success stories coming out of pdxwit from community members sharing that pdxwit s virtual events have been a bright spot during an otherwise challenging time means a ton to me i was just reading an email this morning from a scholarship recipient who pdxwit purchased a laptop for they said the last couple years have been extremely difficult with my personal health professional transition covid and the weight of the political climate i just needed a win of some sort and while my journey is far from over i feel exceptionally encouraged knowing that i have the equipment to support me even the little emails or updates i see on linkedin that say i got my job through pdxwit or i had the courage to ask for a raise thanks to my pdxwit mentor will never get old i have a folder i add screenshots to when i see these types of updates and on the days when i am feeling like the work is too hard or like nothing will ever change i take a look at those and i am immediately ready to keep going what is on tap for the group for 2022 oh 2022 is going to be a big year for us i don t want to reveal all of our secrets but i will share that we are launching a new fee for service consulting arm which will directly support companies in identifying implementing and executing on their diversity equity and inclusion efforts we also plan to make our programs and services even more available to other communities starting with our neighbors in seattle and sf our heart will continue to stay in portland but for years now we have been hearing from those cities that they could really use something like pdxwit in their area so if we have the opportunity to expand our reach and community building expertise why not go for it we know that the hiring frenzy in tech isn t suddenly going to disappear in 2022 so we are eager to launch additional recruitment focused events and services to help match companies who are hiring with great talent we will continue our commitment to using our platform to advocate for job seekers and workers in tech when it comes to what they need in a workplace whether that is flexibility trust your employees to do their work on a schedule that works for them pay transparency put the salary in the job description or relevant benefits paid leave over beer on tap job seekers and employees hold a lot of power right now given this competitive market why not leverage that power to create company cultures that are inclusive and equitable for all

bloomberg federal reserve boss jerome powell appears unperturbed by the fact that longer term bond yields remain low even as officials lay the ground work for tighter policy and inflation is ticking higher while the drop in longer term rates may be viewed by some as indicative of where so called terminal rates for u s policy might ultimately lie powell on wednesday emphasized the impact of ultra low yields in places like japan and germany in helping to keep them anchored a lot of things go into the long rates and the place i would start is just look at global sovereign yields around the world powell said at a news conference following the fed s final scheduled policy meeting for the year which saw officials ramp up the pace of stimulus withdrawal and boost predictions for rate hikes in 2022 the fed chair noted that rates on japanese and german government bonds are so much lower than those on treasuries and that with currency hedging taken into account american debt provides investors with a higher yield i m not troubled by where the long bond is he said this stands as something of a contrast to the view expressed back in 2005 by one of powell s predecessors back then fed chief alan greenspan described a decline in long term bond yields even in the face of six policy rate increases as a conundrum according to powell the move in longer end rates may provide some assessment about the course of fed rates over the cycle and officials have their own estimates but those types of predictions are very speculative those are highly uncertain he said we ll make policy based on what we re seeing in the economy rather than based on what a model might say the neutral rate is the yield on the u s 30 year bond has fallen to around 1 86 from a peak this year of 2 51 in march the fall in long end yields has come as shorter term rates have risen sharply causing the yield curve to flatten and that has some investors worried there are warnings from some that the flattening of the curve and slide in long term yields means that growth is at risk and that the fed will need to end its upcoming tightening cycle sooner rather than later and indeed that is evident in short end market pricing too which suggests rate hikes will peter out long before the forecasts of fed officials indicate for now though powell is preaching a message of calm and keeping firmly focused on economic outcomes we re really focused on broader financial conditions he said wednesday we re focused on maximum employment and price stability 2021 bloomberg l p

for nbc dfw newsletters we re a free market economy she said they should be able to participate in that pelosi s dismissal of the idea of a stock purchase ban came in response to a question about a business insider investigative report this week on share ownership by lawmakers and after controversies over stock purchases by a number of senators since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic the business insider series found that 49 members of congress and 182 senior level congressional staffers had violated the so called stock act which requires public disclosure by themselves and family members within 45 days of sales or purchases of individual stocks bonds and commodity futures the stop trading on congressional knowledge act which became law in 2012 is supposed to prevent lawmakers and staffers from engaging in trading on information they glean from their jobs as well as conflicts of interest but violations of the stock act if sanctioned at all usually result in fines of just 200 we have a responsibility to report stock trades pelosi said wednesday the speaker said she was not familiar with the findings of the business insider series but if people aren t reporting they should be pelosi added walter shaub former director of the u s office of government ethics blasted pelosi s reference to the free market economy in the first of a series of tweets about the lack of a ban on stock ownership by lawmakers it s a ridiculous comment shaub wrote she might as well have said let them eat cake sure it s a free market economy but your average schmuck doesn t get confidential briefings from government experts chock full of nonpublic information directly related to the price of stocks in another tweet shaub wrote in an objective world free of politics members of congress would be mocked for the absurdly weak ethics rules they ve written for themselves earlier monday securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler called for tougher rules limiting stock trading by corporate chief executive officers and other top executives in october the federal reserve announced a wide ranging ban on officials of the central bank owning individual stocks and bonds that ban came on the heels of the resignations of two federal reserve regional presidents robert kaplan of dallas and eric rosengren of boston after disclosures that they had traded individual securities in 2020 their trades came as the coronavirus rocked markets and while the fed itself was engaging in massive purchases of assets aimed at keeping markets stable lawmaker stock controversies a number of good government groups and some lawmakers have called for a ban on owning stocks or mandating that members of congress put their financial holdings in a blind trust while they are in office allowing lawmakers to continue to own index funds which track sectors of financial markets is seen as one way to allow them to get investment returns while limiting the potential for benefiting from information they obtain about individual companies or being perceived as doing so in 2019 then rep chris collins r n y pleaded guilty to federal charges related to tipping off his son about nonpublic information he had obtained about a pharmaceutical company s failed drug trial shortly before public disclosure of that information sent the company s stock into a tailspin collins had for years beforehand touted the prospects of the company innate therapeutics and was on its board of directors even as he served in congress collins also was innate s biggest shareholder in early 2016 owning more than 17 of the company or almost 34 million shares his children cameron and caitlin were at one point the third and fourth largest shareholders respectively with each owning 2 65 of the company at that time or 5 2 million shares apiece collins who had been serving a 26 month prison sentence was pardoned by president donald trump in december 2020 shortly before trump left office

turn on the leg lamp be sure to drink your ovaltine and try not to shoot your eye out while spending christmas at the house from a christmas story the iconic home where ralphie and the parker family lived in the 1983 movie with yellow siding green trim and a leg lamp glowing in the middle of the front room window offers year round overnight stays and currently is available on christmas eve and christmas day for fans who want to spend the upcoming holiday in the house as badly as ralphie wanted a red ryder bb gun the two night minimum stay for christmas costs 3 995 per night the house located in cleveland ohio but set in indiana for the movie has single night rates the remainder of the year starting as low as 495 per night and can be booked at www achristmasstoryhouse com what better way to spend your christmas than to relive your favorite christmas movie said brian jones the homeowner and lifelong a christmas story fan if you love the movie you re going to love the house being a fan myself i worked to make it how it is from a fan s perspective get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters the house provides overnight guests with a third floor loft featuring a living room bedroom and full bathroom and a second floor eat in kitchen all of which is inaccessible to those taking daily public tours of the house overnight guests get full access to the public portions of the house from a half hour after tours end until a half hour before tours resume the following day six guests are permitted to stay overnight and they can even sleep in ralphie and randy s bedroom or cook a meatloaf dinner put on a snowsuit where you can t put your arms down or decode a message from little orphan annie in the bathroom when you see the house and step inside it feels like going home since you ve seen it so many times in the movie jones said it s nostalgic recreating a christmas story house refurbishing the house went much smoother than the old man trying to glue together his broken leg lamp it was the leg lamp along with the navy and ebay that played a role in the house ultimately being restored to its cinematic self in 2006 years earlier jones attended the naval academy in hope of becoming a jet pilot those dreams were dashed when he failed a vision test and was reassigned to be an intelligence officer it was alright but i was still bummed jones said so my parents made and sent me a leg lamp as kind of a gag gift to cheer me up because it was a major award in the movie i asked where d you get this thing this is cool they said we didn t get it we had to make it nobody sells those so jones decided to he started his own business making the career transition from naval officer to entrepreneur leg lamp manufacturer i had an exit interview with my captain he was like you re gonna do what jones said he didn t get it i was like i m going to sell leg lamps sir he was like well good luck with that jones produced them in his san diego condo and sold approximately 500 leg lamps in his first year of operation when his wife beverly also in the navy and heading to the middle east at the time e mailed jones an ebay listing showing the house from a christmas story listed with a starting price of 99 990 suddenly the ideal storefront to sell leg lamps presented itself i went right over to mapquest to see where cleveland ohio was jones said it took me maybe about 15 seconds to realize yeah i m gonna buy that jones who was 28 at the time offered the homeowners 150 000 for the house if they were to stop the bidding they accepted jones acquired a large piece of hollywood memorabilia on 0 12 acres at 3159 11th street known in the movie as cleveland street when i wrote my wife an email saying i bought it she wrote me back one line saying i don t know whether to laugh or cry jones said i just basically spent all the money we had that was going to be for a house for us in california on a beat down rental property jones in the pre airbnb era initially considered turning the house into a bed and breakfast when he visited for the first time and instantly felt the movie magic he was convinced to recreate the house inside and out two years and 240 000 in renovations later he did just that giving the now 80 000 fans who tour the house each year the opportunity to write their own christmas story expanding the christmas story campus and experience the bumpus hounds won t disturb your stay or ruin your turkey dinner but the bumpus house next door to the parker house most certainly stands and offers additional lodging acquired in 2018 the house was transformed into a pair of suites that sleep up to 14 people it s one of the multiple neighboring houses jones purchased to expand the a christmas story campus it creates a whole christmas story house experience jones said that includes the gift shop which is located across the street and offers everything from leg lamps in fragile crates to red ryder bb guns and the museum which is also across the street and includes artifacts from the movie like character worn wardrobes the blackboard from miss shield s classroom and one of the six bb guns used by ralphie in the movie that jones called the holy grail or the museum s collection it s like seeing the house you grew up in but the main draw is ralphie s house where roughly 15 percent of the movie was filmed including exterior scenes and some interior that includes classic scenes like ralphie s backyard shootout with black bart the original shed from which still stands the leg lamp crate delivery and mom and dad admiring the snowstorm through the living room window the snow actually was instant potato flakes it s kind of funny to see people get so emotional because they love the movie so much said jones now 45 and a florida resident it s like seeing a long lost relative or the house you grew up in because the movie was on all the time when they were a kid inside guests can put on a pink bunny suit from aunt clara curse out the furnace or unwrap an official red ryder carbine action 200 shot range model air rifle with a compass in the stock and this thing that tells time then go to the backyard and practice shooting in the very spot where ralphie once did hey that s up to you jones said if you stay at the house and want to shoot a bb gun go for it just be careful you ll shoot your eye out

agencies to afford african countries more transparent and fair credit ratings national governments should establish donor coordination frameworks which will ensure that development finance support programmes are aligned behind a single national plan and traditional and non traditional donors are able to collaborate with one another executive summary having been pummelled by the effects of covid 19 developed and developing countries are pursuing strategies to accelerate their recovery process and to bolster their health systems and economies against future crises however significant fiscal constraints are making it difficult for many developing countries to finance their recovery processes this is particularly evident in africa where governments having exhausted their more liquid domestic assets often have had to tap their sovereign wealth funds international capital markets and other external development finance options exacerbating their already high public debt levels african countries need substantially more development finance to tackle current and future economic challenges however up until covid 19 flows of donor finance to africa had been on the decline for some years borrowing from international capital markets is not always a cost effective route for african countries to follow many african governments have been calling for debt cancellation and other forms of relief but to no avail the efforts of the g20 international monetary fund world bank african development bank and african union among others have provided essential lifelines to african countries as they have navigated the worst of the pandemic the g20 s debt service suspension initiative and the international monetary fund s common framework are just two examples of such initiatives generally however global donor activities and frameworks have been fragmented and poorly coordinated the g20 and other development partners can do more to streamline and coordinate their financial assistance and debt relief efforts in africa priorities include unlocking much more finance to accelerate countries economic recovery and longer term transformation especially private sector investment making capitalmarket borrowing more accessible to african countries and extending more generous debt relief in exchange for african countries engaging in better fiscal management introduction following the massive disruption to the global economy caused by the covid 19 pandemic both developed and developing countries are pursuing a myriad of health and economic policies and strategies to bring about the sustainable and inclusive recovery of their economies a swift recovery would lay the foundations for transformative growth and minimise the debilitating impact of the pandemic on economic progress and poverty reduction efforts globally unfortunately the pace of recovery in the developed and developing world is poles apart many developed countries are fast tracking their recovery process by leveraging national emergency funds and tapping global financial markets to provide stimulus measures to households and businesses while also inoculating a significant share of the adult population in african countries economic recovery remains fragile in the face of the slow pace of vaccination which continues to expose the region to potential mutations of the virus and development financing challenges with only 3 3 of africans fully vaccinated the continent is far from realising its vaccination target of 40 of the population by the end of 2021 with the african vaccine acquisition trust avat and the covid 19 vaccines global access covax the main sources of vaccines remaining heavily underfunded to date only mauritius and the seychelles have fully vaccinated more than 60 of their respective populations ironically because of stockpiling 100 million vaccine doses from the g7 risk expiring by the end of 2021 in terms of financing their economic recovery african countries are severely challenged in comparison with more advanced economies many african countries simply lack the fiscal space to finance a robust and sustainable economic recovery from covid 19 although the world bank noted that fiscal deficits remained under control in 2020 and are expected to narrow in 2021 and beyond the size of the fiscal support measures deployed by african governments has been very small compared with those in advanced economies while advanced economies mobilised about 6 of their gross domestic product gdp to tackle the impending recession african countries barely mobilised 1 in response to the crisis according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the advanced economies fiscal response to covid 19 was on average seven times larger than that of low income countries there are several reasons for this firstly in their quest to mitigate the impact of the crisis on their economies sub saharan african ssa countries have not only exhausted their already insufficient domestic revenues but some have also tapped into their commodity backed sovereign wealth funds which were reserved for future generations covid 19 appeared when many countries were facing rising debt and structurally large fiscal deficits which meant that their fiscal space was already heavily constrained prior to the onset of covid 19 more than 40 of ssa countries were already at debt distress levels prompting the international monetary fund imf and the world bank to call on countries to be more cautious with their pace of debt accumulation notwithstanding this approximately 95 of low income developing countries in ssa recorded significant increases in public debt stocks in 2020 even countries with sound public financial management controls like ghana and rwanda saw their public debt rise from 63 and 62 of gdp respectively in 2019 to 81 and 71 of gdp respectively in 2020 interest payments on debts alone are forecast to exceed 10 of government revenue in 2021 in nearly half the countries on the continent and to exceed 20 in countries like nigeria kenya angola ghana and zambia the shrinking fiscal space has constrained african countries ability to commit the level of resources required to initiate a swift and effective recovery to deal with the fallout from the pandemic and to finance their basic recovery african countries will need an additional 285 billion through to 2025 to return to pre pandemic levels and effectively transform their economies they will need twice this amount meanwhile the external development financing landscape is becoming more difficult for many african countries to navigate despite newly introduced initiatives the unfair and unsustainable terms of borrowing dictated by international capital markets are hindering countries ability to borrow in order to release the pressure on their tight fiscal space the challenges of borrowing from the capital markets are exacerbated by a decline in donor financing to africa prior to the pandemic and weak donor coordination frameworks around which aid is mobilised the breakdown in donor coordination frameworks over the past decade such as the paris declaration accra agenda for action and the addis ababa financing for development has resulted in the fragmentation of limited aid resources this fragmentation could limit countries ability to effectively coordinate scarce financing for their economic recovery plans the external development finance landscape and covid 19 recovery in ssa access to finance is currently an urgent priority for african countries with governments also calling for debt cancellation and other forms of relief it is noteworthy that while other major development finance flows such as foreign direct investment fdi trade and remittances are trending downwards due to the covid 19 pandemic bilateral overseas development assistance oda to africa increased by 4 1 in 2020 driven mostly by emergency aid flows the support provided by various development partners including the group of 20 g20 and the bretton woods institutions and philanthropic organisations has been critical in mitigating the economic and health impacts of the pandemic a few examples of such assistance are discussed below the g20 s debt service suspension initiative dssi which instituted a moratorium on debt service for developing countries has so far provided 5 7 billion in relief to 43 eligible countries in ssa 30 sovereign countries 80 of eligible countries in the region participated in the dssi thereby enabling these countries to channel resources towards fighting the pandemic and safeguarding lives and livelihoods although the dssi has been extended until december 2021 there are major concerns about its implementation private creditors and many debtor countries who hold 31 of african debt do not want to participate while china s position on debt relief for ssa countries under the initiative is still not clear furthermore there are growing concerns that a lack of participation by commercial creditors in debt relief efforts could see these creditors profiting from the riskreduction efforts in these initiatives while refusing to assume potential losses once they materialise several eligible african countries have not participated in the programme as they fear a fall in their credit rating or potentially high sovereign bond spreads in the future for some the conditions attached to participating in the dssi could prevent them from accessing further non concessional loans for the duration of the programme finally there have been concerns about the new development assistance committee dac rules which allow donors to report debt rescheduling or cancellation as oda and how this will contribute to rising numbers of loans being made to already debt distressed countries in the coming years beyond the dssi the common framework of the imf was endorsed by the g20 together with the paris club in november 2020 to support low income countries with unsustainable levels of debt initiated at the request of debtor countries this framework was hailed as historic as it brings china the paris club and other non paris club official creditors together into a single debt relief coordination mechanism while this is a step in the right direction as of april 2021 only three of the 73 dssi eligible countries that face a high risk of debt distress ethiopia chad and zambia had asked to participate in the common framework unfortunately the framework is considered inadequate as it is limited to dssi eligible countries and does not detail concrete measures that could induce privatesector participation in the initiative the imf s rapid financing instrument rfi and rapid credit facility rcf have generated approvals of about 16 1 billion in loans to 34 ssa countries the imf has also shored u zero interest lending through its poverty reduction and growth trust prgt the recent approval of 650 billion in special drawing rights sdrs will go a long way towards boosting liquidity and combatting covid 19 in africa provided a viable framework can be developed to enable advanced economies to pass on their sdrs to poorer countries the world bank in turn has supported 30 ssa countries through its fast track covid 19 facility in addition the bank s health emergency preparedness and response multidonor fund has to date extended approximately 50 million in financing to eligible countries as of september 20 2021 the bank has approved the allocation of 1 9 billion to the acquisition and distribution of covid 19 vaccines in 30 sub saharan african countries and 2 8 billion to the continent as a whole other regional development finance institutions dfis have stepped up to provide support as well the african development bank afdb mobilised 10 billion to establish its covid 19 response facility to assist governments and the private sector it also launched a 3 billion fight covid 19 social bond with a 3 year maturity period the islamic development bank in turn has using several instruments contributed a total of 2 4 billion to west and central african countries côte d ivoire mauritania sierra leone mali uganda chad and guinea bissau china which has a 17 stake in african debt has also been involved in debt relief efforts by participating in the dssi and negotiating a dssi suspension through china exim bank for angola and zambia currently participation in the dssi and the common framework seems to be the best options for african countries to manage their debt more effectively and enhance their fiscal space there is however a general consensus that the current debt relief efforts are inadequate the numbers don t match the scale of the problem this has compelled countries like ghana and nigeria to go to international capital markets at a cost for example in march 2021 ghana successfully floated a 3 billion eurobond issuance and in september nigeria raised 4 billion in eurobonds ssa countries disadvantaged in terms of access to and cost of development finance before covid 19 debt levels in africa were already of growing concern the pandemic has pushed them even higher with the ratio of public debt to gdp increasing across the continent despite all the efforts to contain the debt burden of developing countries only two african countries are now at a low risk of debt distress in the wake of covid19 furthermore between 2017 and 2019 the uptake of more expensive financing instruments like eurobonds has resulted in higher interest rates on international capital markets irrespective of debt to gdp ratios african economies on average pay higher thannormal coupon rates the spreads on african government bonds are 5 7 percentage points higher than other borrowers 6 8 for african governments compared to 1 05 for others even after controlling for global factors and country specific risk african economies that participated in the heavily indebted poor countries hipc initiative in the past are more likely to pay higher coupon spreads at issue than an average country furthermore dssieligible countries have a higher average coupon rate equivalent to 7 the situation is further exacerbated by the fact that many african countries have attained middle income status and no longer have access to concessional loans from development lenders the difficult position of african countries in international capital markets has become even more apparent in the wake of covid 19 within the first year of the pandemic at least 10 african countries were downgraded by credit rating agencies cras angola botswana cameroon cape verde democratic republic of the congo gabon mauritius nigeria south africa and zambia as stated earlier debt restructuring by countries under a globally coordinated mechanism like the common framework comes with the risk of downgrades as the experience of ethiopia suggests the approach adopted by cras unduly adds to the cost of borrowing and greatly limits the potential of international capital to facilitate the economic recovery process in africa international response to the covid 19 crisis and recovery in developing countries affected by weak global donor coordination covid 19 happened at a time when global donor coordination was at its weakest in over a decade the progress made in terms of donor coordination and aid effectiveness following the high level forums in rome 2003 paris 2005 accra 2008 and busan 2011 has been on the decline and this clearly hindered effective responses and the mobilisation of funds by donors in the early months of the pandemic advanced economies that were better resourced and had the political heft to galvanise support to slow the spread of the virus globally especially in very deprived countries were seen instead to be prioritising national and sub national measures for example the us which has historically led global pandemic response efforts prioritised domestic economic and health concerns while disassociating itself both from coordination efforts and high level funding on the global stage the silence from developed countries led to 160 global leaders calling on the g20 to take bold steps to strengthen weak health systems in latin america and africa until then efforts to manage the global spread of covid 19 had been chaotic and fragmented with countries putting in too little too late towards prevention this significantly slowed the international donor community s response to african countries in contrast the speed with which the african union au persuaded members to adopt the africa joint continental strategy for covid 19 establish the au covid 19 response fund and constitute an african task force for coronavirus was critical in stemming the spread of the virus and providing much needed supplies to the continent while global cooperation and commitment in fighting covid have improved the weakened aid architecture and low commitment to development effectiveness pose a risk to recovery efforts in africa firm commitment to the principles of aid effectiveness were crucial for the quick recovery of the global economy after the 2008 9 global financial crisis gfc today poor donor coordination alongside reductions in oda by major development partners such as the uk could have a major negative impact on economic recovery many ssa countries are now struggling to harmonise the limited grant financing with their economic growth and recovery plans according to the global movement one had all donors met the target of spending 0 7 of gross national income gni on oda an additional 189 billion would have been available for developing countries to fight covid and get their economies back on track in a 2017 study conducted by the african center for economic transformation acet it was clear that the thrust behind the budget support envisaged in the aid development effectiveness paradigm has been reversed by bilateral donors with many partners having abandoned general budget support a major instrument for supporting economic recovery in developing countries in favour of project aid and new models of development cooperation such as trilateral development cooperation frameworks and blended financing facilities furthermore emerging economies eg china and non state actors have remained outside any coordination systems despite constituting an increasingly important source of development finance for africa local coordination arrangements designed by national governments have not always been fit for purpose policy priorities to mobilise sustainable financing for economic recovery ssa is set to recover from the 2020 recession with an expected growth rate of 3 3 in 2021 although this is much lower than other regions this rebound is being fuelled by high commodity prices improvements in global trade and the removal of stringent public health related economic measures yet it masks the deeper debt sustainability problems facing many african countries the g20 and other development partners can do more to ease the debt burden of african countries thereby helping to fast track inclusive and transformative economic recovery across the continent addressing the escalating debt crisis facilitating access to affordable finance and ensuring that development partner coordination is de fragmented and aligned to national economic development plans should be at the core of any support provided to the continent in 2020 acet identified ten policy priorities for africa s recovery growth and transformation on the basis of these recommendations and the work performed under the g20 compact with africa cwa the following steps are proposed to achieve sustainable financing for economic recovery and transformation on the continent first as stated above africa urgently needs additional financing to accelerate countries economic recovery efforts while not sufficient on its own oda is nevertheless critical for the implementation of development policies and the financing of public goods needed to boost health standards and economic recovery on the continent furthermore grants from non traditional development partners such as foundations are crucial accompaniments to oda as they support the piloting and testing of new innovations that are essential for economic transformation optimising the value of these grant funds requires national governments to put in place donor coordination frameworks to ensure that partner support is aligned behind a single national plan for such a framework to work traditional and nontraditional donors need to commit to aligning their finance to national imperatives and plans and to collaborate through these frameworks the g20 countries have a myriad of traditional and non traditional bilateral donors most of these countries are also hosts to africa s largest foundation donors with the cwa platform offering a potential template for donor coordination furthermore as development grant assistance is limited in scale african countries also need to attract private sector investors local regional and foreign the steady shift from development cooperation to economic cooperation can if effectively structured facilitate the gradual recovery in fdi and other private capital flows to the continent tunisia a cwa country offers a useful model for promoting donor coordination as a horizontal ministry that interacts with multiple development agencies the tunisian ministry of development and international cooperation mdci developed a collaborative monitoring system that facilitates internal coordination between technical departments involved in cwa reforms and development partners to ensure alignment behind a common national plan the coordination platform includes an it system that gives stakeholders direct and real time access to data from programmes such as the cwa tunisia s joint budget support matrix financed by the kreditanstalt für wiederaufbau kfw agence française de développement afd japan international cooperation agency jica afdb and world bank and the eu matrices thereby ensuring transparency and regular communication about the status of agreed reforms the platform also enables the government of tunisia to track the levels of private investment that a country attracts as a result of the reforms including fdi from g20 countries second development partners could reallocate some resources earmarked for public investment to de risk private projects on the continent thereby spurring recovery furthermore the imf could work with developed countries to reallocate their substantial sdr allocations which they will not be using in the short term to de risk capital market borrowing by african countries these two processes should help reduce the cost of borrowing for african countries and businesses third the g20 should yield to ongoing calls for debt cancellation and extend the dssi for an additional two years while also pacing debt payments within the period to prevent african countries from being suddenly overwhelmed with a huge debt burden at the conclusion of the dssi there have been growing calls for the g20 and the donor community to cancel the debt of low and middle income countries while africa s rising debt post the hipc has made development partners hesitant about going the debt relief route it is critical to give african countries much needed fiscal space to prioritise investments in strategic economic sectors so that they can build forward better timely debt relief is relatively effective by delaying it development partners will simply leave overindebted countries and their populations worse off alongside any support they receive from the g20 african governments should also commit to engaging in improved fiscal management by borrowing responsibly and being more prudent with their expenditure to ensure that they do not regress again fourth the development of a fair and transparent multilateral framework for the purpose of debt crisis resolution is urgently required to address countries unsustainable and inimical debt situation bringing commercial creditors and new actors in the development finance architecture to the table could unlock additional sources of finance to stimulate the recovery of african countries a recent imf study estimated that if brought on board the private sector could by the end of the decade bring additional annual financing equivalent to 3 of ssa s gdp for physical and social infrastructure including private actors in global debt management efforts requires the g20 to find a way to create a public registry for loan and debt data which adequately covers debt across countries of all income levels as well as instruments existing initiatives like the oecd debt transparency initiative have so far excluded information both on middle income countries and sovereign bonds making is difficult to fully appreciate the debt challenges faced by developing countries improving debt transparency will be key to african countries improving their debt management practices which in turn will bolster their economic recovery it is also imperative that any support given to african countries that is aimed at enhancing debt management to stimulate economic recovery prioritises capacity building of government officials in the area of debt management particularly debt audits and internal controls as well as the prudent management of expenditure the latter being a neglected area finally g20 partners should heed calls and work with other countries to explore the feasibility of establishing independent and publicly owned cras that will assess africa s credit ratings more fairly and transparently which should hopefully bring down the cost of borrowing to levels similar to those in other countries acknowledgement saiia gratefully acknowledges the support of

federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks during a senate banking committee hearing on capitol hill in washington tuesday nov 30 2021 ap photo andrew harnik with inflation surging and unemployment falling the federal reserve said wednesday that it will shrink its support for the economy more quickly and expects to raise interest rates three times next year fed chair jerome powell said the u s economy is growing at a robust pace even as it faces risks from the pandemic and he thinks spending by businesses and consumers will remain strong but because inflation is likely to persist longer than the fed had earlier expected powell said the central bank needs to address that threat to help the economy sustain its expansion we will use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched powell said at a news conference in a sharp policy shift the fed said it will withdraw its monthly bond purchases at twice the pace it previously announced and likely end them in march the accelerated timetable puts the fed on a path to start raising rates as early as the first half of next year the fed s new forecast that it will raise its benchmark short term rate three times next year is up from just one rate hike it had projected in september the fed s key rate now pinned near zero influences many consumer and business loans including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans those borrowing costs may start to rise in the coming months though the fed s actions don t always immediately affect other loan rates and even if the central bank does raise rates three times next year it would still leave its benchmark rate historically low below 1 the policy change reflects fed policymakers acknowledgement that with inflation pressures rising the fed needed to begin tightening credit for consumers and businesses faster than they had expected just a few weeks earlier the fed had earlier characterized the inflation spike as mainly a transitory problem that would fade as supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic were resolved the shift was signaled in testimony that powell gave to congress two weeks ago the run up in prices has persisted longer than the fed expected and has spread from goods like food energy and autos to services like apartment rents restaurant meals and hotel rooms it has weighed heavily on consumers especially lower income households and particularly for everyday necessities and negated the higher wages many workers have received powell was asked at his news conference wednesday what specifically had caused the fed to pivot to a tighter credit policy it was essentially higher inflation and much faster progress in the labor market he said he acknowledged the possibility that inflation won t decline as expected next year there s a real risk now powell said that inflation may be more persistent and that may be putting inflation expectations under pressure and that the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched has increased i think part of the reason behind our move today is to put ourselves in a position to be able to deal with that risk collectively the fed s policymakers forecast wednesday that inflation as measured by their preferred gauge will reach 5 3 by year s end up from their october reading of 5 they expect inflation to slow considerably to a 2 6 annual rate by the end of 2022 but that s up from its september forecast of just 2 2 the officials foresee the unemployment rate falling to 3 5 by the end of next year which would match the pre pandemic level when unemployment was at 50 year lows the fed is buying 90 billion a month in bonds down from 120 billion in october and had been reducing those purchases by 15 billion a month but in january it will reduce those purchases by 30 billion to 60 billion and will be on track powell said to end them altogether in march the bond buying has been intended to lower long term interest rates and encourage more borrowing and spending the fed is shifting its attention away from reducing unemployment which has fallen quickly to a healthy 4 2 down from 4 8 at its last meeting and toward reining in higher prices consumer prices soared 6 8 in november compared with a year earlier the government said last week the fastest pace in nearly four decades on wall street stock prices rose gradually and then surged after the fed issued its statement and powell began speaking at a news conference by the time powell finished the dow jones industrial average had jumped more than 300 points the fed s policy change does carry risks raising borrowing costs too fast could stifle consumer and business spending that in turn would weaken the economy and likely raise unemployment yet if the fed waits too long to raise rates inflation could surge out of control it might then have to act aggressively to tighten credit and potentially trigger another recession fed officials have said they expect inflation to cool by the second half of next year gas prices have already come off their peaks supply chain bottlenecks in some areas are gradually easing and government stimulus payments which helped spur a spike in spending that boosted inflation aren t likely to return yet many economists expect high prices to persist that likelihood was reinforced this week by a government report that wholesale inflation jumped 9 6 for the 12 months ending in november the fastest year over year pace on records dating to 2010 housing costs including apartment rents and the cost of homeownership which make up about one third of the consumer price index have been rising at a 5 annual pace the past few months economists at goldman sachs have calculated restaurant prices jumped 5 8 in november from a year ago a nearly four decade high partly reflecting higher wage costs such increases will likely keep inflation well above the fed s 2 annual target next year at his news conference powell noted that consumers the leading driver of the economy remain on solid footing fundamentally he said the consumer is really healthy and we expect personal consumption expenditures to be pretty strong in the current fourth quarter of the year
listen to this article listen to this article editor s note business content from the new york times will now be included with your subscription to finance commerce not a subscriber start your subscription here shoppers may no longer come in droves for wrenches watches or washing machines but sears the once ubiquitous department store that has been battered by the growth of e commerce may have one last thing of value to market its own buildings starting about a decade ago and accelerating over the past few months as its owner embarked on the equivalent of a clearance sale investors have been betting on new uses for vacant sears stores from santa monica california to southern new jersey many of the sites often older windowless hulks connected to shopping malls are not straying far from their original mission they re being overhauled for new retailers but some addresses in line with a trend of repurposing dusty commercial properties are being given fresh and sometimes unexpected new functions at more than a dozen sites across the county developers are installing high end apartments cutting edge classrooms and even labs where classified weapons systems are conceived sears seemed to have thrown in the towel a long time ago and is now figuring out how to monetize its properties said joseph f coradino the ceo of preit a philadelphia based shopping center owner that has redeveloped about a half dozen sears stores most recently a health care facility announced it was taking over a shell at his moorestown mall in new jersey to be sure sears is not the only chain grappling with empty aisles several major department stores have filed for bankruptcy protection during the pandemic including neiman marcus j c penney and lord taylor though as with sears many of those retailers were struggling and closing locations well before the coronavirus crisis for sears the segue to new uses is perhaps most pronounced in its hometown chicago where for decades the tallest building was sears tower but no more sears moved out long ago and since 2009 the 1 450 foot black toned skyscraper has been called willis tower for a british insurance company in chicago several stores have recently completed or are about to embark on makeovers including one of sears oldest properties at east 79th street and south kenwood avenue which opened in 1928 and sold its last sewing machines in 2013 after all traces of sears were scrubbed away the buff brick nearly block long structure reopened last year as a self storage facility operated by extraspace storage i remember the cosmetics counter right inside the front door said zeb mclaurin recalling trips he made there with his family in the early 1980s today mclaurin the president of mclaurin development partners is a co owner of the 140 000 square foot building which he bought in 2018 for 900 000 the seller was seritage growth properties a real estate investment trust and an offshoot of esl investments which has owned sears since 2005 and controls kmart as well sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018 its assets were snapped up a year later by transformco another esl controlled entity only a handful of sears stores remain open with the opening of that chicago store nearly 100 years ago sears began a nationwide push to add a brick and mortar component to a thriving mail order business attention was paid to make its stores look similar to one another but also stand out indeed a tall central campanile style tower with arched windows at the east 79th store resembles one in the north lawndale neighborhood that once lorded over the company s factory and catalog printing plant that spire now called nichols tower got a new lease on life as a community center and hub of nonprofit groups focused on housing and education for mclaurin a demolition would not have been cost effective his site on the south side of chicago isn t suited for an expensive new development at least for now he said but others have retained stores for the architecture because in part they often find it compelling like in the portage park neighborhood of chicago where a once bustling shopping district is a shell of its old self novak development co which bought the two block site from seritage last year for 11 5 million is planning to preserve the art deco style facade of a 1938 sears while adding 206 apartments and 50 000 square feet of retail the city council gave the project its blessing this fall construction is expected next summer in 2020 novak bought another sears site in chicago from seritage a mix of beige brick buildings and parking lots across a three block west side site that cost 2 4 million novak will build 150 apartments and retail space although the site s sears store has been demolished since the pandemic started seritage s stock price has plunged while its longtime ceo has left by september its portfolio of 266 sears and kmart properties which the company bought for 2 7 billion in 2015 had been whittled to 171 according to a company spokesperson of those properties 130 were sears stores even with a trimmer portfolio seritage has continued to plow ahead with its own sears redevelopments filings show including a residential project in west covina california a fundamental challenge seems to be taking buildings that shunned natural light and adapting them for modern tastes which was a challenge at a cast concrete 1939 sears in houston to brighten the space which is owned by rice university designers removed the roof of the three story building and added two extra window lined floors the escalators were also eliminated in the 100 million renovation and replaced by classrooms and a 250 seat forum this was not a precious restoration in any way said anneli rice an architect with the firm shop we used what was useful and stripped away the rest the ion as the sears is now called partially opened last spring and counts microsoft and chevron among its office tenants a craft beer bar will open next year insufficient power and plumbing is a challenge at the former sears store at moorestown mall as it is converted to an outpatient medical clinic for cooper university health care network in spring 2020 cooper bought transformco s stake in the store for 9 million the 23 000 square foot 1963 structure originally had four bathrooms but because it will now house medical offices it will need about 50 said coradino the mall s owner who has also installed four new retailers in a vacant macy s and is mulling a proposal to repurpose an empty lord taylor plans are also afoot to build a hotel and 375 apartments on parking lots there for preit the upside of adding a health care clinic in the mall is the addition of new shoppers relatives of patients can now have something to do the thinking goes while they wait a similar calculation is playing out in lawton oklahoma a former sears at the city owned central plaza mall near the fort sill army base is being retooled as a hub for the production of weapons and navigation systems during the day defense contractors will toil away on top secret technology in rooms that were once cavernous but will be carved up into smaller rooms with more guardable doors in the interest of security said james taylor the director of the project the fista innovation park a shuttered dillard s in the mall is getting a similar reinvention but when it comes time for lunch the defense workers are expected to head out to the food courts and maybe shop along the way which should benefit the mall s retailers taylor said we ve created a collaborative ecosystem he added and anyway no one else was standing in line to occupy these stores this article originally appeared in the new york times

new york cnn business senator elizabeth warren and tesla ceo elon musk are in the middle of a full scale twitter war warren called the world s richest person a freeloader for paying 0 in income taxes in recent years musk responded with a series of personal attacks calling warren senator karen and claiming his income tax bill is about to be the largest in us history he could be right at least about his 2021 tax bill warren calls out musk warren has long advocated for raising taxes on the wealthy by imposing a tax on the richest americans assets rather than just their income after musk was named time magazine s person of the year warren complained he should be paying more taxes let s change the rigged tax code so the person of the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else she tweeted tuesday musk who has never shied from a twitter war replied with a string of insults you remind me of when i was a kid and my friend s angry mom would just randomly yell at everyone for no reason he said in one tweet musk is worth an estimated 251 billion according to forbes real time billionaires estimate but an investigation by propublica reported that in 2018 he and other billionaires paid zero in taxes that year he had little in the way of taxable income given that he sold no shares of his stock and received no cash salary or bonus why musk will pay at least 7 6 billion in taxes this year but musk will face a huge tax bill this year a fact he pointed out in another twitter response to warren and if you opened your eyes for 2 seconds you would realize i will pay more taxes than any american in history this year he tweeted musk has been exercising stock options he was granted as his compensation in 2012 options that vested as tesla hit some pre arranged financial and operational targets over the following six years those options are due to expire next year if he does not exercise them by august he will lose them although musk hasn t paid taxes on their value so far he will have to pay up soon and the tax bill will be substantial that s because once he does exercise those options the value of the shares he acquired less the very nominal exercise price of 6 24 a share counts as income and his bill on those shares will be at the top federal income tax rate of 37 plus another 3 8 net investment tax on top of that along with some undetermined level of state income tax musk could have waited until next year to exercise these options but if democrats are able to pass the build back better bill it could raise his federal tax bill significantly although passage of the bill is by no means certain it would raise the tax bite on the kind of trades musk made perhaps by 8 percentage points above what he now pays that s probably why he has been exercising the options earlier than he needed to so far musk has exercised nearly 15 million of the 22 9 million options that were due to expire and the value of those newly acquired shares was roughly 15 8 billion meaning he faces a federal tax bill of 6 4 billion he has sold 6 5 million of those newly acquired shares to pay the withholding due on the exercise of the options according to the filings he made with the securities and exchange commission about his stock trades he s been exercising options and selling shares every week since early november and he will probably exercise at least another 4 million options if not more before the end of the year that could raise his 2020 tax bill by nearly 2 billion more last month musk also sold 5 4 million shares he had held in trust most of which he has held since the 2010 initial public offering those shares will be taxed at a lower long term capital gain rate of 20 so he ll face an additional federal tax bill of about 1 2 billion more on those sales so his federal tax bill to date for 2021 stands at 7 6 billion with a chance it could rise to nearly 10 billion or more by year s end wealth tax would cost musk if it passes musk s net worth is mostly from his holdings in tesla although the value of his holdings in his other company privately held spacex is also significant over the years both companies benefited significantly from us taxpayer support with tesla receiving at least 6 billion from various tax credits on its electric vehicles and spacex signing government contracts worth about 10 billion warren proposed wealth tax legislation earlier this year that would impose a 2 tax on the net worth of individuals and trusts worth more than 50 million and less than 1 billion and 3 on those holdings of 1 billion or more musk as the richest person might face a tax bill of 7 5 billion if that proposal were to pass even if he didn t trade any stock next year given the current value of his holdings and tesla shares have risen more than any other in the last two years meaning he could pay even more if it continues to gain in value but that legislation so far has not come near to passing

an associated press review found fewer than 475 instances of potential voter fraud in the six states disputed by former president donald trump harrisburg pa a pennsylvania courtroom on wednesday became the latest battleground over claims the 2020 presidential election was rigged as republicans around the country pressed ahead with efforts to investigate the voting despite a lack of evidence of widespread fraud a five judge panel in harrisburg heard democrats arguments to block a subpoena sought by senate republicans seeking information on voters and election systems democrats argue the subpoena is an abuse of power and serves no legitimate legislative purpose a lawyer for senate republicans insisted lawmakers have a legitimate interest in getting the information to improve election law regardless of the backdrop of former president donald trump trying to get allies in battleground states to turn up evidence of election fraud the fact that there s noise floating around out there shouldn t concern the court lawyer matt haverstick said related articles house holds mark meadows in contempt of congress the election review in pennsylvania and another in wisconsin are part of the larger story as gop lawmakers elsewhere make their case for similar efforts in their states they cite concerns raised by claims made by trump and his allies who have referenced various conspiracy theories to explain his loss last november to democrat joe biden among the claims is that widespread voter fraud occurred but an associated press review found fewer than 475 instances of potential voter fraud in the six states disputed by trump a number that would have made no difference in the election though republican leaders argue their probes are needed to restore public confidence in elections but experts say it s the reviews themselves that are undermining faith in u s elections the intent of these reviews is to continue to create doubt distrust and confusion around an election that has been canvassed certified audited litigated and reviewed so they can keep the narrative going so they can continue to raise money and raise their political profiles said matt masterson a former top election security official in the trump administration in pennsylvania republicans led by senate president pro tempore jake corman insist the undertaking has nothing to do with trump or trying to overturn last year s election rather they say the point is to fix problems with the state s elections however the 2020 election has been the focus of republican controlled committees in the senate and house there have been numerous hearings hours of testimony and proposed legislation in an interview tuesday trump praised the work of republican lawmakers in wisconsin and pennsylvania and argued that many of the problems that arose in the election were due to pandemic related changes made outside of the legislative process they used covid in order to cheat as a way of cheating trump said in pennsylvania sen corman and a whole group of people are totally engaged because they ve now found that things were much different than they were told to conduct the review pennsylvania republicans have hired a small firm with little track record and no experience in elections there was no bidding for the contract and no public request for proposals a similar situation unfolded in arizona where senate republicans seeking a review of the 2020 election hired an outside firm that was criticized for its lack of knowledge of election systems and processes the arizona review ended in september without offering proof to support trump s claims of a stolen election in wisconsin this week republican assembly speaker robin vos said the investigation he ordered into the 2020 presidential election will spill into next year and cost more money so far the effort has cost taxpayers nearly 680 000 former wisconsin supreme court justice michael gableman was tapped to lead the investigation and has sought subpoenas of the mayors of the state s five largest cities and the state s top elections official democrats and some republicans in the state have criticized the investigation as a sham given that some of those hired by gableman worked in trump s administration or have supported conspiracy theories about the 2020 election trump lost wisconsin by nearly 21 000 votes an outcome that s been upheld following recounts multiple court rulings and a nonpartisan audit wisconsin election officials have so far identified 31 potential cases of voter fraud in 26 of those cases prosecutors declined to bring charges after conducting a review according to the ap s findings earlier this week republican state sen kathy bernier chair of the senate elections committee and the former chippewa county election clerk called the review a charade designed to appease the gop s conservative base and said questioning the integrity of elections will ultimately hurt turnout for republicans i understand there is frustration when you have a president saying there is massive voter fraud bernier said we have a great system here and no one should falsely accuse election officials of cheating the wave of demands for reviews of the election also includes reliably republican states that trump won in 2020 last week a panel of majority gop lawmakers in utah approved an audit of the state s election system unlike arizona the utah effort will be conducted by nonpartisan legislative auditors and is not focused solely on 2020 republican lt gov deidre henderson cautioned that efforts questioning the integrity of the state s voting system are destructive and very concerning from all of the things that i have seen the endgame here is to fundamentally destroy the voting system we have here in the state of utah henderson said in an interview ___

jeff amy associated press atlanta ap electric vehicle maker rivian automotive will announce thursday that it s building a 5 billion battery and assembly plant east of atlanta that s projected to employ 7 500 workers sources briefed on the decision told the associated press rivian based in irvine california is a startup manufacturer of electric trucks and commercial delivery vans challenging both established automakers like ford and general motors and electric vehicle leader tesla the plant could grow to as many as 10 000 workers sources said which would make it among the largest auto assembly complexes in the united states rivaled by behemoths such as the 11 000 worker bmw complex in spartanburg south carolina and ford motor co s 8 600 worker plant in louisville kentucky more a green tech battery plant in commerce is transforming deep red georgia more lg energy solution sk innovation come to agreement clears way for commerce battery plant rivian will be the largest industrial announcement in georgia history surpassing the 4 400 worker kia complex that opened in west point in 2009 georgia has had a number of failed auto plant recruitments rivian will give georgia gov brian kemp another point to bolster his claims that he has been an excellent steward of georgia s economy even as faces republican and democratic challengers when he runs for reelection next year the city of fort worth texas offered rivian a 440 million incentive package to lure the plant during the summer while published reports indicate rivian also considered sites in arizona and michigan rivian told fort worth its plant would make 200 000 vehicles per year with workers paid at least 56 000 a year the atlanta journal constitution was the first to report rivian s decision the ajc reported that rivian was eyeing a location along i 20 straddling walton and morgan between the cities of social circle and rutledge founder and ceo robert scaringe told bloomberg television in november that the ability to recruit good workers was the most important factor in the decision rivian s existing plant in normal illinois like most auto plants that have opened in recent decades is not unionized georgia officials are unlikely to detail the full incentive package offered to rivian on thursday but the company could max out what georgia calls its mega project tax credit for companies that hire at least 1 800 people or invest at least 450 million that could be worth 118 million in state income tax credits local governments are likely to abate property taxes kia got more than 450 million in incentives for its plant southwest of atlanta georgia has promised 300 million of incentives to the 2 6 billion 2 600 worker battery plant being built by sk innovation in commerce georgia northeast of atlanta rivian like tesla deals with its customers directly instead of through dealers its arrival in georgia could prompt the state to loosen a law that mostly prohibits manufacturers from selling directly rivian currently plans two models for consumers the r1t pickup with a base price of 67 500 and the r1s suv with a base price of 70 000 the truck was recently named motor trend s 2022 truck of the year amazon which owns a slice of the company has ordered 100 000 delivery vans launching rivian into the commercial vehicle business rivian is flush with cash following a 11 9 billion stock offering nov 10 that took the company public allowing it to finance the new plant its market value is nearly 95 billion more than either general motors or ford the company argues that electric vehicle adoption is at the tipping point and it is well positioned for success because trucks and suvs have long been the most profitable vehicles sold but some analysts question whether it needs another plant besides the former mitsubishi plant in illinois that rivian bought for 16 million in 2017 rivian says it has a yearly capacity of 150 000 vehicles but is looking to expand there as well it seems like it might be a little premature to invest that much in another large plant just yet said sam abuelsamid principal mobility analyst for guidehouse insights who said rivian also may be looking for a manufacturing site in europe given the size of the georgia plant abuelsamid expects it to make other parts for the vehicles similar to electric vehicle leader tesla making seats at its factory in fremont california rivian has cash in the bank but will burn through that quickly unless it starts delivering vehicles and generating cash jeopardizing its market darling status abuelsamid said the company needs more retail customers and commercial vehicle buyers other than amazon he said if actual deliveries don t start picking up the markets could turn against them as they have with some other ev startups not called tesla abuelsamid said unlike tesla rivian will be facing serious competition in a much shorter time frame than the near decade head start that tesla had ford and gm plan to start selling their own electric pickup trucks in the next year or two while tesla also plans a new pickup that s part of a wave of electric vehicle investment with sk s 5 billion battery plant northeast of atlanta just one example ford announced in september it would spend 11 4 billion to build three battery factories and an assembly plant in kentucky and tennessee the lmc automotive consulting firm expects u s sales of new fully electric vehicles to hit nearly 400 000 this year nearly double last year s figures but they still make up only about 2 6 of

washington ap the federal reserve will quicken the pace at which it s pulling back its support for the economy as inflation surges and it expects to raise interest rates three times next year in a sharp policy shift the fed announced wednesday that it will shrink its monthly bond purchases at twice the pace it previously announced likely ending them altogether in march the accelerated timetable puts the fed on a path to start raising rates in the first half of next year the fed s new forecast that it will raise its benchmark short term rate three times next year is up from just one rate hike it had projected in september the fed s key rate now pinned near zero influences many consumer and business loans including for mortgages credit cards and auto loans those borrowing costs may start to rise in the coming months though the fed s actions don t always immediately affect other loan rates and even if the central bank does raise rates three times next year it would still leave its benchmark rate historically low below 1 the policy change the fed announced wednesday had been signaled in testimony chair jerome powell gave to congress two weeks ago in discussing the extraordinary support the fed supplied the economy after the pandemic struck last year the shift reflects powell s acknowledgement that with inflation pressures rising the fed needed to begin tightening credit for consumers and businesses faster than he had thought just a few weeks earlier the fed had earlier characterized the inflation spike as mainly a transitory problem that would fade as supply bottlenecks caused by the pandemic were resolved the run up in prices has persisted longer than the fed expected and has spread from goods like food energy and autos to services like apartment rents restaurant meals and hotel rooms it has weighed heavily on consumers especially lower income households and particularly for everyday necessities and negated the higher wages many workers have received powell was asked at a news conference wednesday what specifically had caused the fed to pivot to a tighter credit policy it was essentially higher inflation and much faster progress in the labor market he said as a result the fed is shifting its attention away from reducing unemployment which has fallen quickly to a healthy 4 2 down from 4 8 at its last meeting and toward reining in higher prices consumer prices soared 6 8 in november compared with a year earlier the government said last week the fastest pace in nearly four decades on wall street stock prices rose modestly after the fed issued its statement and powell began speaking at a news conference investors had largely anticipated the fed s policy announcements the fed s new policy shift does carry risks raising borrowing costs too fast could stifle consumer and business spending that in turn would weaken the economy and likely raise unemployment yet if the fed waits too long to raise rates inflation could surge out of control it might then have to act aggressively to tighten credit and potentially trigger another recession fed officials have said they expect inflation to cool by the second half of next year gas prices have already come off their peaks supply chain bottlenecks in some areas are gradually easing and government stimulus payments which helped spur a spike in spending that boosted inflation aren t likely to return yet many economists expect high prices to persist that likelihood was reinforced this week by a government report that wholesale inflation jumped 9 6 for the 12 months ending in november the fastest year over year pace on records dating to 2010 housing costs including apartment rents and the cost of homeownership which make up about one third of the consumer price index have been rising at a 5 annual pace the past few months economists at goldman sachs have calculated restaurant prices jumped 5 8 in november from a year ago a nearly four decade high partly reflecting higher wage costs such increases will likely keep inflation well above the fed s 2 annual target next year the fed s monthly bond purchases were intended to hold down long term rates to aid the economy but with unemployment falling and inflation at a near 40 year high they are no longer needed
in 2018 steve bannon then us president donald trump s chief strategist argued that the united states needed to decouple from china since then the term has become a fixture in discussions of sino american relations to the point that some such as former australian prime minister kevin rudd have warned that it could become a self fulfilling prophecy how salient is that risk today some decoupling is undeniably underway in recent years the two countries have been locked in a tariff war moreover the united states has implemented sanctions against the chinese tech giants zte and huawei authorized the delisting of chinese companies from us stock exchanges unless they meet us auditing standards and added a number of chinese companies to its entity list thereby subjecting them to additional trade restrictions this trend extends beyond trade and technology for example the number of chinese students enrolled in us universities has plummeted and the us has announced plans for a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 winter olympics in beijing prompting condemnation from china yet it is unlikely that either china or the us is as keen to decouple as these developments may suggest china has adopted a passive approach reacting to us actions while taking care not to initiate any fights and while americans broadly support a tough line on china far fewer support cutting economic ties decoupling is certainly not in the interest of the us business community as the us chamber of commerce recently reported american companies would lose hundreds of billions of dollars if they slashed investment in china or the nations increased tariffs this may partly explain why even trump s vice president mike pence in 2019 answered with a resounding no when asked if the administration wanted to decouple from china more recently us trade representative katherine tai argued that far from decoupling which isn t a realistic outcome the us is pursuing recoupling us officials are merely pinpointing their goals in this process whatever those goals turn out to be some recoupling is already happening as the us china business council reports after the two countries signed the phase one trade agreement in 2020 both sides halted tariff escalations furthermore china instituted a robust system of tariff exclusions with the us also instituting some exclusions this has contributed to a rebound in bilateral trade in 2020 us goods exports to china grew by roughly 18 percent more than making up for the tariff driven drop of more than 11 percent in 2019 with that china has retained its position as the third largest market for us goods exports china has also been maintaining or even deepening its ties with the rest of the global economy as nicholas r lardy of the peterson institute for international economics observes despite economic and financial tensions and a plethora of foreign restrictions on the transfer of technology to china the country continues to attract record amounts of foreign direct investment in fact in 2020 china s inbound fdi grew by more than 10 percent to 212 billion putting its share of global fdi at an all time high of one fourth almost twice its share in 2019 china s leaders seem happy to continue on this path in september china s central bank and financial regulators pledged to optimize market access requirements for foreign banks and insurance companies improve rules on cross border transactions between parent companies and subsidiaries and expand channels for foreign capital to participate in the domestic financial market china is also pursuing complementary domestic reforms aimed for example at achieving competitive neutrality and it is using market mechanisms such as exchange rate flexibility to balance its trade account furthermore china is working to strengthen its adherence to international rules and norms such as intellectual property protections a key concern of foreign companies operating in china as the us china business council notes china has made steady efforts to improve protection and enforcement of ip rights and its ip laws and regulations increasingly reflect international standards china s leaders are also working to strengthen regional and multilateral cooperation the country s calls for revitalizing the world trade organization its participation in the regional comprehensive economic partnership and its application to join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership exemplify this effort overall it seems clear that china is committed to upholding global value chains yes it is adjusting its economic structure in order to reduce reliance on foreign demand and investing heavily in research and development with the goal of improving its capacity for indigenous innovation but contrary to what some western observers believe china has been pursuing its own form of decoupling for more than a decade since it launched a campaign to develop more advanced technologies at home this is in response to western efforts to deny chinese firms access to advanced technologies efforts that in many cases have caught the chinese by surprise if any steps china takes in this process turn out to be problematic they can be negotiated within the wto framework this might not be exactly what the us envisioned when it supported china s accession to the wto 20 years ago but in its own way china is fulfilling the promise of that step and it will most likely continue to do so as long as the us lets it nonetheless rudd s warning should not be taken lightly if we keep talking about decoupling we may well get it that is an outcome we would all live to regret the author is a former president of the china society of world economics and director of the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of social sciences served on the monetary policy committee of the people s bank of china from 2004 to 2006 project syndicate the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

bloomberg federal reserve chair jerome powell signaled on wednesday that inflation is now enemy no 1 to keeping the economic expansion on track and returning the labor market to something approaching ebullient pre pandemic levels in an abrupt policy pivot the fed sped up the drawdown of its asset purchase program and laid out a road map for a series of interest rate increases over coming years started with three hikes in 2022 powell also raised the possibility that the u s central bank might begin to withdraw liquidity from the financial system before too long by reducing its massive balance sheet one of the two big threats to getting back to maximum employment is actually high inflation powell said during a press briefing adding that the pandemic was the other what we need is another long expansion like the ones we have been having over the last 40 years financial markets took the shift in the fed s rhetoric in stride with investors betting that the central bank can pull off a proverbial soft landing of the economy reining in rapid price increases with gradual increases in interest rates that don t materially damage gross domestic product stock prices posted the biggest rally since 2020 the first step for the fed is open mouth operations they are talking tough said scott brown chief economist with raymond james financial the fed is seeing inflation broadening out and people are hearing about inflation on the nightly news inflation inflation inflation the fed is worried about that they re not the only ones worried faced with sagging opinion polls and growing voter concern about rapid inflation president joe biden has recently taken to acknowledging the damage being done by higher prices while still talking up the strength of the economy some economists have their doubts about the fed s ability to keep the expansion going arguing that it s been slow off the mark in shifting its focus to an inflationary threat that has been steadily building throughout the year the fed had fallen behind the curve in terms of its rhetoric and actions in regard to containing the threat from inflation said mark vitner a senior economist at wells fargo in the past it has proven very difficult to slow inflation when the economy is at full employment and real gdp is growing faster than its potential that is where we will be in 2022 powell renomination powell denied that the timing of his pivot had anything to do with biden s decision to renominate him for another four year term telling reporters that he had begun putting it in place before the president made his announcement on nov 22 the shift by the fed comes after months in which powell had insisted that the rise in inflation was transitory and driven by supply chain bottlenecks that would fade with time the fed on wednesday drove a stake in the transitory rhetoric dropping it completely from its post meeting statement powell said the fed still sees inflation coming down next year and beyond and the forecasts that policy makers released on wednesday bear that out but to bring that about they now see a markedly more rapid pace of interest rate increases than they projected just two months ago while the fed statement referenced the risk to the economy from new covid 19 variants powell played down the potential impact of omicron arguing that growth was strong and that vaccinated americans were learning to live with the virus powell maintained that the u s could well reach maximum employment next year when policy makers are projecting that they will start lifting interest rates from zero unemployment has fallen rapidly though at 4 2 for november it is still above the 3 5 mark prior to the pandemic he acknowledged that the labor market may not fully return to the stellar levels that prevailed before covid 19 struck particularly when it comes to workforce participation some americans probably have dropped out of the labor force for good including aging baby boomers whose retirement savings plans have benefited from a surging stock market we re not going back to the same economy we had in february of 2020 powell said indeed he said the fed was keeping a close eye on wages lest they begin rising so rapidly that they feed into already too high inflation we would not in any way want to foreclose the idea that the labor market can get even better the fed chair said but again with inflation as high as it is we have to make policy in real time we ve got to make that assessment in real time 2021 bloomberg l p

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news by johnna crider and zachary shahan elon musk was recently awarded time magazine s person of the year for 2021 and quite a few talking heads are really upset about this in fact they are going as far as to claim that elon musk doesn t pay taxes at all and are radicalizing their bases against elon musk let s change the rigged tax code so the person of the year will actually pay taxes and stop freeloading off everyone else elizabeth warren senwarren december 13 2021 this is a tool that they are using intentionally to push an agenda but attacking an individual in this way for how the system is structured is not fair or appropriate in any case elon musk is not freeloading off of everyone else as we ll get into in a moment many members of the democratic party are pushing this narrative this isn t to say that another trump term would have been better it wouldn t have been but it does reflect just how far america has fallen there is a relentless attack on elon musk for being successful while achieving goals that the democratic party is typically aligned with it makes no sense instead of questioning what is established fact check the forms he s filed with the sec why can t you answer johnna s questions is it because those issues aren t for solving but for expoiting for political capital opentoridicule opentoridicule december 14 2021 senator elizabeth warren contributed to a popular narrative by claiming that elon musk isn t paying taxes accusing him of freeloading off of taxpayers this simply isn t true unfortunately many attempts to educate about how stocks work have been met with intense criticism name calling and blind hate from some members of the democratic base who have a raging hatred for elon musk and often wealthy people in general recently north carolina political candidate mark judson district 4 randomly followed me on twitter i saw his tweet echoing senator warren s i peacefully and respectfully yet pointedly called out the fact that members of congress are freeloading well more than elon musk is i was told by the candidate to stop taking brown acid instead of actually having a conversation with me he attempted to degrade me online many are using elon musk and his wealth to score political points but they have manipulated their bases with lies and cherry picked statistics old news articles and disregard for the actual achievements of tesla and elon musk whether intentionally or not they have sacrificed the truth for a particular agenda or narrative elon musk will pay over 15 000 000 000 in taxes this year the most in american history jeff jefftutorials december 15 2021 and americans are falling for it they see it in the news elon is a bad person a villain and we must hate him because he is stealing from the poor this is what several of my friends actually have told me yet these people didn t lift a finger to help me when i was homeless elon did despite not knowing me he shared something i wrote to him from my jewelry blog and those sales saved me he also encouraged me to not give up yet people don t care about the good he s done they only care because of what they see on tv their god like politicians are saying elon musk is a bad person so they follow along and blindly hate him whether or not you support elon musk isn t the issue here the issue is his identity is being used by those with power to push another darker agenda and people are falling for it this is sad yet terrifying many people are inherently good many things that democrats fight for are worthy causes human rights women s rights equality and yes wealth inequality is something that does need to be solved however blaming people like elon musk and jeff bezos will not solve this problem using them as demons to hate just because of their success means treating humans they are simply humans after all in unfair and hurtful ways attacking them in all sorts of ways just for achieving big things as the founders and heads of hugely successful companies america spent 20 years 2 3 trillion and thousands of american lives replacing the taliban in afghanistan with the taliban imagine what elon musk could have done and achieved with such money once politicians are done using elon musk they will find another bad guy for their bases to hate this is not the way forward to a better society elon s wealth is tied up in shares of companies he founded or cofounded and which he led to great success despite so many barriers and so many people saying he couldn t he hasn t paid much in taxes in recent years because that s how the tax system works you pay taxes on income including income from selling stocks but not on shares you own and hold for months or years this year elon finally sold tesla shares and he is paying a record high amount in taxes as a result he hasn t had his net worth sitting in a bank account it s in stock value that has increased dramatically as his companies have achieved more if tesla had gone bankrupt a few years ago like many thought it would he would be far far less wealthy after years of simply holding his shares often while tesla was the most shorted stock on the stock market he is selling tesla stock and paying billions of dollars in taxes is that freeloading it doesn t seem like it by the way while leading tesla and spacex elon has created more than 100 000 jobs generated who knows how much in various types of taxes provided healthcare to workers across the us and the globe and been a leading force cutting global warming emissions is he perfect no of course not but he s certainly not a freeloader have a tip for cleantechnica want to advertise want to suggest a guest for our cleantech talk

los angeles california a coalition of california restaurants and grocery stores has filed a lawsuit to block a new farm animal welfare law under the new law pigs egg laying chickens and veal calves must have enough space to stand and turn around in holding pens while egg and veal producers seem to be able to meet the new standards hog farmers argued the changes would be too expensive and could not be carried out until the state approves final regulations the law which was overwhelmingly approved by voters in november 2018 and will come into force on new year s day 2022 adds to uncertainty about the cost and availability of bacon and other fresh pork products most hog producers have not made changes to comply with the law and a coalition of business owners is seeking more than a two year delay meanwhile the state government has eased the transition to the new system by allowing pork processed under the old rules and held in cold storage to be sold in 2022 however josh balk from the humane society of the u s stressed that california residents should not fear pork industry claims of the apocalypse according to abc news north carolina state university calculated that the new standard would cost some 15 percent more per animal for a farm with 1 000 breeding pigs also the national pork producers council challenged california s right to impose standards on businesses in other states but these efforts have failed california is the largest u s market for pork and producers in major hog states such as iowa provide more than 80 percent of the pork consumed monthly in the state totaling some 255 million pounds said global food and agriculture financial services company rabobank however california s agriculture and health departments have said they have not had enough time to approve the final regulations of the new law and are still accepting public comments for revisions in december therefore it could be months before final rules are approved if the law takes effect 1st january california could avoid immediate shortages or steep price increases as some 466 million pounds of pork have been kept in storage massachusetts has approved a similar animal welfare law which will take effect next month but state lawmakers are considering a one year delay due to supply concerns the accuracy of the california estimates could depend on how many farmers adopt the new standards and how long the transition takes

nearly a week after lee enterprises rejected alden global capital s attempt to buy the newspaper publisher the hedge fund responded wednesday with a lawsuit accusing lee s board of improperly denying shareholders the chance to have a say on the offer lee rejected alden s offer to buy the company for 24 a share or roughly 141 million last thursday because the company s board decided the offer grossly undervalued the company but alden argued in its lawsuit that lee shouldn t have rejected its offer without even talking to the hedge fund alden also said lee shouldn t have refused to accept its nomination of three outside directors for technical reasons so it wants the court to order lee to accept those nominees lee s stockholder unfriendly staggered board has exhibited all of the symptoms of severely entrenched leadership focused more on its own power than what s best for the company alden spokesperson cameron gurley said lee officials didn t immediately respond to questions about the lawsuit wednesday afternoon but the company has been steadfast so far in its opposition to alden the new york based hedge fund that owns 6 3 of lee s stock became one of the largest newspaper owners in the nation after swallowing all of tribune s newspapers earlier this year but it has also earned a reputation for imposing severe cost cuts and layoffs two other hedge funds that are among lee s largest shareholders praetorian capital and cannell capital have said they think the company is worth much more than alden is offering i think there is still a tremendous amount of value said carlo cannell managing director of the wyoming based fund in fact cannell estimates lee s stock could be worth 285 a share within five years if the company does everything right as it continues to transition more toward digital instead of print publication alden said in its lawsuit that it intended its 24 offer to be preliminary and it could have been changed if the company had engaged in constructive talks lee s stock gained another 12 wednesday to close at 40 53 before the lawsuit was announced before alden made its initial bid the stock was selling for 18 49 the newspaper industry overall has been struggling with that digital transition because it been accompanied by shrinking revenue and the pandemic increased the financial pressure on newspapers many newspapers across the country closed over the last two decades and nearly half of all newsroom jobs were eliminated between 2004 and 2018 even before lee rejected alden s bid it adopted a poison pill plan that would make it more expensive for alden to buy up lee s shares once it owns more than 10 of the company at that point the plan would allow lee s other shareholders to buy shares at a 50 discount or possibly get free shares for every share they already own lee owns the st louis post dispatch the buffalo news and dozens of other newspapers including nearly every daily newspaper in nebraska unions that represent journalists at those papers have come out strongly against alden because they re worried about what the hedge fund would do alden has bought up roughly 200 publications across the country in recent years through a series of acquisitions besides the tribune papers alden also owns the denver post orange county register and boston herald

operating results within flight support and record quarterly and full year operating results within electronic technologies consolidated operating income and net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal

less cash and cash equivalents of 128 2 million as of october 31 2021 to shareholders equity ratio improved to a very low 5 6 as of october 31 2021 down from 16 6 as of october 31 2020 which provides

2021 down from 71x as of october 31 2020 during fiscal 2021 we successfully completed six acquisitions and have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2024 we plan to utilize our financial

strong totaling 110 0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as compared to 110 2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 cash flow provided by operating activities increased 9 to 444 1 million in the fiscal year ended october 31 2021 up from 409 1 million in the fiscal year ended october 31 2020 as we look ahead to fiscal 2022 we expect the commercial air travel recovery to continue particularly in certain domestic travel markets while less so in international markets even though the pandemic will likely continue to adversely impact the commercial aerospace industry and heico international markets have not recovered to the extent of domestic markets and while we are confident of their future recovery and the potential sales increase the timing is uncertain we remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide covid 19 vaccine rollouts including boosters will continue to positively influence commercial air travel and benefit the markets we serve as we ve all continued to see and learn it is very difficult to predict the pandemic s path and effect including factors such as new variants and vaccination rates which can impact our key markets therefore we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 2022 net sales and earnings guidance at this time but our ongoing conservative policies strong balance sheet and high degree of liquidity enable us to invest in new research and development execute on our successful acquisition program and position heico for market share gains flight support group eric a mendelson heico s co president and

the flight support group the flight support group s net sales increased 34 to 260 4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 up from 193 6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the net

fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin the improved gross profit margin principally reflects the higher net sales a more favorable product mix across all of our product lines and a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense the flight support group recognized higher inventory obsolescence expense in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2020 following the announced retirement of certain aircraft types and engine platforms by our commercial aerospace customers

the previously mentioned decrease in inventory obsolescence expense and an improved gross profit margin partially offset by higher performance based compensation expense the flight support group s operating margin improved to 16 4 in the fiscal year ended october 31 2021 up from 15 5 in the fiscal year ended october 31 2020 the operating margin increase principally reflects the previously
