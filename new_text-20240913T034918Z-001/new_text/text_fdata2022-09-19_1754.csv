a first of its kind database for tracking the world s fossil fuel production reserves and emissions launches on monday to coincide with climate talks taking place at the united nations general assembly in new york the global registry of fossil fuels includes data from over 50 000 oil gas and coal fields in 89 countries that covers 75 percent of global reserves production and emissions and is available for public use a first for a collection of this size until now there has been private data available for purchase and analysis of the world s fossil fuel usage and reserves the international energy agency also maintains public data on oil gas and coal but it focuses on the demand for those fossil fuels whereas this new database looks at what is yet to be burned the registry was developed by carbon tracker a nonprofit think tank that researches the energy transition s effect on financial markets and the global energy monitor an organization that tracks a variety of energy projects around the globe corporations investors and scientists already have some level of access to private data on fossil fuels mark campanale founder of carbon tracker said he hopes the registry will empower groups to hold governments accountable for example when they issue licenses for fossil fuel extraction civil society groups have got to get more of a focus on what governments are planning to do in terms of license issuance both for coal and oil and gas and actually begin to challenge this permitting process campanale told the associated press the release of the database and an accompanying analysis of the collected data coincide with two critical sets of climate talks at the international level the u n general assembly in new york beginning on september 13 and cop27 in sharm el sheikh egypt in november data like what s being released in the registry could arm environmental and climate groups to pressure national leaders to agree to stronger policies that result in less carbon emissions and we re in dire need of carbon reductions campanale said read more carbon level in atmosphere hits new milestone 50 percent higher than pre industrial levels in their analysis of the data the developers found that the united states and russia have enough fossil fuel still underground untapped to exhaust the world s remaining carbon budget that s the remaining carbon the world can afford to emit before a certain amount of warming occurs in this case 1 5 degrees celsius it also shows these reserves would generate 3 5 trillion tons of greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all of the emissions produced since the industrial revolution we already have enough extractable fossil fuels to cook the planet we can t afford to use them all or almost any of them at this point we ve run out of time to build new things in old ways said rob jackson a stanford university climate scientist who was not involved with the database i like the emphasis on transparency in fossil fuel production and reserves down to specific projects that s a unique aspect to the work jackson compared the global carbon budget to a bathtub you can run water only so long before the tub overflows he said when the tub is close to overflowing he said governments can turn down the faucet mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or open the tub s drain more removing carbon from the atmosphere the database shows that we have much more carbon than we need as a global community campanale said and more than enough to overflow the bathtub and flood the bathroom in jackson s analogy so investors and shareholders should be holding decision makers at the world s largest oil gas and coal companies accountable when they approve new investments in fossil fuel extraction he said campanale said the hope is the investment community who ultimately own these corporations will use the data to begin to challenge the investment plans of companies still planning to expand oil gas and coal projects companies like shell and exxon chevron and their shareholders can use the analysis to to really begin to try and push the companies to move in a completely different direction

which it sees totaling 1 75 percentage points through the end of the year as the central bank looks to bring inflation under control this higher rates path combined with recent tightening in financial

of overtightening cfra s sam stovall said we think a 100 bps hike would unnerve wall street as it would imply that the fomc is overreacting to the data rather than sticking to its game plan and would

aggressive in its fight to curb rising prices oanda s ed moya says pessimism for equities remains elevated as the us economy appears to have a one way ticket towards a recession as the fed is poised

stocks have been pulling back since being overbought in mid august but that shift could be nearing the end of the road increased hawkish rhetoric from the fed a move up in the 10 year yield and last week s cpi print were the triggers for the underperformance we ve seen in growth recently but the stretched positioning made this segment of the market vulnerable to these negative catalysts while it s too early to say that nasdaq positioning has bottomed it s still a bit above historical lows it s important to note that the unwind does appear to be later innings based on what we are seeing in this data calvasina wrote and at oppenheimer john stoltzfus said in a note that market valuations show it might be time for the selling to pause we should note that the market appears to be oversold

coming to a close morgan stanley says a tougher policy stance from the federal reserve is putting a damper on a 12 year long wall street mantra according to morgan stanley over the last 12 years it was common to hear some variation of tina there is no alternative the idea that one needed to be long stocks and bonds because cash offered so little wrote morgan stanley s andrew sheets in a note to clients low yields were not the primary reason why stocks rallied over that time global equities and global equity earnings simply rose by the same amount 100 now that narrative is shifting as the central bank tightens monetary policy and investors have a slew of higher yielding and lower volatility offerings they can buy including cash and short term fixed income securities sheets believes investors are adapting to a new normal with a less friendly federal reserve that looks far from a pivot and is unlikely to take an easy policy stance during difficult times ahead the market is still

gdp outlook forecasts higher chance for recession ahead goldman sachs sees higher interest rates lower growth and elevated risks of a recession ahead the wall street firm over the weekend cut its gdp forecast for 2023 and now sees growth of just 1 1 for the year down from the previous expectation of 1 5 that dovetails with an increase in its expectations for federal reserve interest rate hikes which it sees totaling 1 75 percentage points through the end of the year as the central bank looks to bring inflation under control this higher rates path combined with recent tightening in financial conditions implies a somewhat worse outlook for growth and employment next year economist joseph briggs wrote in a client note dated friday evening goldman also now expects the unemployment rate to rise to 4 1 by the end of 2023 from its current level of 3 7 and to 4 2 by the end of 2024 taken together the firm sees the tighter financial conditions boosting the probability of recession over the next 12 months to 35 jeff cox a 100 basis point hike would unnerve wall street says cfra s stovall hiking rates more than the anticipated 75 basis points could distress wall street and up the chances of overtightening cfra s sam stovall said we think a 100 bps hike would unnerve wall street as it would imply that the fomc is overreacting to the data rather than sticking to its game plan and would increase the likelihood that the fomc will eventually overtighten and lessen the possibility of achieving a soft landing he wrote in a note to clients monday of the 56 rate hikes that have occurred

expects fed funds rate at 4 to 4 25 this year strategists say the most important information investors are looking for from the federal reserve will be what s on the dot plot the fed s so called interest rate forecast after the cpi release last week the futures market for fed funds priced a big jump higher in the terminal rate or end point where the fed stops hiking it had been pricing in a 4 terminal rate by april we expect the median dot to show the funds rate at 4 4 25 at end 2022 an additional hike to a peak of 4 25 4 5 in 2023 one cut in 2024 and two more in 2025 and an unchanged longer run rate of 2 5 goldman sachs david mericle said in a note late sunday how high will the funds rate ultimately need to go our answer is high enough to generate a tightening in financial

tightening proves necessary to keep growth on a below potential path tanaya macheel patti domm stocks could fall below 3 700 before the next rally says fundstrat s newton mark newton head of technical

u s economic data remains strong but a range of financial indicators point to a sharp slowdown over the next year that would dampen oil consumption and lead to lower prices the apparent contradiction between the real economy and financial markets has puzzled some commentators but is normal around a peak in the business cycle economic data reflect current conditions while financial prices reflect how traders expect the economy to evolve in future by definition every downturn starts from a peak in the business cycle when activity is strong the rapid shift from strong and rising economic activity into a contraction is what makes turning points hard to predict in recent decades the largest forecasting errors have occurred around turning points especially peaks business cycles theory history indicators and forecasting zarnowitz 1992 but financial markets currently assign a high probability to a significant slowdown in the cycle in the next 6 months possibly qualifying as a recession notwithstanding the high level of economic activity and jobs peaking activity global trade volumes and industrial output remained at or very close to record levels in june according to the netherlands bureau for economic policy analysis world trade monitor cpb aug 25 u s freight volumes were at record levels in june and manufacturing output was close to its highest levels since before the financial crisis based on data from the u s bureau of transportation statistics and the federal reserve manufacturing activity continued to increase through august albeit more slowly than before according to surveys conducted by the institute for supply management the ism composite purchasing managers index remained at 52 8 in july and august slightly above the 50 point threshold that divides expanding activity from a contraction and in the 50th percentile for all months since 1980 but a broad range of financial indicators from fixed income equity and commodity markets as well as individual share prices for bellwether companies all point to a significant slowdown in the cycle in the next six months expected slowdown futures prices imply the u s central bank is expected to raise interest rates over the next six months to 4 25 4 50 before april 2023 from 2 25 2 50 at present shocking borrowers and the economy the u s treasury yield curve between securities maturing in two and ten years time is more inverted than at any time since august 2000 when the dotcom bubble was starting to burst financial conditions are tightening at some of the fastest rates for more than a decade based on the chicago fed s financial conditions index which is based on measures of risk credit and leverage u s equity indices have already slumped as investors anticipate a downturn hitting demand and discount future earnings more heavily after adjusting for inflation the broad u s s p 500 equity index is down by around 13 14 compared with the same period last year individual equities closely linked with the cycle including caterpillar the heavy equipment maker and 3m corporation the diversified manufacturer have fallen sharply consistent with a significant economic slowdown south korea s kospi 100 index which tracks the global trade cycle because of its heavy exposure to export manufacturing firms is also down by more than 23 compared with the same point last year diesel markets the expected business cycle slowdown is evident in fuel markets where spread between european gas oil and brent crude futures for deliveries in april 2023 has softened to 30 per barrel from more than 40 in late august gas oil s calendar spread between december 2022 and december 2023 has fallen to a backwardation of 12 per barrel from 26 in late august and 33 in june implying that inventories are expected to be higher than before gas oil and other middle distillates are the workhorse of manufacturing and freight transportation and the most sensitive to changes in the business cycle softer spreads are consistent with a regional and global slowdown that would allow distillate inventories to be rebuilt from their current very depleted level parsing expectations prices for bonds equities and commodities reflect what is expected to happen not what will and those expectations could change or be proved wrong but financial markets assign an unusually high probability to an imminent recession at the moment so the expectations cannot be dismissed lightly in the event that a significant cyclical slowdown occurs it is likely to be more severe in europe and china than in the united states europe is more directly exposed to the fallout from energy prices high inflation and the possible disruption of gas supplies stemming from russia s invasion of ukraine china is struggling with a persistent cycle of city level lockdowns imposed to stop the spread of coronavirus as part of its epidemic control strategy but spillovers from europe and china as well as a massive tightening of financial conditions at home are expected to induce a significant slowdown in the united states itself slower growth in the big three economies will also spill over into the larger emerging economies including india brazil saudi arabia indonesia turkey mexico and thailand if the expected slowdown materialises energy consumption will grow much more slowly in 2023 taking some of the heat out of prices for coal gas diesel and crude source reuters editing by elaine hardcastle

summer was going so well for the president the white house threw a party last week with a concert by james taylor mr biden s streak began in june when he signed a bipartisan gun safety law then in august over republican objections he signed the largest investment ever on climate change a minimum tax on corporations a law to lower prescription drug prices and student loan forgiveness but tuesday as james taylor sang fire and rain it seemed like both descended on the president s party the dow plummeted nearly 1 300 points after a dismal inflation report at the white house on thursday we spoke to president biden about the economy ukraine those top secret documents in donald trump s home and whether mr biden will run again the president made news and will ignite a few controversies scott pelley mr president as you know last tuesday the annual inflation rate came in at 8 3 the stock market nosedived people are shocked by their grocery bills what can you do better and faster president joe biden well first of all let s put this in perspective inflation rate month to month was just just an inch hardly at all scott pelley you re not arguing that 8 3 is good news president joe biden no i m not saying it is good news but it was 8 2 or 8 2 before i mean it s not you re ac we act make it sound like all of a sudden my god it went to 8 2 it s been scott pelley it s the highest inflation rate mr president in 40 years president joe biden i got that but guess what we are we re in a position where for the last several months it hasn t spiked it has just barely it s been basically even and in the meantime we created all these jobs and and prices have have gone up but they ve come down for energy the fact is that we ve created 10 million new jobs we re in since we came to office we re in a situation where the the unemployment rate is about 3 7 one of the lowest in history we re in a situation where manufacturing is coming back to the united states in a big way and look down the road we have mas massive investments being made in computer chips and and employment so i look this is a process this is a process scott pelley is the economy going to get worse before it gets better president joe biden no i don t think so we hope we can have what they say a soft landing a transition to a place where we don t lose the gains that i ran to make in the first place for middle class folks being able to generate good paying jobs and expansion and at the same time make sure that we we are are able to continue to grow scott pelley and you would tell the american people that inflation is going to continue to decline president joe biden no i m telling the american people that we re gonna get control of inflation and their prescription drug prices are gonna be a hell of a lotta lower their health care costs are gonna be a lot lower their basic costs for everybody their energy prices are gonna be lower they re gonna be in a situation where they begin to gain control again i m more optimistic than i ve been in a long time scott pelley sir with the federal reserve rapidly raising interest rates what can you do to prevent a recession president joe biden continue to grow the economy and we re growing the economy it s growing in in a way that it hasn t in years and years scott pelley how so president joe biden we re growing entire new industries six hundred and ninety five i think it is or eighty five thousand new manufacturing jobs just since i ve become president in united states continue to grow the economy and continue to give hard working people a break in terms of we pay the highest drug prices in the world of any industrialized nation making sure that medicare can negotiate down those prices by the way we ve also reduced the debt and reduced the deficit by 350 billion my first year this year it s gonna be over 1 5 trillion reduced the debt so to continue to put people in a position to be able to make a decent living and grow and grow and increase their capacity to grow president joe biden and 60 minutes correspondent scott pelley tour the detroit auto show to see what he means we went with mr biden to the detroit auto show last wednesday he celebrated his new funding of a network of charging stations for electric vehicles but the newly crowded convention center brought a different question to mind scott pelley mr president first detroit auto show in three years is the pandemic over president joe biden the pandemic is over we still have a problem with covid we re still doing a lotta work on it it s but the pandemic is over if you notice no one s wearing masks everybody seems to be in pretty good shape and so i think it s changing and i think this is a perfect example of it the car show was a reminder that gasoline prices hit a historic high last june in part because russia cut fuel supplies in its war on ukraine scott pelley mr president the price of gasoline is down about 26 from the 5 high what can you do to keep that price down while vladimir putin is throttling energy supplies president joe biden well there s there s a couple things we ve done for example remember i got some criticism for releasing a million barrels of oil a day from the strategic petroleum reserve and then along came the industry saying they d produce another million barrels a day by the spring so i think we re in relatively good shape scott pelley vladimir putin is going to try to break your will on ukraine and use energy prices to do it president joe biden sure he is but you know we the united states are in much better shape than than anyone else is and relative to russia particularly but he s been trying that for a while he s not gonna succeed but at this very moment that mr biden steered for the future a 19th century form of transport threatened to wreck the economy a deadline for a national rail strike was two days away the white house brokered a deal thursday after a 20 hour marathon of negotiations president joe biden one of the things that happens in negotiations particularly if they ve been elongated like these have is people say and do things where they the pride gets engaged as well and it s awful hard to back off of some of these things they both sat down in my view and they were in the office today saying well we finally figured it out this is fair on both sides and it took that time to focus and and the alternative was just not thinkable scott pelley what do you mean president joe biden if in fact they d gone on a strike the supply chains in this country would ve come to a screeching halt we would ve seen a real economic crisis 60 minutes correspondent scott pelley speaks with president joe biden in the oval office the other crisis on the president s desk ukraine was also improving last week as ukrainian forces recaptured about 3 000 square miles from the russian invasion scott pelley is ukraine winning the war president joe biden ukraine through their the significant help we and our allies are giving them and the incredible bravery and the incredible determination of the ukrainian people are not losing a war and they re making gains in certain areas winning the war in ukraine is to get russia out of ukraine completely and recognizing the sovereignty they re defeating russia russia s turning out not to be as competent and capable as many people thought they were gonna be but winning the war the damage it s doing and the and the citizens and the innocent people are being killed it s awful hard to count that as winning after the horrors of seven months of war president biden has called russian president vladimir putin a war criminal president joe biden it has been barbaric what he s done his attacks on civilian everything from civilian hospitals to to you know people old age homes to neighborhoods where just ordinary people live scott pelley schools president joe biden to schools it s it s just outrageous and so the the price ukrainian people are paying for this war is extremely high but we re gonna stay with em as long as they need our help scott pelley you re already north of 15 billion in terms of those commitments how far do you go president joe biden as long as it takes scott pelley ironclad commitment president joe biden yes scott pelley as ukraine succeeds on the battlefield vladimir putin is becoming embarrassed and pushed into a corner and i wonder mr president what you would say to him if he is considering using chemical or tactical nuclear weapons president joe biden don t don t don t you will change the face of war unlike anything since world war ii scott pelley and the consequences of that would be what president joe biden i am not going to speculate scott pelley what would the u s response be president joe biden you think i would tell you if i knew exactly what it would be of course i m not gonna tell you it ll be consequential they ll become more of a pariah in the world than they ever have been and depending on the extent of what they do will determine what response would occur on the same day we spoke to the president putin met with china s leader xi jinping there s concern that russia s attempt to force reunification with ukraine could inspire china to attack the island of taiwan u s policy since 1979 has been to recognize taiwan as part of china but remain silent on whether the u s military would defend the democratic government there this is among the places where our interview runs into controversy scott pelley what should chinese president xi know about your commitment to taiwan president joe biden we agree with what we signed onto a long time ago and that there s one china policy and taiwan makes their own judgments about their independence we are not moving we re not encouraging their being independent we re not that that s their decision scott pelley but would u s forces defend the island president joe biden yes if in fact there was an unprecedented attack after our interview a white house official told us u s policy has not changed officially the u s will not say whether american forces would defend taiwan but the commander in chief had a view of his own scott pelley so unlike ukraine to be clear sir u s forces u s men and women would defend taiwan in the event of a chinese invasion president joe biden yes for the first time mr biden spoke about the classified documents that the fbi found in former president trump s home the justice department has opened a criminal investigation scott pelley have you been briefed sir on the top secret documents that were found at mar a lago president joe biden no scott pelley no one has come to you to warn you that important national security secrets were revealed by the storage of those documents at the former president s home president joe biden i have not personally spoken to anyone on that in that regard i m sure my administration is aware of all of that and so is the national security council but i have not scott pelley were you notified of the fbi s execution of a search warrant at mar a lago president joe biden no not ahead of time the fbi spread the documents out on a floor to make a record of what was found scott pelley when you saw the photograph of the top secret documents laid out on the floor at mar a lago what did you think to yourself looking at that image president joe biden how that could possibly happen how one anyone could be that irresponsible and i thought what data was in there that may compromise sources and methods by that i mean names of people who helped or th et cetera and it just totally irresponsible scott pelley and you don t know what was in those documents president joe biden i have not asked for the specifics of those documents because i don t want to get myself in the middle of whether or not the justice department should move or not move on certain actions they could take i i agreed i would not tell them what to do and not in fact engage in telling them how to prosecute or not at the white house last thursday president biden told us he hopes to retain control of the house and the senate in the midterm election in november but given the president s job approval rating of around 40 that remains to be seen for his part mr biden has said he plans to run again in 2024 but here is another place where our interview may cause controversy scott pelley sir are you committed to running again or are there certain conditions that have to be right president joe biden look if i were to say to you i m running again all of a sudden a whole range of things come into play that i have requirements i have to change and move and do scott pelley in terms of election laws president joe biden in terms of election laws and it s much too early to make that kind of decision i m a great respecter of fate and so what i m doing is i m doing my job i m gonna do that job and within the timeframe that makes sense after this next election cycle here going into next year make a judgment on what to do scott pelley you say that it s much too early to make that decision i take it the decision has not been made in your own head president joe biden look my intention as i said to begin with is that i would run again but it s just an intention but is it a firm decision that i run again that remains to be seen scott pelley mr president you are the oldest president ever president joe biden pretty good shape huh scott pelley which leads to my next question you are more aware of this than anyone some people ask whether you are fit for the job and when you hear that i wonder what you think president joe biden watch me and ma honest to god that s all i think watch me if you think i don t have the energy level or the mental acuity then then you know that s one thing it s another thing you just watch and and you know keep my schedule do what i m doing i i think that you know i don t when i sit down with our nato allies and keep em together i don t have em saying wait a minute w how how old are you what are you what say you know i mean it s a matter of you know that old expression the proof of the pudding s in the eating i mean i i i respect the fact that people would say you know you re old and but i think it relates to h how much energy you have and whether or not the job you re doing is one consistent with what any person of any age would be able to do scott pelley how would you say your mental focus is president joe biden oh it s focused i d say it s i think it s i i haven t look i have trouble even mentioning even saying to myself my own head the number of years i no more think of myself as being as old as i am than fly i mean it s just not i haven t observed anything in terms of there s not things i don t do now that i did before whether it s physical or mental or anything else scott pelley you have had a string of legislative successes recently president joe biden how d an old guy do that scott pelley but your approval rating in the country is well below 50 and i wonder why you think that is president joe biden this is a really difficult time we re at an inflection point in the history of this country we re gonna make decisions and we re making decisions now that are gonna determine what we re gonna look like the next ten years from now i think you d agree that the impact on the psyche of the american people as a consequence of the pandemic is profound think of how that has changed everything you know people s attitudes about themselves their families about the state of the nation about the state of their communities and so there s a lot of uncertainty out there a great deal of uncertainty and we lost a million people a million people to covid when i got in office when i i got elected only 2 million people had been vaccinated i got 220 million m my point is it takes time we were left in a very difficult situation it s been a very difficult time very difficult and a difficult life for the president in 1972 he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident he lost his son beau to cancer in 2015 at the age of 46 and his son hunter has been a lightning rod for suspicion hunter biden s former addiction to crack cocaine led to a life he describes as non stop depravity he has also acknowledged a federal investigation into his taxes congress investigated hunter biden s job with a ukrainian company at the time that his father ran ukrainian policy in the obama administration a republican investigation however uncovered no wrongdoing by then vice president biden scott pelley mr president if you run again republicans are most likely to go after your son hunter once again and i wonder what you would like to say about your son and whether any of his troubles have caused conflicts for you or for the united states president joe biden i love my son number one he fought an addiction problem he overcame it he wrote about it and no there s not a single thing that i ve observed at all from th that would affect me or the united states relative to my son hunter republican investigations are likely to resume if mr biden loses either the house or the senate and history shows that presidents usually lose seats in congress in a midterm election if so the president s remaining ambitions may be beyond his reach president joe biden for example we passed the most extensive gun legislation in 30 years although i m not gonna rest till we get assault weapons banned which i did once before when i was a senator scott pelley assault weapons banned president joe biden assault assault weapons banned there s no rationale deer aren t running through the woods wearing kevlar vests scott pelley somebody came in and told you about uvalde when it happened and i wonder what you thought president joe biden again i ve gone to every one of those places and in uvalde i spent time with every sing four hours four hours in the pain pain and it s just so so unnecessary so wrong who the hell m sigh don t get me going but i met with every one of those families and i and and the extended families for four hours look our kids should be learning how to read and write not duck and cover think about that think of the mental impact on these kids going back to school we saw it it s wrong it s wrong it s not who we are and we ve gotta stop it we ve got to stop it and the nra continuing to push the sale of assault and semiautomatic weapons is bizarre the much more modest bi partisan gun law that passed this summer may be the best example of the president s legislative breakthroughs that no one thought possible how d an old guy do that he asked us earlier we have a theory joe biden is among the longest serving politicians in washington if there is less bounce in the step than there once was if the words don t flow like they used to maybe there s something to be said for knowhow five decades on the hill and in the oval scott pelley concerning politics mr president you were elected to the senate in 1972 you were 29 years old and in those days it seemed that the parties worked together to move the country forward and i think many americans feel that that no longer happens and in fact may be impossible now president joe biden well i don t think it s impossible but it it it s changed what we do today think about it it s all personal attacks it s about motive it s not about i disagree with you on the on the subject matter and secondly i think that it s i think it s fair to say that we ve not had a president like the last president who has made all of it so personal i ve had six republican senators i promised i d never say their names and i won t come up to me in the last two years and say joe i agree with you but if i if i vote this way it s gonna they re gonna primary me i m gonna lose an election it didn t used to be that way but it s coming back a little bit it s coming back scott pelley do you see it it seems to me mr president that when you were first came to the senate the other guy had a bad idea and now the other guy is a bad guy and i don t know how you get back to that president joe biden well i ll tell you what think about this i was able to get we were able to get a bipartisan 1 2 trillion package done for dealing with the whole question of rebuilding the country the roads and the highways the fact of the matter is we ve gotten a lot of things done bipartisanly and everybody said we re not gonna do anything don t let biden have any successes et cetera so it s still a way to go but i think we re making some progress scott pelley you have lived a long life of triumph and tragedy in november you ll be 80 and i wonder what it is that keeps you in the arena president joe biden well look i ve had tragedies i ve lost part of my soul when i lost my son beau i lost my wife and my daughter in an accident i think of all the people who ve gone through what i ve gone through and a lot more without what i had i have had incredibly supportive family there s so many literally heroes getting up every day putting one foot in front of the other with no help i constantly think what would beau want me to do what would and you know this gets me a long way this rosary the hagar cartoon president biden s father had framed catholic and devout he keeps a rosary in his pocket and he showed us his other inspiration in a cartoon that his father had framed in it the viking hagar confronts god after a lighting strike a blow like those endured by the president president joe biden and he s looking up and what s he say he says why me god and the next scene a voice from heaven why not that s my dad why not joey why not you why not what makes you so different just get up my mom s expression was just get up get up get up scott pelley and you feel you have more to give president joe biden a lot more to give a lot more to give produced by maria gavrilovic associate producer alex ortiz broadcast

new york the buck isn t stopping the value of the u s dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the british pound across the atlantic to the south korean won across the pacific after rising again friday the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against six major currencies including the euro and japanese yen many professional investors don t expect it to ease off anytime soon the dollar s rise affects nearly everyone even those who will never leave the u s borders here s a look at what s driving the u s dollar higher and what it can mean for investors and households what does it mean to say the dollar is stronger essentially one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before advertisement consider the japanese yen a year ago 1 could get a little less than 110 yen now it can buy 143 that s about 30 percent more and one of the biggest moves the u s dollar has made against another currency foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world the u s dollar index which measures the dollar against the euro yen and other major currencies has climbed more than 14 percent this year the gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments most of which have had a dismal year u s stocks are down more than 19 percent bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7 percent why is the dollar strengthening because the u s economy is doing better than others even though inflation is high the u s job market has remained remarkably solid and other areas of the economy such as the services sector have been resilient advertisement that s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low that in turn has traders expecting the federal reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply and to hold them there a while in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years such expectations have helped the yield of a 10 year treasury more than double to 3 44 percent from roughly 1 33 percent a year ago who cares about bond yields investors who want to make more income off their money and those juicier u s yields are drawing investors from all over the world other central banks have been less aggressive than the fed because their economies seem to be more fragile the european central bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever three quarters of a percentage point but the fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year with a third expected this upcoming week some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible following a hotter than expected report on u s inflation tuesday partly because of that less aggressive bent 10 year bonds across europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than u s treasurys such as germany s 1 75 percent and japan s 0 25 percent when investors from asia and europe buy treasurys they have to trade their own currencies for u s dollars that pushes up the dollar s value advertisement a strong dollar helps u s tourists right yes u s travelers in tokyo spending 10 000 yen on dinner will be using 23 percent fewer dollars than a year ago for the same priced meal with the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the argentine peso to the egyptian pound to the south korean won the dollar is going further in many countries than before does it help only people who can afford to travel abroad no a stronger dollar also helps u s shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation when the dollar is rising against the euro for example european companies make more euros on each 1 of sales with that cushion they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros they could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros or they could find some balance of the two advertisement prices for imports fell 1 percent in august from a month earlier following july s 1 5 percent drop offering some relief amid the nation s high inflation prices for imported fruits nuts and some peels dropped 8 7 percent for example they re down 3 percent from a year earlier a stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally that s because oil gold and others are bought and sold in u s dollars around the world when the dollar rises against the yen a japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before that can mean less upward pressure on oil prices so there are only winners from a strong dollar no u s companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed at mcdonald s revenue fell 3 percent during the summer from a year earlier but if the dollar s value had simply stayed put against other currencies the company s revenue would have been 3 percent higher microsoft meanwhile said changes in foreign currency values sliced 595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter a string of other companies have given similar warnings recently and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits companies in the s p 500 index get roughly 40 percent of their revenue from outside the united states according to factset advertisement any other collateral damage a strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in u s dollar terms instead of in their own currencies when they must repay their debts in u s dollars while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day it can create lots of stress where s the dollar heading from here the dollar s biggest moves may be behind it but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while tuesday s report on u s inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected that has traders upping bets for fed rate hikes going into next year fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high until the job is done in breaking the nation s high inflation even if it damages economic growth that bias toward still higher rates by the fed should continue to offer support for the value of the u s dollar for the dollar to weaken meaningfully strategists wrote in a bofa global research report the fed has to get more concerned about growth than inflation

question if the federal reserve stays aggressive in its fight to curb rising prices oanda s ed moya says pessimism for equities remains elevated as the us economy appears to have a one way ticket towards a recession as the fed is poised to remain aggressive moya wrote in a note monday the risks for a retest of the summer lows could easily happen if the fed remains fully committed with their inflation fight he added that the difficult backdrop coupled with fears of slowing global growth and further cuts to guidance creates a tough environment for purchasing stocks samantha subin stocks waver in volatile trading session ahead of fed meeting stocks seesawed on monday in a volatile trading session ahead of another key fed decision later this week many investors are betting on a 75 basis point hike at the conclusion of the central bank s policy meeting on wednesday although a 100 basis point increase is not off the table according to some analysts the fear is fueling concerns that the fed won t be able to tame rising prices without steering the economy into a recession amid this backdrop the s p 500 s financials sector gained 1 as investors bet on higher rates boosting

samantha subin stock market may be oversold strategists say the late morning recovery for stocks on monday could be a sign that the market is oversold after last week s steep declines rbc s lori calvasina said in a note to clients on sunday that growth stocks have been pulling back since being overbought in mid august but that shift could be nearing the end of the road increased hawkish rhetoric from the fed a move up in the 10 year yield and last week s cpi print were the triggers for the underperformance we ve seen in growth recently but the stretched positioning made this segment of the market vulnerable to these negative catalysts while it s too early to say that nasdaq positioning has bottomed it s still a bit above historical lows it s important to note that the unwind does appear to be later innings based on what we are seeing in this data calvasina wrote and at oppenheimer john stoltzfus said in a note that market valuations show it might be time for the selling to pause we should note that the market appears to be oversold as the forward multiple of the s p 500 is now back near to where it was before the market hit its low on june 16 prior to its summer rally stoltzfus wrote jesse pound michael bloom u s homebuilder sentiment falls the national association of home builders wells fargo housing market index fell three points in september to 46 marking the

according to morgan stanley over the last 12 years it was common to hear some variation of tina there is no alternative the idea that one needed to be long stocks and bonds because cash offered so little wrote morgan stanley s andrew sheets in a note to clients low yields were not the primary reason why stocks rallied over that time global equities and global equity earnings simply rose by the same amount 100 now that narrative is shifting as the central bank tightens monetary policy and investors have a slew of higher yielding and lower volatility offerings they can buy including cash and short term fixed income securities sheets believes investors are adapting to a new normal with a less friendly federal reserve that looks far from a pivot and is unlikely to take an easy policy stance during difficult times ahead the market is still facing late cycle conditions inflation that is too high policy that is tightening a yield curve that s inverted and a slowdown in growth that is ahead not behind he wrote samantha subin goldman cuts gdp outlook forecasts higher chance for recession ahead goldman sachs sees higher interest rates lower growth and elevated risks of a recession ahead the wall street firm over the weekend cut its gdp forecast for 2023 and now sees growth of just 1 1 for the year down from the previous expectation of 1 5 that dovetails with an increase in its expectations for federal reserve interest rate hikes which it sees totaling 1 75 percentage points through the end of the year as the central bank looks to bring inflation under control this higher rates path combined with recent tightening in financial conditions implies a somewhat worse outlook for growth and employment next year economist joseph briggs wrote in a client note dated friday evening goldman also now expects the unemployment rate to rise to 4 1 by the end of 2023 from its current level of 3 7 and to 4 2 by the end of 2024 taken together the firm sees the tighter financial conditions boosting the probability of recession over the next 12 months to 35 jeff cox a 100 basis point hike would unnerve wall street says cfra s stovall hiking rates more than the anticipated 75 basis points could distress wall street and up the chances of overtightening cfra s sam stovall said we think a 100 bps hike would unnerve wall street as it would imply that the fomc is overreacting to the data rather than sticking to its game plan and would increase the likelihood that the fomc will eventually overtighten and lessen the possibility of achieving a soft landing he wrote in a note to clients monday of the 56 rate hikes that have occurred since world war ii the central bank has upped interest rates by 100 basis points only seven times following those hikes the s p 500 recorded

federal reserve will be what s on the dot plot the fed s so called interest rate forecast after the cpi release last week the futures market for fed funds priced a big jump higher in the terminal rate or end point where the fed stops hiking it had been pricing in a 4 terminal rate by april we expect the median dot to show the funds rate at 4 4 25 at end 2022 an additional hike to a peak of 4 25 4 5 in 2023 one cut in 2024 and two more in 2025 and an unchanged longer run rate of 2 5 goldman sachs david mericle said in a note late sunday how high will the funds rate ultimately need to go our answer is high enough to generate a tightening in financial conditions that imposes a drag on activity sufficient to maintain a solidly below potential growth trajectory he added we could imagine the hiking cycle extending beyond this year if additional tightening proves necessary to keep growth on a below potential path tanaya macheel patti domm stocks could fall below 3 700 before the next rally

before a more meaningful rally kicks in september s triple witching friday close at multi week lows is particularly negative for the prospects of a rally and further selling still looks likely over

article the buck isn t stopping the value of the u s dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the british pound across the atlantic to the south korean won across the pacific after rising again friday the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against a key index measuring six major currencies including the euro and japanese yen many professional investors don t expect it to ease off anytime soon the dollar s rise affects nearly everyone even those who will never leave the u s borders here s a look at what s driving the u s dollar higher and what it can mean for investors and households what does it mean to say the dollar is stronger essentially that one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before consider the japanese yen a year ago 1 could get a little less than 110 yen now it can buy 143 that s about 30 more and one of the biggest moves the u s dollar has made against another currency foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world the u s dollar index which measures the dollar against the euro yen and other major currencies has climbed more than 14 this year the gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments most of which have had a dismal year u s stocks are down more than 19 bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7 why is the dollar strengthening because the u s economy is doing better than others even though inflation is high the u s job market has remained remarkably solid and other areas of the economy such as the services sector have been resilient that s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low that in turn has traders expecting the federal reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply and to hold them there a while in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years such expectations have helped the yield of a 10 year treasury more than double to 3 44 from roughly 1 33 a year ago who cares about bond yields investors who want to make more income off their money and those juicier u s yields are drawing investors from all over the world other central banks have been less aggressive than the fed because their economies seem to be more fragile the european central bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever three quarters of a percentage point but the fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year with a third expected this upcoming week some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible following a hotter than expected report on u s inflation tuesday partly because of that less aggressive bent 10 year bonds across europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than u s treasurys such as germany s 1 75 and japan s 0 25 when investors from asia and europe buy treasurys they have to trade their own currencies for u s dollars that pushes up the dollar s value a strong dollar helps u s tourists right yes u s travelers in tokyo spending 10 000 yen on dinner will be using 23 fewer dollars than a year ago for the same priced meal with the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the argentine peso to the egyptian pound to the south korean won the dollar is going further in many countries than before does it help only rich people who can afford to travel abroad no a stronger dollar also helps u s shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation when the dollar is rising against the euro for example european companies make more euros on each 1 of sales with that cushion they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros they could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros or they could find some balance of the two prices for imports fell 1 in august from a month earlier following july s 1 5 drop offering some relief amid the nation s high inflation prices for imported fruits nuts and some peels dropped 8 7 for example they re down 3 from a year earlier a stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally that s because oil gold and others are bought and sold in u s dollars around the world when the dollar rises against the yen a japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before that can mean less upward pressure on oil prices so there are only winners from a strong dollar no u s companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed at mcdonald s revenue fell 3 during the summer from a year earlier but if the dollar s value had simply stayed put against other currencies the company s revenue would have been 3 higher microsoft meanwhile said changes in foreign currency values sliced 595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter a string of other companies have given similar warnings recently and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits companies in the s p 500 index get roughly 40 of their revenue from outside the united states according to factset any other collateral damage a strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in u s dollar terms instead of in their own currencies when they must repay their debts in u s dollars while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day it can create lots of stress where s the dollar heading from here the dollar s biggest moves may be behind it but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while tuesday s report on u s inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected that has traders upping bets for fed rate hikes going into next year fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high until the job is done in breaking the nation s high inflation even if it damages economic growth that bias toward still higher rates by the fed should continue to offer support for the value of the u s dollar for the dollar to weaken meaningfully strategists wrote in a bofa global research report the fed has to get more concerned about growth than inflation and we are not there yet

a first of its kind database for tracking the world s fossil fuel production reserves and emissions launched on monday to coincide with climate talks taking place at the united nations general assembly in new york the global registry of fossil fuels includes data from over 50 000 oil gas and coal fields in 89 countries covering 75 of global reserves production and emissions the tool is available for public use a first for a collection this size there was already private data available for purchase and analysis of the world s fossil fuel usage and reserves the international energy agency also maintains public data on oil gas and coal but it focuses on the demand for those fossil fuels whereas the new database includes fuels still underground the registry was developed by carbon tracker a nonprofit think tank that researches the energy transition s effect on financial markets and global energy monitor an organization that tracks a variety of energy projects around the globe it allows anyone with a computer and internet access to look at coal oil and gas reserves with a resolution that hasn t been possible before users can see the carbon dioxide emissions they would generate if burned at a global country or field level they can get a sense of the role fossil fuel production has played in different economies they can simulate transitioning away from fossil fuels under four scenarios continuing current trends governments keeping pledges they ve made governments following sustainable development goals set by the united nations and the world achieving net zero by 2050 it is a first ever full transparency open source available to all kind of tool said inger andersen executive director of the united nations environment program in a press briefing about the registry on monday and as you build it out we from unep will be mining it for every bit we can find so that we too can use it mark campanale founder of carbon tracker said he hopes the registry will empower groups to hold governments accountable for example when they issue licenses for fossil fuel extraction civil society groups have got to get more of a focus on what governments are planning to do in terms of license issuance both for coal and oil and gas and actually begin to challenge this permitting process campanale told the associated press the release of the database and an accompanying analysis of the collected data coincide with two sets of climate talks at the international level the u n general assembly in new york that opened monday and cop27 in sharm el sheikh egypt in november the data like what s being released in the registry could arm environmental and climate groups to pressure national leaders to agree to stronger policies that result in less carbon emissions and we re in dire need of carbon reductions campanale said in their analysis the developers found that the united states and russia have enough fossil fuel underground to exhaust the world s remaining carbon budget that s the carbon the world can afford to emit before a certain amount of warming occurs in this case 1 5 degrees celsius it also shows these reserves would generate 3 5 trillion tons of greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all of the emissions produced since the industrial revolution we already have enough extractable fossil fuels to cook the planet we can t afford to use them all or almost any of them at this point said rob jackson a stanford university climate scientist who was not involved with the database i like the emphasis on transparency in fossil fuel production and reserves down to specific projects that s a unique aspect to the work jackson compared the global carbon budget to a bathtub you can run water only so long before the tub overflows he said when the tub is close to overflowing he said governments can turn down the faucet mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or open the tub s drain more removing carbon from the atmosphere campanale said the hope is the investment community who ultimately own these corporations will use the data to begin to challenge the investment plans of companies still planning to expand oil gas and coal projects companies like shell and exxon chevron and their shareholders can use the analysis to to really begin to try and push the companies to move in a completely different direction ___ follow drew costley on twitter drewcostley ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institute s department of science education the ap is solely responsible for all content copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

for atlas arteria alx after the toll road operator raised capital at a 19 discount to fund a stake in a chicago asset these moves were largely exogenous to wider weakness on the day which was as much to do with domestic monetary and fiscal policy as global macro influences rba governor philip lowe told a parliamentary committee rates would have to continue to be increased while this is not a surprise it is disappointing for those believing the board would soon have to pause to allow the lagged impact of higher rates to catch up lowe also said the government needs to do its part and revenues should be increased by raising taxes like that s all we need right now it is interesting that to date the government is sticking with the legacy pre covid coalition policy of planned tax cuts for higher income earners given it supported the policy at the time perhaps lowe was making a point and while it might be a policy backflip to abandon the cuts the goal posts have since moved and it would not be at all unpopular with the wider electorate but it would not be popular in the stock market as evidenced by an ultimate 1 5 fall it was enough for the market to ignore what was actually

according to morgan stanley over the last 12 years it was common to hear some variation of tina there is no alternative the idea that one needed to be long stocks and bonds because cash offered so little wrote morgan stanley s andrew sheets in a note to clients low yields were not the primary reason why stocks rallied over that time global equities and global equity earnings simply rose by the same amount 100 now that narrative is shifting as the central bank tightens monetary policy and investors have a slew of higher yielding and lower volatility offerings they can buy including cash and short term fixed income securities sheets believes investors are adapting to a new normal with a less friendly federal reserve that looks far from a pivot and is unlikely to take an easy policy stance

the wall street firm over the weekend cut its gdp forecast for 2023 and now sees growth of just 1 1 for the year down from the previous expectation of 1 5 that dovetails with an increase in its expectations for federal reserve interest rate hikes which it sees totaling 1 75 percentage points through the end of the year as the central bank looks to bring inflation under control this higher rates path combined with recent tightening in financial conditions implies a somewhat worse outlook for growth and employment next year economist joseph briggs wrote in a client note dated friday evening goldman also now expects the unemployment rate to rise to 4 1 by the end of 2023 from its current level of 3 7 and to 4 2 by the end of 2024 taken together the firm sees the tighter financial conditions boosting the probability of recession over the next 12 months to 35 jeff cox a 100 basis point hike would unnerve wall street says cfra s stovall hiking rates more than the anticipated 75 basis points could distress wall street and up the chances of overtightening cfra s sam stovall said we think a 100 bps hike would unnerve wall street as it would imply that the fomc is overreacting to the data rather than sticking to its game plan and would increase the likelihood that the fomc will eventually overtighten and lessen the possibility of achieving a soft landing he wrote in a note

poultry meat quality research increasingly important to industry prepares students for careers meat quality defects affect consumer satisfaction 19 september 2022 19 september 2022 7 minute read 7 minute read by by university of arkansas north america for 21 years the main thrust of casey owens research has been improving meat quality for the poultry industry which is good because during that time the poultry industry has risen to the challenges of increasing consumer preferences for more and bigger chicken meat and growing export demands to feed a hungry world but that growth has come at a cost processors are seeing increases in meat defects that cost the industry millions broilers are arkansas leading agricultural product bringing in more than 4 billion in cash farm receipts in 2018 according to the 2020 arkansas agricultural profile a publication of the university of arkansas system division of agriculture owens is the novus international professor of poultry science at the arkansas agricultural experiment station the division of agriculture research arm and the university of arkansas dale bumpers college of agricultural food and life sciences she investigates meat quality defects in broiler meat with such descriptive names as woody breast white striping and spaghetti meat industry impact people in the u s and other countries have more disposable income which allows them to have more choices owens said if they have a bad experience with a company s products they can afford to seek a different product the meat quality issues that dr owens studies cost the industry millions of dollars in lost yield and condemned or downgraded product said mark cooper managing director of global genetics for cobb vantress the company offers development production sale and service of broiler breeding stock negative consumer experience with poor meat quality can impact where or what type of products of poultry they purchase if the product quality gets bad enough cooper said dr owens work helps us understand the management genetic and processing factors that can affect these conditions so that we in turn can find solutions to the problem cobb vantress supported the upgrade of the experiment station s poultry processing pilot plant with new equipment the advances give owens essential tools for investigating the impacts of meat defects on food production and processing practices that may either mediate or compound product quality problems we have a longstanding partnership with dr owens and through our collaboration she is helping us find solutions to reduce these meat quality issues as they relate to our breeding programs cooper said our future plans consist of possible additional investments in the pilot plant to further support the research that goes on in that facility he said research owens said she takes a multi pronged approach to her research studying causes and potential solutions during breeding production and processing she collaborates with research colleagues in the division of agriculture s center of excellence for poultry science to investigate the biological and genetic factors that may contribute to some of these quality defects woody breast for example develops early in life and becomes more pronounced as birds get closer to market age owens said it results in compositional changes within the meat namely an increase in collagen and fat which further impact meat quality identifying genetic causes and associated markers may help chicken breeders to identify potential breeding interventions that may improve muscle development some quality issues can arise during production owens said she learned that heat stress for example can reduce the capacity of muscle tissue to hold water and that has negative impacts during processing while other division poultry scientists work on ways to mediate heat stress in live birds owens investigates ways the industry can cope with the problem during processing i also enjoy developing new tools to measure and assess meat quality and to detect new problems owens said she recently developed predictive models for detecting woody breast in broiler carcasses using image analysis of carcass features associated with the condition that process received a patent in october an eviscerator is part of a poultry industry supported upgrade to the division of agriculture s poultry processing pilot plant that helps researchers develop solutions to industry challenges u of a system division of agriculture photo owens research naturally blends with her teaching in the department of poultry science in the u of a s dale bumpers college of agricultural food and life sciences she has taught many master s and doctoral students over the years and worked alongside them in research their thesis and dissertation research projects have largely built upon and contributed to her research the students are the ones putting in the hours in the lab she said most of her students go to work for poultry companies they go into the industry knowing the whys and hows of meat processing how problems arise and what to do about them owens said i am really thankful for the trust and expectations dr owens put in me which significantly contributed to my career development and what i am today said vivek kuttappan a research scientist at novus international inc when kuttappan joined her lab as a graduate assistant in 2008 he was assigned to characterize white striping when i started working on white striping it was really exploratory as there was no previous information available on this condition however the more we progressed into understanding the condition the more complex the project got kuttappan said the scope of the project extended into the areas of pathology serology and consumer studies dr owens was instrumental in exploring collaborative possibilities to solve our questions she provided me with all the freedom and support to work with experts in specific areas around the u s which opened up a whole new world of opportunities for my challenging project owens said she works to provide her students with a lot of networking opportunities a lot of industry people come to see our facilities and research and students get a lot of exposure to industry concerns and needs she said and the industry representatives get to see the students doing research and managing labs just seeing what they can do owens said owens students also get opportunities to teach classes in poultry science at the university of arkansas vishwesh tijare a food scientist in research and development at columbus craft meats a division of hormel foods in hayward calif taught a lab class and a poultry 101 workshop i always say the best way to learn is to teach something owens said tijare s research informed his teaching he researched the effects of white striping and woody breast on chicken breast quality he said his teaching and research experience combined to build his technical expertise in meat processing this practical experience helps me perform the day to day technical responsibilities required by my job tijare said the world of poultry processing encounters new technical issues from time to time and that is why dr owens always emphasized to all her students that they should be clear on the basic concepts of poultry processing and meat science dr owens trained me in such a way that i m able to detect the cause of technical issues in my day to day work tijare said and this has helped me earn a reputation as a true expert in poultry processing at my company owens teacher student relationships often extend to professional relationships long after they graduate dr owens and i have worked together for over 20 yrs serving in the advancement of the poultry industry said cain cavitt r d fellow scientist in research and development at tyson foods i attribute much of my professional success to the course work and research guidance that i obtained while working on my ph d at the u of a cavitt s primary research emphasis and studies were in evaluating meat tenderness of poultry breast and muscle biochemistry owens said he was instrumental in development of the meullenet owens razor shear method for measuring meat tenderness designed in collaboration with jean françois meullenet now senior vice president agriculture for the division of agriculture and director of the agricultural experiment station the course work that i took along with the research i conducted was instrumental in helping me start my career within the poultry industry cavitt said many of the skills poultry processing and operations muscle biochemistry sensory science statistics that i use daily are attributed to classes that i took and research principles we practiced while a graduate student for dr owens cavitt has maintained close ties with his alma mater since completing his ph d in 2004 i have been able to give back to the u of a poultry science department by serving as an adjunct professor cavitt said during this time i ve been able to help mentor graduate students by serving on graduate committees as well as guest lecturing to both undergraduate and graduate classes on occasion i try to tailor research experience to what students are interested in owens said and i try to get them working with industry partners and visiting companies

a first of its kind database for tracking the world s fossil fuel production reserves and emissions launches on monday to coincide with climate talks taking place at the united nations general assembly in new york a first of its kind database for tracking the world s fossil fuel production reserves and emissions launched on monday to coincide with climate talks taking place at the united nations general assembly in new york the global registry of fossil fuels includes data from over 50 000 oil gas and coal fields in 89 countries covering 75 of global reserves production and emissions the tool is available for public use a first for a collection this size there was already private data available for purchase and analysis of the world s fossil fuel usage and reserves the international energy agency also maintains public data on oil gas and coal but it focuses on the demand for those fossil fuels whereas the new database includes fuels still underground the registry was developed by carbon tracker a nonprofit think tank that researches the energy transition s effect on financial markets and global energy monitor an organization that tracks a variety of energy projects around the globe it allows anyone with a computer and internet access to look at coal oil and gas reserves with a resolution that hasn t been possible before users can see the carbon dioxide emissions they would generate if burned at a global country or field level they can get a sense of the role fossil fuel production has played in different economies they can simulate transitioning away from fossil fuels under four scenarios continuing current trends governments keeping pledges they ve made governments following sustainable development goals set by the united nations and the world achieving net zero by 2050 it is a first ever full transparency open source available to all kind of tool said inger andersen executive director of the united nations environment program in a press briefing about the registry on monday and as you build it out we from unep will be mining it for every bit we can find so that we too can use it mark campanale founder of carbon tracker said he hopes the registry will empower groups to hold governments accountable for example when they issue licenses for fossil fuel extraction civil society groups have got to get more of a focus on what governments are planning to do in terms of license issuance both for coal and oil and gas and actually begin to challenge this permitting process campanale told the associated press the release of the database and an accompanying analysis of the collected data coincide with two sets of climate talks at the international level the u n general assembly in new york that opened monday and cop27 in sharm el sheikh egypt in november the data like what s being released in the registry could arm environmental and climate groups to pressure national leaders to agree to stronger policies that result in less carbon emissions and we re in dire need of carbon reductions campanale said in their analysis the developers found that the united states and russia have enough fossil fuel underground to exhaust the world s remaining carbon budget that s the carbon the world can afford to emit before a certain amount of warming occurs in this case 1 5 degrees celsius it also shows these reserves would generate 3 5 trillion tons of greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all of the emissions produced since the industrial revolution we already have enough extractable fossil fuels to cook the planet we can t afford to use them all or almost any of them at this point said rob jackson a stanford university climate scientist who was not involved with the database i like the emphasis on transparency in fossil fuel production and reserves down to specific projects that s a unique aspect to the work jackson compared the global carbon budget to a bathtub you can run water only so long before the tub overflows he said when the tub is close to overflowing he said governments can turn down the faucet mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or open the tub s drain more removing carbon from the atmosphere campanale said the hope is the investment community who ultimately own these corporations will use the data to begin to challenge the investment plans of companies still planning to expand oil gas and coal projects companies like shell and exxon chevron and their shareholders can use the analysis to to really begin to try and push the companies to move in a completely different direction ___ follow drew costley on twitter drewcostley ___ the associated press health and science department receives support from the howard hughes medical institute s department of science education the ap is solely responsible for all content copyright 2024 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast written or redistributed
new york for investors burned by inflation a very bad year is starting to look even worse as stock prices tumbled and bonds were hit with the deepest losses in decades the surge in consumer prices turned a few corners of the financial markets into profitable refuges earlier this year oil prices rallied other commodities did too even rising home prices and rents propped up the real estate sector but the hiding places are rapidly disappearing that s because the persistent increase in core inflation which strips out volatile food and energy prices is poised to drive the federal reserve fed to continue its most aggressive series of interest rate hikes in decades and that s bad new for assets of all stripes a new study by researchers from the university of pennsylvania and the university of hong kong found that stocks bonds commodities and real estate investment trusts are all exposed to losses when core inflation unexpectedly rises according to data from 1963 to 2019 the first half of the year when energy and food inflation were rising faster than core commodities did great and looked like a great hedge against inflation said nikolai roussanov a finance professor at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania who co authored the study but when energy prices started falling we ve seen that correlation reverse and commodities broadly are not doing so well the shift adds to the darkening outlook in global financial markets which have been hit hard this year as central banks worldwide tightened monetary policy marking a sharp break from the easy money era that helped stocks and bonds rally through the pandemic on tuesday the united states labour department reported that the core consumer price index rose 6 3 in august from a year earlier the first acceleration since march the figures dashed investors hopes for a slowdown and cemented expectations the fed on sept 21 will raise its key rate by three quarters of a percentage point for the third straight time such aggressive tightening raises the risk of a sharp slowdown in the economy that would batter corporate profits and demand for commodities like oil the s p 500 index tumbled more than 4 on tuesday alone following the inflation report and ended the week down nearly 5 a bloomberg commodity index has plunged 3 since tuesday and treasury yields climbed pushing us government debt to a loss of more than 11 this year by far the worst since the bloomberg index starts in 1973 the us dollar has been among the few bright spots with the currency pulled up by rising interest rates the shift in the commodities markets is consistent with what has been seen since the early 1960s according to roussanov and his fellow researchers while commodities return 21 when energy inflation rises by one standard deviation they actually fall 0 1 when core inflation sees the same jump a similar study by researchers from hedge fund firm man group plc and duke university also found that both stocks and bonds tend to perform poorly during inflationary times while commodities are the one major asset class that reliably outperforms when inflation is high but the caveat is once headline inflation begins falling from its peak the return for the asset class has tended to be zero according to one of the authors the whole market and the whole world is navigating from this period of high and rising inflation that we ve been in to a period of still high but lower inflation said man group portfolio manager teun draaisma we re on the cusp of that change the shift is fuelling a movement out of commodities funds as investors brace for slower economic growth or a recession broad based commodity exchange traded funds are set to see cash pulled out for a fifth straight month in september with almost us 17bil rm77bil withdrawn since the start of may with core inflation very strong this implies that aggressive monetary tightening will be delivered said peter chatwell head of global macro strategies trading at mizuho international plc this should reduce demand in the near term and take most asset prices lower bloomberg
the fed took this stance even though markets started to see commodity prices decrease inflation in the us shows signs of easing oil prices have gone south on fears of demand shrinking albeit volatility in the oil prices remains a cause for concern further canada is to increase gas production and export to germany in an effort to ease energy prices the argument against further interest hikes stands on two grounds firstly many economists and commentators believe that the current inflation is a supply side one due to the russia ukraine conflict and the bottlenecks in the supply chains fighting inflation through interest rates works well when driven by higher demand the second ground on which the argument against interest hikes stands is the fear of a looming recession we have recently seen some signs of economic slowdown in terms of employee layoffs ford company for example and lower household spending observed by some consumer goods companies the national association of realtors reported a 5 9 sale decline in july 2022 and 20 2 compared to last year furthermore many real estate agreements were called off in july due to higher mortgage rates these numbers mark a slowdown in the housing market let us not forget that the housing market was the sector that sparked the 2008 financial crisis the fed is now in an unenviable situation struggling to strike the right balance between reducing the inflation rate to the target level of 2 5 over time and simultaneously avoiding driving the economy into recession the impact of such a policy on the stock markets is yet to be felt on the day of powell s speech the s p 500 and nasdaq composite indexes lost 3 37 and 3 94 respectively the upcoming weeks might also see further declines over time such persistent declines will lead investors to seek safe shelters such as gold and fixed deposits now that they can earn higher interest this act on the part of investors will send the economy into a recession experiences show that dealing with inflation is much easier than dealing with a recession since the latter takes a long time to subside the 1929 recession is a case in point another dilemma is the possible effect of a higher interest rate on employment by increasing the interest rate the fed pushes unemployment to a new high the recent data from the bureau of labour statistics for the month of july showed that the rate of unemployment remains stable however historically the employment level is the first casualty of rising interest rates this last factor is crucial given the imminent mid term election in the us scheduled for november 2022 inflation is an international phenomenon however gcc oil producers are on the other side of the equation because these countries benefited from higher energy prices however since the gcc s currencies are pegged to the dollar the interest rate hikes will be felt somehow down the road despite the many warnings addressed in powell s speech and in its next meeting the fed will most probably be cautious not to throw a monkey wrench into the economy by that i mean hiking interest rates too often and at a high level history shows that the fed in many financial crises was caught flat footed i suspect this last point drives the aggressive inflation fight policy followed so far by the fed the decisive factor in the next fed step is the august figures that came out earlier this month ahead of the next fed meeting scheduled on the 20th or 21st of september 2022 an increase of more than 50 bps would be too aggressive and risk higher unemployment and a possible recession on the other hand an increase of 50 bps or less seems prudent and may play a balancing role and smooth facing out of inflation meanwhile market participants will wait for the fed s next meeting with their fingers crossed

euphoria about last week s technological transformation of the ethereum blockchain seemed far gone as ether s price on sunday tumbled to its lowest level since late july the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading below 1 350 a more than 7 decline over the past 24 hours that continued its post merge dip of the previous three days eth started last week changing hands comfortably over 1 700 amid high expectations for ethereum s shift from a proof of work to more energy efficient proof of stake protocol the full impact of the merge may not be readily apparent for some time for now ether and other cryptos seem likely to continue their vulnerability to the same macroeconomic forces that have been affecting stocks and other riskier assets for months bitcoin was recently trading at about 19 450 down more than 2 5 from saturday and near its lowest point in 10 days early in the week the largest crypto in market value began sinking from a perch above

s fomc decision on a fresh interest rate hike this week utc although a minimum 75 basis point increase is widely expected a continuation of the fed s monetary hawkishness we can see that btc s relief rally was indeed unsustainable and it gave up a lot of its gains after the cpi data came out higher than expected and the eth merge turned out to be a sell the news event joe dipasquale ceo of crypto fund manager bitbull capital wrote in an email to coindesk however the upcoming fomc is going to be a key point for the markets as participants price in a 75 bps rate hike while some are expecting

enforcement actions as an important measure it s been six months since president biden s executive on cryptocurrencies but this framework hardly puts anything major in motion wrote oanda senior market analyst edward moya in stark contrast with the merge s mostly flawless execution of the ethereum merge technical snafus and defections marred the new fork blockchain by crypto miners aiming to

economynext sri lanka s higher rates have brought results but full restoration of monetary stability is still eluding the credit system with forex shortages still persisting and interest rates are higher than they need to be due to lack of a credible peg or clean float in this currency crisis sri lanka is also burdened with a lack of clarity on whether there will be a domestic debt restructuring ddr on top of a high inflation and financial repression ifr event which is the usual way debt sustainability is restored by depreciation and a nominally inflated economy related sri lanka s epf hit by us 6 5bn hair cut after soft peg collapse sri lanka s current central bank governor nandalal weerasinghe was right to hike rates and allow bank interest and bond yields to go up while it is true that small businesses in particular are going to be badly hit there was no other choice than to allow rates to normalize to stop the country from being burnt to a cinder with inflation without allowing rates to go up there is no way to reduce credit and outflows and stop further depreciation of the rupee lack of complementary money exchange policies to get the rates down restoring a credible monetary framework is key monetary exchange rate policy conflicts tend to keep rates high a clean float or a re pegging after a float is required to restore credibility taxes and energy prices have been raised to account for the currency collapse using the standard playbook in unstable soft pegs one reason forex shortages persisted in addition to money printed to finance some state expenses is because the central bank was intervening with dollars borrowing from india through the acu mechanism such interventions for imports are followed by more money printing to maintain the policy rate monetary authorities which use reserves for imports and inject liquidity into the banking system encourage banks to give loans without deposits the large liquidity shortages in the banking system are a result of using up reserves for imports it is a classic problem of intermediate regimes in past crises it was not evident because liquidity was injected with outright purchases of gilts china mercifully did not allow its swap to be used for imports otherwise it would have been busted in bridging finance reserves for imports and sri lanka would be deeper in debt the forced dollar sales to the central bank by commercial banks are another reason for delays in reaching external monetary stability the main reason the rupee collapsed steeply in 2022 compared to earlier currency crises was also the surrender rule involving forced dollar sales to the central bank by commercial banks as well as too low interest rates which were not slowing credit fast enough a surrender rule where banks are forced to sell dollars to the central bank not the rule forcing exporters to sell to commercial banks deprives dollars to the market on one side and spews new money into the banking system on the other while it is possible to restore monetary stability without a float it takes longer the corrective interest rates are higher and the output shock or decline in economic activity is greater the longer high rates persist the higher the risk of a banking crisis a flexible exchange rate country will take longer to recover from a combined currency cum banking crisis than a simple currency crisis which is quickly resolved with a float following a rate hike what a float is not this column has consistently advocated a float as a way to end forex shortages restore credibility to the exchange rate and also to bring down interest rates a float is not a break of the peg as advocated by mercantilists in sri lanka which is a hit or miss affair a float is not a devaluation followed by half hearted interventions which fire more depreciation since interventions are offset with new money in a flexible exchange rate regime with a policy rate half hearted floats and interventions followed by injections to offset them simply drive credit and imports as graphically shown in 2012 a clean float isolates reserve money from the balance of payments to establish a clean float the central bank has to abandon its attempts to collect forex reserves through a surrender rule in the form of forced dollars sales to itself which create money and it should also stop sales of dollar sales which sucks out money in a clean float the bop no longer plays any role in the growth or contraction of reserve money there is a complete suspension of convertibility as happened in russia after the us blocked its foreign reserves the central bank gains full control of reserve money which can be guided with open market operations alone there a no money exchange policy conflicts compromise monetary policy and outflows are financed with inflows however that is not what happened in sri lanka after the march float attempt what happened was progressive devaluation with partial interventions especially in the form of a surrender rule which pushed the currency down india s acu money which was used for interventions also played a role in forex shortages as did the forced dollar sales acu money should only have been used to settle adb and world bank loans they should not have been used for import interventions under a float the reserve money gets fixed except for atm withdrawal and inflation however dollar sales against treasury bills such as to settle multilateral debt while leading to a loss of reserves will not alter reserve money in other words a float is a complete suspension of convertibility where reserve money is neither created nor destroyed by central bank sales or purchases of dollars it is not the sale of foreign reserves defense of the peg but the injection of money after the intervention to sterilize the intervention that drives credit and leads to even more losses of foreign reserves this is happening in bangladesh and also india at the moment in the past sri lanka has managed to float and restore monetary stability and the ability in a short time but in 2022 high rates and forex shortages are persisting for an extended time meanwhile private sector sterilization is seen with foreign banks collecting large volumes of liquidity which is parked in the central bank as a result weak credit will reduce the bop impact of any money printed now this column warned against this eventuality not only due to sri lanka s past experience but the general fear of floating found among soft peggers central bankers who operate flexible exchange rates are usually too frightened to float as they are psychologically conditioned to manage the currency half hearted floats do not work given sri lanka s tendency to float half heartedly including in 2012 and to try to float with excess liquidity in 2015 this column warned that care should be taken for it not to happen but this columnist did not count on the deadly surrender rule which is very much worse than floating with excess liquidity however any kind of half hearted treasury bill and bond auctions partially failed bond or bill auctions with some volumes of printed money will lead to progressively higher interest rates but the reserve losses and currency depreciation will continue this column warned in august 2021 sri lanka s monetary meltdown will accelerate unless quick action is taken soft peggers are not good at floating partial interventions flexible exchange rate will lead to even higher interest rates and more losses of confidence in argentina short term rates went up to 60 percent due to the flexible exchange rate which is neither floating nor pegged that had caused so much damage to sri lanka since 2015 coupled with an unsterilized disorderly market conditions dmc rule which also lacks credibility the high interest rates can kill many businesses the high rates from partial floating can kill finance companies and banks when dying banks are bailed out with printed money it is generally even more difficult to control the exchange rate if money has to be printed for other expenses the float will not work that is why the deficit has to be reduced to some extent if not the whole burden will fall on the interest rate with no growth it will be a vicious cycle if money continues to be printed the currency fall will not stop with a float a float will also not stop defaults even if it works and halts the depreciation if money is continued to be printed the currency will continue to fall as it did in 2015 when the central bank floated with excess liquidity and indonesia s central bank floated with bank bailout money during the east asian crisis a severe currency fall will lead to an inflationary blow off like in argentina which will lower government cash expenses and salaries of state workers and the unemployed graduates that were hired unfortunately private salaries and pensions of old people will also go up in smoke in the same way all this shows that stimulus mmt and soft pegged central banks are not a joke all this has happened the inflationary blow off has happened inflation at the time this column is updated has topped 60 percent with private credit now negative most of the increases in the inflation index in the future will come from the changes to the price structure from the recent currency fall and past printing of money a successful float and an appreciation of the currency can reduce some of the inflation high rates flat yield curve will persist until a float and credible peg is re established the current high interest rates will not fall steadily until monetary stability is restored conflicting money and exchange policy will keep rates elevated and will require a severe crushing of economic activity to stop further depreciation in past currency crises rates have started to fall only after a successful float in sri lanka float has been always been followed by a re pegging to re build foreign reserves under an imf program the central bank should not buy dollars until the float succeeds a clean float which is followed by an appreciation of the currency makes dollar holders sell exporters to convert early and importers settle at leisure if not uncertainty will persist there will be little incentive to sell forward the bunched up yield of the treasury bills where the yield curve if flat is testimony to existing monetary instability the longer it takes to restore monetary stability the longer higher rates will prevail the longer higher rates prevail the bigger hit on the businesses the economy and bigger the hit on banks by august high rates have been in sri lanka for six months and there are no signs of them falling as yet as soon as a float succeeds and a working regime is established interest rates tend to ease even if the central bank sells down its treasury bill stock and buys dollars to meet an imf reserve target in past crises currency was re pegged after the float under an imf program to meet the net international reserve targets a float was a prior action in earlier imf programs and is likely to be this time as well however with the program likely to be delayed due to debt negotiations an early restoration of monetary stability will help stabilize rates in past currency crises triggered by the central bank foreign projects continued to operate imf and other money also came quickly after a staff level agreement was signed following the default however many projects including those by japan is halted chinese projects are running already committed adb and world bank projects are also operating but there are no new ones on top of all this outflows are taking place due to unwinding of swaps and external market borrowings of banks as well as settling of suppliers credit some banks also have negative net open positions and some dollar debt is being repaid in dollars a back of the envelop calculation shows that sri lanka is almost running a current account surplus with reported exports and remittances exceeding imports while experiencing a bop deficit due to printing at the margin however the fear of a ddr event is keeping rates elevated the fear of ddr on top of high inflation and financial repression impoverish unstable countries with intermediate regimes countries which move out of an intermediate regime to a clean float or hard peg rapidly more out of poverty collapse regularly due to its policy rate injections which drive unsustainable domestic credit they have high inflation and elevated interest rates the have volatile growth and output shocks with every currency collapse every currency collapse coming from data driven flexible inflation targeting as seen from 2015 to extend a credit cycle beyond that of the fed by suppressing rates with liquidity injections will cost about two years of growth as the output shock follows the currency collapse central bank purchases of treasury bills is an effective domestic default when countries with intermediate regime become a market access country they default externally as the domestic default leads to forex shortages debt sustainability in these depreciating latin america liquidity injecting countries is usually restored by high inflation and financial repression ifr as long as they do not have market access and external commercial debt volumes are low sri lanka s economy expected to inflate to 23 trillion rupees at least in 2022 according to latest projections while bank deposits and pensions funds lose value with savers and old pensioners paying the biggest price however now there are growing fears of a domestic debt restructuring ddr on top of imf bond holders in banks and the epf have faced severe financial repression from around 2015 due to money printed under the flexible inflation targeting output gap targeting to suppress rates through overnight repo term repo outright purchases and explicit price controls from 2020 the three currency crises created in 2015 2016 2018 and 2020 2022 are ample testimony to the below market rates that spurred credit to unsustainable levels and blew a hole through the bop and destroyed the savings and investible capital of the people through depreciation flaw in the framework the lack of early clarity on whether there is a ddr ifr even is now driving interest rates up the lack of early clarity is a serious flaw in the current default resolution framework developed by washington for flexible exchange rate countries if sri lanka can maintain a credible peg for two fed cycles like east asia and abandon the flexible exchange rate and aggressive open market operations interest rates and inflation will collapse to world levels and deficits will come down foreign investments will flow in as they see stability but that will not happen in sri lanka with its policy rate with a narrow corridor and data driven flexible inflation targeting presumably to target an output gap instead now that sri lanka has market access the country will default repeatedly under the flexible inflation targeting regime such defaults will take place every two to 2 5 fed cycles flexible inflation targeting is not inflation targeting it simply a reserve collecting peg with over aggressive open market operations the data driven flexible inflation targeting where money is encouraged to be printed through multiple liquidity windows is the most dangerous multiple anchor soft pegged regime cooked up by salt water style pundits in the west sitting in the safe cocoons of their single anchor monetary regimes in post depression post world war ii history flexible inflation targeting tops the bretton woods failed pegs with miles to spare it is an attempt to run a reserve collecting non credible peg with floating rate style monetary policy when the failed bretton woods was set up floating rates were not in existence in any case intermediate regime central banks that go to the imf keeps going to the agency in future crises sri lanka has gone to the agency 17 times including this one some central banks set up by the us in the same style as the sri lanka has gone to the imf 20 times or more there will be no difference in this program in a new monetary law act to be passed under the imf program flexible inflation targeting the very same regime that created three currency crises including one where taxes were raised to reduce the deficit in 2018 will be legalized nothing can save this country from another default and another currency crisis trade controls depreciation and social unrest in fact from august 28 1950 sri lanka was made into a country with trade controls with exchange controls and steep depreciation and high inflation after 1978 where only the people on the top of the food chain can survive and younger people can migrate and get jobs in countries with stable regimes sri lanka is now a country with an ageing population future ifr events under data driven flexible inflation targeting with or without ddr will take a terrible toll on them as pension funds are destroyed young people however can migrate to single anchor regimes or find jobs in countries with credible or mostly credible pegs colombo sept18 2022
tokyo japan s increasingly incongruous policy stance aimed at securing both stable growth and inflation is adding to the likelihood of further yen losses even as officials warn of possible intervention just last week as finance minister shunichi suzuki was warning he would step into markets to shore up the currency if needed the bank of japan boj was boosting bond purchases to keep yields low a move that widens the policy differentials with the rest of world and weakens the yen the central bank spent 1 42 trillion yen us 9 9bil or rm44 9bil on government debt to protect its artificially low yield cap on wednesday and thursday alone even after taking the passage of time into account that sum dwarfs the 231 billion yen rm7 3bil the country used the last time it intervened to support the currency in june 1998 adding to the conflicting signals last week prime minister fumio kishida chose to flag the attractiveness of the weakening local currency for companies looking to bring their production facilities back in japan that hardly chimed with suzuki s repeated hints that the authorities will intervene if moves are too rapid amid these apparent contradictions the takeaway for yen bears appears to be that they can still keep pushing the currency lower as long as they don t go too fast a major driver of yen weakness has been the widening yield gap between policy rates in the united states and japan that spread is set to expand even further this week with the federal reserve fed potentially opting for a hike of as much as 100 basis points on sept 21 while the boj is expected to reaffirm its commitment to rock bottom borrowing costs the following day this kabuki dance is unsustainable said aninda mitra head of asia macro and investment strategy at bny mellon investment management in singapore heightened verbal intervention reveals both a concern about the speed of potential inflation impacts and also contradictorily a willingness to purchase more japanese government bonds which ultimately undermines the defence of the yen the yen is far from being alone the vast majority of its global peers have also wilted against the dollar in recent months as the fed has turned increasing hawkish even so japan s currency is the worst performer in the group of 10 this year having tumbled more than 19 strategists around the world are predicting further losses goldman sachs group inc said last week the yen may decline to 155 per dollar if us treasury yields keep rising while hsbc holdings inc said last week it may fall beyond 145 rbc capital markets is tipping it to end the year at 147 based on bloomberg surveys while the sinking yen is putting pressure on boj governor haruhiko kuroda to allow bonds yields to rise there are few signs he will back down his recent comments suggest he is determined to stick to an accommodative policy to revive growth as he has done through his decade long tenure as head of the central bank the nation s preferred gauge of inflation consumer prices excluding fresh food accelerated to 2 4 in july the fastest pace since 2008 still that s far below the levels in other developed countries despite japan s heavy reliance on imported energy and food kuroda has repeatedly said the uptick won t last without bigger wage gains and therefore rates must stay low until a lasting growth cycle is in place the boj will keep its benchmark rate at minus 0 1 next week according to all 49 economists surveyed by bloomberg the central bank won t adjust policy until the yen weakens to 150 according to the median reply to one of the other questions asked in the survey kuroda is certain that some kind of small rate hike won t make much difference for the yen as can be been seen in the depreciation of multiple currencies including the korean won said jin kenzaki head of japan research at societe generale sa in tokyo for now the authorities just want to buy time until the dollar pressure subsides when the end of the fed rate cycle comes into view he said traders are skeptical the boj can hold out indefinitely swap rates betting on a shift in policy have been creeping higher with those on 10 year contracts about 20 basis points above the boj s 0 25 line in the sand for bond yields that s still below the level of almost 0 6 reached in june when surging global yields fuelled speculation the central bank would capitulate prime minister kishida last week announced the continuation of fuel and animal feed subsidies plus cash handouts for low income households aimed at alleviating the pain of soaring energy and food prices as those costs are being amplified by the weak yen the administration is essentially giving the boj a green light to keep going no matter what happens to the currency japan s economic policy is getting complicated but it s a reflection of each entity s view on what s best for the economy societe generale s kenzaki said the bottom line is that kuroda won t and can t give up his easing stance kishida gets that and so now he is starting to focus on taking advantage of the weak yen bloomberg
article the buck isn t stopping the value of the u s dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the british pound across the atlantic to the south korean won across the pacific after rising again friday the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against a key index measuring six major currencies including the euro and japanese yen many professional investors don t expect it to ease off anytime soon the dollar s rise affects nearly everyone even those who will never leave the u s borders here s a look at what s driving the u s dollar higher and what it can mean for investors and households what does it mean to say the dollar is stronger essentially that one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before consider the japanese yen a year ago 1 could get a little less than 110 yen now it can buy 143 that s about 30 more and one of the biggest moves the u s dollar has made against another currency foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world the u s dollar index which measures the dollar against the euro yen and other major currencies has climbed more than 14 this year the gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments most of which have had a dismal year u s stocks are down more than 19 bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7 why is the dollar strengthening because the u s economy is doing better than others even though inflation is high the u s job market has remained remarkably solid and other areas of the economy such as the services sector have been resilient that s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low that in turn has traders expecting the federal reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply and to hold them there a while in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years such expectations have helped the yield of a 10 year treasury more than double to 3 44 from roughly 1 33 a year ago who cares about bond yields investors who want to make more income off their money and those juicier u s yields are drawing investors from all over the world other central banks have been less aggressive than the fed because their economies seem to be more fragile the european central bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever three quarters of a percentage point but the fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year with a third expected this upcoming week some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible following a hotter than expected report on u s inflation tuesday partly because of that less aggressive bent 10 year bonds across europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than u s treasurys such as germany s 1 75 and japan s 0 25 when investors from asia and europe buy treasurys they have to trade their own currencies for u s dollars that pushes up the dollar s value a strong dollar helps u s tourists right yes u s travelers in tokyo spending 10 000 yen on dinner will be using 23 fewer dollars than a year ago for the same priced meal with the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the argentine peso to the egyptian pound to the south korean won the dollar is going further in many countries than before does it help only rich people who can afford to travel abroad no a stronger dollar also helps u s shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation when the dollar is rising against the euro for example european companies make more euros on each 1 of sales with that cushion they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros they could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros or they could find some balance of the two prices for imports fell 1 in august from a month earlier following july s 1 5 drop offering some relief amid the nation s high inflation prices for imported fruits nuts and some peels dropped 8 7 for example they re down 3 from a year earlier a stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally that s because oil gold and others are bought and sold in u s dollars around the world when the dollar rises against the yen a japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before that can mean less upward pressure on oil prices so there are only winners from a strong dollar no u s companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed at mcdonald s revenue fell 3 during the summer from a year earlier but if the dollar s value had simply stayed put against other currencies the company s revenue would have been 3 higher microsoft meanwhile said changes in foreign currency values sliced 595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter a string of other companies have given similar warnings recently and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits companies in the s p 500 index get roughly 40 of their revenue from outside the united states according to factset any other collateral damage a strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in u s dollar terms instead of in their own currencies when they must repay their debts in u s dollars while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day it can create lots of stress where s the dollar heading from here the dollar s biggest moves may be behind it but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while tuesday s report on u s inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected that has traders upping bets for fed rate hikes going into next year fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high until the job is done in breaking the nation s high inflation even if it damages economic growth that bias toward still higher rates by the fed should continue to offer support for the value of the u s dollar for the dollar to weaken meaningfully strategists wrote in a bofa global research report the fed has to get more concerned about growth than inflation and we are not there yet

odds of a hard landing treasury 10 year yields hovered near 3 5 per cent while the two year rate which is more sensitive to imminent policy moves hit the highest since 2007 volatility is expected to remain heightened through the remainder of this year at a minimum said megan horneman chief investment officer at verdence capital advisors until there is consistent improvement from inflation timing the peak in fed rate hikes is challenging while we do not rule out a testing of the june s p 500 low we would look at it as a potential buying opportunity traders are betting the fed will hike by 75 basis points wednesday signal rates are heading above 4 per cent and will then pause the long hold strategy is rooted in the idea the central bank would avoid the disastrous stop go policy of the 1970s that allowed inflation to get out of hand while a case can be made for going bigger a shock full point boost could add to recession jitters to sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra

sees the fed boosting rates by 100 basis points this month with chair jerome powell and the central bank s economic projections looking hawkish he noted that could cause the s p 500 to retest its june 16 low of 3 666 77 almost 6 per cent below current levels while a policy surprise could certainly move markets the fed s revised forecasts for where the policy rate will ultimately come to rest and how long it s likely to stay at that level will be equally important swap contracts that forecast rates over the next two years now peak around 4 5 per cent in march 2023 a full point higher than was expected after the last meeting in july the question to focus on isn t whether the fed will hike rates by 75 basis points or 100 basis points said phillip nelson head of asset allocation at nepc what we re looking for is how aggressive powell will be in the next six to 12 months the messaging we get in the next few weeks could be a bigger data point and a shock to investors in a sign of how severe

article the buck isn t stopping the value of the u s dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the british pound across the atlantic to the south korean won across the pacific after rising again friday the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against a key index measuring six major currencies including the euro and japanese yen many professional investors don t expect it to ease off anytime soon the dollar s rise affects nearly everyone even those who will never leave the u s borders here s a look at what s driving the u s dollar higher and what it can mean for investors and households what does it mean to say the dollar is stronger essentially that one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before consider the japanese yen a year ago 1 could get a little less than 110 yen now it can buy 143 that s about 30 more and one of the biggest moves the u s dollar has made against another currency foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world the u s dollar index which measures the dollar against the euro yen and other major currencies has climbed more than 14 this year the gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments most of which have had a dismal year u s stocks are down more than 19 bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7 why is the dollar strengthening because the u s economy is doing better than others even though inflation is high the u s job market has remained remarkably solid and other areas of the economy such as the services sector have been resilient that s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low that in turn has traders expecting the federal reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply and to hold them there a while in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years such expectations have helped the yield of a 10 year treasury more than double to 3 44 from roughly 1 33 a year ago who cares about bond yields investors who want to make more income off their money and those juicier u s yields are drawing investors from all over the world other central banks have been less aggressive than the fed because their economies seem to be more fragile the european central bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever three quarters of a percentage point but the fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year with a third expected this upcoming week some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible following a hotter than expected report on u s inflation tuesday partly because of that less aggressive bent 10 year bonds across europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than u s treasurys such as germany s 1 75 and japan s 0 25 when investors from asia and europe buy treasurys they have to trade their own currencies for u s dollars that pushes up the dollar s value a strong dollar helps u s tourists right yes u s travelers in tokyo spending 10 000 yen on dinner will be using 23 fewer dollars than a year ago for the same priced meal with the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the argentine peso to the egyptian pound to the south korean won the dollar is going further in many countries than before does it help only rich people who can afford to travel abroad no a stronger dollar also helps u s shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation when the dollar is rising against the euro for example european companies make more euros on each 1 of sales with that cushion they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros they could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros or they could find some balance of the two prices for imports fell 1 in august from a month earlier following july s 1 5 drop offering some relief amid the nation s high inflation prices for imported fruits nuts and some peels dropped 8 7 for example they re down 3 from a year earlier a stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally that s because oil gold and others are bought and sold in u s dollars around the world when the dollar rises against the yen a japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before that can mean less upward pressure on oil prices so there are only winners from a strong dollar no u s companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed at mcdonald s revenue fell 3 during the summer from a year earlier but if the dollar s value had simply stayed put against other currencies the company s revenue would have been 3 higher microsoft meanwhile said changes in foreign currency values sliced 595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter a string of other companies have given similar warnings recently and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits companies in the s p 500 index get roughly 40 of their revenue from outside the united states according to factset any other collateral damage a strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in u s dollar terms instead of in their own currencies when they must repay their debts in u s dollars while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day it can create lots of stress where s the dollar heading from here the dollar s biggest moves may be behind it but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while tuesday s report on u s inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected that has traders upping bets for fed rate hikes going into next year fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high until the job is done in breaking the nation s high inflation even if it damages economic growth that bias toward still higher rates by the fed should continue to offer support for the value of the u s dollar for the dollar to weaken meaningfully strategists wrote in a bofa global research report the fed has to get more concerned about growth than inflation and we are not there yet

a first of its kind database for tracking the world s fossil fuel production reserves and emissions launches on monday to coincide with climate talks taking place at the united nations general assembly in new york the global registry of fossil fuels includes data from over 50 000 oil gas and coal fields in 89 countries that covers 75 of global reserves production and emissions and is available for public use a first for a collection of this size until now there has been private data available for purchase and analysis of the world s fossil fuel usage and reserves the international energy agency also maintains public data on oil gas and coal but it focuses on the demand for those fossil fuels whereas this new database looks at what is yet to be burned the registry was developed by carbon tracker a nonprofit think tank that researches the energy transition s effect on financial markets and the global energy monitor an organization that tracks a variety of energy projects around the globe corporations investors and scientists already have some level of access to private data on fossil fuels mark campanale founder of carbon tracker said he hopes the registry will empower groups to hold governments accountable for example when they issue licenses for fossil fuel extraction civil society groups have got to get more of a focus on what governments are planning to do in terms of license issuance both for coal and oil and gas and actually begin to challenge this permitting process campanale told the associated press advertisement the release of the database and an accompanying analysis of the collected data coincide with two critical sets of climate talks at the international level the u n general assembly in new york beginning on september 13 and cop27 in sharm el sheikh egypt in november data like what s being released in the registry could arm environmental and climate groups to pressure national leaders to agree to stronger policies that result in less carbon emissions and we re in dire need of carbon reductions campanale said in their analysis of the data the developers found that the united states and russia have enough fossil fuel still underground untapped to exhaust the world s remaining carbon budget that s the remaining carbon the world can afford to emit before a certain amount of warming occurs in this case 1 5 degrees celsius it also shows these reserves would generate 3 5 trillion tons of greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all of the emissions produced since the industrial revolution we already have enough extractable fossil fuels to cook the planet we can t afford to use them all or almost any of them at this point we ve run out of time to build new things in old ways said rob jackson a stanford university climate scientist who was not involved with the database i like the emphasis on transparency in fossil fuel production and reserves down to specific projects that s a unique aspect to the work jackson compared the global carbon budget to a bathtub advertisement you can run water only so long before the tub overflows he said when the tub is close to overflowing he said governments can turn down the faucet mitigating greenhouse gas emissions or open the tub s drain more removing carbon from the atmosphere the database shows that we have much more carbon than we need as a global community campanale said and more than enough to overflow the bathtub and flood the bathroom in jackson s analogy so investors and shareholders should be holding decision makers at the world s largest oil gas and coal companies accountable when they approve new investments in fossil fuel extraction he said campanale said the hope is the investment community who ultimately own these corporations will use the data to begin to challenge the investment plans of companies still planning to expand oil gas and coal projects companies like shell and exxon chevron and their shareholders can use the analysis to to really begin to try and push the companies to move in a completely different direction send questions comments to the editors previous next

the e commerce company enjoyed smooth sailing for years but the narrative has changed greatly in recent months it s the dog days of summer for e commerce company shopify shop 2 04 the stock is down 77 year to date in light of historically high inflation levels and a reopening global economy which has brought consumers back into brick and mortar stores but macroeconomic conditions aren t the only thing negatively affecting the e commerce stock at the moment in its most recent quarter the company posted a big net loss quite the no no during times of economic uncertainty so what exactly is going on with shopify s bottom line and will the e commerce software business bounce back in the coming years let s take a closer look at its current situation to come up with an answer shopify is facing a series of headwinds in the second quarter shopify s total revenue increased 15 7 year over year to 1 30 billion that seems fine at first glance but it doesn t even compare to the 56 7 uptick the company reported in the same quarter last year meanwhile it suffered a net loss of 1 20 billion a much different outcome from its 879 1 million of net income in the year ago quarter in the first half of 2022 the e commerce company generated a total net loss of 2 68 billion ouch so why is shopify s bottom line in the red these days the company s operating expenses rose 76 year over year to 845 9 million in the second quarter and while that contributed to the company s 190 2 million operating loss in the period its 1 20 billion net loss could primarily be attributed to its equity holdings in affirm holdings and global e online in the second quarter shopify s unrealized loss on its various investments totaled 1 0 billion making up the bulk of the of red ink on its bottom line both affirm and global e online have witnessed their share prices collapse 78 and 48 year to date respectively as part of the ongoing market correction that said the company is indeed investing a whole lot of money into its platform in its push to help merchants expand their growth and reach and management has stated it will invest roughly 1 billion into the shopify fulfillment network throughout 2023 and 2024 while that and similar initiatives could pay dividends down the road they re extremely capital intensive and will continue to exert pressure on profitability for the foreseeable future will shopify get back on track shopify has confronted a very unfortunate situation record high inflation and a softening e commerce environment are putting pressure on its top line while its ramping up spending in new offerings and services don t get me wrong these investments could pay off long term as just one example two day delivery for consumers buying from shopify powered businesses could add plenty of value to the e commerce platform in the long run but its worsening profitability is not a great look amid the current macro environment big picture in mind shopify is still advantageously positioned for success in the latest quarter e commerce sales only represented 14 5 of total retail sales in the united states online sales are forecast to expand 50 over the next four years eclipsing 7 4 trillion by 2025 according to statista with a market share of 31 shopify is the biggest e commerce software platform in the u s investors have every right to be concerned about the company s recent trajectory but it s also important to keep the long run in mind with nearly 7 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet and a debt to equity ratio of only 14 the company has the financial stability to weather any economic storm and pursue its ambitious vision is shopify stock a buy even after shedding 77 of its value year to date the e commerce stock is still trading at just over eight times sales that s an expensive valuation in and of itself but it s also a premium to competitors like bigcommerce and wix com which sport price to sales multiples of 4 5 and 3 2 respectively thus the company has more room to fall before it officially qualifies as cheap if you already own the stock i suggest holding onto it shopify has a bright future ahead of it despite these recent pitfalls but if you re looking to start a position i d stay on the sidelines for now there are better opportunities out there in e commerce right now
these bank stocks will get an earnings boost from rising interest rates over the past year inflation has remained stubbornly high wreaking havoc for consumers and investors alike economists hoped august would bring better news but it didn t earlier this week the u s bureau of labor statistics released its august data for the consumer price index which measures the changes in the costs of consumer goods the release showed that prices were up 8 3 on an annual basis with higher food and housing costs offsetting lower energy prices now investors look to the federal reserve which has been aggressively fighting inflation with its primary tool interest rate increases when the fed raised rates by 75 basis points in june it was its largest rate hike in 28 years the fed raised rates another 75 basis points in july and investors expect a similar increase during its meeting next week while rising rates hurt most companies by raising the cost of borrowing bank stocks benefit here s why one of the main ways banks make money is by charging customers higher interest rates on credit than they pay customers on deposits while some banks generate extra income from fees and others have highly profitable investment banking divisions most banks generate earnings from interest rates banks face challenging times when interest rates are low because that tends to compress interest rate spreads or the amount of interest charged minus the amount paid out when interest rates rise this spread tends to widen and banks see their profitability improve with that said here are three banks that stand to benefit in a big way from continuing rate increases 1 bank of america bank of america bac 0 45 ranks as the second largest bank in the u s with over 2 trillion in assets and is one of the most interest rate sensitive major banks out there one reason is that 40 of its 1 4 trillion in deposits from consumer wealth management clients is in low or no interest checking accounts as a result bank of america can earn more on these deposits as rates rise through the first six months of the year bank of america s net interest income nii rose by 18 to 24 billion versus the first half of the previous year in its recent regulatory filing the bank said a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would help nii grow by 5 billion over the next year an 11 increase from its trailing 12 month nii 2 the bancorp the bancorp tbbk 1 37 is different from traditional banks because it has no branches instead the bank offers private label banking services to online and nonbank lenders the bank handles back end services like regulatory compliance and access to payment networks like visa and mastercard over 100 clients like paypal holdings and chime turn to the bancorp for these services to help nonbank clients offer their own payment products the bank s net interest income didn t change much in the first half of the year but that s due to a timing difference in how interest rates affect its deposits and loans most of the bancorp s deposits are through prepaid and debit card account deposits and when interest rates go up the bancorp quickly adjusts the interest rates it pays on these deposits however its loans are variable rates repriced on a lag and take longer to adjust to changes in interest rates these loans are generally repriced monthly or quarterly and the bank sees higher interest rates serving as a tailwind in the second half of this year according to its regulatory filing a 100 basis point parallel increase to interest rates would help nii increase by 9 while a 200 basis point increase would help nii grow by nearly 19 3 silvergate capital silvergate capital si 2 63 provides banking services to cryptocurrency customers which it has done since 2013 one of its earliest products was the silvergate exchange network sen a payment transfer network that allows crypto exchanges like coinbase global or gemini to transfer u s dollars efficiently the sen is interesting because it gives silvergate a vast amount of non interest bearing deposits which allows the bank to benefit significantly when interest rates go higher the bank has over 13 billion in non interest bearing deposits or 99 5 of its total deposit base as a result silvergate reaps the benefits of higher interest rates on its loan portfolio while it doesn t have to increase what it pays out on its deposit accounts silvergate s nii grew 126 to 121 million in the year s first half in its recent regulatory filing the bank noted that a 100 basis point parallel shift up in interest rates would cause nii to increase by nearly 16 while a 200 basis point increase would cause nii to grow by 31

canola futures prices are bouncing around as forecasters try to determine the size of oilseed production here in the united states and elsewhere the u s department of agriculture monthly supply and demand report sept 12 called into question what had been an impression that global oilseed supply would be more comfortable this year the report surprised everyone with a u s soybean yield forecast of only 50 5 bushels an acre down from 51 9 bu in the august report it also cut harvested area to 86 6 million acres from 87 2 million advertisement read also coming canola crush capacity delayed saskatoon canada s canola crush buildout is not going as smoothly as planned according to the u s department of agriculture it saw production at 4 378 billion bu below the range of analysts expectations of 4 44 to 4 57 billion it forecast ending stocks at only 200 million bu the lowest in seven years in the minutes following the report november soybeans shot up more than five percent and november canola more than 3 5 percent that was a marked departure from recent experience when prices were falling the november canola contract last week fell to a level not seen since before the drought established last summer however the price remained strong compared to any point before 2021 began advertisement a weaker canola price would not be surprising given this year s crop is improved and the fact that we are in harvest when prices usually are under pressure the prices of competing oilseeds were also down from the highs this spring and crude oil s price was lower the scarcity of canola last spring caused its price to break from traditional relationship with soybeans in the first half of 2020 canola was worth only about five percent more than soybeans both oilseeds soared in the first half of this year but canola clearly outpaced soybeans when canola peaked in late april its price was more than 50 percent higher than soybeans price rationing was narrowing the list of buyers down to only those who had to have it by last week canola s premium over soybeans had fallen to around 14 percent advertisement with more supply on the way canola s price will once again have to reach a competitive level but there are varying views on the size of the canola crop statistics canada s production forecast issued aug 29 based on satellite images from july tentatively pegged canola at 19 5 million tonnes well up from last year but about the same as the 2020 21 crop that was based on a national average canola yield of 40 5 bu per acres the saskatchewan yield estimate was 37 7 bu per acre manitoba 43 bu and alberta 44 3 bu but two provincial agriculture departments think yields might be lower saskatchewan agriculture on sept 5 estimated the provincial canola yield average at 34 bu alberta agriculture on aug 23 forecast yield at 40 5 bu manitoba agriculture on sept 6 said yields on canola harvested so far ranged 45 to 50 bu per acre advertisement canola supply estimates were filled out sept 7 with statistics canada data on july 31 ending stocks it pegged stocks at a tight 875 000 tonnes about half the amount last year at the same point the next forecast of this year s production based on modelling will be released sept 14 statcan raised its estimate of the 2021 22 crop to 13 76 million tonnes up from the previous estimate of 12 60 million tonnes the usda and other forecasters tentatively expect a major expansion of soybean production in south america to 215 6 million tonnes up 20 percent from last season s drought reduced crops advertisement however those crops are not seeded yet and the outlook is based on average weather the la nina that helped limit rainfall last season is still in place and could again hurt yields down south palm oil is another competitor in the vegetable oil sector like other oils it peaked this spring partly driven higher by indonesia s brief export ban but the price is now down about 44 percent earlier analysts expected production would pick up in the second half of the year pressuring prices even lower however the labour shortages that plagued the industry in number two producer malaysia since the beginning of covid continue malaysian plantations get many workers from indonesia and bangladesh and with the lifting of travel restrictions the industry expected entry of 52 000 workers but bureaucracy and concern over worker safety slowed that to a trickle leading some production to spoil in the field reuters reported on the other hand repeated covid lockdowns of major cities in china are hurting demand from the largest palm oil importer also the status of china s hog herd will impact soybean and canola demand big operating losses last year and early this year caused farmers to shrink the herd supply and demand are in better balance now and profits have returned but with fewer pigs the demand for oilseed meal is reduced

these mixed media compositions are in fact patchworks of painted fabric individually selected from bruce s vast archive and pasted directly onto the canvas in a textile collage that can sometimes

can be as overwhelming and rhythmic as the ocean waves of big sur as an exhibiting artist for over 25 years bruce has steadily oriented her craft toward capturing and encouraging the process of artmaking as an end in its own right a way both of making something new and taking stock of oneself as an administrator who oversees the creative programming for the entire state of arizona bruce is

tackling the challenges confronting nigeria s economy requires seamless coordination of monetary and fiscal authorities experts have said though a few are within the control of the apex bank most require coordination with fiscal authorities while identifying excessive printing of money as a major factor fueling inflation in the country the experts while reacting to the spike in headline inflation to 20 52 per cent in august argued that besides imported inflation which is triggered by high energy prices the country s high inflation is strongly correlated with the increase in the money supply they said this against a spike in broad money from n20 trillion in 2015 to about n49 trillion according to them the short term solution to the high inflation is to mop up the excess liquidity through further interest rate hikes and adopting open market operations omo the chief executive officer diary hills limited kelvin emmanuel held that the central bank of nigeria cbn needs to assert its independence by recalling the ways and means w m facility which has created a situation where the money supply is higher than output his words the central bank also must migrate the financial system from collateral based to credit reporting based lending by setting up the infrastructure that is necessary for the integration of the bank verification number bvn with the national identity management commissions nimc national identification number nin system this is the key to developing regulatory frameworks for credit data aggregation reporting and evaluation agencies in the private sector that are tasked with the duty of building a point based merit system for individuals companies cooperatives and associations to de risk lending in nigeria he added that the solution to increasing the loan deposit ratio ldr for deposit money banks dmb is not setting penalties as the banks would rather prefer to pay a fine than give unsecured loans that raise their non performing loans npls a credit reporting based lending structure will increase the integrity of the market and help financial institutions access data for determining clean lines which is a key to unlocking capital for raising productivity output he stated he stressed that the fiscal authorities on the other hand need to utilise their backward integration levy for the development of import substitutions in areas where nigeria has a comparative advantage explaining that when it comes to fiscal framework the two major drivers of inflation are energy and food he said fast tracking the process that ensures the removal of government back pms subsidy and government subsidised exchange rate system are fundamental drivers to decelerating the inflationary trend an oil and gas expert jide pratt said high inflation is a reality to which nigerians would need to accept inflation is something we all have to face now to stem the tide as individuals we need to look towards holding savings for those who can in stocks mutual funds and other currency for those who can afford it pratt who is also the chief operating officer coo of aiona nigeria manufacturer of led and solar lights added that on the part of the government a lot of what is happening in the economic space is due to insecurity and a lack of adequate infrastructure to stimulate trade a good example of this is the lagos ibadan expressway which has taken over a decade to construct he stated the man hours lost in gridlock has a direct correlation with trade between the two cities the examples are numerous finally the fiscal policies haven t been apt to at least tackle the foreign exchange rates and devaluation this has a direct impact on the cost of imported items as the paucity of foreign exchange from the cbn due to lower foreign direct investment fdi means that it is sourced at the parallel market as high as 710 713 as of today pratt believes that the next administration already has its job well cut out for it as resolving insecurity improving infrastructure and solving the foreign exchange conundrum would form the fulcrum of its core tasks the first task for the next administration is the sincerity of purpose and then tackle insecurity infrastructure foreign exchange and fdi these must be the building blocks the need to also encourage manufacturing production as well as boost mechanised agriculture to get food sufficient then excess to export leaning on acfta is extremely pertinent the question is are we ready or will we rather face doom days that lie ahead for prof kingsley moghalu the cbn has to stop deficit financing of the federal government to bring inflation to control lending the federal government 20 trillion naira in ways and means lending is illegal the cbn is creating inflation and those in charge of the economy are clueless about how to manage the economy he said moghalu a lawyer ex deputy governor of the apex bank and professor of political economy insisted that managing inflation is not strictly about adjusting the interest rate upwards to tackle rising prices but deliberately taking steps to improve the entry of foreign exchange into the nigerian economy he explained the nigerian economy can attract huge foreign exchange but we drive them away with too much government control such as multiple exchange rates some people can get foreign exchange and go and sell it in the unofficial market thereby distorting the system no matter what anybody says that happens in a country of about two hundred million people there is a market so if the government makes the management of foreign exchange transparent there will be a huge inflow of capital that could drive down the price of foreign currencies the first problem is the absence of a clear economic philosophy the balance between the state and the market has not been properly spelled out therefore we have political leaders that tend to use state power to manage the economy then some people say that the market should be free where the private sector will drive the economy none of these two extremes will work for nigeria what i propose is what i call a developmental capitalist state in which the market will largely drive the economy there must be a balance between the government and the market while i agree that nigeria cannot run a full capital state it should have a welfare package for old people and unemployed persons but for the unemployed the government should have a transitional mechanism in place that is not more than one year to enable them to retrain to get something doing to fully combat youth unemployment moghalu canvassed re training of educated young nigerians especially in areas that need personnel according to him another problem confronting the nigerian nation is the absence of consistent economic policies going memory lane moghlau explained that in the 1960s regions made huge progress because political colossus such as obafemi awolowo nnamdi azikiwe and ahmadu bello had philosophies behind their economic policies with consistency to deliver credible results also head of equity trading planet capital paul uzum said the medium to a long term solution to rising inflation is fiscal discipline that is eliminating the perpetual fiscal deficit there is little the government can do to checkmate imported inflation as long as we operate an open economy and import goods from other countries it will be eliminated within 1 2 years when inflation rates in the world s big economies fall back to their normal one to three per cent range but we need to adopt more fiscal discipline and improve productivity a professor of finance at the university of nigeria nsukka chuke nwude rising insecurity and foreign exchange fx shortage have triggered supply shocks as farmers are forced out of their farms while manufacturing firms cannot optimise their production according to him the consumer price index which is the prime inflation indicator and costs of goods are uptick as a result of these factors it is not surprising that such a level of inflation is occurring the national bureau of statistics nbs is even economical with the truth honestly it should be more than that if accurate inventory is taken we are in a consumer nation we don t produce enough goods which is a challenge our leadership is lame with no plan to resuscitate the ailing economy he said chief executive officer of wyoming capital and partners tajudeen olayinka said the 20 52 per cent inflation rate is an indication that demand side management has failed to tame inflation given the fact that most of the factors responsible for inflation in nigeria are traceable to the supply side factors according to him the supply side factors had been largely unresolved before the imported inflation was worsened by the russia ukraine war he also listed factors impacting negatively on the nation s economy to include fx scarcity mismanagement unending insecurity and limited access to farms other factors according to him are crude oil theft inability to meet opec production quota high cost of raw materials infrastructure deficit and high cost of funding he warned that more nigerians would become extremely poor due to poor purchasing power and heightening unemployment a situation that would further hurt the economy olayinka also belatedly criticized the fiscal authorities describing it as weak with no positive contribution to the performance of the economy other than engaging in excessive borrowing and fiscal rascality which have worsened inflation nigeria s economy is in dire need of drip and blood infusion it will be difficult for cbn s demand side management tools to solve the problem this is not to say cbn is not aware of the possible failure of its demand side management tools or that raising interest rates will not sufficiently address the current inflationary pressure the apex bank must also act to address the possible threat of a reversal of capital flow arising largely from an interest rate hike in europe and america he said olayinka submitted that while the global inflationary threat is dealt with by the more advanced economies nigeria s fiscal authority should search for solutions to some of the self inflicted supply side problems affecting the economy
it s too early for us to be dip buyers many investors who thought inflation had peaked got a rude awakening from tuesday s scorching consumer prices report it battered stocks and sent the s p 500 to its worst week since its june bottom traders are now preparing for another 75 basis point hike with some predicting a 100 basis point increase the benchmark gauge which through mid august had surged as much as 17 per cent from its june low is up just 5 6 per cent in the last three months the cpi report is a game changer said mark newton a technical strategist at fundstrat global advisors and long term bull turned short term bear newton sees the s p 500 bottoming out in mid october advertisement historically the back half of september is one of the most difficult periods for the stock market the s p 500 averages a 0 75 per cent decline in the second part of the month since 1950 according to the stock trader s almanac there are a couple of theories for this investors returning from summer vacations tend to reassess portfolio positioning defensively companies prepare their budgets for the coming year and debate belt tightening and mutual funds often engage in window dressing by selling positions at a loss to reduce the size of their capital gains distributions of course anyone who seeks to divine seasonal patterns for trading convictions does so knowing that past isn t prologue and september has eked out positive returns in recent years still this is another bad omen for a market with few good ones to lure dip buyers and there s little respite ahead as october is the stockmarket s most volatile month since world war ii the average volatility in october is 36 per cent above the average for the other 11 months of the year according to investment research firm cfra one reason is markets tend to struggle in the lead up to midterm elections and this is a midterm year but equities typically post a strong rally into year end after midterms advertisement bear killer beyond the fed meeting stocks will be driven by third quarter earnings this october profits have been better than feared so far but strategists at morgan stanley and bank of america warn that estimates need to be cut much further before equities can find a true low the fed needs to see inflation come down and is headed near its 2 per cent target but we re a long way from that said stephanie lang chief investment officer at homrich berg who recommends being defensively positioned in favour of consumer staples and health care companies yet while october is seen as a spooky month for equities it s also known as a bear killer turning the tide in roughly a dozen post world war ii market slumps according to the stock trader s almanac if history is any guide traders can therefore be forgiven for hoping that month may yet bring the market bottom when investors are very fearful bear markets tend to die said mr newton of fundstrat bloomberg
profitable publicly listed companies have several ways to return excess cash to their shareholders dividend payments are the most common way but a company can also choose to do a stock buyback or a share repurchase there s actually a growing trend among companies in developed equity markets to do stock buybacks as their most favoured form of payouts to their shareholders the trend is also catching up in emerging markets to return money that the companies don t need to finance their operations and investments to their shareholders through buybacks instead of dividend payments in pakistan however only a few companies like netsol maple leaf cement and lucky cement have of late chosen this form of a payout a stock buyback happens when a firm uses some of its excess cash to repurchase its own stock from the marketplace once a company carries share buybacks the break up value of its stock and its profits per outstanding share increase as the total number of its shares goes down corporate profits have doubled yet minority shareholders have not benefited from the share price appreciation and resultant capital gains both stock buybacks and dividend payouts use cash to reward shareholders the key difference between a share repurchase and a dividend payout is that stock buybacks potentially boost the earnings per share eps and book value per share while dividends always dilute the two asim wahab khan chief investment officer at nbp funds argues that it is an ideal time for corporates in pakistan to initiate their stock buyback programmes why so from its peak of 53 127 points in may 2017 the benchmark kse 100 index of the pakistan stock exchange has tumbled by almost a fifth to around 42 500 points in the same period corporate profits have doubled yet the investors or minority shareholders have not benefited from the share price appreciation and resultant capital gains no wonder they are shifting their liquidity to inefficient asset classes with much higher returns in a worst case scenario complete misallocation of capital will halt corporate expansions resulting in a further economic slowdown according to him while lack of public interest due to economic and political uncertainty has been a key reason behind the ailing share market the blame must also be shared by market participants who have failed to generate substantial interest of investors mr khan who has over 16 years of diverse experience in research portfolio management equities and fixed income says in an interview with dawn investors have suffered as they are lured into stocks with artificial volumes and price pumping eventually leading to greed based investment that almost always erodes their savings the biggest loser of this trend and an underperforming shares market in the long run will be the corporate sector and with it the economy of pakistan the listed companies have an excellent opportunity to turn around this dangerous trend while making excellent returns for their shareholders by utilising buybacks mr khan insists that a buyback programme has many advantages for the corporates to begin with it boosts return on equity roe and eps as well as generates value since the cash utilised for buybacks generally yields far lower returns if kept idle in the company for example even with record high interest rates the after tax yield on cash for companies is nearly 11 per cent versus the earnings yield on equities of 23pc which is also higher than the roe of 16 17pc premiums paid on recent mergers and acquisitions askari cement sanofi wyeth karam ceramics and ici morinaga and deep discounts on replacement value all indicate that buybacks can create significant value investors have suffered as they are lured into stocks with artificial volumes and price pumping eventually leading to greed based investment that almost always erodes their savings additionally according to mr khan a buyback signals investors that management is confident in the company s prospects this adds trust improves perception and greatly enhances the company s overall image it gives freedom to the shareholders as those who want to cash out partially or fully can do so by selling their shares to the company buybacks provide huge impetus to price allowing for rights issue offer for sale at premium prices a buyback effectively means re investment in a high return business which boosts shareholders returns investors assign a premium to companies that regularly engage in buybacks because of higher liquidity and reduced risks boosting their share price and reducing their overall cost of capital besides profits earned on cash on the balance sheet entail an effective tax rate of 61pc corporate tax super tax workers profit participation fund tax on dividends a share buyback would save these taxes enhancing after tax returns for its shareholders buybacks also have several advantages for capital markets and in turn the overall economy by encouraging a culture of savings compared to dividends which may not get reinvested and are instead used for consumption points out mr khan further buybacks generate a virtuous cycle which starts with increased liquidity improved investor confidence and perception and reduced risk and cost of capital this means a boost to the stock market attracting further liquidity that can be utilised to fund value added projects especially with the help of initial and secondary offerings with more capital directed towards the efficient asset class companies can expand and grow their businesses generating sustainable economic activity and employment for the masses more liquidity is also ideal for the brokerage industry which primarily relies on market volumes historically dividends were the dominant form of corporate payout in the united states however there has been a structural change in corporate payout policy where buybacks have surpassed cash dividends and have become the dominant form of a corporate payout since 1997 the total amount of buybacks has exceeded the cash dividends paid by us firms while the proportion of companies with share buybacks has increased to 53pc from 28pc during this period after the 2008 financial crisis the buybacks in the us dropped to 86pc of dividends or 205 billion since then they have grown to 876bn or 160pc of the dividends in 2021 in 2022 buybacks are slated to cross 1 trillion in india buybacks have been on a steep rise from 2009 when buybacks stood at 100 million or just 1pc of the dividends paid indian buybacks are up to a whopping 5 6bn or 38pc of the dividends the growth in buybacks in other markets like the uk china turkiye vietnam and the philippines is similar mr khan stresses he argues that the rules and procedures for stock repurchase programmes should be relaxed to encourage companies the securities and exchange commission of pakistan has recently enhanced the buyback period to six months from three months it should allow subsequent buybacks after six months instead of a one year lockdown period this will result in increased flexibility and frequency for corporates engaging in buybacks increasing vibrancy of the capital markets which will further the benefits of buybacks highlighted earlier published in dawn the business and finance weekly september 19th 2022

trial echoing these thoughts study principal investigator michel azizi professor of medicine at université paris cité hôpital européen georges pompidou paris france said the results from radiance ii provide further evidence for urdn as a potential therapy option for hypertension the radiance ii results are strongly consistent across all measures of blood pressure within the study and are also consistent with the prior solo off medication and trio on triple antihypertensive combination treatment trials adding confidence in the treatment effect of the paradise urdn system across a broad spectrum of hypertension severity these results align well with the recent consensus statement from the european society of cardiology supporting the use of renal denervation for treatment of uncontrolled hypertension additionally if these results are maintained over the long term as already shown by the 36 month results of the solo trial and 24 month results of the trio trial the reductions in blood pressure seen in the radiance trials are of a magnitude previously shown in hypertension drug trials to be associated with cardiovascular risk reduction we are thrilled with the results from radiance ii this is further evidence that the paradise urdn system lowers blood pressure in a wide range of patients who are struggling to control their hypertension said recor president

elon musk is a twitter super user he has tweeted more than 19 000 times since joining the platform 13 years ago this year he has tweeted an average of six times a day at least 150 of the posts are about twitter itself according to a washington post analysis musk is locked in an on again off again struggle with the social media company as he tries to back out of a deal he made in april to acquire it for 44 billion about r750bn but some of his tweets make you wonder why he ever wanted it like many twitter users the richest man in the world has a love hate relationship with the platform where he posts memes videos of spacex launches and random musings about life love colonising mars and population collapse unlike most twitter users musk has long noted twitter s problems with spam and bots he has voiced suspicion that many of his 105 million followers are not real people the billionaire is arguing that he should be allowed to call off the purchase because twitter has understated its bot problem musk did not respond to a request for comment what follows are some of musk s most telling tweets about the company he loves twitter he loves it not does musk even like the company he has offered to buy he seems to have struggled with this question for years since joining twitter in 2009 musk has amassed the fifth largest audience on the site surpassing even taylor swift and lady gaga as well as realdonaldtrump in its heyday sometimes musk seems to love twitter and its reach he ll poll his users about its strength as a platform for free speech he ll ask whether they really want an edit button but then he ll get upset about the spam bots or a new emoji the billionaire has also tweeted that he is taking a break from the site most of which were short lived in many ways musk s feed mirrors the roller coaster of emotion experienced by many twitter users one minute he s loving his ability to share his thoughts easily and engage with fans and followers the next he is noting how quickly conversations can become toxic february 5 2017 yeah and twitter is a hater hellscape december 21 2017 i love twitter october 26 2018 on twitter likes are rare criticism is brutal so hardcore it s great july 24 2020 twitter sucks in other ways musk s relationship with twitter is unique after he tweeted in august 2018 that he had funding secured to take tesla his electric car company private at 420 a share the securities and exchange commission sued him for allegedly misleading shareholders how many users have a tweet that cost them 20 million he has long known about the bots in may when musk first signalled that he was hesitant about the twitter deal he blamed twitter s alleged obfuscation about the number of fake bot accounts on the site but his tweets show that he has been aware of the bot problem for years july 11 2018 lots of fake accounts on twitter characterized by high following follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn t wonder why on august 28 2018 he praised twitter s actions to remove fake accounts great actions by twitter to delete bogus accounts will increase usage by real users he has since tweeted about bots more than 10 times january 21 2022 twitter is spending engineering resources on this bs while crypto scammers are throwing a spambot block party in every thread on april 21 a week after he launched his hostile takeover bid he tweeted that twitter had the power to defeat the bot plague if our twitter bid succeeds we will defeat the spam bots or die trying in may musk accused twitter of having no grasp of the problem and when he backed out of the deal in july he accused twitter of having failed or refused to hand over information that would help him determine the true number of bot accounts twitter has long estimated in regulatory filings that fewer than 5 of its monetisable daily users are spam and bots and said that it has provided musk with sufficient information on the issue his free speech concerns are new until last year musk rarely tweeted about twitter s role in guaranteeing freedom of speech march 31 2019 some people use their hair to express themselves i use twitter but since the platform banned former us president donald trump and others in the wake of the january 6 2021 attack on the us capitol he s become increasingly vocal about the idea that twitter is essential to civic discourse on january 11 2021 a few days after twitter banned trump a lot of people are going to be super unhappy with west coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech in march 2022 as musk was buying up a big stake in twitter he unspooled a string of tweets calling on twitter to be politically neutral and to maintain wide access to its site or risk undermining democracy march 26 given that twitter serves as the de facto public town square failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy what should be done a month later after he agreed to buy twitter musk said he would restore trump to the platform twitter has become kind of the de facto town square so it s just really important that people have both the reality and the perception that they are able to speak freely within the bounds of the law he said in an april ted interview other tweets from that month april 25 i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means april 26 by free speech i simply mean that which matches the law i am against censorship that goes far beyond the law if people want less free speech they will ask government to pass laws to that effect therefore going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people april 27 for twitter to deserve public trust it must be politically neutral which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally he has used twitter against itself this spring musk s nearly 10 stake in twitter transformed him from user to a minority owner overnight as his campaign to buy the company unfolded he used twitter itself to shape public perception of the deal april 9 most of these top accounts tweet rarely and post very little content is twitter dying april 14 if the current twitter board takes actions contrary to shareholder interests they would be breaching their fiduciary duty the liability they would thereby assume would be titanic in scale may 13 twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5 of users may 17 20 fake spam accounts while 4 times what twitter claims could be much higher my offer was based on twitter s sec filings being accurate yesterday twitter s ceo publicly refused to show proof of 5 this deal cannot move forward until he does sometimes his tweets were confusing the same week he revealed his big stake in the company he tweeted that twitter might be dead the next day twitter revealed he wouldn t be joining the board after all sometimes his tweets seemed like satire his offer price for twitter was 54 20 a share causing speculation that it was an inside joke the number 420 is linked to marijuana more importantly he used twitter to get his message across he egged on twitter shareholders when it appeared the board might reject his offer then in may he tweeted that the deal was on hold at the time the stock market was tanking along with musk s personal wealth he continued to tweet doubts about the company particularly allegations that its user base was riddled with bots until finally attempting to call the deal off in july the saga is scheduled to culminate in october in delaware chancery court where twitter has sued musk to force him to complete the purchase some of musk s tweets could play a role in the trial did twitter mislead musk or does his tweeting history suggest that musk has had a strong understanding of the platform s strengths and weaknesses all along

by virtu financial introduction the conditional order type is a useful and efficient tool for sourcing block liquidity in this paper we seek to provide more clarity on conditional order function and the benefits in the context of a block seeking algorithmic order although conditional orders are widely used in north america and europe for seeking block liquidity the asia pacific apac region has been slower to adopt however apac buy side traders are increasingly requesting that sell side providers add the conditional order type to their order routers leading to interesting implications for liquidity seeking algorithms as well as the venues that accept conditional orders while interest in conditional orders is growing the order type is often misunderstood both in terms of its application and how it interacts in electronic block crossing networks this paper explains how virtu s frontier execution algorithms 1 use conditional orders and looks at how they interact with human users in virtu s block indications network posit alert 2 conditional order definition and reference terminology the practicality of the conditional order type is to enable an order router to submit an uncommitted order to a venue that accepts the conditional order type the conditional order is not a firm order if contra liquidity exists a message is sent to the conditional order submitter requesting to send a firm up order if both parties send firm up orders and the firm up orders are marketable with each other a match can occur conditional order an uncommitted order that is not a firm order and will not execute if contra liquidity exists a message to submit a firm up order is sent conditional orders allow a user s order to rest in full size at multiple venues conditional venue a venue that accepts or uses the conditional order type firm up request message a message that is sent in response to a conditional order signifying contra liquidity exists firm up order upon receiving a firm up request message the routing broker can send a firm up order to the conditional venue the firm up order will contain the number of shares the user wishes to execute execution report message in response to a firm up order this message will contain execution details from the conditional venue conditional router a broker s smart order router which includes conditional orders in some cases brokers use both firm and conditional order types in their smart order routers the below conditional order terminology will be referenced throughout this paper these terms and their associated workflows are depicted in exhibit 1 exhibit 1 conditional order workflow source virtu financial 2021 conditional order usage and questions the primary benefit of the conditional order type is to help solve the liquidity fragmentation problem by enabling routing brokers to rest their full size orders at a conditional venue while executing smaller firm orders on other venues if a contra block order is available on the conditional venue the conditional routing broker can cancel its outstanding firm orders and firm up with a block sized quantity at the conditional venue conditional order types can help improve an execution algorithm s ability to seek block liquidity and achieve larger execution sizes relative to algorithms that do not employ conditional orders in the us and europe buy side institutions have driven the growth in conditional order usage by shifting a portion of their block liquidity seeking order flow away from blotter scraping desktop applications to algorithms that incorporate conditional orders consequently most large broker dealers in the us and europe incorporate conditional orders in their order routing logic and many venues in the us and europe support conditional order matching this move has resulted in a divergence in the liquidity makeup in virtu s posit alert block indications system by region where conditional liquidity electronic users makes up the majority of the resulting executed volume in the us and europe while in apac potential liquidity coming from the posit alert desktop application users human users still makes up the majority of indications and resulting executed volume see exhibit 2 exhibit 2 global posit liquidity alert breakdown by participant type as the level of interest in conditional orders increases in the apac region so have the number of questions on how conditional orders function specifically on topics such as information leakage prior to execution the remainder of this paper explains how conditional orders interact in virtu s posit alert block indications system and how virtu s liquidity seeking algorithms utilize conditional orders in their routing conditional order interaction in posit alert posit alert is one of two venues in the apac region that currently accepts conditional orders conditional orders routed to posit alert can interact with other conditional orders electronic users and orders originating from users who use the posit alert front end application human users conditional order does not interact with firm orders in posit posit alert accepts conditional orders in all 12 apac markets 3 the system supports when posit alert identifies a potential match between an electronic user and a human user only the human user is sent a message that contra liquidity is available via a pop up window on their desktop termed as light up no information is sent to the electronic user the human user is then given 30 seconds to respond to the light up by submitting a firm up order if the human user fails to act or declines to send a firm up order then no match takes place and the electronic user never receives any information that a potential matching opportunity existed if the human user responds with a firm up order by clicking the send button only then will the electronic user receive a message to route a firm up order the firm up request message posit alert sends to the electronic user is anonymous and contains no information on the human user s total order size or the size the human user firmed up with the electronic user has two seconds to respond with a firm up order for potential matches between two electronic users posit alert will route firm up request messages to both users simultaneously again the message is anonymous and no information related to contra order size is included in the messages sent to the electronic user each electronic user will then have two seconds to respond with a firm up order how virtu seeks liquidity using conditional orders virtu believes that in order to achieve optimal execution for clients our algorithms need to be connected to multiple liquidity sources as well as utilize the variety of available order types whilst internalization via executions in posit is a byproduct of our algorithm s trading internalization is not the objective for that misses the mark in terms of satisfying the execution objectives of our clients in apac virtu s frontier execution algorithms will leverage conditional orders in all available conditional venues where appropriate particularly when using covert 4 oasis 5 catch 6 strategies virtu generally will route a parent order s full order size as a conditional order type to all conditional venues while working smaller child orders in both non displayed venues and lit exchanges if the algorithm receives a conditional firm up request message from a venue e g posit alert the algorithm will first cancel all outstanding firm orders which is done to determine how many shares to route to posit alert in the firm up order as well as to ensure that the router does not overfill the client s parent order once the algorithm receives all cancel acknowledgments back on its firm orders a firm up order is routed to posit alert with a quantity that generally equals the remaining share balance of the parent order if the algorithm receives a partial fill the residual quantity will be re indicated into posit alert while new firm orders are sent to other venues exhibit 3 below illustrates an example of the order routing sequence virtu s algorithms use for conditional order interaction exhibit 3 conditional order example viewed through virtu s proprietary market data replay tool conclusion the conditional order type is a useful and efficient tool for sourcing block liquidity from the perspective of posit alert conditional orders provide a unique and differentiated source of block liquidity to posit alert s human users in terms of concerns around information leakage the electronic user of a conditional order does not receive information on contra order interest until the human user commits and sends a firm order in fact human users in posit alert receive the firm up request message before electronic users of contra conditional orders from the perspective of virtu s algorithms conditional orders provide a means of helping to manage market fragmentation by increasing the probability of achieving block fills in posit alert while minimizing opportunity cost by remaining in the market with firm orders in numerous venues end notes 1 frontier execution algorithms virtu s global and comprehensive suite of single stock portfolio and pairs strategies combine the firm s execution technology with access to liquidity from a wide array of sources to help solve for the execution objectives of our clients 2 posit alert virtu s global block indications network posit alert delivers block liquidity to subscribers in 38 countries posit

press release no 5 2022 zealand pharma presents data from phase 3 trial of dasiglucagon in congenital hyperinsulinism at the 60th annual espe meeting dasiglucagon significantly reduced the requirement for intravenous glucose to maintain glycemia in newborns and infants with chi part 1 of phase 3 trial dasiglucagon reduced time in hypoglycemia and enabled discontinuation of intravenous glucose in most infants and limited the need for pancreatectomy part 2 of phase 3 trial results support the potential for dasiglucagon to be a novel effective and well tolerated treatment for infants with chi dependent on intravenous glucose copenhagen dk and boston ma u s september 19 2022 zealand pharma a s cvr no 20045078 a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of innovative peptide based medicines today announced that clinical results from the two part phase 3 trial of dasiglucagon for the treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism chi in newborns and infants up to 12 months of age were presented at the 60th annual european society for paediatric endocrinology espe meeting held in rome september 15 17 2022 topline results from part 1 of the trial were previously announced in may 2022 company announcement no 22 2022 children with chi can experience significant and permanent neurologic complications as a result of hypoglycemia and many infants are dependent on intravenous glucose and in some cases require pancreatectomy to maintain euglycemia i am encouraged by the results from part 1 of this phase 3 study demonstrating that dasiglucagon treatment resulted in a significant reduction in glucose infusion rate and to see this trend continue in part 2 in which the majority of infants could reduce or in many cases be weaned off of iv glucose infusion and also avoid pancreatectomy said diva d de león crutchlow m d m s c e chief of the division of endocrinology and diabetes and director of the congenital hyperinsulinism center at children s hospital of philadelphia and a study principal investigator though congenital hyperinsulinism is an incredibly challenging disease to manage the efficacy and safety of dasiglucagon observed in this phase 3 trial support its potential as a new treatment option for children with chi we are very pleased to present the compelling results from the phase 3 study of dasiglucagon in newborns and infants up to 12 months of age at espe 2022 this study deepens our understanding of dasiglucagon s potential as an innovative treatment for chi patients said david kendall m d chief medical officer of zealand pharma zealand is committed to addressing the unmet needs of children living with chi and we look forward to engaging with regulatory authorities and submitting a new drug application for dasiglucagon in 2023 the abstracts of the oral presentations are available at eurospe org and the data are summarized as follows title dasiglucagon significantly reduces requirement for intravenous glucose in children with congenital hyperinsulinism ages 7 days to 12 months authors diva d de leon indraneel banerjee david m kendall sune birch eva bøge jelena ivkovic paul s thornton presentation highlights in part 1 of the phase 3 trial dasiglucagon significantly reduced the requirement for intravenous iv glucose to maintain glycemia in neonates and infants with chi and reduced glucose requirements to levels that potentially allow for discontinuation of iv glucose support dasiglucagon significantly reduced the mean iv glucose infusion rate gir in the last 12 hours of the 48 hour treatment period by 55 as compared to placebo 4 3 mg kg min for dasiglucagon and 9 4 mg kg min for placebo with a treatment difference of 5 2 mg kg min p 0 0037 dasiglucagon also reduced gir over the entire 48 hour treatment period by 3 5 mg kg min compared to placebo p 0 0107 dasiglucagon treatment resulted in a reduction of 31 g day in total carbohydrate intake iv and gastric compared to placebo 107 g day for dasiglucagon vs 138 g day for placebo p 0 024 a 22 reduction in carbohydrate calories dasiglucagon was observed to be well tolerated in part 1 of the trial with skin reactions and gastrointestinal disturbances as the most frequently reported adverse events no serious adverse events reported title dasiglucagon treatment over 21 days in infants with congenital hyperinsulinism results in glycaemic stability and reduces requirement for intravenous glucose authors indraneel banerjee diva d de leon david m kendall sune birch eva bøge jelena ivkovic paul s thornton presentation highlights in the 21 day open label part 2 of the phase 3 trial continuous subcutaneous infusion of dasiglucagon in infants with chi reduced iv glucose requirements time in hypoglycaemia and enabled discontinuation of iv glucose in most infants obviating the need for subtotal pancreatectomy for glycaemic stability dasiglucagon enabled reduction and either periodic or permanent discontinuation of iv glucose infusion in 10 out of 12 infants seven infants who did not require pancreatectomy were completely weaned off iv glucose at the completion of the trial during the 21 day treatment with dasiglucagon continuous glucose monitoring cgm measures of hypoglycaemia trended lower with median time 70 mg dl reduced from 7 0 to 5 2 and 54 mg dl reduced from 1 9 to 0 88 there was no increase in hyperglycaemia the safety profile of dasiglucagon in part 2 was consistent with part 1 with no adverse event requiring discontinuation of treatment and no serious adverse events reported about the phase 3 trial the phase 3 trial 17103 was designed to investigate the potential for chronic dasiglucagon infusion delivered subcutaneously via a pump to prevent hypoglycemia in newly diagnosed children with chi who are dependent on intravenous glucose the trial was conducted in two parts part 1 was a double blind placebo controlled two period crossover with treatment periods of 48 hours each part 2 was an open label single arm study of dasiglucagon treatment for an additional 21 days the primary objective of the overall trial was to reduce or eliminate the need for intensive hospital treatment reduce the frequency of dangerously low blood glucose hypoglycemia and the need for constant feeding and to potentially delay or eliminate the need for pancreatectomy clinicaltrials gov nct04172441 about chi

video link children s health defense chd 1 produced and published a comprehensive and interesting resource for parents and families about childhood vaccines while many people are currently focused on an experimental jab using genetic material the chd presents documented evidence in vaccine secrets some of it from the federal government that our children have been vaccine guinea pigs for decades they present the data in short chapter videos that are less than two minutes each or if you prefer you can watch the whole video in less than 25 minutes in it you ll find answers to more than a dozen questions about the vaccines your child gets that may very well surprise if not shock you first a bit of background the first u s shots for covid 19 were given in december 2020 to health care workers in new york 2 in the short 20 months that followed a lot has been learned about the jabs and the adverse effects that have devastated those who have taken them the sheer number of adults and children affected is dramatically higher than in any year since the vaccine adverse event reporting system vaers began recording events in 1990 3 as of august 12 2022 there have been over 1 3 million adverse event reports after the covid jab 4 including over 30 000 deaths and over 56 000 individuals who are now permanently disabled the pandemic has demonstrated that many physicians were unaware of the existence of vaers which is comanaged by the cdc and fda 5 in the past the system s intended use had been to detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse event reporting that might indicate a possible safety problem with a vaccine 6 however it s apparent as the fda cdc and other public health agencies ignore the number of reports following the covd jab that the system may be recording damage but the public health officials are ignoring it as you consider the documented evidence presented by the chd it begs the question since the damage and devastation from the covid shot is obviously being ignored by public health officials how long have they been ignoring vaccine damage in our most vulnerable according to chd and the national vaccine information center nvic it s been going on for decades factors involved in vaccine safety there s no question the number of vaccinations required for children just to enter school has jumped dramatically from the 1970s to the present time according to the children s hospital of philadelphia 7 the number of vaccines increased from four in the 1940s to seven in the 1970s and then to 14 by 2020 but according to chd 8 that vaccine schedule includes 50 shots by age 6 and 69 shots by age 18 when you add all the antigens the weakened or inactive microbes of the diseases that trigger an immune response9 to the adjuvants foreign substances added to a vaccine to help the antigens create a stronger immune response10 you have a staggering amount of foreign substances being pumped into your child over a very relatively short period of time as chd points out some children appear able to handle this but many do not which leads to another factor how vaccine safety is tested and proved unfortunately while you may think that independent research tests and supports safety this is not true actually that s all done by the vaccine manufacturers themselves according to the fda 11 before the fda licenses approves a vaccine the vaccine is tested extensively by its manufacturer fda scientists and medical professionals carefully evaluate all the available information about the vaccine to determine its safety and effectiveness when you read the last line you ll notice they evaluate all available information as the chd points out this does not include all the information from testing let s consider the current release of pfizer documents that were used to approve comirnaty the pfizer covid 19 jab 12 operation rescue13 reported the data revealed that 270 pregnant women were vaccinated and a large percentage 238 88 of those were not followed up this lack of follow up is concerning since the data also showed that 124 of the 270 had some adverse reaction to the shot 75 were serious and 49 were nonserious the outcome of only 34 pregnancies was recorded and 28 of those babies died in utero or at birth of the 34 pregnancies only one was recorded as normal and five were recorded in pfizer data as pending 14 this is the data that the fda used to determine that the shot was safe for pregnant women yet the data show that from 82 to 97 of the documented outcomes resulted in death this demonstrates that even when the fda has the data the results of the analysis that leads to the statement safe and effective 15 are questionable when the fda approves shots based on this flawed data you must ask yourself how bad are the data big pharma is hiding vaccines do not reliably prevent disease but do spread it another point the chd makes is that data demonstrate that vaccines do not reliably prevent disease not only that vaccinated people can and do spread the diseases against which they re vaccinated if you need a current example consider the covid shot which the cdc acknowledged is not effective for disease prevention 16 cdc s covid 19 prevention recommendations no longer differentiate based on a person s vaccination status because breakthrough infections occur though they are generally mild and persons who have had covid 19 but are not vaccinated have some degree of protection against severe illness from their previous infection the film goes on to show several examples of vaccinated people who got the disease they were vaccinated against for example measles statistics from the cdc17 showed up to 30 of measles cases in 2019 were in people who were vaccinated against measles the chd cites four more cases in which researchers documented measles in individuals who were vaccinated 18 unfortunately although vaccines are supposed to protect vulnerable people those who receive certain vaccines can spread the diseases in a process called shedding according to the cdc 19 individuals given a live attenuated influenza vaccine can shed the virus and spread the illness the chd20 also notes other viruses that can shed or spread after vaccination include measles rubella chickenpox rotavirus and shingles disease decline not related to vaccines probably just as important as the fact that the vaccines are not always safe do not always protect against the disease and may cause shedding and spreading of the illness is that government data show the vaccine program does not deserve the credit for alleviating problems in the u s against contagious diseases in fact when you look at the data it s apparent that public health experts have lied about the importance of the vaccine program as demonstrated by chd data from the national vital statistics system nvss 21 which is overseen by the cdc unequivocably show that improvements in hygiene and clean drinking water triggered the decline in mortality from these diseases before the vaccines were even introduced vaccines are big business in 2009 the globe and mail22 looked at the growth of the vaccine industry and how the h5n1 bird flu contributed to the growth of the flu vaccine industry which soared 32 every year between 2004 and 2007 at the time experts estimated the global vaccine industry would top 40 billion by 2012 in 2022 fortune business insights23 released data from 2020 and estimated the global vaccine market at 55 44 billion before covid 19 shots were introduced they then projected the market would grow to 61 04 billion in 2021 and 125 49 billion by 2028 with an estimated compound annual growth rate of 10 8 the largest contributor of which would be the covid 19 shot the market analysis called this stellar growth in march 202124 pfizer reported they expected sales of the covid jab to total 15 billion by the end of the year with a profit margin of 30 however by 2022 they had far exceeded expectations according to poynter 25 moderna reported first quarter earnings in 2022 that were more than triple the same period the last year earning 5 9 billion in just one quarter this was dwarfed by pfizer s first quarter earnings in 2022 that grew 77 to more than 25 billion compared to the same period in the previous year according to cnbc 26 this growth was driven by 13 2 billion in sales of the covid shot in one quarter compared to the 15 billion in annual sales they estimated for 2021 the chd27 points out that in one year merck sold 3 15 billion worth of gardasil fierce pharma28 reported sales of gardasil increased by 31 in the first quarter of 2019 after launching the product in china merck executives called this unprecedented note that gardasil has yet to demonstrate that it s prevented a single case of cancer why to prove its effectiveness against cancer merck would have had to wait roughly 35 years or more between giving the shot to young females and age 50 when the average woman develops cervical cancer but they didn t do that because they said studying cancer itself isn t feasible because it takes too long 29 when you understand that merck having to wait 35 years for a true efficacy finding would cost 3 billion a year in sales over that 35 years or about 105 billion total it becomes plain that it s all about the money not safety or efficacy who says vaccines aren t big business the chd also notes the revolving door between health authorities and big pharma dr julie gerberding was the director of the cdc when gardasil was approved the chd writes 30 her move from the cdc to merck significantly increased her income apparently she went from about 172 000 in salary to around 25 million in compensation from stock sales at merck and cern vaccines make billions of dollars for corporations and millions of dollars for some lucky insiders if they weren t such gravy trains do you really think they would be pushed so hard parents must make health decisions these are just a few of the highlights from this incredibly informative video you also discover what the pharmaceutical industry uses for their control in testing vaccines in children and it isn t a placebo the chd also discusses the many dangerous ingredients that are included in manufacturing vaccines including bird virus and pig virus fragments additionally they discuss the pitiful compensation process and remuneration that victims receive after being injured if they are among the lucky few whose injuries are compensated what this all shows is how imperative it is for parents to do their due

new york ap the buck isn t stopping the value of the u s dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the british pound across the atlantic to the south korean won across the pacific after rising again friday the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against a key index measuring six major currencies including the euro and japanese yen many professional investors don t expect it to ease off anytime soon the dollar s rise affects nearly everyone even those who will never leave the u s borders here s a look at what s driving the u s dollar higher and what it can mean for investors and households what does it mean to say the dollar is stronger essentially that one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before consider the japanese yen a year ago 1 could get a little less than 110 yen now it can buy 143 that s about 30 more and one of the biggest moves the u s dollar has made against another currency foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world the u s dollar index which measures the dollar against the euro yen and other major currencies has climbed more than 14 this year the gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments most of which have had a dismal year u s stocks are down more than 19 bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7 why is the dollar strengthening because the u s economy is doing better than others even though inflation is high the u s job market has remained remarkably solid and other areas of the economy such as the services sector have been resilient that s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low that in turn has traders expecting the federal reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply and to hold them there a while in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years such expectations have helped the yield of a 10 year treasury more than double to 3 44 from roughly 1 33 a year ago who cares about bond yields investors who want to make more income off their money and those juicier u s yields are drawing investors from all over the world other central banks have been less aggressive than the fed because their economies seem to be more fragile the european central bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever three quarters of a percentage point but the fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year with a third expected this upcoming week some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible following a hotter than expected report on u s inflation tuesday partly because of that less aggressive bent 10 year bonds across europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than u s treasurys such as germany s 1 75 and japan s 0 25 when investors from asia and europe buy treasurys they have to trade their own currencies for u s dollars that pushes up the dollar s value a strong dollar helps u s tourists right yes u s travelers in tokyo spending 10 000 yen on dinner will be using 23 fewer dollars than a year ago for the same priced meal with the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the argentine peso to the egyptian pound to the south korean won the dollar is going further in many countries than before does it help only rich people who can afford to travel abroad no a stronger dollar also helps u s shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation when the dollar is rising against the euro for example european companies make more euros on each 1 of sales with that cushion they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros they could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros or they could find some balance of the two prices for imports fell 1 in august from a month earlier following july s 1 5 drop offering some relief amid the nation s high inflation prices for imported fruits nuts and some peels dropped 8 7 for example they re down 3 from a year earlier a stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally that s because oil gold and others are bought and sold in u s dollars around the world when the dollar rises against the yen a japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before that can mean less upward pressure on oil prices so there are only winners from a strong dollar no u s companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed at mcdonald s revenue fell 3 during the summer from a year earlier but if the dollar s value had simply stayed put against other currencies the company s revenue would have been 3 higher microsoft meanwhile said changes in foreign currency values sliced 595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter a string of other companies have given similar warnings recently and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits companies in the s p 500 index get roughly 40 of their revenue from outside the united states according to factset any other collateral damage a strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in u s dollar terms instead of in their own currencies when they must repay their debts in u s dollars while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day it can create lots of stress where s the dollar heading from here the dollar s biggest moves may be behind it but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while tuesday s report on u s inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected that has traders upping bets for fed rate hikes going into next year fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high until the job is done in breaking the nation s high inflation even if it damages economic growth that bias toward still higher rates by the fed should continue to offer support for the value of the u s dollar for the dollar to weaken meaningfully strategists wrote in a bofa global research report the fed has to get more concerned about growth than inflation and we are not there yet copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed follow

former state sen george logan a republican from ansonia speaks during opening session at the state capitol wednesday jan 4 2017 national republicans are optimistic logan will finally be the gop candidate who can win connecticut s 5th congressional district seat which hasn t been held by a republican since 2006 the seat is now held by two term democratic u s rep jahana hayes ap photo jessica hill file rep jahana hayes d conn chairwoman of the house subcommittee on nutrition joins rep rosa delauro d conn the house appropriations committee chairwoman left and speaker of the house nancy pelosi d calif at a news conference as house democrats unveil a 28 million emergency spending bill to address the shortage of infant formula in the united states at the capitol in washington tuesday may 17 2022 ap photo j scott applewhite in a race that has gained national attention u s rep jahana hayes and republican challenger george logan are locked in potentially the state s closest congressional battle of the year hayes a two term democratic incumbent is trying to combat the challenge from logan as republicans predict that a red wave is coming republicans have been anticipating the november midterm elections hoping to capitalize on democratic president joe biden s sluggish poll ratings and the highest inflation rate in the past four decades but democrats have been working to curb the wave by criticizing the u s supreme court s landmark decision on abortion the tightness of the 5th district race was shown by an internal national republican poll in july that pegged the battle at a 45 45 tie but hayes disputes that as an overestimation because other polls have shown hayes with a slight lead as the race enters the final 50 days republicans have touted logan in the category of a young gun in a nationally targeted race that they are trying to win hayes too has captured the attention of the democratic congressional campaign committee which is trying to hold the party s slight majority in the u s house and keep nancy pelosi as house speaker the respected fivethirtyeight website originally described the battle as a tossup but now predicts that hayes is favored to win based on various polling and other data i want to help remove nancy pelosi as speaker of the house logan said in an interview i want to go down to washington to work across the aisle to work with democrats and republicans to solve our common problems inflation crime education the opioid epidemic we need to secure our southern borders we need to support law enforcement there is so much to do and right now i just don t believe that my opponent incumbent congresswoman jahana hayes is representing our district as well as it should be i believe i can do a better job you cannot vote 100 in line with nancy pelosi and then turn around and tell us you are in line with the district but hayes dismissed the concerns saying she will push her accomplishments that include voting for gun safety lowering prescription drug prices helping veterans improving transportation infrastructure pushing for climate change improvements funding law enforcement and providing cities and towns with federal funding to recover from the coronavirus pandemic i don t think that nancy pelosi is the bogeyman that they think she is hayes told the courant in an interview i have a record that stands alone without nancy pelosi the republicans have this fascination with nancy pelosi when they have some house cleaning themselves to do they have a former president who is literally on the verge of indictment and many of the republican leaders in congress kevin mccarthy the minority leader didn t want to certify the election i am running on my record the work that i ve done as a female democratic member of congress hayes has sometimes been linked to rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york and other members of the squad a four member group of young often outspoken members of congress hayes posed for a photo on the cover of rolling stone magazine in 2019 with aoc rep ilhan omar of minnesota and pelosi with the headline of women shaping the future in congress but hayes doesn t take kindly to the association roping me into the squad trying to attach me to other people that s the way you run a campaign when you have no issues to stand on hayes said the only reason that i m labeled as she s a part of the squad is because i m a black woman joe courtney has a record that s even more progressive than me rosa delauro has a record that s even more progressive than me but i ve never heard anyone say joe courtney is a member of the squad i ve never heard it he votes like a democrat on a lot of the very same issues the controversial subject of abortion has arisen repeatedly in the race logan has blasted television commercials that say he is against abortion in fact he says he supports abortion rights i believe in a woman s right to choose logan said i am not extreme in my point of view when it comes to parental notification or a woman s right to choose the ads have been broadcast by the democratic congressional campaign committee rather than directly by the hayes campaign but logan says he sees no difference for me they are one and the same logan said she hasn t said a word about the falseness of the ads talk about completely blatant lies and she has nothing to say about it on my stance on a woman s right to choose that s what i m talking about she is fully in lockstep with what they re doing ask her yourself but hayes responded that her campaign is prevented from coordinating with the dccc as an outside group clearly mr logan doesn t know how a federal campaign works hayes said i had no input on the dccc ads i saw them the same time as everyone else i have nothing to do with the dccc on abortion i have always been of the opinion that it is between a woman and her doctor it should not be up to government officials protecting that right to privacy is something that i have stood firm on when i had the chance to vote for that with the women s reproductive health act in congress i voted for it a self described moderate republican and fiscal conservative logan was part of the bipartisan coalition in the state legislature in 2017 that pushed for spending and bonding caps that have led to connecticut s record rainy day fund for fiscal emergencies the law passed that year provided triggers that forced the legislature to place money into the rainy day fund rather than spending it if personal income taxes from wall street stock and bond gains exceeded certain levels as a fiscal conservative logan voted in the senate in 2019 against creating the state s paid family and medical leave program that requires payroll deductions to fund the initiative he also voted against raising the minimum wage and voted against various spending measures pushed by democratic govs dannel p malloy and ned lamont but democrats are skeptical of logan being a moderate senate president pro tem martin looney a new haven democrat said that logan talked about having independent views but ended up voting with his fellow republicans during four years in the state senate sen logan was somewhat of a changeable figure when he served in the state senate in many cases talking about some more moderate positions but in the end voting with the rest of his caucus when the chips were down looney a liberal democrat said in an interview he would vote with his caucus on most issues logan defeated 12 term democratic incumbent sen joe crisco of woodbridge in 2016 which led to an 18 18 tie in the senate he then won in a tight race in a recount in 2018 before losing to democrat jorge cabrera in a rematch in 2020 logan republicans say is their best candidate in the 5th district since then state sen andrew w roraback of goshen lost in a close race to democrat elizabeth esty in 2012 roraback won 31 of the 41 towns in the district but he lost as esty took huge margins in democratic strongholds like new britain meriden waterbury and danbury hayes won elections in 2018 and 2020 by 12 points each time including victories twice in new britain democrats have seen a major trend in their favor in the 5th district a one time republican stronghold where democrats have dominated since a young chris murphy defeated longtime republican u s rep nancy johnson in a major upset in 2006 since then democrats have grown increasingly strong across the district where hillary clinton and biden defeated republican donald trump in both 2016 and 2020 besides new britain the sprawling 41 town district includes the farmington valley and virtually all of litchfield county to the new york and massachusetts borders republicans say they will perform well in races statewide but democrats disagree having won all congressional and governor s races since 2006 the last connecticut republican in congress was u s rep chris shays of bridgeport who lost in 2008 after more than two decades in washington a key city is new britain where republican mayor erin stewart has won a record breaking five consecutive terms in a pro union city where democrats hold a 6 to 1 advantage in voter registration despite those odds republicans also made gains last year on the school board and reached a super majority on the city council national republicans have not opened an office in connecticut in the past officials said showing their intent to capitalize in november on biden s low poll ratings republican national committee chairwoman ronna romney mcdaniel traveled to new britain recently for the second time in the past six months to rally the troops and echo logan s message in reaching out to minority voters as i stand here the day before the start of hispanic heritage month it s an exciting time here in the 5th district when we celebrate all cultures all folks all different ways of thinking different backgrounds logan said i am proud to stand here in new britain connecticut usa as the son of guatemalan immigrants who came to this country to live the american dream and today i stand here as your nominee for congress the u s house of representatives isn t america great this is what it s all about one of the criticisms of hayes over her four years in congress has been that she is often difficult to reach and has not made a sustained high profile presence in the sprawling district that stretches from simsbury to the new york and massachusetts borders state republican chairman ben proto said that the spanish speaking logan is making inroads on the campaign trail we re hearing very bad things about jahana hayes mostly from democrats she s nowhere to be found proto said she s not showing up anywhere we don t know what she is doing which has kind of been the knock on jahana for a long time i will give george his credit he is everywhere if there is a fair he s there he connects very well within the total district but the hispanic portion of the district in particular he has the ability to go in and talk with them on their issues in their language in a way they understand better than we ve ever been able to do before but hayes rejected the notion that she is aloof and often invisible in the district i only hear it from people like ben proto and when there s a campaign hayes said i can tell you what constituents say there are parts of this district where i m told i m the only person that visits frequently i have helped people in every part of the district i went into communities that had never seen their congressperson i guess i m flattered that mr proto pays so much attention to me but i m doing the work of a legislator i am in d c i am in the district i m running an official office i m just keeping my head down and doing the work i trust that the people who have been touched by this office will show up on nov 8
a us grouping constituted around the thought of the philosopher leo strauss controls from now on both the secretariat of defense and the secretariat of state after having organized many wars since those of yugoslavia they imagined the one in ukraine it is now manipulating the european union and is preparing to deprive it of energy sources if european leaders do not open their eyes their alliance with washington will lead to the collapse of the union s economy there is no point in believing that europeans will be spared because they are developed the straussians wrote as early as 1992 that they would not hesitate to destroy germany and the eu beginning in 1949 the german jewish philosopher leo strauss taught at the university of chicago he soon formed a small group of jewish disciples from among his students he taught them orally which was quite different from his writings according to him the democracies had shown their inability to protect the jews from the nazi final solution to prevent this tragedy from happening again and the hammer from falling on them his disciples had to be on the other side of the handle he advised them to build their own dictatorship organizing his followers leo strauss called them his hoplites soldiers of sparta he trained them to disrupt the classes of some of his fellow teachers several of the members of this sect have held very high positions in the united states and israel the operation and ideology of this grouping were the subject of controversy after the attacks of september 11 2001 an abundant literature has opposed the supporters and opponents of the philosopher however the facts are indisputable anti semitic authors have wrongly lumped together straussians jewish communities in the diaspora and the state of israel however the ideology of leo strauss was never discussed in the jewish world before 9 11 from a sociological point of view it is a sectarian phenomenon not at all representative of jewish culture however in 2003 benjamin netanyahu s revisionist zionists made a pact with the us straussians in the presence of other israeli leaders this alliance was never made public one of the characteristics of this group is that they are ready for anything for example they wanted to return iraq to the stone age this is indeed what they did for them all sacrifices are possible including for themselves as long as they remain the first not the best the first in 1992 an advisor to the secretary of defense the straussian paul wolfowitz wrote the defense planning guidance it was the first official us document reflecting the thinking of leo strauss wolfowitz was introduced to strauss thought by the american philosopher allan bloom a friend of the frenchman raymond aron but he himself only briefly knew the master at the end of his teaching in chicago however the us ambassador to the un jeane kirkpatrick recognized him as one of the great straussian figures in the context of the dissolution of the soviet union wolfowitz developed a strategy to maintain us hegemony over the entire rest of the world the defense planning guidance should have remained confidential but the new york times revealed its main lines and published extracts three days later the washington post revealed further details in the end the original text was never made public but a version edited by the secretary of defense and future vice president dick cheney was circulated it is known that the original document was based on a series of meetings in which two other people all three straussian participated andrew marshall the pentagon s thinker who was replaced three years after his death by arthur cebrowski albert wohlstetter the thinker of the atomic deterrence strategy and his son in law richard perle the future director of the defense policy board the defense planning guidance was written by a student of wohlstetter zalmay khalilzad future ambassador to the un the document speaks of a new world order ultimately supported by the united states in which the sole superpower would only have temporary alliances depending on the conflict the un and even nato would be increasingly sidelined more broadly the wolfowitz doctrine theorizes the need for the united states to block the emergence of any potential competitor to u s hegemony especially advanced industrial nations such as germany and japan particularly targeted is the european union while the united states supports the european integration project we must be careful to prevent the emergence of a purely european security system that would undermine nato and particularly its integrated military command structure the europeans will thus be asked to include in the maastricht treaty a clause subordinating their defense policy to that of nato while the pentagon report recommends the integration of the new central and eastern european states into the european union while giving them the benefit of a military agreement with the united states that would protect them against a possible russian attack for thirty years this document has been patiently implemented the maastricht treaty includes a paragraph 4 in title v article j4 which stipulates the policy of the union within the meaning of this article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states and shall respect the obligations of certain member states under the north atlantic treaty and be compatible with the common security and defence policy established within that framework these provisions have been included in the various texts up to article 42 of the treaty on european union the former warsaw pact member states have almost all joined the european union this decision was a choice imposed by washington and announced by secretary of state james baker just before the european council meeting that endorsed it in 2000 paul wolfowitz was together with zbignew brzezinki the main speaker at a large ukrainian us symposium in washington organized by ukrainian integral nationalists who had taken refuge in the usa there he pledged to support independent ukraine to provoke russia to go to war with it and ultimately to finance the destruction of the resurgent rival of the usa these commitments were implemented with the passage of the ukraine democracy defense lend lease act of 2022 on april 28 2022 ukraine is now exempt from all arms control procedures including end use certificates very expensive weapons are leased by the usa to the eu to defend ukraine when the war is over the europeans will have to pay for what they have consumed and the bill will be heavy although the european elites have benefited from their alliance with the united states so far they should not be surprised that the united states is now trying to destroy them under the defense planning guidance they have already seen what washington was capable of after the 9 11 attacks paul wolfowitz forbade countries that had expressed reservations about the war such as germany and france to conclude contracts for the reconstruction of iraq at present the rise in the price of energy sources and their increasing scarcity threaten not only the heating and transportation of individuals but above all the survival of all their industries if this phenomenon continues it is the economy of the european union as a whole that will suddenly collapse taking its population back at least a century this phenomenon is difficult to analyze because the prices and availability of energy sources vary according to many factors first prices depend on supply and demand as a result they have risen with the overall economic recovery from the end of the covid 19 epidemic second energy sources are the main targets of speculators even more so than currencies the world price of oil can be multiplied by 2 5 just by the effect of speculation so far everything is usual and known but the western sanctions against russia following its application of the minsk ii agreement for which it was the guarantor before the security council have broken the world market from now on there is no longer a global price but different prices according to the countries of the sellers and the customers there are still prices quoted on the stock exchange in wall street and the city but they bear no relation to those in beijing and new delhi above all oil and gas which were abundant in the european union are starting to run out while globally they are still in overabundance all our reference points have been turned upside down our statistical tools designed for the global market are not at all adapted to the current period we can therefore only make assumptions without any means of verifying them this situation allows many people to talk nonsense with an air of authority in fact we are all evolving at a guessing pace one of the current factors is the reflux of dollars which were used for trade and speculation and which are no longer usable for these transactions in certain countries this mostly virtual currency is leaving russia and its allies to go to or return to the countries where it is still used this is a gigantic phenomenon that the federal reserve and the us military have always wanted to avoid but which the straussians in the biden administration secretary of state antony blinken and his deputy victoria nuland have deliberately provoked wrongly convinced that russia has invaded ukraine and is trying to annex it the europeans forbid themselves to trade with moscow in practice they still consume russian gas but they are convinced that gazprom will cut off their gas supply for example their press announced that the russian company was closing the nord stream pipeline although it had announced a three day technical interruption normally gas pipeline deliveries are interrupted for maintenance for two days every two months here gazprom was hampered in its maintenance by the western blockade which prevented the return of the turbines it had sent for repair to canada however the population understood that the evil russians had cut off their gas on the eve of winter the european propaganda aims to prepare public opinion for a definitive closure of the gas pipeline and to put the responsibility on russia in this case the leaders of the union are simply implementing the directives of the straussians in doing so they are scuttling european industry to the detriment of their citizens already some energy intensive factories have reduced their production or even closed the process of decrepitude of the european union will continue as long as no one dares to oppose it to everyone s surprise a first pro russian demonstration was held on september 3 in prague the police admitted to 70 000 people for a country of 10 million but there were probably many more political commentators despise them and consider them putin s useful idiots but these insults do not mask the unease of european elites energy experts consider power cuts throughout the union inevitable only hungary which has previously obtained exemptions could escape the rules of the single energy market those who can produce electricity will have to share it with those who cannot it doesn t matter whether this inability is the result of bad luck or short sightedness brussels should start with voltage reductions then cut off at night and finally during the day individuals will have difficulties to maintain elevators to heat their homes in winter to cook if they use electric plates and those who use trains buses or electric cars should have difficulties to move energy intensive businesses such as blast furnaces are expected to close infrastructures are expected to become impassable such as long tunnels that can no longer be ventilated above all electronic installations designed for continuous operation will not be able to withstand repeated interruptions this will be the case for example for antennas that are essential for cell phone networks which will be thrown away after three months of this treatment in third world countries where electricity is scarce battery powered leds are used for lighting and ups to power low consumption machines such as computers or televisions but these materials are currently not available in the eu the eu s gdp has already fallen by almost 1 will this recession continue as the straussians plan or will the citizens of the union interrupt it as part of the czech people are trying to do the straussians will go all the way they have taken advantage of the decadence of the united states to take over the real power since a junkie never elected can use official planes galore to do business all over the world they have quietly moved into the shadow of president biden and are governing in his place european leaders on the other hand are either blind or too committed to stop acknowledge their thirty years of mistakes and turn back specialists of leo strauss political thought interpret it in a very contradictory way for my part i am not interested in what the philosopher thought of

article the buck isn t stopping the value of the u s dollar has been on a tear for more than a year against everything from the british pound across the atlantic to the south korean won across the pacific after rising again friday the dollar is near its highest level in more than two decades against a key index measuring six major currencies including the euro and japanese yen many professional investors don t expect it to ease off anytime soon the dollar s rise affects nearly everyone even those who will never leave the u s borders here s a look at what s driving the u s dollar higher and what it can mean for investors and households what does it mean to say the dollar is stronger essentially that one dollar can buy more of another currency than it could before consider the japanese yen a year ago 1 could get a little less than 110 yen now it can buy 143 that s about 30 more and one of the biggest moves the u s dollar has made against another currency foreign currency values are constantly shifting against each other as banks businesses and traders buy and sell them in time zones around the world the u s dollar index which measures the dollar against the euro yen and other major currencies has climbed more than 14 this year the gain looks even more impressive compared against other investments most of which have had a dismal year u s stocks are down more than 19 bitcoin has more than halved and gold has lost more than 7 why is the dollar strengthening because the u s economy is doing better than others even though inflation is high the u s job market has remained remarkably solid and other areas of the economy such as the services sector have been resilient that s helped offset worries about a slowing housing industry and other parts of the economy that do best when interest rates are low that in turn has traders expecting the federal reserve to follow through on its promise to keep hiking interest rates sharply and to hold them there a while in hopes of knocking down the worst inflation in 40 years such expectations have helped the yield of a 10 year treasury more than double to 3 44 from roughly 1 33 a year ago who cares about bond yields investors who want to make more income off their money and those juicier u s yields are drawing investors from all over the world other central banks have been less aggressive than the fed because their economies seem to be more fragile the european central bank just raised its key rate by the largest amount ever three quarters of a percentage point but the fed has already raised its key rate by that amount twice this year with a third expected this upcoming week some traders even say a gargantuan hike of a full percentage point could be possible following a hotter than expected report on u s inflation tuesday partly because of that less aggressive bent 10 year bonds across europe and other areas of the world offer much lower yields than u s treasurys such as germany s 1 75 and japan s 0 25 when investors from asia and europe buy treasurys they have to trade their own currencies for u s dollars that pushes up the dollar s value a strong dollar helps u s tourists right yes u s travelers in tokyo spending 10 000 yen on dinner will be using 23 fewer dollars than a year ago for the same priced meal with the dollar up sharply so far this year against everything from the argentine peso to the egyptian pound to the south korean won the dollar is going further in many countries than before does it help only rich people who can afford to travel abroad no a stronger dollar also helps u s shoppers by keeping a lid on prices for imports and pushing downward on inflation when the dollar is rising against the euro for example european companies make more euros on each 1 of sales with that cushion they could cut the dollar price for their products and still make the same amount of euros they could also leave the price in dollars alone and pocket the extra euros or they could find some balance of the two prices for imports fell 1 in august from a month earlier following july s 1 5 drop offering some relief amid the nation s high inflation prices for imported fruits nuts and some peels dropped 8 7 for example they re down 3 from a year earlier a stronger dollar can keep prices in check for commodities generally that s because oil gold and others are bought and sold in u s dollars around the world when the dollar rises against the yen a japanese buyer can get fewer barrels of crude for the same number of yen as before that can mean less upward pressure on oil prices so there are only winners from a strong dollar no u s companies that sell abroad are seeing their profits get squeezed at mcdonald s revenue fell 3 during the summer from a year earlier but if the dollar s value had simply stayed put against other currencies the company s revenue would have been 3 higher microsoft meanwhile said changes in foreign currency values sliced 595 million off its revenue in the latest quarter a string of other companies have given similar warnings recently and further gains for the dollar could add more pressure on profits companies in the s p 500 index get roughly 40 of their revenue from outside the united states according to factset any other collateral damage a strong dollar can put a financial squeeze across the developing world many companies and governments in such emerging markets borrow money in u s dollar terms instead of in their own currencies when they must repay their debts in u s dollars while their own currencies buy fewer dollars by the day it can create lots of stress where s the dollar heading from here the dollar s biggest moves may be behind it but many professionals expect the dollar to at least stay this high a while tuesday s report on u s inflation shocked the market and showed it remains more stubborn than expected that has traders upping bets for fed rate hikes going into next year fed officials have been busy recently reaffirming their commitment to keeping rates high until the job is done in breaking the nation s high inflation even if it damages economic growth that bias toward still higher rates by the fed should continue to offer support for the value of the u s dollar for the dollar to weaken meaningfully strategists wrote in a bofa global research report the fed has to get more concerned about growth than inflation and we are not there yet
