they did a pretty good job on friday stock markets have taken investors on a roller coaster ride lately with a relentless oscillation between up days and down days on friday bullish investors got the better of things sending the dow jones industrial average dji 0 17 and s p 500 gspc 0 21 up by more than 0 5 the nasdaq composite s ixic 0 12 gain was more modest extending the narrative that has played out through just about all of 2022 index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 53 176 s p 500 0 59 22 nasdaq 0 21 22 even as some technology stocks continued to struggle on friday the market s best performing sector of 2022 once again reasserted its dominion over wall street energy stocks moved sharply higher and many believe that even though they produced huge gains this year the biggest companies in oil and natural gas could once again have a positive impact on the stock market come 2023 how energy stocks fared friday many stocks in the energy sector saw solid gains on friday among the biggest names dow component chevron cvx 0 83 rose by 3 while fellow oil giant exxonmobil closed the session 2 6 higher some smaller companies saw even bigger gains exploration and production company conocophillips finished the day more than 4 higher while apa was up nearly 6 and chord energy managed a 5 gain oilfield services specialists also enjoyed gains slb and baker hughes each picked up about 3 on the day while halliburton was up by 4 even refining companies joined in on the positive mood valero energy finished the trading day 4 higher while marathon petroleum posted a 3 1 gain and phillips 66 was up 3 4 rising energy prices are helping stocks the rises in energy stocks were driven largely by increases in the prices of energy commodities west texas intermediate crude oil finished higher by nearly 2 per barrel approaching the 80 mark brent crude was up more than 2 50 per barrel moving above 84 refined products saw even larger gains on a percentage basis gasoline futures were up by more than 0 12 per gallon to 2 38 while heating oil also rose 0 12 per gallon to 3 21 natural gas prices climbed 0 09 to close the day back above 5 what s coming in 2023 long term investors need to remember though that many of the factors that move energy stocks from day to day are fleeting by nature for instance many energy market participants said that worries about the impact of the massive winter storm hitting much of the u s this week are affecting prices with particular concern that the cold and snowy weather will force production and refining activity to a temporary halt that won t necessarily have any lasting impact on long term supply and demand but it could produce significant volatility in energy markets over a period of days or weeks there are though some things that could happen in 2023 that would potentially send energy prices higher china s economy has been sluggish in part because of its pandemic restrictions but as its relaxation of its zero covid policies moves forward its energy demand could dramatically increase moreover if the war in ukraine continues we could see production cuts from russia a major energy commodity exporter as price caps imposed on russian crude have already led the kremlin to announce it was cutting volumes at the same time though some other events could weigh on the energy sector a recession in the u s and other major world economies could reduce global industrial activity diminishing energy demand moreover if the war between russia and ukraine were to end that could lead to the removal or reduction of sanctions which in turn could lead to greater supplies of oil and natural gas hitting the market what investors shouldn t count on though is energy stocks repeating in 2023 the 62 rise they have delivered so far in 2022 even under positive scenarios more modest gains are much more likely and it ll be interesting to see how it all plays out in the year to come

ceo elon musk says he won t sell any more shares in tesla for 18 months or more likely an attempt to comfort shareholders of the electric vehicle company who have watched the stock lose nearly half of its value since musk s purchase of twitter went through in october i m not selling any stock for 18 to 24 months musk said during an audio only twitter spaces group conversation on thursday musk then said he wouldn t sell tesla shares for two years but backtracked and said he would pause sales for at least one year musk dumped another 2 58 billion worth of tesla stock last week and has sold nearly 23 billion worth of his car company s shares since april when he started building a position in twitter a significant portion of those proceeds have gone to help fund his 44 billion acquisition of the social media company which has been marked by chaos since musk took over in less than two months musk has presided over a dizzying series of changes that have unnerved advertisers and turned off users he s laid off half of the workforce axed contract content moderators and disbanded a council of trust and safety advisors he has dropped enforcement of covid 19 misinformation rules and called for criminal charges against dr anthony fauci the top u s infectious disease expert tesla investors have grown weary of the 24 7 twitter chaos that they say has distracted the eccentric ceo from the electric car company his main source of wealth tesla s market value was over 1 1 trillion on april 1 the last trading day before musk disclosed he was buying up twitter shares the company has since lost nearly two thirds of its value at a time when rival automakers are cutting in on tesla s dominant share of electric vehicle sales tesla shares fell more than 1 on friday to 123 74 they were more than 360 each on april 1 and hit an all time high of more than 414 in november of 2021 this week tesla boosted the discounts it s offering through year s end on its two top selling models an indication that demand is slowing for its electric vehicles the austin texas company began offering a 3 750 incentive on its model 3 sedan and model y suv on its website earlier this month but on wednesday doubled the discount to 7 500 for those who take delivery between now and dec 31
fraser seitel the line between genius and madman is razor thin on one hand you can possess the henry ford like brilliance to create a successful attractive superior new automobile and follow it up with a spaceship that flies to mars on the other hand you can be so maniacal that you tear down willfully all you ve created behold the perplexing paradox that is elon musk yes he invented tesla the sleekest fastest and most gorgeous car of all time yes he s single handedly wrecking the value of his once thriving company and its shareholders one of whom in dismaying full disclosure is me no he never really intended to buy twitter no he had has no clue what to do with the losing social network now that he s stuck with it and no there s little chance that twitter the company will avoid bankruptcy and that musk the individual will avoid being forced to sell out at bargain basement prices the only liquid currency he owns tesla stock to repay his bulging twitter debt and there s also little doubt that the billionaire s purchase of twitter will go down in the annals of business decisions as elon musk s folly one of the dumbest takeovers of all time but and here s the point despite what outraged journalists and self appointed free speech advocates have argued the fact that musk owns the private messaging site gives him every right to throw off that site any reporter he doesn t like sorry new york times and washington post and cnn and keith olbermann and stephen king and aoc but if he owns the company then as long as he isn t acting in a racist sexist or antisemitic manner he can toss your caboose off the site musk s initial decision to suspend from twitter any journalist who through tweet or link exposed the location of the musk family was met with great vitriol by reporters and politicians around the world the times demanded a satisfying explanation for this action the executive editor of the post huffed the suspensions undermine elon musk s claim that he intends to run twitter as a platform dedicated to free speech but here s why musk is right and his critics are wrong first while twitter users like the rest of us are protected by constitutional first amendment free speech and free press clauses twitter users aren t journalists in the classical sense who are protected by media shield laws rather twitter is now a private company owned by one man who can do with it what he wants as long as it s legal if media companies free speech champions or human rights advocates don t like what musk is doing with twitter they can either take him to court or petition congress to pass laws that treat blogs and social media as journalists moreover to most people twitter is meaningless the vast majority of americans 77 percent according to the latest pew research data don t use twitter and of the less than one quarter who do use the site regularly the top 25 percent of those users produce 97 percent of all tweets and who are the top twitter daily users journalists 69 percent of whom report they use twitter more than any other site that compares with only 13 percent of u s adults who say they regularly get news from twitter so the point is that even though the new york times and washington post and other major media regularly cite tweets as a major source of news and prevailing opinion twitter in fact is the very definition of an elite medium with little relevance to most people so if elon musk wants to kick some reporter off his site he s totally within his rights to do so second journalists aren t even journalists anymore so why should they be accorded special privileges it used to be that objectivity and professional integrity were the attributes that separated journalists from the rest of us typical were the six elements of the code of ethics of the radio television digital news association 1 public trust 2 truthfulness 3 fairness 4 integrity 5 independence and 6 accountability in other words once upon a time if you read it in the new york times you could be relatively certain the story had been produced by professional journalists vetted by experienced editors and therefore produced with even handedness and a minimum of political bias today where according to the paper s own demographic data 91 percent of times readers identify as democrats the old rules of fairness and truthfulness no longer apply typical is the times daily drumbeat of embarrassing news stories that fan the flames of an imaginary national trend that more and more firms are unionizing to prove its case the times regularly reports on the unionization efforts at only two companies starbucks and amazon the reality in both cases where most efforts to unionize have been thwarted by enlightened management adopting more pro labor benefits is rarely mentioned in times stories no wonder according to most polls less than half of americans believe the times is a trustworthy news source the reality in today s world of journalism is that objectivity is out and political bias is in so the argument that journalists merit special privileges is increasingly more difficult to justify primarily because third the media sadly are no longer considered credible sources of news by many americans credibility in the media just like trust in most american institutions continues to decline according to the latest pew research trust in national news outlets among all u s adults has descended to 61 percent with 77 percent of democrats and only 42 percent of republicans expressing such trust younger americans under 30 now trust social media news sources as much as national media news sources perhaps most tellingly while 76 percent of all american adults believe the news media have a responsibility to strive for equal coverage of all sides in reporting news only 44 percent of u s journalists feel similarly so much for journalistic credibility in all fairness when it comes to credibility at this stage elon musk also commands little or none but does the mad billionaire have the right to expel anyone he wants from his sinking social media site yes he does fraser p seitel has been a communications consultant author and teacher for 40 years he s the author of the pearson text the practice of public relations now in its 14th edition and co author of rethinking reputation and idea wise he may be reached directly at

for the better part of 2022 the fashion industry was waiting for the other shoe to drop we re still waiting there was the glut of merchandise retailers and brands had amassed going into the year already high inflation hit levels not seen since the early 1980s russia ceased to be a viable market for most western brands almost overnight when it invaded ukraine interest rate hikes a sagging stock market and round after round of tech layoffs all threatened to cool consumer demand for fashion china s economic engine faced its greatest threat in decades from the country s zero covid policy the uk and much of europe teetered on the brink of what some economists predict will be a long deep recession but throughout this period there s always been just enough good news to keep the fashion industry from spiralling into utter despair the us has managed to dodge a recession so far though in surveys a majority of economists regularly continue to predict it s only a matter of time china has loosened its zero covid policy raising hopes that its massive market will swiftly reopen when the inevitable wave of illnesses subsides and most importantly consumers don t seem to share economists and fashion executives doom and gloom mindset on friday the university of michigan said its index of us consumer sentiment hit 59 7 in december below a reading of 70 6 a year ago but up from november

percent increase in the month prior retail sales tell a similar story the headline number reflecting purchases of everything from televisions to watches to dish soap fell 0 6 percent in the us and 0 4

news had a halo effect on the whole industry with fashion stocks rising almost across the board the retailer demonstrated that excess inventory can be a temporary problem rather than a return to the bad old days of year round discounting nordstrom american eagle vince and urban outfitters inc have also underscored their efforts to reduce inventory in recent earnings calls if retailers can improve their inventory position in early 2023 they will be in a much healthier position to for a strong year in general analysts say the bull case on 2023 remains centred on clean post holiday inventory

year muni ust ratio was at 60 the five year at 64 the 10 year at 68 and the 30 year at 92 according to refinitiv mmd s 1 p m read ice data services had the three at 62 the five at 66 the 10 at 72 and

at miller tabak asset management looking ahead to the first quarter he expects a brisk pace to follow the holiday lull january returns are anticipated to be slightly positive given the heavy cash hitting client portfolios on the first and 15th of the month he said from a macro standpoint 2022 basically saw the unwinding of the asset valuation bubble created by easy money by the federal reserve and overly stimulative fiscal policy in 2020 and 2021 according to a dpc data report who would have thought the lockdown would turn into a boon for internet sales and speculative stock trading that it would upend the existing work and commute model in a way that s still playing out all around the country the report asked the report said what started out as defensive recovery measures in response to the covid 19 outbreak became a massive net stimulus effort noting the disruptions related to a globalized supply chain created a recipe for a significant spike in inflation the fed had no choice but to press the reset button and raise rates aggressively for the past three quarters and probably well into the first half of next year the report said some municipal issuers they report said came out of the last two years in better shape than in 2019 not suffering as much as initially expected from the pandemic and some even coming out of the last two years in better shape than they were in 2019 the federal government has to date allotted more than 800 billion in pandemic relief aid to state governments across the six pieces of legislation passed in response the pandemic the report said more importantly 307 billion consisted of flexible funds that states could use at their discretion the report noted admittedly with 20 20 hindsight this massive federal aid was simply overkill states and local governments the report said ended up footing some of the bill for the federal largesse through a much higher cost of capital resulting from the fed tightening cycle as of dec 23 the 30 year mmd spot stood at 3 49 down from a peak of 4 16 on oct 26 but 200 basis points higher than where it was on dec 30 2021 similarly the 10 year mmd spot yields 2 54 down from 3 41 on oct 26 but 150 basis points higher than at the beginning of the year at the end of the day this year s market sell off sets the stage for a potentially more rewarding 2023 particularly in the second half the report said the investment case for high quality municipals is already quite appealing based on higher tax equivalent yields and wider quality spreads according to the report it certainly wasn t a coincidence that the explosive november rally started when double tax exempt yields on high grade paper crossed the 4 00 mark for a taxable equivalent yield in the 6 7 range depending on the state the report said

current stance the second round of data was rather upbeat as consumer sentiment improved and inflation expectations dropped even further said edward moya senior market analyst at oanda new home sales also unexpectedly improved but no one is betting that the bottom is in place disinflation trends are firmly in place after durable goods orders slumped and as personal spending softened he added demand destruction should only continue and that will be well received by the inflation fighting fed november durable goods orders dropped 2 1 more than double the 1 0 decline expected while personal income gained 0 4 in november and spending inched up 0 1 the durable goods data shows that higher costs of capital and persistent inflation continue to pressure the manufacturing sector according to josé torres senior economist at interactive brokers university of michigan consumer sentiment rose to 59 7 while the present situation index slipped to 59 4 and the expectations index grew to 59 9 but the report s one year inflation expectation slid 0 1 point to 2 9 its lowest read since june 2021 the fed s tightening path is getting vindicated here as the narrative that personal and business spending will continue to slow appears to be firmly in place moya said november personal consumption expenditures rose 0 1 while core gained 0 2 and year over year core pce dropped to 4 6 from 5 0 a month earlier jay hatfield ceo at infrastructure capital believes future reads will also ease with pce reads dropping below 3 in the middle of next year we are optimistic that pce core inflation will decline faster than cpi as the lagging shelter component of cpi is 33 while shelter is only 16 of pce he said the fed continues to try to manage the economy based on lagging indicators such as the labor market and inflationary expectations vs the critical leading indicators of inflation including the money supply the housing sector and energy and commodity prices hatfield said had the fed used infrastructure capital s real time inflation indicator he said it would have started tightening policy in late 2020 as inflation in the housing market started to skyrocket the pce report along with other recent reads of inflation provided further evidence of mounting disinflationary pressures particularly within the goods sector said berenberg chief economist for americas and asia mickey levy and economist mahmoud abu ghzalah however continued robust gains in nominal personal income driven by wage and salary growth together with still resilient labor markets point to continued upward pressures on core services prices excluding shelter and energy services if the core pce gain of 0 2 is not revised they said december pce would need to jump 0 6 to meet the fed s 4 8 forecast for 2022 this magnitude of reacceleration in core pce inflation is unlikely and raises the probability the fed will opt to nudge down its inflation forecasts when it issues its next set of economic projections the pce data implies that higher interest rates inflation and uncertainty about the economy have prompted caution at the cash register interactive s torres said this trend may help americans improve their financial health and spending power which over the long term is positive because consumption represents approximately 70 of u s gdp the minimal increase in spending is also encouraging for the inflation outlook because it shows that higher interest rates are helping to curtail demand christine albano contributed to this report

almost 9 out of 10 investment advisors and managers plan to increase their clients portfolio allocations to alternative investments over the next two years according to a survey sponsored by cais a technology platform that connects independent advisors with investment managers across a range of nonpublicly traded funds and mercer the 38 billion aum investment advisory firm based in new york city why the growing interest a shrinking pool of investable securities in the equity markets and a decade of low yields on debt have prompted advisors to look elsewhere for income and the noncorrelated assets needed to build out client portfolios according to the firms related advisors take on alternatives there were existing trends that i think have been going on for five or 10 years said gregg sommer a partner at mercer investments who heads up the firm s financial intermediaries business the recent economic conditions have only accelerated that if you re not investing in private equity venture or private credit you re not participating in the economy and that s what we re bringing to the table said matt brown chief executive of cais during a presentation at schwab s recent advisor conference if you re a financial advisor and you re not including alternative investments in your portfolios you re at the risk of losing your business over the next three years related seven advisors assess the value of alternatives yet the interest in alternatives has not always translated into action as many advisory firms still struggle with access and pulling the less liquid often more opaque investments into their portfolio management and performance reporting workflows tech consultants f2 strategy conducted a similar survey in june which found that almost half of wealth management firms actively investing in alternatives expect to slow down the allocations in the coming year doug fritz co founder and chief executive of f2 strategy said interest among advisors in the alternatives landscape was a mixed bag and often comes more from how they position themselves competitively than a reaction to market conditions there are wealth firms that use traditional funds and etfs and have not had a third and fourth assets class to add to client portfolios they see that as a gap they must overcome he said they re not really thinking about the economy and less correlated asset classes they re thinking about their competitive stance and how they can win client mandates clients that may be going to smaller independent rias that already have a book of alternative assets or large wirehouses that have had them for a while ryan s cole managing director of citrine capital said the promise of alternative investments as an enhancement to client outcomes is overhyped he said his firm sees interest in alternatives increase during every bear market only to drop off during bull markets these alternatives are marketed as uncorrelated assets that outperform in bear markets but they almost never outperform markets they also usually have really high fees said cole unfortunately retail investors usually buy them during bear markets because they get nervous i would recommend that retail investors steer clear and if they do want alternative assets that are uncorrelated to act as a hedge against their stock portfolio then it s usually best to buy those during bull markets but for the most part i don t ever recommend investing in these he said curtis j crossland of suttle crossland wealth advisors said he did see a place for alternatives but not as a tactical option in volatile markets alternative investments should be viewed as a supplemental strategy to the traditional portfolio for most investors said crossland part of his rationale was alternatives tend to have different risks associated with them compared with stocks and bonds but also the potential for unique exposures and returns that can t be found on the public exchanges hedge funds private equity or private capital real estate or infrastructure aren t necessarily known for liquidity there can be specialized etfs that give you exposure but they don t represent all the options said crossland he said his firm added alternatives for clients that have assets beyond what s needed for their lifestyle and basic planning needs recommending an alternative investment to an investor that is simply frustrated with the current market cycle or seeking alternatives in the hopes of short term outperformance is to act on irrational fears or concerns the client s entire situation should be considered and weighed before any recommendations are made ryan bouchard founder and chief investment officer of rising tide wealth advisory solutions said he saw a recent rise in interest for alternative investments from clients and prospects i think for the past 10 years or so alts was kind of a bad word and i think especially this year when interest rates have risen so much i think a lot of advisors are taking a second look at the role of alternatives in portfolios said bouchard bouchard said his firm looked to alternative investments to serve as the ballast of a portfolio a role that traditionally had been played by bonds bonds were supposed to hold up whenever equity markets fell and interest rates got lower and lower over the last decade it became evident that at some point bonds were not going to be the savior of the overall portfolio we encouraged people to diversify some of that bond exposure into alternatives said bouchard but it takes time and research to find the appropriate investments for the clients investors and advisors need to understand exactly what they re getting into and they need to understand these liquidity gates the more that investors learn about this stuff they re asking their advisors what they should be doing and i think advisors do need to have an understanding they need to know what s available out there the universe of alternatives is getting bigger and bigger every day

by chris isidore cnn a popular misconception has emerged about elon musk and tesla the megabillionaire s love affair with twitter is the main reason tesla shares have lost so much value this year but tesla s steep stock selloff this week proved that the problems at musk s car company go well beyond twitter even as musk signals he may give up his ceo title at twitter investors became concerned that the outlook for tesla s sales and profit is taking a turn for the worse a sign of the weakening demand tesla has announced a rare sale the company offered two rebates for buyers who take delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year initially offering a 3 750 discount earlier this month tesla then doubled that rebate to 7 500 thursday tesla clearly is starting to see demand cracks in china and in the us at a time that ev competition is increasing across the board said dan ives tech analyst with wedbush securities and a tesla bull who cut his price target for the stock friday from 250 to 175 the price cuts that tesla enacted was the straw that broke the camel s back on the stock another reason tesla s stock is sinking the us economy could tip into recession next year hurting car sales musk said on an twitter spaces call thursday he foresees the economy will be in a serious recession in 2023 i think there is going to be some macro drama that s higher than people currently think he said according to reuters adding that homes and cars will get disproportionately impacted by economic conditions tesla s questionable valuation part of the problem with tesla s stock price is that critics question whether it was ever worth the trillion dollar valuation it had at the start of the year at its peak tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined despite having a fraction of the sales of any of them today it is worth 399 billion it got ahead of itself in the near term said gene munster of loup ventures another tesla fan i still believe this can be a much bigger company i think it will see those kinds of numbers again but it could take a long long time to get there tesla s growth prospects a target of 50 sales growth annually helped drive that valuation it conceded in october that it will miss that sales target for this year the stock s climb to dizzying heights rising 743 in 2020 alone was driven by musk s reputation as a genius who would disrupt the massive global auto industry tesla was viewed as a disruptive technology company not as an automaker and a large part of that premium is related to musk said ives overpromising and underdelivering critics of tesla said much of its sky high valuation was based on promises that musk made about future products many of which came years after they were originally promised a prime example is the cybertruck the tesla pickup truck first unveiled three years ago with promises that production would start in 2021 now it is slated to start production next year with a ramp up in production in 2024 putting it years behind other electric pickup offerings from ford and upstart ev maker rivian both of which have electric pickups available for purchase today it could also trail planned electric pickup offerings from general motors elon musk has a pathological problem with the truth said gordon johnson one of the largest critics of tesla among analysts when people say he s a genius and innovator it s based on all his promises he never lives up to johnson said tesla shares will have a much steeper fall ahead once it starts being priced like other automakers rather than on its promises he said that for tesla to hit its growth targets it needs to be building new plants almost every year but that new factories in germany and texas that opened in spring are still not operating at full capacity and he said that its plant in china has had to scale back production due to weak sales in the market in the face of the covid restrictions demand in the us has collapsed he said two months ago your wait time was two or three months now you can get one immediately they re going to build more cars than they sell for a third straight quarter it s the definition of excess capacity tesla is still by far the largest ev maker worldwide although that title is being challenged in some key markets by volkswagen in europe and by byd in china and more competition is coming from established automakers such as ford and gm the twitter factor that s not to say twitter has played no role in tesla s stock price demise this year tesla shares have lost 66 of their value since musk s interest in twitter was first disclosed in april with a 45 decline since he closed on the deal in late october investors have been disappointed that musk appears to be paying for so much of his 44 billion purchase of twitter by selling tesla stock musk tesla s largest shareholder has sold 23 billion worth of tesla shares since his interest in twitter became public in april on thursday s twitter spaces call musk promised he was done selling shares of tesla stock until at least 2024 if not beyond but he hasn t lived up to a previous promise in april that he was done selling tesla shares selling 14 4 billion of that stock since that time it s been a pinocchio situation for musk saying he is done selling stock investors want to see him walk the walk and not just talk the talk said ives another twitter factor musk named himself ceo of twitter the third major company he leads along with tesla and spacex so many people assumed that musk s loss of focus on tesla has spooked its former fans on wall street but this week began with musk running a poll on twitter of course asking if he should give up the ceo title at his social media plaything he promised he would comply with the result and 57 5 of those who voted said they want him gone that departure may take a while musk tweeted he will resign as soon as i find someone foolish enough to take the job and the same tweet he cautioned that even if he gives up the ceo title at twitter he s not walking away totally saying that he plans to just run the software servers teams after finding a new fool to be ceo the poll results late sunday were enough to lift tesla shares in early trading monday but the shares ended the day slightly lower and have lost significantly more ground every day since tesla shares fell 9 thursday and it ended the week down 18 after another 2 drop on friday and then there s the question of how much damage the debacle at twitter has done to the tesla brand musk has fired thousands of employees banned journalists while allowing donald trump and other previously banned accounts back online called for the prosecution of dr anthony fauci embraced conspiracy theories and made anti trans statements in his short tenure as ceo it may have endeared him to some but angered other potential buyers including liberals who might be willing to pay a premium for a more environmentally friendly vehicle i think it was measurable damage said munster who believes the publicity over his time at twitter cost tesla 5 of its sales the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warner bros

cnn by david goldman cnn elon musk s wealth destruction has become historic the ceo of tesla spacex and twitter is worth 137 billion according to the bloomberg billionaires index good enough for second place on the list of the world s richest behind lvmh chairman bernard arnault but at its peak in november 2021 musk s net worth was 340 billion that makes musk the first person ever to lose 200 billion in wealth bloomberg reported last week the bulk of musk s wealth is tied up in tesla whose stock plunged 65 in 2022 demand for teslas weakened as competition in electric vehicles from established automakers surged last year the company missed its growth targets and scaled back production in china its fourth quarter deliveries announced monday missed wall street s estimates evidence of car buyers sinking interest in teslas became apparent last month after the company announced a rare sale in a bid to clear out inventory tesla offered two rebates for buyers taking delivery of a vehicle before the end of the year initially offering a 3 750 discount then doubling the rebate to 7 500 with two weeks left in 2022 investors were rattled by the rebates sending the stock plunging 37 in december critics have long questioned whether tesla was ever worth the trillion dollar valuation it had at the start of 2022 at its peak tesla was worth more than the 12 largest automakers on the planet combined despite having a fraction of their sales tesla ended the year worth 386 billion still much larger than its automaker rivals but far smaller than the tech titans apple microsoft google and amazon with which it was being compared a year ago musk s 44 billion purchase of twitter hasn t helped tesla s stock or musk s personal wealth either musk tesla s largest shareholder has sold 23 billion worth of tesla shares since his interest in twitter became public in april his constant tweeting and increasingly erratic behavior particularly after taking over as ceo at twitter has angered tesla investors who want musk to pay more attention to his significantly larger and more valuable company musk has defended himself against critics saying he hasn t missed a major tesla meeting since taking on responsibility for twitter tesla s stock may rebound and musk could once again become the world s richest person but musk s reputation as a genius took some serious damage in 2022 almost as much damage as his personal wealth the cnn wire 2023 cable news network inc a warner bros discovery company all rights reserved
the national law enforcement officers memorial fund released its report on the number of fatalities among law enforcement officers leos the report cites that 126 leos died in the line of duty in 2014 while the majority of deaths were traffic related incidents the number of deaths from firearms incidents rose by 56 in comparison to 2013 the number one cause of death that took place with a felony act were ambush style attacks similar to the one that took the lives of nypd officers wenjian loi and rafael ramos the two officers were killed in retaliation for the deaths of eric garner and michael brown fifteen officers were killed in ambush assaults in 2014 marking the highest number of deaths of that type in nine years while the average number of leo deaths was below the national annual average of 151 the 56 rise in ambush attacks is a statistical outlier for the year and may set the tone for 2015 if current tension between the black community and law enforcement continues the deadliest year ever for police was 1930 when 316 officers were killed that year represented the high water mark for prohibition but from 1919 to 1938 the number of officers killed in action stayed well above 200 while alcohol prohibition took effect nationwide in 1920 many states pre empted the ratification by passing laws earlier additionally congress passed the wartime prohibition act which took effect on july 1 1919 deaths by law enforcement went from 179 in 1918 to 238 in 1919 a rise of 33 narrowing down those numbers by deaths caused by non accidental gunfire the increase is actually 47 at the time of prohibition respect for the law and government was at an all time low police were either corrupt or ineffective in enforcing prohibition laws government specifically congress was a laughing stock possibly because they were all drunk when passing dry laws congress even had their own bootlegger george cassidy who was known as the man in the green hat who plowed politicians with alcohol for a decade during prohibition jumping forward to the present at least within the black community respect for the law and law enforcement officers is at a low point low enough for men like michael brown to attack a police officer or low enough for six teenagers to attack two boston cops serving a warrant or for gunman to open fire on a la patrol car or for two nydp cops to be knelt down and executed unlike the prohibition era there are no laws to be repealed that can fix this and national leaders such as al sharpton president obama and eric holder have only added fuel to the flames trying times ahead
vail mountain visitation during the upcoming holiday week could be quite the opposite of last season if predictions hold true part of the reason is something local parents won t be surprised to hear the fact that kids were still in school on the thursday before the sunday on which christmas falls it s a much different story than last season when christmas fell on a saturday and many public school students received vacation time for the entire week ahead of the holiday in the investment world that s called a positive holiday shift or a visitation bump based on where the holiday falls on the calendar the inverse effect is a negative holiday shift which is what we re seeing this season vail resorts analyst patrick scholes pointed out in a report released thursday in addition to a holiday shift we see new competitive supply from short term rentals the re opening of international markets such as europe the caribbean and canada combined with favorable fx for american travelers and the return of cruising as a value priced vacation alternative are putting some pressure on domestic resort hotel occupancy wrote scholes and gregory j miller with truist securities to be clear this is not just for u s ski resorts but also for popular u s resorts such as beach resorts that saw outsized performance two years into covid recently released data from destimetrics a company that collects future booking and pricing data for hotels at western u s ski resorts shows that shifts in school breaks this year vs last year mean that there are roughly 38 fewer households with k 12 children available to travel prior to the holiday week that is reflected in the deep yoy decline in occupancy between december 15 and 24 destimetrics writes and while that s problematic and difficult to overcome more concerning is the peak week of december 25 to 31 which was extremely busy last year but had trouble filling in this year with extreme room rates playing a role the higher room rates at hotels were noted as a positive in thursday s report from truist securities which pointed out that hotels attracting higher spending guests bodes well for on mountain spend per visitor and lodging segment profitability the reduced availability for travel in late december has also created a corresponding uptick in travel for early january something ski resorts are likely to see that along with an improved guest experience over last season could get 2023 off to a positive start for ski resorts 2023 optimism an interesting side note from truist securities thursday report was the fact that the firm increased its price target for vail mountain investment firms set price target numbers based on how much those firms expect companies stocks will be trading at in the future truist in 2022 was one of the more negative companies on vail resorts stock in january of 2022 some firms had price targets above 350 per share for vail resorts which had hit 370 in november of 2021 truist securities predicted 322 in early january but reduced to 302 in february and was down to 278 by march truists december increase on mtn from 270 to 292 shows an optimistic outlook on the stock which was trading at 242 when the price target was issued on thursday deutsche bank as of thursday had a price target of 289 jefferies investment bank had a price target of 232 and stifel nicolaus had a price target of 261 for vail resorts from truists thursday report investors who follow our research may recall that we were highly critical of mtn last season as in our view and that of many others mtn was caught flat footed by labor shortages in light of epic pass sales up 76 y y as we noted in our research earlier this year realistically despite mtn s assurances it will not be until early mid december once the ski season gets underway that we will get a good indication if mtn s resorts will be properly staffed until then it is mostly wait see if mtn can execute on its commitment to be much better prepared for the ski season truist reported that as of mid december at vail resorts colorado resorts staffing and service levels both on slope and f b have significantly improved from last season though are not fully back lessons and grooming were listed among the elements not back to full service levels truist noted the good news for mtn is that lessons have seen sizable price increases and many popular dates especially for children sold out quickly in october truist noted the bad news is that mtn likely left money on the table due to not having enough available instructors in conducting on mountain analysis of vail mountain researchers likely found fewer lift line issues and more open restaurants this year locally the fact that sales are down 12 on the full epic pass that s the one that gives guests unlimited access to vail mountain and beaver creek is likely to play a role in reduced visitation to the eagle county ski areas this season despite the slight bump in january hotel reservations at western u s ski resorts are down for the rest of the season as well destimetrics reports but all of that actually creates a favorable environment for pass sales for next season truist noted with full season epic pass sales down 12 y y part of which we attribute to poor experiences by skiers boarders at mtn s resorts last season some of the damage from last season s issues has been done thursday s report pointed out going forward assuming the y y improvements are maintained throughout the season we could envision less attrition on the full epic pass next ski season

crude oil siphoned from pipelines to fuel the international cocaine trade is tearing oozing toxic holes in the forests of western colombia reuters reported in the forests traffickers and paramilitaries brew homemade gasoline from oil stolen from pipelines according to the outlet the illicit gasoline brewed in clandestine refineries is used to extract cocaine from coca leaves a key early step in refining the drug previous reports have suggested cocaine trafficking is responsible for at least a quarter of annual forest loss in some central american countries as colombia s cocaine exports rise to record numbers oil theft at two key pipelines has tripled over the past four years to nearly 3 500 barrels per day reuters reported much of that stolen product goes to crude refineries in the jungle which typically dump about two thirds of the oil they receive into the ground police told reuters that poisons about a square mile around the refinery by clogging the tiny pores in the

s air for less than 100 programming note equilibrium will be taking a break next week happy holidays tesla rolls out discounts amid dropping stock price tesla stock continued to tumble this week amid the announcement it would offer discounts on its two top selling models the electric vehicle ev manufacturer s stock has lost nearly 20 percent of its value this week alone tesla s share price has fallen nearly 70 percent since the beginning of the year on thursday u s regulators said they would also investigate two more crashes involving teslas that might have operated on automated driving systems double discount tesla announced wednesday it was doubling the discounts on any model 3 or model y vehicles delivered before the end of the year that meant a jump from 3 750 announced dec 1 to 7 500 the company also this month offered to throw in 10 000 miles of free high speed charging what analysts are saying the fact tesla seems to be cutting price to increase deliveries volumes doesn t raise confidence craig irwin a senior analyst at roth capital partners told reuters that s a particular concern at a time where we see increasing competition roth added on musk s mind elon musk said in a twitter spaces audio chat on thursday that he expects a serious recession in 2023 that would cause consumers to defer major purchases strategic concerns tesla s discount decision represents a troubling example of prioritizing short term appearances over long term results financial advice site motleyfool reported if tesla waited until jan 1 2023 new treasury rules mean the government would offer its own 7 500 deal as we reported instead tesla is footing the bill for that discount itself when the government will offer it for free in a week why tesla s willingness to discount its evs indicates that it s more concerned with meeting wall street expectations on arbitrary quarter end delivery volume than on getting an extra 7 500 for the same vehicle the motleyfool wrote the drop is another sign of trouble for the trailblazing electric vehicle company amid continuing fallout over its chief executive s controversial takeover of twitter for his part musk is unapologetic i am not going to like sort of suppress my views just to boost the stock price he said on twitter spaces according to reuters bad vibes the doomsday risk for tesla is that all the intangibles that helped make the brand feel cool and futuristic will evaporate leaving the company to be traded as just another car company according to investor s business daily where s the harm in that if investors treated tesla like they do ford and general motors companies pouring billions into new ev supply chains company shares could see even more significant drops business daily reported feds esg is not get out of

mitloehner methane is misjudged published friday december 23 2022 imagine two bathtubs one has a drain the other does not the faucets are running on low and eventually the bathtub without a drain fills up the water in the other bathtub however flows down the drain as fast as it leaves the faucet only when the faucets are running on high does the tub with the drain begin to fill up this is the analogy frank mitloehner of the university of california davis gave regarding methane emissions from cows during the indiana farm bureau convention in indianapolis last friday the drainless bathtub represents carbon dioxide and the bathtub with a drain represents methane the illustration shows the difference between a stock greenhouse gas ghg and a flow gas stock gases such as carbon dioxide accumulate while flow gases run in a cycle continually being added and destroyed in the atmosphere methane therefore only accrues when there are extremely high emissions however methane is currently being treated like a stock gas which creates a stigma around agriculture the current narrative around agriculture is negative the air quality specialist said but american farmers can be part of the climate solution california legislature passed a bill that aims to reduce ghgs by 40 before 2030 this is an update from the original bill passed in 2006 that attempted to reduce emissions to the 1990 levels by 2020 according to u s energy information administration s independent statistics and analysis since 2015 california dairies have reduced ghgs by 2 million metric tons a reduction of 30 mitloehner said farmers are achieving this by covering the manure and catching the methane emitted from it the gas can then be turned into fuel for transportation commonly known as renewable natural gas rng by managing methane you make money while reducing ghgs mitloehner said until last year dairies could make up to 2 000 per year per cow by managing methane the amount of revenue has since fallen but participation in the program has increased while california dairy farmers are contributing to the solution agriculture remains stigmatized for its ghg emissions this is because the current measurement of global warming potential that ghgs have gwp 100 treats all gases as stock gases but methane is not a stock gas for every gwp 100 of carbon dioxide 28 gwp 100s are produced according to the current measuring system however mitloehner says this is not an accurate read of methane s impact in fact it is off kilter by approximately 3 or 4 gwp 100 why mitloehner explains that 558 tera grams of methane are produced globally but because methane is a flow gas 548 tera grams of methane are destroyed leaving only 10 tera grams in the atmosphere chemical reactions in the atmosphere account for the destruction of 515 tera grams and the soil erodes another 33 tera grams of the gas methane is special it has a much shorter lifespan he said while carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere for 1 000 years methane has a lifespan of only 12 years a more recent global warming potential unit gwp takes the shorter lifespan of methane into account creating more accurate measurements of the environmental impact of the ghgs mitloehner also discussed biogenic carbon and fossil fuels biogenic carbon refers to the carbon dioxide produced by cows and other animals carbon is transmitted into plants through photosynthesis creating carbon dioxide which is turned into carbohydrates in the grass which cows eat after cows eat the grass the carbon dioxide is emitted through belches back into the air to repeat the cycle as with methane this form of carbon dioxide is constantly created and destroyed offering a balance of the gas level the majority of ghgs are released by fossil fuels not cows mitloehner said in fact the number of dairy cows in the u s has declined by 16 million from 1950 to 2022 this has decreased the carbon footprint by 66 mitloehner also reports that methane has not increased in the u s but third world countries are responsible for higher methane levels in the atmosphere even so by managing methane dairy farmers can reduce emissions of the gas across the u s by significant amounts as california dairies are mitloehner says this is a more effective way to manage ghgs than if everybody in the u s became vegan which would only reduce ghg emissions by 2 6 mitloehner closed with a warning watch out for what other countries are doing to manage ghgs in the netherlands farmers have been protesting because legislation has been passed to reduce the dutch livestock sector by one third farmers there are asked to sign a contract stating that they nor their children will ever farm again ireland is also making moves to reduce one third of its ghg emissions and new zealand has incorporated a methane tax for livestock owners while reducing the amount of ghgs emitted into the atmosphere is important mitloehner says it is also important to keep in mind that there is a safe amount of ghgs that the earth needs to protect itself from the sun and frigid temperatures of space the key is to not make too many ghgs which act like a blanket reflecting the heat of the earth back onto it there is hope he says that the stigma around agriculture s impact on the environment will dispense he contrasted two times magazine stories that were 20

by yuki yamaguchi kyodo news dec 24 2022 08 16 all japan seiji watanabe s enchantment with the dynamism of stock trading helped him rise to a senior position at nomura securities co japan s biggest securities house overseeing sales of japanese equities to institutional investors his deep knowledge of japanese stocks even made him a go to person for many money managers worldwide seeking advice on investing in companies such as toyota motor corp and softbank group corp but in his late 40s watanabe turned to a harder sell trying to convince a japanese public known for its relative lack of enthusiasm for investing that stock trading can be a worthwhile endeavor offering not just personal financial rewards but in his view benefits for society too a native of toyama prefecture in central japan watanabe started his career as a sales employee at a nomura branch in tokyo s high end ginza shopping district and quickly developed a passion for picking winners in the markets however his view of his career was shaken when a massive earthquake and tsunami pounded japan s northeast in march 2011 leaving about 16 000 dead and more than 2 500 unaccounted for his first reaction to news footage showing a giant tsunami turning coastal towns into rubble he recalled was to wonder what stocks will go up next week then i thought what am i thinking watanabe 55 said in an interview it felt as if i were liberated from brainwashing that was a turning point he began to see stocks not just as a means to make money but as a way to help grow companies that provide necessary goods and services and maintain employment that led him to view his role as helping direct the flow of money in ways that could help the japanese economy he said after serving as a managing director at nomura he left the company and launched million eyes co in 2016 a for profit investment school that focuses on training self sufficient individual investors his idea is to tap more than 1 000 trillion yen of savings in the country to drive a shift toward investment a significant swing would pour funds into promising companies on a massive scale helping revive japan s economy and eventually benefiting investors he said japan s public keeps much more of its financial assets in savings than its counterparts abroad according to the bank of japan cash and deposits accounted for 54 3 percent of financial assets held by japanese households in march 2022 against 13 7 percent in the united states and 34 5 percent in europe in contrast stocks represented only 10 2 percent of the total in japan compared with 39 8 percent in the united states and 19 5 percent in europe watanabe s idea concords with prime minister fumio kishida s policy goal of reviving the japanese economy through investment but financial motives alone are not enough to convince risk averse japanese people to buy stocks he said it s ingrained in our dna that if you pursue greed you will be punished watanabe said rather we should think of investment just like making an offering at a shrine if you have an altruistic mind that will eventually come back to you just like old folktales to help his students develop a discerning eye for good companies watanabe encourages them to carefully read kaisha shikiho companies quarterly a phone book thick investment guide published quarterly that details financial information about all of the more than 3 800 listed companies in japan though considered japan s bible of investment even professional investors rarely read the tome which has more than 2 000 pages from cover to cover he said but watanabe has done so for the past 25 years on a september day this year he accomplished the extraordinary feat of finishing his 100th issue of kaisha shikiho since he began reading it at the direction of his senior colleague in 1997 i started reading it because i was scared of him watanabe said but i have come to understand the japanese economy and even world economy better through it it has really enriched my life by studying every page of the book over many years readers can notice slight changes in the economy such as new business trends and how government policies like tax hikes affect companies which will help them find the next toyota or sony he said mr watanabe sometimes teaches us the signs of change in japanese companies that even we are not aware of said naoki yamamoto manager of the kaisha shikiho center at toyo keizai inc he is our ideal reader the school called fukugan keizai jyuku has drawn more than 3 500 students so far with about half of them in their 30s and 40s women accounted for about 30 percent of the total watanabe says the school s stance to focus not just on investment advice but also on companies histories and corporate philosophies may have helped attract people traditionally less interested in investment such as young people and women his students are often surprised by how they are surrounded by so many listed companies in their daily lives without knowing it for example hyojito co exclusively makes map boards at train stations while suminoe textile co supplies red carpets to japan s diet i have developed a habit of thinking of investment as something related to my work said toshiko amagasa a student of the school who works in the restaurant industry the school really changed how i see things she said the key to success is investing in companies the same way you would a child watanabe said you invest in a company because you simply want to support it he said if everyone did that the japanese economy would change

outperformance as with many other year end standouts including heavy machinery makers and solar energy stocks you can chalk it up to high expectations due to the infrastructure investment and jobs act which was signed into law in november that law allocates government funding for construction projects including roads bridges transit ports airports rail broadband and drinking water and wastewater infrastructure in other words plenty of work ahead will require steel charlotte north carolina based nucor is down 10 02 in the past month but still boasts a year to date gain of 21 25 despite the decline shares found solid support above their 200 day moving average signaling that institutional investors are holding shares at the level rather than bailing out that s an indication of confidence about the stock s future prospects disappointing earnings guidance much of the recent price decline was due to a december 15 announcement that nucor was lowering its earnings guidance for the current quarter it now expects fourth quarter earnings between 4 25 and 4 35 per share it added that full year earnings remain on track to exceed the record of 23 16 per diluted share nucor set in 2021 nucor s price to earnings ratio of 4 is in value stock territory at the moment which isn t necessarily a bad thing considering that value stocks over time tend to outperform growth marketbeat analyst data show a hold rating on the stock in the third quarter the company warned of challenges related to lower product shipments sentiments echoed in the december warning despite some gloom in recent months the passage of the infrastructure bill may lead to better than expected results in 2023 and beyond new construction and clean energy initiatives will create demand that s not yet quantified and certainly institutional investors have shown they are willing to hold shares at levels that outpace the broader market meanwhile steel dynamics has also declined recently pulling back 3 37 in the past

investors didn t like what they heard the fort wayne indiana company expects earnings between 3 34 and 3 38 per share which includes the impact of several special items strong order backlog in a sign of resilience and optimism about 2023 the company expects a strong order backlog from non residential customers to continue next year steel dynamics shares are getting excellent support at their 50 day moving average that was the case even before the announcement about the company joining the s p 500 analyst data compiled by marketbeat show a hold rating on this stock coincidentally steel dynamics like nucor has a p e ratio of 4 suggesting that if the company sees increased revenue from infrastructure and clean energy projects there could be significant room to run while wall street

rev richard coles even if we re not strictly as christian as we were let us all bathe in the radiant joy of christmas london if you have visited recently feels like it has finally recovered its energy after the pandemic for all the recent train strikes oxford street is busier than an a e on new year s day the lights twinkle and the carols play and though we may be spending less this christmas the shops are jammed much to rejoice at in this but there is also a problem after covid lockdowns we have forgotten what it is like for so many people to compete for so little space i dispute that christianity has disappeared though when i consider just how deeply the gospel is printed in all our lives through the institutions that were formed by it by the carols that we still know and sing even if the words are unintelligible to us but it is undoubtedly true that a traditional church christmas is a ghost of christmas past for more and more people and on the buses as well the underground goodwill is unevenly distributed i was on a tube the other day so packed it was like playing twister with 100 strangers at a busy stop half of them got out and there was a rush for their vacated seats two women both laden with shopping wanted the last remaining seat and did a sort of do sido dance before the winner prevailed the loser lost her patience and an argument broke out one of those arguments that suddenly has more force in it than you think it ought to after only a couple of exchanges it had escalated almost to the point of violence the rest of us pretended nothing was happening i gave thanks that i was not in a dog collar and therefore expected to do something there was that silence you get before an explosion then one of the women said shall we start again another silence and then the other said yes the whole carriage exhaled nobody wanted this fight though it is a stressful world and sometimes those stresses erupt but a gracious offer of a reset graciously accepted can reduce the situation peace and goodwill broke out by the time we got to marble arch we were all practically pulling crackers shall we start again i thought it an apt phrase for christmas one i might use for my own sermon but this christmas i won t be preaching a sermon for the first time in 20 years i retired as vicar of finedon in northamptonshire after easter and am now in the quarantine that follows when we are advised to do nothing churchy as we get used to life after parish ministry devicaring as someone called it it is a wise precaution because it is only when you stop that you realise how much you have been defined by the role a vicar plays many parts everything from a stock character in situation comedy the first thing anyone said to me after i was ordained was more tea vicar to a traffic calming measure stand in your dog collar next to a rat run and you ll slow cars more effectively than a speed camera we are most prominent in our role at christmas on parade in our parishes with christingles the nativity and midnight mass while doling out holy communion wondering why little balthazar is offering the christ child his light sabre and trying to extinguish candle occasioned small fires i don t think i ever felt more a part of the community than at christmas more woven into its life and the stories of its people i was an agent of the seasonal goodwill that helps bind us restores our relationships gives us joy and a yearning to delight in the pleasures of life and strength to face its troubles it is a thing most wonderful what am i for as a vicar i used to think if not that six months on i have begun to recover something of the individual who was of necessity surrendered to the role i am aware that anyone who observed me on the job might find it a stretch to think my individuality was surrendered even to the smallest degree five christmases ago after all i was appearing in a dog collar on strictly come dancing what does that have to do with the feast of the nativity of our lord it could be argued there is a connection given that christmas has become pretty much a secular affair and if the statistics are to be taken at a face value we can no longer think of this country as christian i dispute that christianity has disappeared though when i consider just how deeply the gospel is printed in all our lives through the institutions that were formed by it by the carols that we still know and sing even if the words are unintelligible to us but it is undoubtedly true that a traditional church christmas is a ghost of christmas past for more and more people the closest as a nation we get to the christmas spirit now perhaps is something like strictly a collective gathering for everyone from children to grandparents to seek light in darkness to witness marvellous things feel our hopes fulfilled and all beneath not an unexpected star travelling across the dark sky but a glitterball turning over the tower ballroom dance floor shall we start again is this our festive reset it is christmassy yet it is not christmas what you don t see on strictly is the booted out contestant heading for home in a black car holding the lovely handtied bouquet given as a departing gift the death flowers the pros call them and banished from this world of enchantment you feel like a child sent home from a party for wetting yourself waving from the back of your mum s car at your friends while they ignore you as they play pass the parcel christmas as any vicar will tell you is about light in darkness and i do not think there was a single christmas when as a vicar i did not have to make round trips from nativity to deathbed then back to nativity mortality rates rise sharply towards the end of december perhaps an understandable reaction to cold dark nights but also because people hold on wanting to have a last christmas with those they love around them i understand why some people might prefer in the end to resign themselves to eternity given how relentless the jingling sleigh can seem one of the most jarring sights i remember from my first post after ordination was the lodge houses at the drive that led through the cemetery to the crematorium the closest as a nation we get to the christmas spirit now perhaps is something like strictly a collective gathering for everyone from children to grandparents to seek light in darkness to witness marvellous things feel our hopes fulfilled and all beneath not an unexpected star travelling across the dark sky but a glitterball turning over the tower ballroom dance floor pictured rev richard coles pictured with dance partner dianne buswell on strictly in 2017 these had been let to tenants and one christmas they erected a giant santa which lit up and went yo ho ho every time we went past in a hearse and christmas deaths mean christmas widows lots of them it is hard enough being a widow at the best of times but now when families gather and we hear the story of a birth the empty place at the table and the dark suit in the wardrobe are particularly bitter i know this not only from observation but experience also for i myself am a christmas widower my husband david died just before christmas in 2019 right between his birthday and jesus s december for me is therefore a wipe out emotionally rather a disadvantage for a vicar it is hard enough being a widow at the best of times but now when families gather and we hear the story of a birth the empty place at the table and the dark suit in the wardrobe are particularly bitter pictured richard with his late husband david that first christmas without him mad with grief an object of media interest and at a total loss i was stood down by my impeccably caring bishop take as much time off as you need my marvellous curate jane stepped into the breach and i was taken in by friends who gave me lots of love and lots of room and shared their christmas with me then lockdown followed and the next two christmases were cancelled or curtailed and it is only now my fourth alone that i have to work out how to do it without the distractions and obligations of being the vicar without a husband and in a new place shall we start again when i retired i moved to sussex a county with which i have no connection apart from an old friend who lives there my former flatmate and former manager when i was in pop music with whom i had many christmases in london before i was ordained she has often come to my rescue at this most wonderful time of the year once 40 years ago she fought off a mugger who attacked me near oxford street by hitting him with a floris lavender bag another time she smoothed over a tricky christmas in new york where i was recording an album with my then music partner jimmy somerville we were the pop duo the communards we both invited friends without checking and 17 people turned up to stay for the holidays in a two bedroom apartment on 2nd avenue it was one of the best christmases i can remember last christmas she came to stay with me and this year i will be with her because i now live in the same village newly installed for the first time in four years i have put up a tree and found stashed in an outhouse our christmas decorations david loved christmas and would have transformed an outside privy into santa s grotto unfortunately i am not expert in the decorative arts and would live like a student if left to it so i approached the boxes of baubles and lights and nativity personnel with some hesitancy as any widow will tell you you may think you have got used to it but grief will sometimes pounce with surprisingly fresh force i took the lids off the boxes and saw inside the decorations that david had so carefully wrapped when he put them away after his last christmas he had wound the lights also on to a spool and as i unwound them i unwound myself and had to stop because i could not see anything for tears grief is the price you pay for love yes i know but i just want him to walk through the door and make the tree pretty because i cannot but we must all start again perhaps you are a new christmas widow too perhaps your year has been gruelling your circumstances difficult your prospects bleak perhaps it has been wonderful and you are full of joy and delight warmed by an aga full for the feast or on a beach somewhere sunny perhaps you are stuck in kyiv or calais or kabul in a verse from my favourite carol see amid the winter s snow we sing this sacred infant all divine what a tender love was thine thus to come from highest bliss down to such a world as this wherever we are no matter what we ve suffered or what we ve done radiance shines on us from a shed in bethlehem and in its light we are in that christmas moment all equal and beloved of god we stand on the edge of the new reality that is born here with the sacred infant where our wounds are healed our sorrows answered our joys confirmed and we can start again i

springfield when state rep maura hirschauer d batavia filed legislation that would ban assault weapons in january it was met with little fanfare after five months just one of her colleagues had signed on as a co sponsor and it remained in the gatekeeping house rules committee such has often been the way for gun control legislation in illinois where despite democratic supermajorities in the legislature and an ally in the governor s office lawmakers often shied away from greater regulation of firearms a third rail that exposed the state s regional divides as well as political ones but that reluctance fell by the wayside on july 4 when a 22 year old gunman opened fire on a fourth of july parade in suburban highland park killing seven and wounding dozens the suspect robert crimo iii used an ar 15 style semiautomatic rifle that was purchased legally with the help of his father who faces reckless conduct charges for sponsoring his firearm owners identification foid card application in the three weeks that followed that event the number of house sponsors on that proposal jumped from two to 56 it takes 60 votes to pass a bill in the house during regular session every illinoisan was at their own fourth of july parade and could internalize how this could have been them said state rep bob morgan d deerfield who was marching in the parade when the shooting occurred and i think that really changed the conversation with this renewed mandate to take on the issue house speaker chris welch d hillside announced in july that firearms safety would be a topic of one of the four working groups created to find legislative solutions for an expected special legislative session that session also meant to address the supreme court s overturning of roe v wade did not come to fruition but the working groups kept meeting those discussions bore fruit as earlier this month lawmakers introduced new legislation that among other things would ban the future sale of assault weapons in the state three legislative hearings have been held on the proposal in the past two weeks and it is expected to be considered during the lame duck session in early january which is the period before the end of legislators current terms and the start of their new terms proponents and opponents of the legislation say it will likely be tweaked but that it is ultimately expected to pass and be signed into law by gov j b pritzker but the debate will not end there gun rights advocates have promised a legal challenge there is legitimate uncertainty as to the outcome in light of a recent supreme court decision that shifted the standard for evaluating the constitutionality of gun control laws beyond that questions remain about the effectiveness of an assault weapons ban with even champions of the effort acknowledging that the policy alone will be no silver bullet what the legislation does the top line of house bill 5855 deemed by advocates the protect illinois communities act is a ban on assault weapons but the legislation does more than that it would also ban high capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds and devices that can essentially convert any gun into a semiautomatic weapon by allowing the firing of multiple bullets with one pull of the trigger under the proposal only those under 21 who are active duty members of the u s military or illinois national guard would be allowed to obtain a foid card current law allows 18 19 and 20 year olds to obtain a permit with parental consent it would also strengthen the state s relatively new red flag law enacted in 2019 which allows family members or law enforcement to petition a court to have a person s firearms temporarily taken away if they are deemed a danger to themselves or others the proposal would lengthen the period a person can be barred from possessing weapons from six months to one year the illinois state police would be tasked with investigating illegal firearms trafficking and coordinating firearms related intelligence with other federal state and local law enforcement agencies several of these incorporated elements including the large capacity magazine ban the strengthening of the red flag law and raising the age to obtain a foid card to 21 were recommended by the johns hopkins center for gun violence solutions which released a 16 page report detailing suggested illinois policy changes in november but the most striking change would be a ban on the future manufacture possession delivery sale and purchase of assault weapons in illinois the state would join eight others california connecticut delaware hawaii maryland massachusetts new jersey and new york and washington d c in doing so if the legislation is passed and signed into law illinois proposal identifies 49 types of assault shotguns and rifles and 20 kinds of assault pistols that would be covered under the ban also covered include several kinds of semiautomatic centerfire rifle that can accept a detachable magazine and has any of the following features a folding or telescoping stock thumbhole stock forward pistol grip flash suppressor or grenade launcher those who currently own these weapons would be grandfathered in but required to register weapons covered under the ban with the state police within 300 days of the law s effective date the registration fee would be 25 per gun morgan said that the definition of assault weapons including the list of guns that constitute them was largely pulled from the federal assault weapons ban which went into effect in 1994 but sunset in 2004 is it constitutional it is all but certain that illinois assault weapons ban if enacted would be challenged in court gun rights advocates have said as much we re not negotiating we re not going to school them on all of the technical flaws of this said dan eldridge president of the federal firearms licensees of illinois and owner of maxon shooter s supplies and indoor range in des plaines we re simply going to take them to court because they have the votes we understand and the governor wants an assault weapon ban in his resume as he has national ambitions he wants all this so the political winds are pretty much in our face here he said we understand that but it doesn t matter what they pass you cannot do this you just simply can t and they won t win some states do have bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines in place several municipalities in illinois do as well passing them during a grace period in 2013 ahead of the state s concealed carry law which included a provision that made gun regulation exclusively a state function taking effect highland park s assault weapons ban was upheld by a federal court in 2015 if we took our legal advice from the nra we might as well just legalize fully automatic weapons flamethrowers and grenade launchers morgan said the reality is the u s supreme court is very clear that a significant amount of common sense gun reforms are constitutional and legal however there is genuine uncertainty over whether several of the components of illinois house democrats proposal would pass constitutional muster at issue is a recent u s supreme court decision that significantly altered the way courts interpret the constitutionality of gun restrictions in new york state rifle pistol association inc v bruen the nation s high court in a 6 3 decision found that new york state s concealed carry law which required that a person show a greater need for protection than the average person to be permitted to carry outside the home was unconstitutional the landmark decision found that americans have a broad right to carry a concealed firearm outside the home the first major expansion of gun rights since district of columbia v heller in 2008 and mcdonald v city of chicago in 2012 which affirmed the rights of people to possess firearms in the home though the substance of the decision does not directly relate to an assault weapons ban the court laid out a new process for evaluating all second amendment cases so that s the aspect that s going to be very impactful going forward in all of these types of cases including cases like challenges to assault weapons bans challenges to large capacity magazine restrictions the type of things that illinois is considering said andrew willinger executive director of the duke center for firearms law the previous framework for examining gun laws was to first determine if the second amendment was implicated in any way then an analysis would be done to determine the objective the government was seeking to advance in its regulation how effective it was and the burden it would impose on gun owners however the supreme court in bruen rejected this second step instead the government now has to prove that the law they are defending has a well established and representative historical analogue which basically means there s a longstanding tradition of regulation this is open to interpretation and there have been few samples of cases being decided since the bruen decision came down certainly now after bruen i think most gun regulations are going to be challenged just because it s unclear how this historical test is going to play out willinger said and if judges construe it narrowly then a lot of gun laws will be on sort of tenuous footing immediately following bruen the supreme court vacated several lower court decisions that upheld gun restrictions including an assault weapons ban in maryland and ban on high capacity magazines in california and new jersey asking those courts to reconsider their decisions using the new framework maryland and california s laws are still working through the appellate court process but are expected to be decided in the next few weeks or months rhode island s ban on high capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds was upheld by a federal judge last week in oregon where voters approved a similar ban it remains to be decided though a federal judge indicated that it would likely be upheld willinger said that based on the limited evidence large capacity magazine bans appear likely to be upheld while assault weapons bans may come down to the types of weapons included and how widespread their uses are would it be effective for morgan the answer to this question is simple if a handgun had been used in the highland park mass shooting on the fourth of july more of my neighbors would be alive today he said expert opinions are less clear with some studies showing a reduction in mass shootings and the lethality of gun violence with assault weapons and high capacity magazine bans in place but others such as the rand corporation which analyzed a series of studies found inconclusive evidence for the effect of assault weapon bans on mass shootings kim smith director of programs at the university of chicago crime lab and education lab told lawmakers last week that three quarters of shootings stem from an altercation that happens to take place in proximity to a gun one way to reduce gun violence she said was to make the situations in which those arguments occur more forgiving the best way to do that is to limit the widespread availability of illegal guns particularly those equipped with high capacity magazines smith said without the presence of a gun altercations would still happen but they would be far less likely to result in deaths delrice adams executive director of the illinois criminal justice information authority agreed telling lawmakers that research has shown that bans on these lethal weapons are associated with significant reductions in the rate of fatal mass shooting incidents and victims killed during the 10 years that our country had that ban there was a 40 decrease in gun violence by assault weapons adams said however since the expiration of this ban the number of mass shooting deaths has grown by nearly 500 according to a 2021 northwestern medicine study the federal assault weapons ban in effect from 1994 to 2004 was highly effective at reducing mass shootings the authors estimated that the ban prevented 10 mass shootings and that its continuation would have prevented 30 mass shootings that killed 339 people and injured 1 139 no matter which dataset you use no matter how you measure mass shootings there s a benefit and a reduction in mass shootings and lethality and number of injuries said lori ann post director of the buehler center for health policy and economics at northwestern university and one of the study s lead authors still the report noted that about 50 000 people die from gun injuries each year with mass shootings accounting for just about 1 of those deaths but mass shooting incidents have risen significantly over the past two decades according to the fbi the number of active shooter incidents defined as one or more individuals actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in a populated area rose from three in 2000 to 40 in 2020 and rates of gun deaths in general have risen as well with the johns hopkins study finding that from 2011 to 2020 illinois rate increased 64 it wasn t just chicago the study found the highest gun death rates in that time were in st clair massac and vermillion counties but even if an assault weapons ban is enacted holes would remain for one illinois is surrounded by states with looser gun restrictions making it difficult to regulate the flow of guns into the state and with the grandfather clause on assault weapons many will still be legally owned across the state even advocates acknowledge that the legislation would only be one part of a more holistic solution to reduce gun violence while legislation strategies are critical to addressing gun violence and mass shootings we simultaneously must invest in community violence intervention initiatives smith said the state has already started in a sense in 2021 lawmakers approved the reimagining public safety act which directed 250 million over three years toward community based violence prevention initiatives morgan said the solution to gun violence is not an either or and that lawmakers had to treat it with the complexity that the issue demands gun violence is not a binary issue that can be solved with one change morgan said really we got to this point through systemic disinvestment and the only way we re going to really reduce gun violence is through addressing all the elements of the communities struggling with these issues the legislation will likely be heard during the lame duck session

with global supply chain disruptions at an all time high companies are having to source alternative supplies within their pricing structure to meet end user demand beyond this the war in ukraine continues to have a strong impact on the manufacturing industry with more disruptions imminent as it continues to account for inflated prices and material shortages across the manufacturing industry alternate product modifications have played a role in addressing these challenges to effectively mitigate the effects of disruptions and optimize resilience organizations must adequately assess risk across their supply chain establish alternate sources of supply and implement effective spend management solutions assess risk across the supply chain first and foremost manufacturers must assess risk across their supply chain this is crucial for identifying risks and deciphering the value chains of all products moreover as interest rates and inflation are expected to rise further a supply chain risk assessment would help standardize processes to identify analyze evaluate and mitigate supply challenges by the end of 2023 we anticipate interest rates will level out however inflation is only expected to drop to four percent in the united states a couple percentage points above where it was pre pandemic it should be recognized that disruption can come from anywhere and manufacturers need to be prepared with complete visibility when this occurs business networks provide track and trace solutions that deliver an added level of visibility as they re fully integrated in the overall planning production and fulfillment processes of an organization these solutions can help companies connect with a multitude of suppliers logistics providers equipment repair vendors and other business partners worldwide additionally these solutions make it possible to avoid costly peer to peer connections shifting support to center on n tier supply chain visibility and collaboration identify alternate sources of supply in a recent sap survey business leaders said their current supply chain issues stem primarily from global political unrest 58 percent lack of raw materials 44 percent and rising fuel and energy costs 40 percent only 31 percent cited inflation as a major contributor furthermore 50 percent of business leaders expect reduced availability of raw materials in the united states in 2023 so we should expect many manufacturers to implement preemptive tactics to combat future shortages here are some of the tactics organizations are implementing a shift to just in case supply chain management nearly two in three companies 64 percent are moving away from just in time supply chains to a just in case scenario by increasing the amount of inventory they store in fact 63 percent say the united states should adopt this approach to overcome potential supply chain crises when it comes to the just in case strategy it s a double edged sword because companies will have to spend more to stock more inventory leveraging of business networks for proactive sourcing another effective approach is to assess risk and identify alternate sources proactively leveraging the visibility and connectivity offered by business networks these networks also enable buyers to onboard suppliers quickly another effective approach is to assess risk and identify alternate sources proactively leveraging the visibility and connectivity offered by business networks these networks also enable buyers to onboard suppliers quickly diversification of the supply chain organizations are switching up their suppliers ꟷ and not just to counter inflation or disruption from the u s perspective supplier diversity is higher on an organization s radar than in other parts of the world this is largely due to an increase in consumer demand and state regulation such as california s supplier diversity legislation beyond this leveraging multi sourcing helps to create flexibility and mitigate the effects of unprecedented risks during the pandemic organizations failed to adopt a true multi sourcing strategy as they were often sourcing from the same region with the right network and visibility making supplier diversity a priority in procurement is achievable leverage spend management solutions digitalization helps manufacturers be more efficient when technology solutions are implemented organizations have greater time to focus on strategic priorities including diversifying suppliers working toward sustainability goals and achieving other business objectives this is why spend management solutions are on the top of every cfo s agenda especially in the shifting post pandemic workforce geographical dispersity defined as the physical dispersion of group members across geographically distant locations has necessitated the use of technology solutions to improve and ultimately streamline business processes including procurement and supply chain one way manufacturers are doing this is to use software technology for scenario planning this helps decision makers identify a wide range of potential outcomes and impacts evaluate ways to respond and manage potential outcomes ꟷ both positive and negative organizations can decide upon what templates and formalized frameworks for scenario planning make the most sense for their teams to implement this tactic can also reveal cost effective solutions because executives have more insight into potential impacts as well as the cash flow they could gain by mitigating potential risks ultimately in today s uniquely volatile environment manufacturers have to be agile and adaptive in their approach to addressing disruption it is only once businesses have a strategy in place to overcome these challenges as they appear that they can be on the right track for a brighter future where they re capable of optimizing resilient supply chains gordon donovan is the global market research director procurement and supply at sap
the fundamentals that buoyed thermal coal stocks sharply higher this year are now unwinding coal stocks like peabody energy btu 5 01 and consol energy ceix 4 05 may be among 2022 s biggest winners but don t look for the same sort of bullish results in 2023 investors planning to stick with these stocks for the long haul may want to brace themselves the circumstances driving thermal coal names higher this year are already unwinding as we prepare to flip the calendar a perfect storm natural gas prices were certainly high in late 2021 but few people expected the commodity s price to continue racing to highs reached in the middle of this year with no other cost effective choices readily available many of the world s electricity production plants were forced to revert to generating power by burning coal rather than gas even if only temporarily to this end the international energy agency estimates worldwide coal consumption will rise 1 2 this year eclipsing 8 billion tonnes of usage for the first time it s proven a boon for miners like the aforementioned consol energy and peabody energy which dig up the thermal coal well suited for this application stocks of these two outfits are up 182 and 220 year to date respectively fueled by what s been roughly a tripling of thermal coal prices since the advance began back in 2020 shares of thermal coal miners arch resources and alliance resource partners have been star performers this year as well even if not as strong as peabody and consol don t look for coal consumption to slow in 2023 either the international energy agency iea is forecasting the coming year s consumption of coal will look much like this year s china already the world s biggest user of the fossil fuel accounting for roughly half the global market is projected to burn more coal in 2023 than it will in 2022 what is likely changing for the worse however is the high price of coal many miners have been enjoying lately the thermal coal party is winding down the coal mining industry can expand or shrink its capacity as needed what coal miners can t do though is expand or shrink their capacity on the fly it takes time to bring more production online it even takes time to take capacity offline the industry didn t have much time to adapt coming out of 2021 and through 2022 when among other things russia invaded ukraine fanning the flames of higher coal prices it now seems they ve had enough time to address these unique challenges just this september alliance resource partners announced plans to develop a new mine in henderson kentucky defying efforts to phase out usage of the fossil fuel meanwhile india china and indonesia all intend to ramp up their production of thermal coal in 2023 although most of that increased output also will be used by and within these three nations the decision still frees up global supplies of the energy creating mineral that s why fitch ratings is forecasting a sizable dip in the price of thermal coal from around 300 per tonne now to 220 per tonne next year and en route to less than 100 per tonne in 2024 indeed the price contraction may already be underway and it s not just fitch fearing the impact of demand headwinds coupled with improving supplies consol energy s senior vice president dan connell recently commented we re still projecting us domestic coal production to actually decrease in 2023 versus 2022 pointing to broader renewed efforts to replace thermal coal with cleaner power producing options connell s view is arguably a proxy for the entire industry s current worries to this end fitch ratings estimates the world s coal mining companies will suffer nearly a 7 decline in revenue in the coming year followed by nearly an 8 sales dip in 2024 earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda margins in turn are projected to fall from this year s 42 to 37 8 in 2023 and 32 9 by 2024 more risk less reward ahead it s not all bad news the aforementioned alliance resources has inked deals assuring the sale of 5 6 million tons of thermal coal at prices supporting higher margins through 2025 peabody used this year s windfall to pay down debt its total liabilities stood at just under 2 8 billion as of the end of september down from over 3 1 billion a year earlier it could be enough to allow the miner to start paying dividends at least according to b riley securities analyst lucas pipes certainly a few miners have derived some sustainable benefit from the business s unusual circumstances think bigger picture though not all mining thermal coal mining companies were able to lock in price contracts and certainly any new customers will be paying then current coal prices fitch expects to fall in 2023 and then fall again in 2024 interest rates have also soared this year setting the stage for costlier capital in the foreseeable future and most coal miners were already paying above average interest rates because they pose above average risk to lenders the single biggest loan on consol s books is costing the company 11 per year and that credit line s interest rate is a floating rate that could continue to rise other miners are facing similar interest rate challenges connect the dots this new paradigm isn t proving problematic for coal companies just yet or their stocks given how the thermal coal market is primed to shift back to pre 2021 pressures and prices though these stocks could be up ended with little to no warning tread lightly if you re planning on sticking with any of these holdings

enthusiasm for investing that stock trading can be a worthwhile endeavor offering not just personal financial rewards but in his view benefits for society too a native of toyama prefecture in central japan watanabe started his career as a sales employee at a nomura branch in tokyo s high end ginza shopping district and quickly developed a passion for picking winners in the markets however his view of his career was shaken when a massive earthquake and tsunami pounded japan s northeast in march 2011 leaving about 16 000 dead and more than 2 500 unaccounted for his first reaction to news footage showing a giant tsunami turning coastal towns into rubble he recalled was to wonder what stocks will go up next week then i thought what am i thinking watanabe 55 said in an interview it felt as if i were liberated from brainwashing that was a turning point he began to see stocks not just as a means to make money but as a way to help grow companies that provide necessary goods and services and maintain employment that led him to view his role as helping direct the flow of money in ways that could help the japanese economy he said after serving as a managing director at nomura he left the company and launched million eyes co in 2016 a for profit investment school that focuses on training self sufficient individual investors his idea is to tap more than 1 000 trillion yen of savings in the country to drive a shift toward investment a significant swing would pour funds into promising companies on a massive scale helping revive japan s economy and eventually benefiting investors he said japan s public keeps much more of its financial assets in savings than its counterparts abroad according to the bank of japan cash and deposits accounted for 54 3 percent of financial assets held by japanese households in march 2022 against 13 7 percent in the united states and 34 5 percent in europe in contrast stocks represented only 10 2 percent of the total in japan compared with 39 8 percent in the united states and 19 5 percent in europe watanabe s idea concords with prime minister fumio kishida s policy goal of reviving the japanese economy through investment but financial motives alone are not enough to convince risk averse japanese people to buy stocks he said it s ingrained in our dna that if you pursue greed you will be punished watanabe said rather we should think of investment just like making an offering at a shrine if you have an altruistic mind that will eventually come back to you just like old folktales to help his students develop a discerning eye for good companies watanabe encourages them to carefully read kaisha shikiho companies quarterly a phone book thick investment guide published quarterly that details financial information about all of the more than 3 800 listed companies in japan though considered japan s bible of investment even professional investors rarely read the tome which has more than 2 000 pages from cover to cover he said but watanabe has done so for the past 25 years on a september day this year he accomplished the extraordinary feat of finishing his 100th issue of kaisha shikiho since he began reading it at the direction of his senior colleague in 1997 i started reading it because i was scared of him watanabe said but i have come to understand the japanese economy and even world economy better through it it has really enriched my life by studying every page of the book over many years readers can notice slight changes in the economy such as new business trends and how government policies like tax hikes affect companies which will help them find the next toyota or sony he said mr watanabe sometimes teaches us the signs of change in japanese companies that even we are not aware of said naoki yamamoto manager of the kaisha shikiho center at toyo keizai inc he is our ideal reader the school called fukugan keizai jyuku has drawn more than 3 500 students so far with about half of them in their 30s and 40s women accounted for about 30 percent of the total watanabe says the school s stance to focus not just on investment advice but also on companies histories and corporate philosophies may have helped attract people traditionally less interested in investment such as young people and women his students are often surprised by how they are surrounded by so many listed companies in their daily lives without knowing it for example hyojito co exclusively makes map boards at train stations while suminoe textile co supplies red carpets to japan s diet i have developed a habit of thinking of investment as something related to my work said toshiko amagasa a student of the school who works in the restaurant industry the school really changed how i see things she said the key to success is investing in companies the same way you would a child watanabe said you invest in a company because you simply want to support it he said if everyone did that the japanese economy would change
they did a pretty good job on friday stock markets have taken investors on a roller coaster ride lately with a relentless oscillation between up days and down days on friday bullish investors got the better of things sending the dow jones industrial average dji 0 17 and s p 500 gspc 0 21 up by more than 0 5 the nasdaq composite s ixic 0 12 gain was more modest extending the narrative that has played out through just about all of 2022 index daily percentage change daily point change dow 0 53 176 s p 500 0 59 22 nasdaq 0 21 22 even as some technology stocks continued to struggle on friday the market s best performing sector of 2022 once again reasserted its dominion over wall street energy stocks moved sharply higher and many believe that even though they produced huge gains this year the biggest companies in oil and natural gas could once again have a positive impact on the stock market come 2023 how energy stocks fared friday many stocks in the energy sector saw solid gains on friday among the biggest names dow component chevron cvx 0 83 rose by 3 while fellow oil giant exxonmobil closed the session 2 6 higher some smaller companies saw even bigger gains exploration and production company conocophillips finished the day more than 4 higher while apa was up nearly 6 and chord energy managed a 5 gain oilfield services specialists also enjoyed gains slb and baker hughes each picked up about 3 on the day while halliburton was up by 4 even refining companies joined in on the positive mood valero energy finished the trading day 4 higher while marathon petroleum posted a 3 1 gain and phillips 66 was up 3 4 rising energy prices are helping stocks the rises in energy stocks were driven largely by increases in the prices of energy commodities west texas intermediate crude oil finished higher by nearly 2 per barrel approaching the 80 mark brent crude was up more than 2 50 per barrel moving above 84 refined products saw even larger gains on a percentage basis gasoline futures were up by more than 0 12 per gallon to 2 38 while heating oil also rose 0 12 per gallon to 3 21 natural gas prices climbed 0 09 to close the day back above 5 what s coming in 2023 long term investors need to remember though that many of the factors that move energy stocks from day to day are fleeting by nature for instance many energy market participants said that worries about the impact of the massive winter storm hitting much of the u s this week are affecting prices with particular concern that the cold and snowy weather will force production and refining activity to a temporary halt that won t necessarily have any lasting impact on long term supply and demand but it could produce significant volatility in energy markets over a period of days or weeks there are though some things that could happen in 2023 that would potentially send energy prices higher china s economy has been sluggish in part because of its pandemic restrictions but as its relaxation of its zero covid policies moves forward its energy demand could dramatically increase moreover if the war in ukraine continues we could see production cuts from russia a major energy commodity exporter as price caps imposed on russian crude have already led the kremlin to announce it was cutting volumes at the same time though some other events could weigh on the energy sector a recession in the u s and other major world economies could reduce global industrial activity diminishing energy demand moreover if the war between russia and ukraine were to end that could lead to the removal or reduction of sanctions which in turn could lead to greater supplies of oil and natural gas hitting the market what investors shouldn t count on though is energy stocks repeating in 2023 the 62 rise they have delivered so far in 2022 even under positive scenarios more modest gains are much more likely and it ll be interesting to see how it all plays out in the year to come

holdings inc f45 or the company nyse fxlv in the united states district court western district of texas austin division on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired f45 securities pursuant to the f45 s july 2021 ipo both dates inclusive the class period investors have until february 6 2023 to apply to the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit click here to participate in the action f45 is a fitness franchisor with a business model based on rapid growth through the franchising of low overhead fitness facilities the company was founded in sydney australia in 2013 and by the time of the company s july 16 2021 initial public offering more fully described below maintained 2 801 franchises in 68 countries plaintiff brings this class action on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock stock or shares of f45 pursuant and or traceable to the company s false and or misleading form s 1 registration statement and accompanying prospectus and supplemental prospectus collectively the registration statement issued in connection with the company s july 16 2021 initial public offering of 18 75 million shares of common stock priced at 16 per share the july 2021 ipo or the offering to pursue remedies under sections 11 and 15 of the securities act of 1933 the securities act as set forth in the prospectus issued in support of the july 2021 ipo the company asserted that the proceeds would be used inter alia to repay indebtedness to complete the purchase of flywheel indoor cycling studio to pay bonuses to certain employees to pay expenses related to the offering and for working capital and general corporate purposes in support of the july 2021 ipo f45 s registration statement professed and represented its advantage over traditional owner operated fitness facilities both because the franchise model has enabled us to open new studios at an accelerated pace versus the owner operator model and because it generated quick revenue for the company because or the majority of franchises that we sell we receive an upfront payment from the franchisee however due to the material misstatements and omissions contained therein defendants registration statement was false and misleading regarding the company s revenue stream and its ability to maintain its rapid expansion business model in its prospectus the company noted that it intended to emphasize the growth of multi unit franchisees over single unit franchisees stating that as of march 31 2021 pproximately 49 of total franchises sold are owned by single unit franchisee owners with the other 51 owned by multi unit franchisees the company stated that s we pursue opportunities to develop multi unit franchise systems with financial partners we expect the percentage of multi unit franchisees to increase over time however at the time the registration statement did not disclose that f45 could not maintain new franchise growth because it was offering more favorable payment terms to multi unit franchisees the registration statement merely represented that he upfront establishment fee is payable by the franchisee upon signing a new franchise agreement in truth as of the july 2021 ipo and as the company would later acknowledge f45 provided for modified payment terms for large multiunit deals this would and did ultimately result in material increases to accounts receivable and lower cash flow for the company f45 s approach to starting new franchises was not sustainable over the long term as the company was not being and would not be repaid by multi unit franchise owners quickly enough to maintain significant franchise growth indeed in the first and second quarters of 2022 f45reported just 117 and 92 new franchise openings respectively compared to 96 studio openings in the first quarter of 2020 when the covid 19 pandemic began this lackluster pace of growth was accompanied by a massive and unsustainable increase in f45 s accounts receivable and a similar and equally unsustainable decrease in its cash and cash equivalents these practices were not sustainable at the time of the ipo when the company could no longer sustain this defective business model its growth rate and revenue plummeted then on july 26 2022 just a year after the ipo and just a little more than two months after reiterating its growth targets f45 issued a press release titled f45 announces strategic update the press release described strategic updates to align the company more closely with macroeconomic conditions and current business trends and prepare for the next phase of studio and membership growth according to the press release the company s strategic updates informed the market 1 of a significant reduction in its financial guidance from a range of 255 to 275 million to a new range of 120 to 130 million 2 of a dramatic cut in the number of new exercise studios that it would open in 2022 down approximately 60 or 350 to 450 new studios versus 1 000 3 that a 250 million credit line will not be available 4 that it was letting go of about 110 employees equaling approximately 45 of its workforce and 5 that ceo adam gilchrist had resigned his position as ceo effective july 24 2022 importantly more adverse news was disclosed in the july 26 2022 strategic updates the company disclosed that for the full year net franchises sold would be between 350 and 450 a fraction of the prior guidance of 1 500 and that full year net initial studio openings would be between 350 and 450 compared to the prior guidance of 1 000 as a consequence of its infirm business model and condition existing at the time of the july 2021 ipo f45 was also forced to substantially slash guidance for the full year 2022 revenue to just between 120 million and 130 million compared to the prior guidance of 255 million to 275 million and full year adjusted ebitda between 25 million and 30 million compared to the prior guidance of 90 million to 100 million signaling a dramatic decrease in its business and momentum the july 26 2022 adverse disclosures caused the trading price of f45 to plunge over 60 from a close at 3 51 on july 26 to close at 1 35 on july 27 2022 and representing more than a 78 decline from its offering price of 16 per share on july 16 2021 just slightly more than a year

new york dec 23 2022 globe newswire bragar eagel squire p c a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against generac holdings inc generac or the company nyse gnrc in the united states district court of eastern wisconsin on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired generac securities between april 29 2021 and november 1 2022 both dates inclusive the class period investors have until january 30 2023 to apply to the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit click here to participate in the action this action arises from repeated misrepresentations by generac and its senior executives that concealed from investors a defective component at the core of generac s solar power products that component the snaprs was intended to perform an essential safety function by rapidly shutting down solar devices in certain dangerous situations rather than protecting consumers the snaprs would overheat melt and in some cases start fires defendants knew that the versions of the snaprs installed in thousands of homes were defective and dangerous numerous consumers filed complaints with regulators and generac s business partners that sold installed and serviced generac s solar products informed the company of the snaprs defect instead of warning investors and consumers defendants continued to tout the success and reliability of generac s solar energy products while quietly making minor modifications to the snaprs including issuing a firmware update after these modifications failed to fix the snaprs defendants continued to mislead investors generac relied on channel partners to sell service and install its solar battery storage systems including power home solar llc d b a pink energy pink energy baker electric home energy posigen and valley solar during the class period pink energy was the largest of these partners with operations in 15 states among other deceptions generac misled investors about its dependence on pink energy falsely assuring investors that no single customer or partner drove more than 6 of its sales and that generac had a broad and diverse network of distribution partners generac also misled investors about its financial condition by failing to account for its liability for warranty claims arising from the defective snaprs by misrepresenting its warranty liability generac also overstated its earnings throughout the class period and falsely assured investors that the company s financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap investors began to learn the truth about generac s defective snaprs on august 1 2022 when pink energy filed a lawsuit against generac revealing that the company s defective snaprs components caused millions of dollars of damage giving rise to liability that threatened pink energy s solvency the pink energy complaint the disclosures in the pink energy complaint caused the price of generac shares to decline by 3 31 per share the liability created by defective snaprs components ultimately forced pink energy to declare bankruptcy on october 7 2022 in the wake of pink energy s bankruptcy on october 19 2022 generac revealed that it had taken pre tax charges totaling approximately 55 million including approximately 37 million of clean energy product warranty related matter and approximately 18 million of bad debt expense related to a clean energy product customer that has filed for bankruptcy the 37 million charge related to warranty expenses appears to reflect generac s belated acknowledgment of its increased liability to redress defective snaprs units the 18 million charge related to bad debt expense reflects receivables owed by pink energy and possibly other partners or customers burdened with defective snaprs products that would not be paid the october 19 disclosures caused the price of generac shares to decline by 37 44 per share or 25 on november 2 2022 generac released its earnings results for the third quarter of 2022 and lowered sales guidance on its solar energy business for the remainder of the year by approximately 40 on a conference call with investors and analysts held that same day generac s ceo defendant jagdfeld attributed the lowered guidance to the loss of a major customer during the quarter along with the specific warranty related issue i e the defective snaprs component and the pink energy bankruptcy that resulted directly from that defect analysts expressed shock upon learning how dependent generac s clean energy business was on pink energy with several analysts noting that investors had not been told of the significant concentration of that business with a single partner as a result of these disclosures the price of generac shares declined by 8 99 per share or 8 through this action plaintiffs seek an award of damages to compensate generac stockholders for defendants

new york dec 23 2022 globe newswire bragar eagel squire p c a nationally recognized stockholder rights law firm reminds investors that a class action lawsuit has been filed against f45 training holdings inc f45 or the company nyse fxlv in the united states district court western district of texas austin division on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired f45 securities pursuant to the f45 s july 2021 ipo both dates inclusive the class period investors have until february 6 2023 to apply to the court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit click here to participate in the action f45 is a fitness franchisor with a business model based on rapid growth through the franchising of low overhead fitness facilities the company was founded in sydney australia in 2013 and by the time of the company s july 16 2021 initial public offering more fully described below maintained 2 801 franchises in 68 countries plaintiff brings this class action on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired the common stock stock or shares of f45 pursuant and or traceable to the company s false and or misleading form s 1 registration statement and accompanying prospectus and supplemental prospectus collectively the registration statement issued in connection with the company s july 16 2021 initial public offering of 18 75 million shares of common stock priced at 16 per share the july 2021 ipo or the offering to pursue remedies under sections 11 and 15 of the securities act of 1933 the securities act as set forth in the prospectus issued in support of the july 2021 ipo the company asserted that the proceeds would be used inter alia to repay indebtedness to complete the purchase of flywheel indoor cycling studio to pay bonuses to certain employees to pay expenses related to the offering and for working capital and general corporate purposes in support of the july 2021 ipo f45 s registration statement professed and represented its advantage over traditional owner operated fitness facilities both because the franchise model has enabled us to open new studios at an accelerated pace versus the owner operator model and because it generated quick revenue for the company because or the majority of franchises that we sell we receive an upfront payment from the franchisee however due to the material misstatements and omissions contained therein defendants registration statement was false and misleading regarding the company s revenue stream and its ability to maintain its rapid expansion business model in its prospectus the company noted that it intended to emphasize the growth of multi unit franchisees over single unit franchisees stating that as of march 31 2021 pproximately 49 of total franchises sold are owned by single unit franchisee owners with the other 51 owned by multi unit franchisees the company stated that s we pursue opportunities to develop multi unit franchise systems with financial partners we expect the percentage of multi unit franchisees to increase over time however at the time the registration statement did not disclose that f45 could not maintain new franchise growth because it was offering more favorable payment terms to multi unit franchisees the registration statement merely represented that he upfront establishment fee is payable by the franchisee upon signing a new franchise agreement in truth as of the july 2021 ipo and as the company would later acknowledge f45 provided for modified payment terms for large multiunit deals this would and did ultimately result in material increases to accounts receivable and lower cash flow for the company f45 s approach to starting new franchises was not sustainable over the long term as the company was not being and would not be repaid by multi unit franchise owners quickly enough to maintain significant franchise growth indeed in the first and second quarters of 2022 f45reported just 117 and 92 new franchise openings respectively compared to 96 studio openings in the first quarter of 2020 when the covid 19 pandemic began this lackluster pace of growth was accompanied by a massive and unsustainable increase in f45 s accounts receivable and a similar and equally unsustainable decrease in its cash and cash equivalents these practices were not sustainable at the time of the ipo when the company could no longer sustain this defective business model its growth rate and revenue plummeted then on july 26 2022 just a year after the ipo and just a little more than two months after reiterating its growth targets f45 issued a press release titled f45 announces strategic update the press release described strategic updates to align the company more closely with macroeconomic conditions and current business trends and prepare for the next phase of studio and membership growth according to the press release the company s strategic updates informed the market 1 of a significant reduction in its financial guidance from a range of 255 to 275 million to a new range of 120 to 130 million 2 of a dramatic cut in the number of new exercise studios that it would open in 2022 down approximately 60 or 350 to 450 new studios versus 1 000 3 that a 250 million credit line will not be available 4 that it was letting go of about 110 employees equaling approximately 45 of its workforce and 5 that ceo adam gilchrist had resigned his position as ceo effective july 24 2022 importantly more adverse news was disclosed in the july 26 2022 strategic updates the company disclosed that for the full year net franchises sold would be between 350 and 450 a fraction of the prior guidance of 1 500 and that full year net initial studio openings would be between 350 and 450 compared to the prior guidance of 1 000 as a consequence of its infirm business model and condition existing at the time of the july 2021 ipo f45 was also forced to substantially slash guidance for the full year 2022 revenue to just between 120 million and 130 million compared to the prior guidance of 255 million to 275 million and full year adjusted ebitda between 25 million and 30 million compared to the prior guidance of 90 million to 100 million signaling a dramatic decrease in its business and momentum the july 26 2022 adverse disclosures caused the trading price of f45 to plunge over 60 from a close at 3 51 on july 26 to close at 1 35 on july 27 2022 and representing more than a 78 decline from its offering price of 16 per share on july 16 2021 just slightly more than a year

that component the snaprs was intended to perform an essential safety function by rapidly shutting down solar devices in certain dangerous situations rather than protecting consumers the snaprs would overheat melt and in some cases start fires defendants knew that the versions of the snaprs installed in thousands of homes were defective and dangerous numerous consumers filed complaints with regulators and generac s business partners that sold installed and serviced generac s solar products informed the company of the snaprs defect instead of warning investors and consumers defendants continued to tout the success and reliability of generac s solar energy products while quietly making minor modifications to the snaprs including issuing a firmware update after these modifications failed to fix the snaprs defendants continued to mislead investors generac relied on channel partners to sell service and install its solar battery storage systems including power home solar llc d b a pink energy pink energy baker electric home energy posigen and valley solar during the class period pink energy was the largest of these partners with operations in 15 states among other deceptions generac misled investors about its dependence on pink energy falsely assuring investors that no single customer or partner drove more than 6 of its sales and that generac had a broad and diverse network of distribution partners generac also misled investors about its financial condition by failing to account for its liability for warranty claims arising from the defective snaprs by misrepresenting its warranty liability generac also overstated its earnings throughout the class period and falsely assured investors that the company s financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap investors began to learn the truth about generac s defective snaprs on august 1 2022 when pink energy filed a lawsuit against generac revealing that the company s defective snaprs components caused millions of dollars of damage giving rise to liability that threatened pink energy s solvency the pink energy complaint the disclosures in the pink energy complaint caused the price of generac shares to decline by 3 31 per share the liability created by defective snaprs components ultimately forced pink energy to declare bankruptcy on october 7 2022 in the wake of pink energy s bankruptcy on october 19 2022 generac revealed that it had taken pre tax charges totaling approximately 55 million including approximately 37 million of clean energy product warranty related matter and approximately 18 million of bad debt expense related to a clean energy product customer that has filed for bankruptcy the 37 million charge related to warranty expenses appears to reflect generac s belated acknowledgment of its increased liability to redress defective snaprs units the 18 million charge related to bad debt expense reflects receivables owed by pink energy and possibly other partners or customers burdened with defective snaprs products that would not be paid the october 19 disclosures caused the price of generac shares to decline by 37 44 per share or 25 on november 2 2022 generac released its earnings results for the third quarter of 2022 and lowered sales guidance on its solar energy business for the remainder of the year by approximately 40 on a conference call with investors and analysts held that same day generac s ceo defendant jagdfeld attributed the lowered guidance to the loss of a major customer during the quarter along with the specific warranty related issue i e the defective snaprs component and the pink energy bankruptcy that resulted directly from that defect analysts expressed shock upon learning how dependent generac s clean energy business was on pink energy with several analysts noting that investors had not been told of the significant concentration of that business with a single partner as a result of these disclosures the price of generac shares declined by 8 99 per share or 8 through this action plaintiffs seek an award of damages to compensate generac stockholders for defendants misrepresentations as set forth herein if you purchased or otherwise acquired generac shares and suffered a loss are a long term stockholder have information would like to learn more about these
