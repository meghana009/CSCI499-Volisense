not every stock that s been down for the past few weeks is actually at risk of a sales and earnings slowdown the environment has changed dramatically in just the past few months a year ago stocks could do no wrong buying anything on the dip usually worked out well now just when it feels like the market can t move any lower it does it s understandable that investors are now broadly seeking out safe havens and reliable dividends in particular with that as the backdrop here s a closer look at three safe dividend stocks you may want to buy now just in case the current turbulence is warning of a recession and bear market that will likely drag most stocks lower nextera energy dividend yield 2 4 nextera energy nee 0 52 may not be the market s best known utility name but it is quietly one of the world s biggest power providers its florida power light company subsidiary delivers electricity to 5 7 million homes and businesses in florida it s also the world s largest renewable energy generator wholesaling electricity largely produced by wind and the sun via a business called nextera energy resources it s remained relatively unfamiliar largely because the company only started using the moniker in 2010 and was still piecing itself together at the time while other utility outfits like southern company and duke energy enjoy a decades old pedigree nextera energy s young age however is also the reason it s such a compelling dividend prospect it s been built from the ground up with the future of energy in mind and without as much fossil fuel baggage as aforementioned names like duke and southern company not only is it already ahead of its competition in this regard but nextera s real zero plan also lays out a credible path to becoming a true zero carbon power producer by 2045 while it remains to be seen what the green energy regulatory environment will look like 20 years from now nextera looks more ready for this evolution than any other name in the business it has 9 500 megawatts worth of solar power installations alone planned for the next 10 years for instance in the meantime the company that would eventually become nextera hasn t failed to pay a dividend in any quarter since 1995 and hasn t failed to raise its annual payout in each of the past 26 years nextera energy even told investors it believes it will be able to raise its full year payout by 10 per year at least through 2024 that makes it one of the best dividend growers out there advance auto parts dividend yield 3 6 stepping into a retailer s stock right now doesn t just sound a tad questionable in light of last month s consumer spending slowdown and red flags of a looming recession it seems downright crazy advance auto parts aap 0 60 however defies that obvious logic for a less than obvious reason auto repairs and car maintenance never really slow down regardless of the economic environment as of its latest tally advance auto parts operates nearly 5 000 retail stores all across north america generating a little over 11 billion worth of sales over the course of the past four reported quarters incredibly though it s facing the same supply chain problems automobile manufacturers are that figure is better than pre covid 2019 s top line of 9 7 billion which somehow grew to 10 1 billion in covid crimped 2020 this year s projected top line of more than 3 5 billion will improve on last year s figure and should grow another 4 in 2023 to reach 11 8 billion earnings are growing at an even faster clip with profit margins improving as the company scales up some investors are surprised to see this sort of resiliency those people who understand the automotive business well however understand that as cars become more expensive and less disposable repairing them and keeping them in good running order is an investment rather than expense this dynamic isn t apt to change anytime soon either the company isn t a dividend aristocrat it s not even close in fact despite years of growth advance auto parts didn t get serious about paying or raising its dividends until 2020 in the midst of the pandemic now that the ball s rolling though it s not likely to stop the auto parts retailer upped its quarterly per share payout by 50 earlier this year yet that payout is still only about 40 of its typical per share earnings verizon dividend yield 5 2 finally add verizon communications vz 0 98 to your list of extremely safe dividend stocks to buy now it s not a company that needs much in the way of an introduction verizon of course is one of the u s s top wireless service providers handling 115 million consumer accounts as of the end of the first quarter and nearly 28 million more business accounts it also manages a cable television and broadband business though these clearly aren t its core profit engine although the company is forever innovating new products and services verizon s never going to deliver high growth again pew research estimates that 97 of americans now own a cellphone and 85 of the population owns a smartphone and therefore already have a mobile data plan the market itself is pretty well saturated and while population growth and winning more market share could help expand the top line it can t help enough to drive double digit growth innovations like private 5g wireless networks and emergency responder solutions are mostly natural extensions of its existing offerings for investors seeking out safe reliable dividend income though it doesn t matter consumers are practically addicted to their mobile phones and willingly pay their monthly bill to keep them connected verizon just needs to make sure its service is strong enough to keep its existing customers in the fold while winning its fair share of any market growth and it does this just fine last quarter s postpaid churn rate was just a hair over 1 meaning 99 of the customers it ended the quarter with were customers at the beginning of the quarter oh and with 15 consecutive years of dividend increases under its belt it s safe to say verizon is en route to becoming a dividend aristocrat
sterling slumps against the dollar after inflation hits a 40 year high bank of england under pressure on interest rates as fed gets tough in us the pound is under mounting pressure amid fears the bank of england will be outpaced by the us in the fight against inflation sterling slumped as low as 1 2162 yesterday taking its losses against the dollar to nearly 10 per cent this year it came after official figures showed inflation in the uk hit 9 1 per cent in may which is another 40 year high but analysts said the rise in the cost of living was unlikely to be enough to persuade the bank to implement more aggressive interest rate hikes despite mounting criticism of its handling of the crisis the central bank has raised rates five times since december but never by more than 0 25 percentage points the rate now stands at 1 25 per cent by contrast the us federal reserve bumped up rates by 0 75 percentage points last week the biggest rise since 1994 after a 0 5 percentage point hike in may and it is expected to raise rates by another 0 75 percentage points in july and by 0 5 percentage points in september analysts warned that the drastically different approach to tackling inflation in london and washington was likely to weigh further on the pound rising interest rates used by central banks to tame inflation typically boost a currency as investors hunt better returns the dollar tends to fare well in times of trouble as the currency is seen as a safe asset by international investors james reilly assistant economist at capital economics said we expect the pound to weaken further against the us dollar over the rest of 2022 as the bank of england fails to keep pace with the fed and appetite for risk continues to weaken andrew sentance a former member of the bank s rate setting monetary policy committee said the financial markets have given their verdict on uk inflation and the lack of response the pound is falling uk economic policy is in disarray the cost of living crisis has already weighed on the pound with traders fearing britain will topple into recession as households and businesses tighten their belts the slump has hit holidaymakers who get less bang for their buck overseas and importers find it more expensive to buy foreign goods federal reserve chairman jay powell last night paved the way for more rate rises telling the senate banking committee the american economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy in theory higher rates should keep inflation down by encouraging saving rather than spending but this can also throw economic growth into reverse a prospect which has caused the bank of england to pull back from big hikes powell conceded that a recession in the us was certainly a possibility but added that the likelihood was not elevated with traders unsure what to make of powell s comments the pound recovered against the dollar but is sharply down this year even before the most recent rate hikes the pound was losing out to the dollar due to the pandemic and the chaos caused by russia s invasions of ukraine as investors tend to rush to safe haven assets in times of uncertainty a member of the bank of england s rate setting committee catherine mann this week backed boosting interest rates to support the pound a weaker sterling would add to inflation she said as importers find their pounds do not stretch as far but james smith an economist at ing said while we see scope for a 0 5 percentage point hike in august we still find it hard to see the central bank taking rates anywhere near as far as the fed

42 to approximately 116 million with a 17 9 adjusted ebitda margin the growth of our rpo and professional search business remained extremely strong in the fourth quarter driven by the widening supply demand imbalance for top scale professionals in the post covid environment globally fee revenue grew to 213 5 million which was up 77 year over year and up approximately 25 million or 13 sequentially rpo fee revenue grew approximately 43 year over year and 14 sequentially while professional search fee revenue was up approximately 142 year over year and up 12 sequentially in the fourth quarter we began the integration of patina a provider of senior level executive professional talent on an interim or project basis patina was acquired on april 1 and generated approximately 4 1 million in the last month of our fiscal fourth quarter new business wins for both rpo and professional search were also very strong in the fourth quarter reaching new highs professional search new business was 108 million and rpo was awarded 213 million of new contracts consisting of 44 million of renewals and extensions and 169 million of new logo work adjusted ebitda for rpo and professional search continued to scale with revenue improving to 50 8 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 23 8 for all of fiscal 22 rpo and professional search also achieved new highs for revenue earnings and profitability

consultants worldwide at the end of the fourth quarter was 587 up 63 year over year and up six sequentially annualized fee revenue production per consultant in the fourth quarter remained strong at 1 67 million and a number of new search and the number of new search assignments opened worldwide in the fourth quarter was up 8 to 1 851 fourth quarter global executive search adjusted ebitda grew to approximately 64 million which was up 14 million or 29 year over year with an adjusted ebitda margin of 26 3 for all of fiscal 22 korn ferry became the first firm ever to generate 900 million of annual executive search revenue in fiscal 22 global executive search fee revenue was 936 million up 47 year over year with an adjusted ebitda of nearly 258 million with an adjusted ebitda margin of 27 5 i ll now turn the call back over to bob to discuss our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 23 bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer great thanks gregg as previously discussed our consolidated new business grew to a new high in the fourth quarter with strength across all lines of business our backlog of revenue under contract exiting the fourth quarter was the highest in company history in may new business although down sequentially from april was in line with both our expectations and our normal historical monthly seasonal pattern additionally new business for june month to date is also in line with our expectations in the normal monthly seasonal patterns as well evolving megatrends and workforce disruption are driving more consistent demand and regardless of economic headwinds presenting new areas of opportunity across one korn ferry ongoing changes in the workforce such as more broadly skilled labor shortages continued competition for talent people working differently and a growing focus on esg and de i means our synergistic portfolio of offerings is more relevant today than ever now even with these favorable trends it is difficult for us to quantify the risks associated with economic factors like global inflation rising interest rates supply chain disruptions and escalating geopolitical tensions with all of this in mind however assuming no new major pandemic related lockdowns or further changes in worldwide geopolitical or economic conditions financial markets foreign exchange rates we expect our consolidated fee revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 23 to range from 680 million to 710 million and our consolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share to range from 1 42 to 1 58 and our gaap diluted earnings per share to range from 1 35 to 1 51 now as i previously mentioned we deployed about 134 million on the acquisitions of the lucas group and patina solutions group in the last six months these acquisitions are currently being integrated into the professional search portion of our rpo ps segment and really will provide new scale in a new interim service offering which we really believe is a tremendous opportunity for growth now these acquisitions serve as a catalyst for repositioning our existing rpo ps segment into two separate reporting segments the first being rpo on a stand alone basis and the second obviously being professional search on a stand alone basis and these will both be effective starting may 1 of 2022 in closing we re very optimistic about our future fy 22 was just a phenomenal year for us that we achieved tremendous success numerous new financial and operational highs but as gary said we believe our best performance is yet to come our solutions are highly relevant in today s business environment they re aligned with long term secular trends that will drive strong durable growth combined with sustained profitability for years to come korn ferry has never been better positioned to serve all of its constituencies colleagues clients candidates and shareholders with that we would be glad to answer any questions you may have questions answers operator our first question will come from the line of george tong with goldman sachs please go ahead george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good morning monthly new business reached a new high in march but decelerated in year over year growth in april with a particularly sharp slowdown in consulting can you discuss whether you expect the deceleration in april to continue and how the consulting business is positioned to perform in the current macro environment gary burnison chief executive officer well i think the consulting business has never been better positioned it s a far reaching business from old strategy to learning and development to compensation rewards and assessment succession it really it plays at the essence of what a leader s job is that is to be a conductor synthesizing and synchronizing the company s strategy with their organizational structure and with their talent so i when we look at the new business and what we ve seen is exactly in line with what we ve done in the past and so our year end is april 30 and we tend to see a deceleration in may and that is about historically speaking that s about 12 and that s what we saw as a firm overall and in june we would expect based on history for new business to be basically flat or maybe slightly up that s what history would suggest and so it s still early in the month and we ve got a number of days to go but as bob alluded to we re basically tracking what we thought we would do in our historical pattern there s no question and then you know this better than anybody that the market has been unsustainable and it s been red hot in a whole series of factors a series of events and data points but so yes it s clearly moderated as we thought it would but it s still i think we re incredibly well positioned bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer and george this is bob the other thing i would say that what we re seeing is exactly what we expected it s exactly what we ve done historically and if you go back and look at all of fy 22 q1 was our fourth best new business quarter ever q2 was no 3 q3 was no 2 and q4 was no 1 so we continue to progressively get better and exited the year with our best quarter ever george tong goldman sachs analyst got it digital new business trends were relatively anemic in the fiscal fourth quarter can you discuss the factors weighing on digital growth and whether you expect those factors to persist beyond 4q gary burnison chief executive officer well generally speaking the biggest quarter for growth in the business is our october quarter and so we would expect to see that again i would expect the growth to be very much tempered in the first quarter and we what we ve done is really reposition that business we ve put on a lot of new sales professionals and we re going to continue to do that over the next quarter or two so just this last quarter or quarter even to date we ve put on an additional 30 to 40 sales professionals we re going to continue that so we ve certainly reimagine that business as we have the rest of the firm and so i would expect in this first quarter that the new business would be lower than it s been and again i don t think that s particularly unusual with historical trends but i would expect the october quarter is always the best quarter in that business bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer and george if you caught on my commentary where i talked about the 46 million that we deployed a significant portion of that was put into place in the digital business to continue to try to accelerate the product development and our go to market offerings george tong goldman sachs analyst that s helpful and then lastly can you provide an update on progress with your cross selling initiatives including the amount of fee revenue coming from cross line of business referrals and how quickly large marquee and regional accounts are growing gary burnison chief executive officer it was bob can talk about the marquee and regional accounts they are cross referrals it s continued despite the increase in scale of the business the cross referrals were about 28 almost 30 in the quarter and so that s one data point that you can look at and say is this strategy working are you having deeper impact with clients and are you integrating the organization across solution lines and so that s one of the things that i m most proud of so that number look that number is not going to get to 50 or 60 i don t foresee that but i do believe that it s a positive reflection and a data point that certainly supports the strategy and in some parts of the business that cross referral percentage is actually materially higher than 28 bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer george i think this is bob again i think one of the things that maybe is perhaps a little underappreciated is how how much connective tissue that exists between our core solutions and how easy it is to move across those core solutions and when you re dealing with the client if you place a ceo you can help that individual accelerate the performance you can help them to get the right team in place you can help them put in place an incentive compensation program to motivate and reward the team for driving his or her strategy and so on and i think as gary mentioned we re almost at 30 i think there s room to grow there just based on how much again interconnectivity there is between our solutions and how easy it is to walk across all of them when you re facing off your clients george tong goldman sachs analyst very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question comes from tobey sommer with truist securities please go ahead jasper bibb truist securities analyst hey everyone this is actually jasper bibb on for tobey thanks for taking my questions just on exec and pro search i wanted to ask there are certain industry groups that are trending better or worse here i was kind of thinking of some of the headlines around tech companies instituting hiring freezes or doing layoffs and i was wondering if that was having any impact here gary burnison chief executive officer our tech business was up sequentially 6 so it s not having an impact the professional search we ve been in the business for some time obviously with the rpo offering but this is a really renewed focus on the part of korn ferry and so when you look at our market opportunity it s probably 300 billion 350 billion and when you look at that market there s a couple of really big aspects one is around learning and development that s an enormous piece today learning and development is about 10 11 of the company we develop over one million professionals a year i think the opportunity around ldo learning development outsourcing is big for korn ferry and it s kind of what rpo was many many years ago so we re going to continue to put emphasis there then secondly when you look at that 300 million 350 billion a big part of it is around knowledge workers and professional search and interim services the megatrend of work anywhere anytime has only accelerated during the pandemic and we don t really see that going away so this idea of flexibility in a hybrid work and what i would call career nomads i think it s going to continue and so as an example we re putting a new focus around interim services putting in seasoned professionals to help drive an initiative or lead a business and really that business has gone from almost to today a run rate of about 110 million so if you look at all that in the professional search segment is today it s about 400 million and i look at it and say why shouldn t we quadruple that business i think we really do have that kind of opportunity so in terms of industry trends we haven t seen anything that would sound an alarm bell and it was good to see that the technology business actually grew sequentially jasper bibb truist securities analyst thanks make sense and i was just hoping you could speak to your thinking around the tina deal growing in the interim executive market how are you thinking about the opportunity for revenue synergies and putting that business besides kind of the core executive search brand gary burnison chief executive officer we ve already seen look first of all with all of the work that we do it begins and ends with quality that s true in every part of the business and we monitor that daily in terms of what we re doing whether it s assessing people developing people placements so that s something we pay very very close attention to the interim is a unique opportunity i think for us given the brand that we have and it s a relatively new entry for korn ferry so i look at that and say well it s a 110 million business today that should be a 1 billion business i really think there s that much market demand and today that offering is primarily anchored in the united states we have a little bit of capability globally but that s another area for us to tap so you re going to see us continue to invest in that part of our business jasper bibb truist securities analyst last question for me just how should we think about the durability of margins of a recession where they occurred here do you think there are potential offsets to think about as far as consultant productivity or some of the real estate cost takeouts you ve done in the past two years relative to maybe the experience of the last two recessions thanks gary burnison chief executive officer well look i ll let bob comment in more detail but i think this is my 80th earnings call with the firm and i think what you d find over that time is our 20 year cagr is 10 our 10 year cagr is 13 our cross referrals are almost 30 we ve got a marquee and regional account go to market strategy that s 36 37 of the portfolio and the other thing when you look at that span of time you d find that peak to trough looks significantly different over time and that is that even bore out in this covid debacle that we all went through where there were parts of the business that were more cyclical and there were others that were less cyclical so i think the thesis around tamping down the cyclicality is actually borne out in the data but at the end of the day you do have a consulting business and that can over time tend to ebb and flow but for korn ferry it s been up and to the right so bob you could probably speak to the operating boundaries and how we re thinking about that bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer yeah so one of the things that we constantly are looking at the business and assessing what the world looks like and going into the covid sort of pandemic recession if you will our operating boundary at that point in time was to make sure that we were cash flow neutral in a particular quarter and on a trailing 12 basis what we experienced was that we were well above cash flow neutral and we ve really reassessed our operating boundaries now and are really looking at the business from the perspective of having a nothing less than a 5 ebitda margin on a trailing 12 basis which obviously puts us very much in a cash positive position your point on real estate is actually a very good one one of the things that we re looking at now that offices are reopening we re tracking attendance in offices and seeing how many people are actually coming in using the office facilities how frequently and so on and i really believe that there will be a sort of a second wave if you will of real estate reductions it won t be what we did the first time first time we took out kind of 21 22 of our footprint but i think there s going to be opportunity for further reductions in our real estate footprint just based on office usage and the way that people want to work today and our view is you kind of have to meet them where they are and not be in a position to force anyone to come in the office if they don t want to be in and they don t have to be in jasper bibb truist securities analyst appreciate the color guys thanks for taking the questions operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark marcon with baird please go ahead mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst good afternoon and congratulations on the strong year obviously really strong particularly in terms of rpo can you talk a little bit about like how much of the new logo wins on the rpo side would you expect to spill into the first quarter of this year from a revenue perspective gary burnison chief executive officer bob do you want to do that bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer yeah mark i would say there s probably very little in the first quarter that will spill in essentially when you stand up as these are large engagements and when you sign up a large engagement it takes some time to stand it up and the way that the contracts are written as we get an upfront implementation fee which is a very small percentage of the total contract value and so as the requisitions as the job gets stood up and the requisitions start to open up that s when you ll see the real impact from the revenue so i would say probably very little in q1 and then we ll see it more in hitting in q2 and beyond that s consistent with the way that the large engagements have always operated mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst great and when you were answering at the very beginning of the q a when you were answering the question from george in terms of the may was 12 june flat are you talking about as it relates to new business is that on a year over year basis so in other words may looks like it s up about 12 and june seems like it s flat relative to the june of last year or june is flat relative to may bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer we re talking sequentially mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst ok so may would be up 12 relative to april or sound positive bob rozek executive vice president chief financial and corporate officer may relative to april down 12 sequentially on a year over year basis though may is actually up 13 mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst ok and gary burnison chief executive officer the way we look we look at new business every day and we have tiles and i generally tend to look at new business on a month sequential basis because that s we manage the business with looking at current data and we have certain goals and targets each month and as long as they line up with where we are more focused on the current data than the year over year compare especially this past year because the compares are still all over the place mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst ok and if june is flat relative to may what would that be on a year over year basis gregg kvochak senior vice president finance treasury tax investor relations that would be mark roughly mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst it s about it would be about 10 year over year growth right gregg kvochak senior vice president finance treasury tax investor relations that is about right yes 10 mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst ok great that s super helpful and then with regards to on the executive search side any sense for like what percentage of the business is basically coming from relatively new entities that might still be private gary burnison chief executive officer no we don t have that at our fingertips mark it s a pretty balanced portfolio and i would say that overall it kind of mirrors the global economy i don t think there s anything that s particularly out of balance there mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst and then how about what percentage of searches we obviously are all aware that hey there are cyclical factors there s demographic factors from a demographic perspective the boomers are retiring any sense in terms of what percentage is roughly what percentage of the searches are basically due to retirements that where somebody needs to be replaced and it s not necessarily because of churn and job hopping gary burnison chief executive officer yeah i think i m not going to give you a specific percentage mark but it s a decent ratio i mean i ve thought a lot about june of 07 and kind of compare that to this june so 15 years ago and did we really see the great recession coming and what were we paying attention to what were we ignoring where were the blind spots and we had actually started to tap down hiring we had gone out and made sure our balance sheet was bolstered and i look at that 15 years because i don t think that covid is a good comparable but i look at that and say june of 07 versus today and what s really happening in the labor market and i don t need to tell you but i think labor force participation rate is lower the workforce is older and there s been really not much growth in the labor force so june of 07 the participation rate was 66 today it s 62 the workforce in the united states was 153 million today it s 163 million there s only been 10 million more workers over 15 years and over the last two and a half years there s been no growth in the labor force so it s definitely getting older there s millions of people that have left the workforce the labor force growth is 35 slower than the population growth college unemployment rate is still as you know very very low and the thing it s also yes they re definitely certainly people are retiring the boomers are retiring but the other thing that s interesting is the just a demographic trend of 55 and older back in june of 07 it was 29 and today it s 38 so i think you have a just completely different labor force dynamic today than what you had say 15 years ago but the reality is there are literally millions of people have left the job market at least in the u s and i think the trend is true for other western economies mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst great gary you ve always been extremely thoughtful about cycles and i obviously started following you korn ferry prior to the dot com bust and so we live through gfc together in terms of like and you ve always looked ahead and thought you were very thoughtful about cycles so how are you how exactly there s obviously some people who are basically assuming that we re going to go into a recession right now that s i mean that s obvious there s others who think it might be a soft landing if we go into a recession like to what extent do you think like what sort of revenue degradation and it s not like a great financial crisis but more like a garden variety type recession if we ended up with that sort of scenario how do you think revenue and you gave like ok ebitda is not going to go less than 5 but what do you think realistic about where margins could go in a garden variety recession where we just have a couple of quarters of down gdp but nothing overly dramatic gary burnison chief executive officer it s obviously i m not an economist i it s very very difficult to predict those kind of things i think the huge wildcard that i ve said now for three earnings calls clearly inflation i had said months ago it wasn t transitory and that s turned out to be the case that is a huge issue for americans and others in the world i think the thing that s hard to handicap right now is given the labor market is substantially different than it was during the financial crisis and there is still a shortage of talent and the data points in 07 were significantly different how much is that going to buffer a garden variety recession and i do believe that it will i m not convinced that the great application is going to turn into the great resignation i m just not convinced of that yet and so we haven t seen any signs of cracking here and i think the labor market is substantially different and in korn ferry s business is way different and as i said when you look at this peak to trough and the actual performance it has been markedly different over these last 15 to 20 years so it s hard for me to really give you a precise number but i do think it s different this time and i think there is a buffer when it comes to the labor market that maybe wasn t there 15 years ago mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst ok and then how are you planning like over the next 12 months like how are you thinking about hiring where would we see the strongest levels of growth from a consultant base etc and a separate question you mentioned wage inflation and inflation in general what sort of levels of wage inflation are you currently seeing in terms of the new assignments both in terms of professional as well as executive search gary burnison chief executive officer yeah we even saw it in may we were continuing to see it which may not be great news for the economy but we re continuing to see it i mean we saw it in professional search for example in may so when you look just take today versus pre covid you d find that knowledge workers is where professional search operates our average fees are up 20 in the search business it s less than that it s probably more like 10 but we re continuing to see that we haven t seen a falling off there mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst and from your own hiring perspective what would you gary burnison chief executive officer we re all out on we have 11 000 colleagues where we ve out of those 11 000 there s probably about 1 800 what we would call partners and principles people that have responsibility for originating business we re looking for talent everywhere we re as aggressive today as we were six months ago we re going to continue to be we re obviously very mindful on the costs we ve tried to take a measured approach particularly over the last say seven eight nine months on that but the demand has continued to be there so as i mentioned we have to add more commercial capability in our digital business and again nothing against the colleagues that we have today we just need we need more of them but we re really looking across the board from organizational strategy consultants to comp and benefits consultants executive search i mean we re still continuing to do that my view is you invest in winter time and i have no idea if winter times come but the firm is just incredibly well positioned we re going to continue to make investments around pro search in the interim and it s not like we re trying to double or triple down on cyclicality but i just think that the mega trend around mobility is going to continue and you just see it in young people i think no matter what happens that s going to absolutely accelerate so we re going to make investment in interim services and pro search so we re certainly very mindful and cautious of the r word and what everybody is talking about so we re mindful of cost but at the same time this is about growth the story of korn ferry it has to be about growth for the long term mark marcon robert w baird and company analyst

rossen reports gas prices keep rising will a federal gas tax holiday really help share copy link copy pete my wife is saying every day because we have lot of money in our four oh one k of course just like lot of people were watching it go down and down and down and crater and every day my wife is saying to me let s get out of this we need to get out of this like we re losing money by the day and i say i think that s the opposite of what experts say are supposed to do right now so pete i guess what i m mainly asking is who s right me and my wife you re gonna make me choose aren t you by the way you meant you had money in your 40 and k jeff um and uh yeah oddly you re right you re right and here s how i like to explain this let s say you re driving from indianapolis to orlando it s straight line south kind of straight and let s say you have to take detour to kansas city which is what the markets just done it s just taking this big detour you re not gonna get out of your car in kansas city because you re further away from your goal it just wouldn t it wouldn t make sense so what s happening right in the market is what happens every 10 years or so and it s really easy to freak out and what i tell people generally speaking is don t stare at your account balance you won t even notice the difference keep buying into the market because then you re buying at lower price so this is not the time to get out ride it out and you re actually saying buy more now there are some pretty good companies that you can get on sale absolutely there s some good bargains right now now i will note you want to make sure you ve got good emergency fund good cash position as i m sure we re gonna talk about like the recession is on the horizon and so you want to be little bit more cash heavy in case you need to deal with unemployment issues or something like that but yeah when the market s down that s when smart people make money let s talk about possible recession the treasury secretary yellen says that it s not inevitable that we re gonna have recession what are your thoughts about this and does it really matter we keep hearing the word recession is it just is it just semantics does it really matter if everything is down and inflation is high whatever you call it yeah it just makes it more difficult to run your household and by that i m not here to agree or disagree with the treasury secretary but i can i can say this all the signs point to recession is on the horizon you ve got high inflation you ve got rising interest rates which is trying to bring down the inflation and so what you re likely to see jeff is increased unemployment in the next few months um which is simple byproduct of in 2020 we were all scared and didn t spend any money in 2021 we were excited to spend money so we spent lot of money and 2022 was always going to be like this there was no chance it wouldn t be like this uh and so it s sort of just leveling out of this so what do you see happening for the rest of the year right the fed raising interest rates um is that enough are they doing enough when will we see inflation come down when will prices start dropping i think you ll start seeing prices drop in the late fall you re already starting to see the housing market shake up little bit with rising interest rates you re seeing rising mortgage rates and when that happens lot of the service companies that serve the home building community prices start to come down there so i think you ll start to notice price changes in the late fall i do have to admit that one of the last things you re gonna see change our food prices you re not you re not gonna see your beef price come back down where you re used to having it you re not you re not gonna see all your vegetables come back down i think that s gonna take little while longer why it s really about the supply chain i mean um the white house this week said that one of the primary reason for inflation is the conflict the war going on in ukraine uh where i acknowledge that inflation isn t helped by the war in ukraine it s not the primary reason however with grain and lot of different food supplies going you know being produced in the ukraine that does affect food prices here and so you will see increased food prices for the near future at least let s talk about gas prices i mean it s insane so the white house is talking about federal gas tax holiday where they would let that go is that enough to do the trick yeah i think the only thing that s gonna change gas prices where people choose to not use as much gas now gasoline has always been what s called in elastic meaning the price goes up and people don t care they keep using the same amount of gas jeff i think to get gas prices under control people need to start making choices of wind to drive in fact jeff i would argue this will keep the hybrid work from home situation going longer than it otherwise would have gone because i don t think people are gonna want to get in their cars and drive to work and then pay for an increased lunch price at work i think person can save 200 month by simply working from home and not subjecting themselves to all this inflation so why are companies still telling everyone to go back to the office there seems to be disconnect in that right it seems that people want to stay home more and actually in this case you re talking about it actually being helpful financially right not going out for lunch not paying the gas prices but then companies are telling people to go back i will note employers and employees are not aligned on this employers like myself we want people here because of collaboration we wanna it s the conversations in the hallway they get lot done not to mention you by lot of office space and you want to fill it up the employee though says look i m just as good at home if we need to collaborate send me text message and by the way i can work in sweatpants um so i i don t say that judgmental i just say like why get in your car sit in traffic and then eat lunch out and spend bunch of money so i don t think this work from home things gonna sort itself out for another 12 18 months just because of inflation alone so that s so interesting that if everybody drove just little less that could really potentially right because then what you it s it s high school economics it s supply and demand if demand goes down and supply stays the same you could see price decreases but uh it s summer driving season i ve got family trip heading down to charleston south carolina we are driving and we will spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars of fuel on fuel and jeff there s no way we re not going so it s not like we see gas prices and go well we re staying put no we ve planned this for long time we re going but i think people s habits will start to change people say i m not actually driving to that side of town today we ll figure out something else i think at 6 gallon which is where we re heading i think people are gonna start making that decision let s talk about crypto currency uh i own some crypto you want crypto i do not i m not big crypto guy i love talking about it but it s not my thing so is this thing gonna crater is it going to zero warren buffett says this thing is going to zero he famously said i think it was couple of months ago if somebody came to me with all the bitcoin in the world and they were gonna sell it to me for 25 i d say no thanks where do you stand on this is it going to zero or is it going back well i make it practice to never disagree with warren buffett however i don t think it s going to zero but i also think that um we ve learned lot in the last couple of months about the relation of crypto into the stock market in general are they aligned are they heading in the same direction it was supposed to be degree of hedge jeff right you could not expose yourself to the equity market the stock market and still get some some return out of the crypto market but if the crypto market crashes right alongside with the stock market then what value is it really providing i would also note you re getting lot more amateur investors in the crypto marketplace just as you had amateur investors in the late 1990s day trading like i used to write so i think you re just seeing inexperienced amateur investors learning what volatility really feels like with crypto i want to talk about the housing market little bit where do you say there is definitely softening going on but supply is still low if you look at lot of places it s not like you have ton of supply lot of people are saying well hold on the real estate market is gonna crash but really isn t it just like it s still gonna go up but it was going up like this now it s gonna go little slower like this potential yeah and look i don t think it s gonna crash i think it it ll definitely level out and and it s because there ll be there ll be fewer buyers that qualify for the higher priced homes when when interest rates were at 3 or 2 5 it s pretty easy to afford very expensive house depending on your income when that interest rate goes up by three or 4 the by the market of buyers shrinks significantly so again just based on economics alone if there s less demand because there s fewer buyers you re gonna see prices relax little bit not that you re real estate expert but just financially if you re if you have home that you plan on selling in the next you know 2 3 years is this the time to sell well wait again given that i m not real estate expert i would say you always want to sell at the top of market that the challenge of course as you know jeff is then where do you live you just gonna rent and and feel it out for couple of years i ll note this maybe i ll stay in different way the last thing i would do right now is buy home it would be the absolute last thing i would do high prices and high lending prices makes for bad time to buy home my wife and i bought our home in 2007 which was horrible time to buy home in retrospect high prices relatively high interest rates uh and and not that we ve had to deal with that for the last 14 years but it s it s certainly something that affected us for the first few years after that decision mm um do you see interest rates coming down at some point in couple of years will the fed pull back on these will they start cutting once inflation is under control do you think we ve got lot to go before that and in fact i would argue i would like to see the fed more aggressive they did 75 basis points basis point increase on the federally i would like to have seen it at 100 basis points full percentage point i d like to see him do it again um the sooner they get that done the sooner the sooner the economy can normalize of what people are used to it is worth noting that we have had unprecedented economic growth over the last couple of decades and so people are so used to low interest rates and or you know amazing stock market and robust economy these things correct there s balance in the world so this time we re about to go through it s going to be eye opening for people who weren t an adult in the last 20 years right it s gonna be the first period of time in which they ve experienced financial hardship back in like the seventies or was it eighties or seventies interest rates are really high right where they re like 9 or yeah you hear the stories about grandma had an 18 5 interest rate on their mortgage and you re like what how are you leaving yeah you wonder why real estate market wasn t increasing significantly in the late 70s and early 80s is because interest rates were so high there weren t enough buyers to go into the marketplace to to make home prices go up part of the reason why our housing market has been on fire is because of the low interest rates the low lending rates and so it will it will adjust because it always does when the fed raises the rates right that s also impacting your credit card interest right it s not just housing everything you know it s it s it s everything you want to talk about another market that s really gotten out of whack is is cars uh you know the average car payment america as of last month is over 700 month the supply chain is messed up and so with the higher interest rates that are upon us right now i think what you re gonna see is that market cool off little bit too and he could use it i mean it could i mean by the way car salesperson is not going to tell you they want the market to cool off but i will notice the supply chain normalizes and as those interest rates go up you re going to see it s easy being get the rossen reports newsletter deals scams your money unemployment jeff s newsletter cuts through the noise your

todd rosenbluth head of research at vettafi recently appeared on td ameritrade to discuss the movement of investors into fixed income etfs with host caroline woods last week saw record trading of 58 billion in fixed income etfs primarily in the secondary market between stock sellers and purchasers we saw record demand for trading for corporate bond etfs we saw it particularly strong in the high yield bond etf marketplace explained rosenbluth etfs that saw particularly high levels of trading included the ishares iboxx high yield corporate bond etf hyg at 9 billion of trades the spdr bloomberg high yield bond etf jnk at 4 billion of trades and the ishares broad usd high yield corporate bond etf ushy at 2 2 billion six times its daily average investors are running to fixed income etfs as opposed to fleeing them some of that is the trading activity but it s a sign that there s greater liquidity in the fixed income etf market than investors perhaps realized rosenbluth said the high yield funds tend to be less sensitive to interest rates compared to treasuries but do carry significantly higher amounts of credit risks with that being said funds like hyg that are down this year hyg is down 14 9 ytd have still performed better than the broader market within bonds advisors and investors are generally investing along two different strategies in the current environment they are either seeking ultra short duration bonds that are less interest rate sensitive while seeking to protect the downside in their portfolios or else they are seeking return potential within the higher yield offerings a record 58 billion traded in bond etfs in anticipation of last week s rate hike toddrosenbluth explains how the spike in yields ahead of the fed led to record money being traded in bond funds and talks fixed income strategy w cline_woods td ameritrade network tdanetwork june 22 2022 it s a trend that doesn t carry over into equities rosenbluth explained in the equity space we ve really seen it more of the quality aspect of it and we think investors have been rewarded by favoring higher quality strategies rosenbluth said that includes within energy with funds like the alerian mlp etf amlp as well as in more diversified strategies within equities the pivot to fixed income etfs has been at the cost of mutual funds as fixed income mutual funds have experienced outflows this year it doesn t come as a surprise to rosenbluth because in an environment where performance is down hefty fees can make losses even more substantial the price savings that etfs offer in their reduced fees are a good incentive for advisors and investors looking to trim costs particularly in a downward environment we did a webcast earlier this week with our vettafi advisor audience base and they re looking to stay within income but looking to rotate perhaps into more equity oriented strategies i mentioned amlp earlier there s some quality etfs like qual ishares msci usa quality factor etf or cowz pacer us cash cows 100 etf that have been seeing strong interest rosenbluth explained covered call strategies have also been more popular with funds like the jpmorgan equity premium income etf jepi in this environment there are lots of different ways to get exposure to income and tilt your portfolio away from just pure fixed income and have some exposure to equities as well rosenbluth said for more news information and strategy visit vettafi com

4 17pm inflation remains on the minds of investors the dow closed wednesday down 47 points 0 2 at 30 483 the nasdaq composite lost 16 points 0 2 to 11 053 and the s p 500 ticked down 5 points 0 1 to 3 760 despite an initially promising response on wall street to testimony from fed chair jerome powell the rally petered out in the afternoon inflation remains the biggest risk to financial assets and jerome powell has made his position abundantly clear the fed will continue to raise interest rates until inflation begins to wane until then a sustainable rally for risk assets is hard to imagine wrote robert schein chief investment officer of blanke schein wealth management cnbc reported 12 05pm powell s testimony calms markets us stocks managed to shake off this morning s losses at noon after fed chair jerome powell reaffirmed the central bank s commitment to reining in inflation during his congressional testimony at midday the dow jones industrial average the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite were all steady at 30 491 points 3 762 points and 11 071 points respectively aj bell financial analyst danni hewson said wall street seemed like what it heard in powell s testimony with the iron fish which had been smashing confidence now clothed in a soft glove words like nimble and appropriate took the sting out of the strongly committed as did his assertions that the us economy was fit enough to handle what s coming down the tracks he said a crowd of familiar names enjoyed quick bumps up such as the nasdaq with lockdown favourites docusign netflix and zoom enjoying a moment in the sun cmc markets uk chief market analyst michael hewson also noted that powell s testimony appeared to be helping pull us markets off their lows however the rally continues to remain fragile as investors weigh up the twin risks of a global slowdown against central banks overplaying their hand and tipping the economy into recession he said this appears to be a vain hope given that some sort of recession or slowdown is inevitable whatever central bankers might say publicly the only question is around the degree of severity depending on where you are 11am proactive north america headlines

of its non brokered private placement for gross proceeds of 517 991 20 9 35am us stocks sink after rally us stocks opened lower on wednesday with the fed back in the spotlight as its chair jerome powell began his two day testimony before the senate banking committee at 9 30am et just after the open the dow jones industrial index had shed 331 points at 30 200 points the s p 500 had dipped 43 points at 3 722 points and the nasdaq composite had slipped 67 points at 11 003 points oanda senior market analyst craig erlam said wednesday s stock market falls were a reminder of why investors shouldn t get excited by bear market rallies there s a desperation to add substance to the often sizeable rallies that pop up in equity markets despite little or no rationale behind them and today is once again a lesson in why we shouldn t bother he said in much the same way that if it seems too good to be true it probably is if stocks are rallying for seemingly no reason there probably isn t one commenting on powell s testimony in congress erlam said he expected the r word was likely to come up a lot naturally he ll do his best to remain apolitical but i m not sure investors will be able to ignore so much recession chat he said 6 30am brace for more volatility us markets were expected to open lower on wednesday giving back some on tuesday s rally ahead of us federal reserve chair jerome powell s latest testimony before congress to be delivered today and tomorrow powell is expected to strike a hawkish note on inflation which has yet to hit its peak suggesting that trading is likely to remain cautious and volatile putting an end to the bargain hunting which shored up equity prices in the previous session futures for the dow jones industrial average fell 1 5 in pre market trading while those for the broader s p 500 index shed 1 7 and contracts for the nasdaq 100 were down 2 while equity markets kicked off the short trading week with a bang the gains might prove to be fleeting warned ipek ozkardeskaya senior analyst at swissquote bank the gains may not last as the jerome powell s semiannual testimony could turn the market mood sour again as the fed chief is expected to reiterate his strong commitment to fighting inflation even if it means a slower economy and a softer jobs market she noted fed policymakers raised interest rates by 75 basis points last week and are expected to keep on hiking rates through the rest of the year some believe that the fed is losing the battle against inflation and that the aggressive rate hikes will instead crimp economic growth and dent corporate bottom lines fears that the world s biggest economy will slip into a recession are also growing us president joe biden said earlier this week that he doesn t think the recession is inevitable but goldman upped its recession expectation from 15 to 30 and morgan stanley nyse ms said that the s p500 must drop another 15 20 to fully reflect the scale of contraction noted ozkardeskaya therefore yesterday s rally in stocks could be another dead cat bounce and we may see the market painted in red in the following sessions the us futures are already in the red this morning she added in energy markets wti crude oil futures lost 5 to 104 04 a barrel and brent crude futures shed 4 5 to 109 03 amid concerns that global economic growth may falter contact the author

u s federal reserve chair jerome powell testifies before a senate banking housing and urban affairs committee hearing on the semiannual monetary policy report to the congress on capitol hill in washington d c june 22 reuters yonhap the u s economy remains strong but a series of aggressive rate hikes meant to cool soaring inflation could eventually trigger a recession federal reserve chair jerome powell cautioned wednesday powell whose testimony before senators was closely watched by investors and analysts also said the world s largest economy faces an uncertain global environment and could see further inflation surprises the fed chair again stressed that policymakers understand the hardships caused by rising prices and are committed to bringing down inflation which has reached a 40 year high last week the u s central bank announced the sharpest interest rate increase in nearly 30 years and promised additional similar moves to combat the price surge with gas and food costs skyrocketing and millions of americans struggling to get by but when peppered with questions about the prospect of a recession powell acknowledged the risk it s not our intended outcome at all but it s certainly a possibility he told the senate banking committee and frankly the events of the last few months around the world have made it more difficult for us to achieve what we want which is two percent inflation and still a strong labor market in his opening remarks powell insisted the u s economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store the fed chief said in his semi annual appearance before congress policymakers will need to be nimble given that the economy often evolves in unexpected ways he said the fed is facing intense criticism that it was too slow to react to the changing economy which benefited from a flood of federal government stimulus last week s super sized 0 75 percentage point increase in the benchmark lending rate was the third since march taking the policy rate up a total of 1 5 points powell at the time said a similar increase was likely in july the ideal scenario would be for those moves to cool the economy enough to douse inflation pressures without choking off growth the hoped for soft landing i think it s going to be very challenging powell said insisting there are pathways to avoid recession and that he does not view the risk of a downturn as particularly elevated financial markets seemed cheered by his relatively upbeat comments which echo those of other fed officials in recent days who have pushed back against rising pessimism but wall street stocks lost steam late in the trading session and the dow finished the day down 0 2 percent essential to curb inflation in addition to easing the financial strain on less wealthy american families the fed chief said tamping down inflation was essential to maintain a healthy labor market the u s economy recovered quickly from the covid 19 pandemic helped by robust consumer spending and has continued to create jobs at a strong pace pushing unemployment down to near a 50 year low but the buoyant demand for homes cars and other goods clashed with transportation and supply chain snarls in parts of the world where covid 19 has remained a challenge that fueled inflation which got dramatically worse after russia invaded ukraine in late february and western nations imposed stiff sanctions on moscow sending food and fuel prices up at a blistering rate but powell noted that inflation is a global issue not unique to the united states many major central banks have joined the fed in beginning to tighten monetary policy with the notable exception of the bank of japan powell said many factors driving inflation are beyond the fed s control but he pointed to signs that rising rates are having an impact as business investment slows and activity in the housing sector looks to be softening in part reflecting higher mortgage rates average home loan rates jumped to 5 23 percent in may for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage from 4 98 percent in april according to freddie mac while the median price for homes topped 400 000 for the first time the tightening in financial conditions that we have seen in recent months should continue to temper growth and help bring demand into better balance with supply powell said afp

the ongoing bear market in stocks is creating opportunities for long term investors according to bank of america the bank suggests investors start to nibble on stocks when the s p 500 hits 3 600 and gorge at 3 000 once the ongoing bear market ends the s p 500 could be primed for a bull market run to 8 900 by 2028 bofa said advertisement long term investors should get ready for big stock market opportunities as the s p 500 continues to flesh out its bear market decline according to bank of america the bank highlighted the typical bear market playbook in a friday note observing that the stock market has entered its 20th bear market in the past 140 years the average bear market has experienced a peak to trough decline of 37 lasting 289 days history is no guide to future performance but if it were today s bear market would end on october 19 with s p 500 at 3 000 bofa said a decline to 3 000 represents potential downside of about 18 from current levels and would represent a total peak to trough decline of 38 in line with the typical bear market at those levels investors should gorge on stocks as they would likely represent an attractive valuation as long as the economy doesn t fall into a deep and prolonged recession meanwhile if the s p 500 falls to 3 300 investors should bite on stocks and a decline to 3 600 means investors should start to nibble the fundamental drivers behind such a bear market include an inflation shock which is already playing itself out an interest rate shock and a recession shock and crash according to the note advertisement the inflation shock materialized after may s cpi report saw prices rise 8 6 and it seems that the interest rate shock started to unfold after fed chair jerome powell raised rates by 75 basis points last week finally a recession shock could come next month if second quarter gdp growth shows a decline after the first quarter s contraction in gdp growth but the other side to the ongoing bear market and worrying economic signals is an eventual bull market that has historically always materialized after such a sharp decline in stock prices the good news is that the average bull market lasts more than five years with a 198 return bofa said so next bull sees s p 500 at 8 900 by february of 2028 a rise of that magnitude would result in the s p 500 generating a six year compounded annual growth rate of about 15 which is more than double the historical average growth rate of 7 for the stock market less inflation and about in line with the s p 500 s six year compounded annual growth rate of 16 from january 2016 to its peak in january of this year adding to bank of america s conviction of an eventual turnaround is its contrarian bull and bear indicator which plunged to an extreme bearish reading of 0 0 last week other times it fell to this level include august 2002 july 2008 september 2011 september 2015 january 2016 and march 2020 that extreme bearishness combined with extreme investor positioning suggests strong three month returns of more than 5 as long as there is no double dip recession or some type of systemic market event according to the note advertisement opportunity knocks bofa said
rossen reports gas prices keep rising will a federal gas tax holiday really help share copy link copy pete my wife is saying every day because we have lot of money in our four oh one k of course just like lot of people were watching it go down and down and down and crater and every day my wife is saying to me let s get out of this we need to get out of this like we re losing money by the day and i say i think that s the opposite of what experts say are supposed to do right now so pete i guess what i m mainly asking is who s right me and my wife you re gonna make me choose aren t you by the way you meant you had money in your 40 and k jeff um and uh yeah oddly you re right you re right and here s how i like to explain this let s say you re driving from indianapolis to orlando it s straight line south kind of straight and let s say you have to take detour to kansas city which is what the markets just done it s just taking this big detour you re not gonna get out of your car in kansas city because you re further away from your goal it just wouldn t it wouldn t make sense so what s happening right in the market is what happens every 10 years or so and it s really easy to freak out and what i tell people generally speaking is don t stare at your account balance you won t even notice the difference keep buying into the market because then you re buying at lower price so this is not the time to get out ride it out and you re actually saying buy more now there are some pretty good companies that you can get on sale absolutely there s some good bargains right now now i will note you want to make sure you ve got good emergency fund good cash position as i m sure we re gonna talk about like the recession is on the horizon and so you want to be little bit more cash heavy in case you need to deal with unemployment issues or something like that but yeah when the market s down that s when smart people make money let s talk about possible recession the treasury secretary yellen says that it s not inevitable that we re gonna have recession what are your thoughts about this and does it really matter we keep hearing the word recession is it just is it just semantics does it really matter if everything is down and inflation is high whatever you call it yeah it just makes it more difficult to run your household and by that i m not here to agree or disagree with the treasury secretary but i can i can say this all the signs point to recession is on the horizon you ve got high inflation you ve got rising interest rates which is trying to bring down the inflation and so what you re likely to see jeff is increased unemployment in the next few months um which is simple byproduct of in 2020 we were all scared and didn t spend any money in 2021 we were excited to spend money so we spent lot of money and 2022 was always going to be like this there was no chance it wouldn t be like this uh and so it s sort of just leveling out of this so what do you see happening for the rest of the year right the fed raising interest rates um is that enough are they doing enough when will we see inflation come down when will prices start dropping i think you ll start seeing prices drop in the late fall you re already starting to see the housing market shake up little bit with rising interest rates you re seeing rising mortgage rates and when that happens lot of the service companies that serve the home building community prices start to come down there so i think you ll start to notice price changes in the late fall i do have to admit that one of the last things you re gonna see change our food prices you re not you re not gonna see your beef price come back down where you re used to having it you re not you re not gonna see all your vegetables come back down i think that s gonna take little while longer why it s really about the supply chain i mean um the white house this week said that one of the primary reason for inflation is the conflict the war going on in ukraine uh where i acknowledge that inflation isn t helped by the war in ukraine it s not the primary reason however with grain and lot of different food supplies going you know being produced in the ukraine that does affect food prices here and so you will see increased food prices for the near future at least let s talk about gas prices i mean it s insane so the white house is talking about federal gas tax holiday where they would let that go is that enough to do the trick yeah i think the only thing that s gonna change gas prices where people choose to not use as much gas now gasoline has always been what s called in elastic meaning the price goes up and people don t care they keep using the same amount of gas jeff i think to get gas prices under control people need to start making choices of wind to drive in fact jeff i would argue this will keep the hybrid work from home situation going longer than it otherwise would have gone because i don t think people are gonna want to get in their cars and drive to work and then pay for an increased lunch price at work i think person can save 200 month by simply working from home and not subjecting themselves to all this inflation so why are companies still telling everyone to go back to the office there seems to be disconnect in that right it seems that people want to stay home more and actually in this case you re talking about it actually being helpful financially right not going out for lunch not paying the gas prices but then companies are telling people to go back i will note employers and employees are not aligned on this employers like myself we want people here because of collaboration we wanna it s the conversations in the hallway they get lot done not to mention you by lot of office space and you want to fill it up the employee though says look i m just as good at home if we need to collaborate send me text message and by the way i can work in sweatpants um so i i don t say that judgmental i just say like why get in your car sit in traffic and then eat lunch out and spend bunch of money so i don t think this work from home things gonna sort itself out for another 12 18 months just because of inflation alone so that s so interesting that if everybody drove just little less that could really potentially right because then what you it s it s high school economics it s supply and demand if demand goes down and supply stays the same you could see price decreases but uh it s summer driving season i ve got family trip heading down to charleston south carolina we are driving and we will spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars of fuel on fuel and jeff there s no way we re not going so it s not like we see gas prices and go well we re staying put no we ve planned this for long time we re going but i think people s habits will start to change people say i m not actually driving to that side of town today we ll figure out something else i think at 6 gallon which is where we re heading i think people are gonna start making that decision let s talk about crypto currency uh i own some crypto you want crypto i do not i m not big crypto guy i love talking about it but it s not my thing so is this thing gonna crater is it going to zero warren buffett says this thing is going to zero he famously said i think it was couple of months ago if somebody came to me with all the bitcoin in the world and they were gonna sell it to me for 25 i d say no thanks where do you stand on this is it going to zero or is it going back well i make it practice to never disagree with warren buffett however i don t think it s going to zero but i also think that um we ve learned lot in the last couple of months about the relation of crypto into the stock market in general are they aligned are they heading in the same direction it was supposed to be degree of hedge jeff right you could not expose yourself to the equity market the stock market and still get some some return out of the crypto market but if the crypto market crashes right alongside with the stock market then what value is it really providing i would also note you re getting lot more amateur investors in the crypto marketplace just as you had amateur investors in the late 1990s day trading like i used to write so i think you re just seeing inexperienced amateur investors learning what volatility really feels like with crypto i want to talk about the housing market little bit where do you say there is definitely softening going on but supply is still low if you look at lot of places it s not like you have ton of supply lot of people are saying well hold on the real estate market is gonna crash but really isn t it just like it s still gonna go up but it was going up like this now it s gonna go little slower like this potential yeah and look i don t think it s gonna crash i think it it ll definitely level out and and it s because there ll be there ll be fewer buyers that qualify for the higher priced homes when when interest rates were at 3 or 2 5 it s pretty easy to afford very expensive house depending on your income when that interest rate goes up by three or 4 the by the market of buyers shrinks significantly so again just based on economics alone if there s less demand because there s fewer buyers you re gonna see prices relax little bit not that you re real estate expert but just financially if you re if you have home that you plan on selling in the next you know 2 3 years is this the time to sell well wait again given that i m not real estate expert i would say you always want to sell at the top of market that the challenge of course as you know jeff is then where do you live you just gonna rent and and feel it out for couple of years i ll note this maybe i ll stay in different way the last thing i would do right now is buy home it would be the absolute last thing i would do high prices and high lending prices makes for bad time to buy home my wife and i bought our home in 2007 which was horrible time to buy home in retrospect high prices relatively high interest rates uh and and not that we ve had to deal with that for the last 14 years but it s it s certainly something that affected us for the first few years after that decision mm um do you see interest rates coming down at some point in couple of years will the fed pull back on these will they start cutting once inflation is under control do you think we ve got lot to go before that and in fact i would argue i would like to see the fed more aggressive they did 75 basis points basis point increase on the federally i would like to have seen it at 100 basis points full percentage point i d like to see him do it again um the sooner they get that done the sooner the sooner the economy can normalize of what people are used to it is worth noting that we have had unprecedented economic growth over the last couple of decades and so people are so used to low interest rates and or you know amazing stock market and robust economy these things correct there s balance in the world so this time we re about to go through it s going to be eye opening for people who weren t an adult in the last 20 years right it s gonna be the first period of time in which they ve experienced financial hardship back in like the seventies or was it eighties or seventies interest rates are really high right where they re like 9 or yeah you hear the stories about grandma had an 18 5 interest rate on their mortgage and you re like what how are you leaving yeah you wonder why real estate market wasn t increasing significantly in the late 70s and early 80s is because interest rates were so high there weren t enough buyers to go into the marketplace to to make home prices go up part of the reason why our housing market has been on fire is because of the low interest rates the low lending rates and so it will it will adjust because it always does when the fed raises the rates right that s also impacting your credit card interest right it s not just housing everything you know it s it s it s everything you want to talk about another market that s really gotten out of whack is is cars uh you know the average car payment america as of last month is over 700 month the supply chain is messed up and so with the higher interest rates that are upon us right now i think what you re gonna see is that market cool off little bit too and he could use it i mean it could i mean by the way car salesperson is not going to tell you they want the market to cool off but i will notice the supply chain normalizes and as those interest rates go up you re going to see it s easy being get the rossen reports newsletter deals scams your money unemployment jeff s newsletter cuts through the noise your

prague on june 10 taming frothy housing prices are a key part of policy makers goals as they seek to quell the fastest inflation in decades photographer milan jaros bloomberg a world economy already contending with raging inflation stock market turmoil and a grueling war is facing yet another threat the unraveling of a massive housing boom as central banks around the globe rapidly increase interest rates soaring borrowing costs mean people who were already stretching to buy property are finally reaching their limits the effects are being seen in countries such as canada the us and new zealand where once hot residential real estate markets have suddenly turned cold it s a sharp reversal from years of surging prices fueled by rock bottom mortgage rates and government stimulus along with a pandemic that popularized remote work and sent homebuyers on the hunt for bigger spaces an analysis by bloomberg economics shows that 19 oecd countries have combined price to rent and home price to income ratios that are higher today than they were ahead of the 2008 financial crisis an indication that prices have moved out of line with fundamentals new zealand at top of risk ranking five gauges of property risk for oecd member and accession countries taming frothy home prices are a key part of many policy makers goals as they seek to quell the fastest inflation in decades but as markets shudder from the prospects of a global recession a slowdown in housing could create a ripple effect that would deepen an economic slump falling home prices would erode household wealth dent consumer confidence and potentially curb future development animal spirits are typically tamed when people are faced with higher repayment costs on an asset that s losing value and property construction and sales are huge multipliers of economic activity around the world the danger is business and financial cycles turning down simultaneously which can lead to longer lasting recessions said rob subbaraman head of global markets research at nomura holdings inc a decade of qe has fueled frothy housing markets and we could be entering the other side of this soon as housing affordability is stretched and debt service ratios could rise sharply such a scenario would gum up bank lending as the risk of bad loans increases choking the flow of credit that economies thrive on in the us and western europe the housing crash that precipitated the financial crisis hobbled banking systems governments and consumers for years to be sure a 2008 style collapse is unlikely lenders have tightened standards household savings are still robust and many countries still have housing shortages labor markets are also strong providing an important buffer lower prices will have a direct effect on consumer spending and the whole economy as typically real estate makes up a significant part of households wealth said tuuli mccully head of asia pacific economics at scotiabank nevertheless as household balance sheets in many major markets remain healthy i am not particularly worried about risks related to house prices and the world economy still the risk of a sharp drop in prices is clearly greater when there s a synchronized global tightening of monetary policy said niraj shah of bloomberg economics in london more than 50 central banks have raised interest rates by at least 50 basis points in one go this year with more hikes expected in the us the federal reserve last week boosted its main interest rate by 75 basis points its biggest increase since 1994 housing markets in new zealand the czech republic australia and canada rank among the world s bubbliest and are particularly vulnerable to falling prices according to bloomberg economics portugal is especially at risk in the euro area while austria germany and the netherlands also are looking frothy in asia south korea house prices also look vulnerable according to an analysis by s p global ratings that report noted risks from household credit relative to nominal gdp the growth rate of household debt and the speed of house price gains elsewhere in europe sweden has seen a dramatic turnaround in housing demand sparking concern in a country where debt runs at 200 of household income goldman sachs group inc economists wrote in a report last week that the signals from home sales typically precede prices by about six months indicating that several countries are likely to see further declines in values a substantial cooldown in housing markets is an important reason why developed economies will likely slow according to the economists led by jan hatzius the very rapid deterioration in affordability and large drops in home sales suggest that a hard landing is a meaningful risk especially in new zealand canada and australia although that is not our baseline given current tightness the goldman economists wrote central banks are issuing warnings of their own the bank of canada said this month in its annual review of the financial system that high levels of mortgage debt are of particular concern as interest rates rise and more borrowers are strained to pay bills the reserve bank of new zealand s semi annual financial stability report said that the overall threat to the financial system is limited but a sharp decline in house prices is possible which could significantly reduce wealth and lead to a contraction in consumer spending as borrowing costs rise real estate markets face a critical test bloomberg s shah said if central bankers act too aggressively they could sow the seeds of the next crisis here is what s unfolding in bubbly housing markets around the world new zealand if 2021 was the year new zealand s house price growth reached dizzying heights with an annual increase of close to 30 2022 is shaping up to be the year the music stops and the abrupt change has left people scrambling in march jonathan milne decided it was time to sell a family home in the auckland suburb of onehunga and purchase a larger house nearby for nz 2 million 1 3 million he and his wife georgie were optimistic of a speedy sale and a good price for their old home which was valued by the local government at nz 1 8 million ups and downs soaring prices are expected to give way to declines next year all that changed in april when the rbnz took aggressive action to tackle inflation hiking the official rate by 50 basis points to 1 5 its biggest increase in 22 years it quickly followed with another 50 basis point jump in may and a projection for the rate to peak at close to 4 next year milne s house was meant to be sold in may via auction a popular method of home sales in new zealand but not a single bidder showed up for the event what we didn t anticipate was that it would be so hard to market and sell our house said milne the 47 year old managing editor of a news website we knew that every week that passed would knock another nz 100 000 off the price at the end of last month they accepted an offer that milne described as dramatically below the government valuation economists expect new zealand house prices will fall about 10 this year and may eventually drop as much as 20 from their late 2021 peak while for many homeowners that s a small decline compared with the massive equity gains in recent years there likely will be broader effects anz bank forecasts subdued consumer spending due to a mixture of people feeling poorer because of falling house prices the impact of higher rates on cash flow as well as higher food and energy prices according to sharon zollner the bank s new zealand chief economist there are going to be house buyers who have just entered the market in the last year or so who started off with a mortgage rate of 2 5 and all of a sudden they are rolling off on to a mortgage rate closer to 6 said jarrod kerr chief economist at kiwibank in auckland there is going to be some pain for sure ainsley thomson canada the housing market in canada has turned so fast some buyers are losing money on their properties before the sales even close people are actively trying to get out of deals said mark morris a toronto based real estate lawyer who cited one example where a property s assessed value came in c 200 000 155 000 less than the purchase price agreed to only a couple months before that left the buyer willing to give up their c 100 000 deposit to avoid closing he said i m called several times a day by various people who feel that they ve paid too much such cases are cropping up after canada posted its first national home price decline in two years in april followed by another drop in may though so far the pain has been concentrated around the markets which saw the biggest pandemic runups toronto and its surrounding regions the strains are already starting to spread to formerly hot markets around vancouver too peak housing in canada s largest city prices are down almost 9 since february like in other countries the turmoil in canada s housing market is being caused by an aggressive campaign to raise interest rates by the central bank the benchmark has already gone from 0 25 at the beginning of the year to 1 5 today with even higher rates expected some economists say home prices could fall as much as 20 in the hottest markets it s a drastic change in a country that saw prices rise by more than 50 over the two years since the pandemic started with prices rapidly outpacing wage growth some buyers hope of entering the market came from low rates that are now jumping it s the marginal buyer who s supporting current valuations so that could mean significant impact on the housing market said matthieu arseneau deputy chief economist at national bank of canada who says home prices nationally could fall as much as 10 will new buyers be able to afford those prices at these rates ari altstedter us mabel melendi could tell the housing market in cape coral florida was slowing after a week went by and she still hadn t received any inquiries or offers on a newly constructed home she listed in mid april just three months ago she received a bid on a similar property within three days of putting it on the market but after three price cuts knocking the asking price down to 425 000 from 510 000 and more than two months after the initial listing she was still looking for buyers in mid june one offer that came in over memorial day weekend fell through after the buyer couldn t qualify for a large enough mortgage most of the people don t qualify for what they used to qualify for before melendi said mortgage rates have increased this year at the fastest pace in records dating back a half century according to freddie mac the average rate for a 30 year loan reached 5 78 last week the highest since

rossen reports when will prices start dropping financial expert weighs in share copy link copy pete my wife is saying every day because we have lot of money in our four oh one k of course just like lot of people were watching it go down and down and down and crater and every day my wife is saying to me let s get out of this we need to get out of this like we re losing money by the day and i say i think that s the opposite of what experts say are supposed to do right now so pete i guess what i m mainly asking is who s right me and my wife you re gonna make me choose aren t you by the way you meant you had money in your 40 and k jeff um and uh yeah oddly you re right you re right and here s how i like to explain this let s say you re driving from indianapolis to orlando it s straight line south kind of straight and let s say you have to take detour to kansas city which is what the markets just done it s just taking this big detour you re not gonna get out of your car in kansas city because you re further away from your goal it just wouldn t it wouldn t make sense so what s happening right in the market is what happens every 10 years or so and it s really easy to freak out and what i tell people generally speaking is don t stare at your account balance you won t even notice the difference keep buying into the market because then you re buying at lower price so this is not the time to get out ride it out and you re actually saying buy more now there are some pretty good companies that you can get on sale absolutely there s some good bargains right now now i will note you want to make sure you ve got good emergency fund good cash position as i m sure we re gonna talk about like the recession is on the horizon and so you want to be little bit more cash heavy in case you need to deal with unemployment issues or something like that but yeah when the market s down that s when smart people make money let s talk about possible recession the treasury secretary yellen says that it s not inevitable that we re gonna have recession what are your thoughts about this and does it really matter we keep hearing the word recession is it just is it just semantics does it really matter if everything is down and inflation is high whatever you call it yeah it just makes it more difficult to run your household and by that i m not here to agree or disagree with the treasury secretary but i can i can say this all the signs point to recession is on the horizon you ve got high inflation you ve got rising interest rates which is trying to bring down the inflation and so what you re likely to see jeff is increased unemployment in the next few months um which is simple byproduct of in 2020 we were all scared and didn t spend any money in 2021 we were excited to spend money so we spent lot of money and 2022 was always going to be like this there was no chance it wouldn t be like this uh and so it s sort of just leveling out of this so what do you see happening for the rest of the year right the fed raising interest rates um is that enough are they doing enough when will we see inflation come down when will prices start dropping i think you ll start seeing prices drop in the late fall you re already starting to see the housing market shake up little bit with rising interest rates you re seeing rising mortgage rates and when that happens lot of the service companies that serve the home building community prices start to come down there so i think you ll start to notice price changes in the late fall i do have to admit that one of the last things you re gonna see change our food prices you re not you re not gonna see your beef price come back down where you re used to having it you re not you re not gonna see all your vegetables come back down i think that s gonna take little while longer why it s really about the supply chain i mean um the white house this week said that one of the primary reason for inflation is the conflict the war going on in ukraine uh where i acknowledge that inflation isn t helped by the war in ukraine it s not the primary reason however with grain and lot of different food supplies going you know being produced in the ukraine that does affect food prices here and so you will see increased food prices for the near future at least let s talk about gas prices i mean it s insane so the white house is talking about federal gas tax holiday where they would let that go is that enough to do the trick yeah i think the only thing that s gonna change gas prices where people choose to not use as much gas now gasoline has always been what s called in elastic meaning the price goes up and people don t care they keep using the same amount of gas jeff i think to get gas prices under control people need to start making choices of wind to drive in fact jeff i would argue this will keep the hybrid work from home situation going longer than it otherwise would have gone because i don t think people are gonna want to get in their cars and drive to work and then pay for an increased lunch price at work i think person can save 200 month by simply working from home and not subjecting themselves to all this inflation so why are companies still telling everyone to go back to the office there seems to be disconnect in that right it seems that people want to stay home more and actually in this case you re talking about it actually being helpful financially right not going out for lunch not paying the gas prices but then companies are telling people to go back i will note employers and employees are not aligned on this employers like myself we want people here because of collaboration we wanna it s the conversations in the hallway they get lot done not to mention you by lot of office space and you want to fill it up the employee though says look i m just as good at home if we need to collaborate send me text message and by the way i can work in sweatpants um so i i don t say that judgmental i just say like why get in your car sit in traffic and then eat lunch out and spend bunch of money so i don t think this work from home things gonna sort itself out for another 12 18 months just because of inflation alone so that s so interesting that if everybody drove just little less that could really potentially right because then what you it s it s high school economics it s supply and demand if demand goes down and supply stays the same you could see price decreases but uh it s summer driving season i ve got family trip heading down to charleston south carolina we are driving and we will spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars of fuel on fuel and jeff there s no way we re not going so it s not like we see gas prices and go well we re staying put no we ve planned this for long time we re going but i think people s habits will start to change people say i m not actually driving to that side of town today we ll figure out something else i think at 6 gallon which is where we re heading i think people are gonna start making that decision let s talk about crypto currency uh i own some crypto you want crypto i do not i m not big crypto guy i love talking about it but it s not my thing so is this thing gonna crater is it going to zero warren buffett says this thing is going to zero he famously said i think it was couple of months ago if somebody came to me with all the bitcoin in the world and they were gonna sell it to me for 25 i d say no thanks where do you stand on this is it going to zero or is it going back well i make it practice to never disagree with warren buffett however i don t think it s going to zero but i also think that um we ve learned lot in the last couple of months about the relation of crypto into the stock market in general are they aligned are they heading in the same direction it was supposed to be degree of hedge jeff right you could not expose yourself to the equity market the stock market and still get some some return out of the crypto market but if the crypto market crashes right alongside with the stock market then what value is it really providing i would also note you re getting lot more amateur investors in the crypto marketplace just as you had amateur investors in the late 1990s day trading like i used to write so i think you re just seeing inexperienced amateur investors learning what volatility really feels like with crypto i want to talk about the housing market little bit where do you say there is definitely softening going on but supply is still low if you look at lot of places it s not like you have ton of supply lot of people are saying well hold on the real estate market is gonna crash but really isn t it just like it s still gonna go up but it was going up like this now it s gonna go little slower like this potential yeah and look i don t think it s gonna crash i think it it ll definitely level out and and it s because there ll be there ll be fewer buyers that qualify for the higher priced homes when when interest rates were at 3 or 2 5 it s pretty easy to afford very expensive house depending on your income when that interest rate goes up by three or 4 the by the market of buyers shrinks significantly so again just based on economics alone if there s less demand because there s fewer buyers you re gonna see prices relax little bit not that you re real estate expert but just financially if you re if you have home that you plan on selling in the next you know 2 3 years is this the time to sell well wait again given that i m not real estate expert i would say you always want to sell at the top of market that the challenge of course as you know jeff is then where do you live you just gonna rent and and feel it out for couple of years i ll note this maybe i ll stay in different way the last thing i would do right now is buy home it would be the absolute last thing i would do high prices and high lending prices makes for bad time to buy home my wife and i bought our home in 2007 which was horrible time to buy home in retrospect high prices relatively high interest rates uh and and not that we ve had to deal with that for the last 14 years but it s it s certainly something that affected us for the first few years after that decision mm um do you see interest rates coming down at some point in couple of years will the fed pull back on these will they start cutting once inflation is under control do you think we ve got lot to go before that and in fact i would argue i would like to see the fed more aggressive they did 75 basis points basis point increase on the federally i would like to have seen it at 100 basis points full percentage point i d like to see him do it again um the sooner they get that done the sooner the sooner the economy can normalize of what people are used to it is worth noting that we have had unprecedented economic growth over the last couple of decades and so people are so used to low interest rates and or you know amazing stock market and robust economy these things correct there s balance in the world so this time we re about to go through it s going to be eye opening for people who weren t an adult in the last 20 years right it s gonna be the first period of time in which they ve experienced financial hardship back in like the seventies or was it eighties or seventies interest rates are really high right where they re like 9 or yeah you hear the stories about grandma had an 18 5 interest rate on their mortgage and you re like what how are you leaving yeah you wonder why real estate market wasn t increasing significantly in the late 70s and early 80s is because interest rates were so high there weren t enough buyers to go into the marketplace to to make home prices go up part of the reason why our housing market has been on fire is because of the low interest rates the low lending rates and so it will it will adjust because it always does when the fed raises the rates right that s also impacting your credit card interest right it s not just housing everything you know it s it s it s everything you want to talk about another market that s really gotten out of whack is is cars uh you know the average car payment america as of last month is over 700 month the supply chain is messed up and so with the higher interest rates that are upon us right now i think what you re gonna see is that market cool off little bit too and he could use it i mean it could i mean by the way car salesperson is not going to tell you they want the market to cool off but i will notice the supply chain normalizes and as those interest rates go up you re going to see it s easy being get the rossen reports newsletter deals scams your money unemployment jeff s newsletter cuts through the noise your

it was very frustrating to read noam scheiber s profile of jaz brisack the person who led the first successful union organizing drive at a starbucks brisack does sound like a very impressive person and it is good to see her getting the attention her efforts warrant however scheiber ruins the story by repeatedly telling readers that the neoliberals who have dominated political debate in recent decades want a free market nothing could be further from the truth i will start the indictment with their support of intellectual property government granted patent and copyright monopolies transfer many hundred billion dollars annually from the rest of us to the top 10 percent and especially the top one percent bill gates would still be working for a living if the government didn t threaten to arrest anyone who made copies of microsoft software without his permission then we have free trade the neoliberals made it a top priority to make it as easy as possible to bring in cheap manufactured goods from developing countries this cost millions of manufacturing jobs and put downward pressure on the pay of noncollege educated workers more generally by contrast if you talk to most neoliberals about removing the barriers that make it difficult for foreign doctors to practice in the united states or other highly paid professionals most suddenly get really stupid like they don t know what free trade is neoliberals have been happy to lower the trade barriers that protect the wages of less educated workers but then it comes to the barriers that support the pay of people like them they are the most protectionist people around the financial sector is another example when people buy clothes or food in most places they pay a sales tax but that s not the case for purchases of financial assets suppose we ended the special treatment for the financial sector and imposed a very modest 0 1 percent on sales of stock and other financial assets this would radically reduce the incomes of many very rich wall street types while having a minimal impact on the ability of the financial sector to carry through its productive purposes it is also not the free market to give facebook and other social media behemoths section 230 protection against defamation suits that print and broadcast outlets don t enjoy mark zuckerberg and other facebook insiders would be much poorer without this protection but we would be moving towards a free market by taking it away i could go on see rigged but the point should be clear neoliberal types are just fine with all sorts of government interventions that redistribute income upward they just get upset when the government intervenes in ways that redistributes from those on top to the rest of us it is understandable that neoliberals would like to be seen as big advocates of the free market after all it sounds much better to say that you favor a free market than to see that you favor redistributing from the poor and working class to the rich and very rich but the neoliberals self description is not accurate and people like scheiber should not be repeating it neoliberals need to be exposed for who they really are this article was originally published as neoliberals don t like free markets but they want you to think they do courtesy counterpunch org

by alicia wallace cnn business the record run up in home prices and rents exacerbated the affordable housing crisis in the us and rising interest rates stand to make it even worse according to harvard university s annual state of the nation s housing report released wednesday although quickly rising mortgage rates are already appearing to cool overheated housing markets they are putting the homeownership dreams of millions of americans even further out of reach researchers and housing industry experts said the income needed to qualify for a home has skyrocketed the mortgage property tax and insurance payments for a median priced home of 340 700 cost 700 more per month in april 2022 than they did a year before and the annual income needed to qualify for such a home is 28 000 higher in april 2022 versus last year according to harvard s joint center for housing studies which analyzed data from freddie mac and the national association of realtors this has priced out about 4 million renters over the past year alone said daniel t mccue senior research associate at the joint center for housing studies if the door is closing on affordable home ownership it would lock in some significant inequities in housing he said wednesday during a webcast panel discussion about the report a tale of two housing markets economic gains made before the pandemic financial stimulus benefits and moratoriums on foreclosures and evictions during the pandemic and a strong job market helped to not only keep people in their homes but also allowed other americans especially older millennials and people of color to have the financial wherewithal to become homeowners but in march 2022 home prices rose 20 6 year over year which was the largest jump in 30 years of record keeping according to joint center for housing studies tabulations of costar and corelogic case shiller home price indices data rents shot up as well especially for single family homes that served as remote office spaces for families during the pandemic that caught the eye of investment firms which snapped up moderately priced homes in booming markets to then rent out or flip for a profit investor holdings accounted for nearly 30 of all homes sold during the first quarter of this year harvard s housing studies researchers noted citing corelogic data new construction increased as well but the majority of those new homes sold for more than 400 000 putting them out of reach for first time home buyers the researchers said the growth in homeownership however has not been enough to narrow the gap of longstanding systemic racial disparities in early 2022 homeownership rates for black and hispanic households were 45 3 and 49 1 respectively by comparison white households had a home ownership rate of 77 researchers wrote citing us census housing vacancy survey data the increase in home values and record low interest rates during the heart of the pandemic further widened the already drastic wealth gap between homeowners and renters as well as racial inequities according to the study folks that are trying to buy their first homes families that are trying to transition from out of rental into something more affordable the market right now is not working for that demographic said alanna mccargo president of ginnie mae the federally owned mortgage backer adding increased concern she said are not only the rising rates of evictions and foreclosures after pandemic related moratoriums were lifted but also the impact of inflation we have to be very intentional that we are not leaving people behind mccargo said massive supply demand imbalance eviction and foreclosure moratoriums put in place during 2020 helped ease the financial strain on many households but some haven t been able to dig out yet according to the harvard study about 10 of households were behind on their rent or mortgage payments during the period of december 2021 to april 2022 the share of renters behind on payments was 14 5 versus 6 for homeowners researchers found households are going to be very precariously housed and we may even see increased homelessness as a result of that which is already increasing in many communities said sarah saadian senior vice president of public policy for the national low income housing coalition adding that it s already at a crisis point at the center of this is a massive supply demand imbalance said ryan marshall president and chief executive officer of atlanta based homebuilder pultegroup marshall noted higher construction costs supply constraints and strict land use policies have discouraged development existing municipalities and existing residents do not want any new neighbors he said they ve got their slice of paradise and they don t want any new friends and it s the sad reality of the world that we live in today the joint center for housing studies researchers noted that one potential solution could come from the biden administration s housing supply action plan which seeks to increase affordable housing options through the funding of state and local reforms adding requirements for federally owned housing to go to owner occupants and helping the private sector address supply chain challenges another option they noted are state based efforts such as density promoting land use changes in states such as california and oregon while the federal reserve seeks to soften demand for homes and curb inflation by raising rates it can do very little to address ongoing constraints on the number of available homes for sale fed chairman jerome powell said wednesday in testimony before the senate banking committee still he cautioned rising mortgage rates could ultimately price people out of homeownership the federal reserve does not set the interest rates borrowers pay on mortgages directly but its actions influence them mortgage rates tend to track 10 year us treasury bonds but mortgage rates are indirectly impacted by the fed s actions on inflation as investors see or anticipate rate hikes they often sell government bonds which sends yields higher and with it mortgage rates should monetary policy tighten and spur an economic downturn that presents an even greater concern harvard researchers wrote with so many households financially stressed by high housing costs a serious downturn could transform the recent uptick in housing insecurity into a wave they wrote cnn s matt egan and anna bahney contributed to this report the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

s main social problems a shortage of quality housing caused by decades of inadequate maintenance a lack of new housing and impediments facing people trying to fix up their own homes an official review last year found that the island of 11 3 million people had 3 9 million homes at the end of 2020 almost 40 of which were just in fair to poor condition cuba needed another 862 000 homes to adequately house its people up from an officially estimated shortfall of about 500 000 in 2005 the government announced a major national program to solve the problem in 2018 but the latest official figures show a dramatic drop in recent construction as the country has struggled with a pandemic stricken economy and tighter us sanctions in 2019 44 000 homes were built 35 by the state and 65 by individual families in 2020 that number dropped to 32 000 43 by the state and 57 by individuals last year about 18 000 units were built 47 by the state and 53 by individuals there are no official figures for the current year that leaves families like ayala s with little option when it rains here everything gets wet furniture the refrigerator we have nowhere to move things to said ayala trying to control her emotion while showing the effects of the latest downpours including a strong musty smell tomorrow a wind will come and this roof will fall on us and we will be two more dead said ayala 36 whose face is partially paralyzed after surgery for a brain tumor she and her brother wilmedis horta ayala a 39 year old physical education teacher at a primary school filled out all kinds of paperwork to get authorization to legally fix the place which is about a century old but the building permit mandatory in cuba was never issued lahera 65 was a state employee until she requested sick leave the four of them live off what the cuban state give her daughter to take care of her and the girls when it rains the walls here pick up a current become electrified she said they are bad but i don t know to what degree they would fall they are all cracked the building the structure is very old for decades in cuba residential construction was wholly controlled by the socialist government and no legal real estate market existed people could not sell homes in 2011 president raúl castro authorized the buying and selling of homes as a way to reactivate the economy giving more space to private enterprise thousands of people acquired houses or invested in fixing up the ones they had which suddenly gained capital value with an increase in tourism and a rapprochement with the united states in the middle of that decade some areas like old havana saw a wave of gentrification often aided by funds from families in the u s that hit a wall with the pandemic and trump era sanctions cuba s government has long struggled to build sufficient new housing or maintain existing structures and tried to keep a tight hand on private efforts believing often correctly that building materials had been pilfered from state stocks in recent years it has tried to offer more credits for construction and repairs and stimulate efforts by professional and workplace groups to build apartment buildings for themselves but construction materials are often hard to find at low price official outlets which often insist on seeing permits and private sellers demand prices far beyond what ayala or lahera can afford now the first rains of the new storm season have again exposed the fragility of cuba s housing much of it located in coastal cities with salt laden air you just have to walk through the city to see the profound deterioration of havana s buildings architect orlando inclán told the associated press inclán was part of a team that won a competition sponsored by his professional association to build social housing using alternative or recycled materials he and some of his colleagues are urging the government to lift a ban on private architecture and construction businesses and let them participate in a movement to clean up public spaces and houses for the island s population it is time to diversify the housing policy the actors involved must be diversified the materials must be diversified the ways of understanding housing must be diversified he said there doesn t have to be only one producer of housing the only way to find a solution to this is to think creatively andrea

sterling terms with dividends reinvested latin american latam equities posted a positive performance over the month with chile and colombia leading the rise security selection in peru contributed the most to relative performance over the period while security selection in brazil detracted most from relative returns an absence in the portfolio of the brazilian electric engineering company weg was the top contributor to performance during the month our view remains that the stock is expensive and rising input costs are likely to weigh on near term profits an overweight position in chilean pulp and paper company empresas cmpc also benefitted the portfolio as the company is performing well on the back of current elevated pulp prices stemming from supply constraints on the other hand the lack of any holding in chilean chemical company sociedad quimica y minera de chile detracted most from relative performance as the company s main product lithium benefitted from the rising price environment given strong expected demand from electronic vehicle producers an overweight position in brazilian healthcare company hapvida also detracted from relative performance as the stock has been impacted this year following covid related spikes in healthcare costs which have been eating into the company s profitability we continue to have strong conviction in the stock given the recent merger with intermedica another healthcare company the combined entity will have greater scale which should translate in to better procurement terms in the future as such we have added to our position in the stock as we see the name trading at attractive fundamentals following its recent underperformance we reduced our exposure to brazilian bank banco bradesco to take profits following stock outperformance we sold our holding in brazilian food processing company marfrig as we see signs of the cattle cycle turning for next few years leading to downside to margin expectations the portfolio ended the period being overweight to brazil and mexico whilst being underweight to colombia and peru at the sector level we are overweight financials and real estate and underweight energy and utilities latin american equities are bouncing back from a challenging 2021 as investors learn to live with the region s political risk and focus instead on soaring local interest rates and commodity prices latam currency remains relatively cheap at current levels as the combination of rising interest rates and low valuations has been attracting investors to increase regional exposure latin american central banks were the first to raise rates last year and policy makers in mexico and colombia have both surprised markets with steep hikes this year in preparation for federal reserve tightening meanwhile brazilian policy makers have increased borrowing costs to the highest levels in almost five years latin america has been proactive in hiking rates and is considered to be ahead of the curve from a monetary policy standpoint relative to developed markets having been one of the worst performing emerging market currencies last year the brazilian real has shown robust appreciation this year with the currency strengthening on the back of higher interest rates while rises in commodity prices have certainly played a role the prices of oil soybeans and iron ore brazil s main commodity exports have increased since the start of the year what s more high interest rates are making local assets more attractive latin america s high yields compared with peers and relatively cheap local stock markets continue to attract foreign account inflows global rotation from growth stocks into value stocks continue to boost performance latin america and considering the federal reserve s pace of interest rate rises this may keep investors away from growth stocks for now we would argue that for many reasons latam would seem well positioned ahead of rising geopolitical tensions as the region provides i geographic and economic insulation from the recent conflict ii long and wide commodities exposure iii cheap currencies iv attractive valuation entry points and v

financial report 3 further details are given in the glossary in the half yearly financial report sources blackrock and datastream chairman s statement dear shareholder overview recent reports to shareholders were inevitably dominated by the covid 19 pandemic and its inpacts on markets and economies direct impacts lockdowns and the like have reduced over the recent months although the receding pandemic has left behind it a number of related supply constraints causing inflation to rise sharply as demand for goods outstripped supply as economic activity restarted these effects were then compounded by russia s invasion of ukraine and the resulting humanitarian crisis market volatility spiked and sentiment has been firmly orientated towards fear not greed with market participants reducing exposure and seeking safe havens the west s response to russia s invasion has been decisive applying unprecedented sanctions on russian companies and financial institutions freezing assets and even the announcement by the uk and the us of a total ban on the import of russian oil and gas although many would argue these severe actions have been entirely appropriate they have not been without significant cost to western economies the resulting energy supply shock has seen energy prices skyrocket and this coupled with the existing post covid 19 supply constraints mentioned above has pushed inflation to levels not seen in decades in the uk hitting a 40 year high of 9 1 in may 2022 this has left central banks walking a delicate tightrope act between intervening to address soaring inflation while running the risk of curtailing economic growth the bank of england raised interest rates by 0 25 percentage points to 1 in may 2022 and by a further 0 25 percentage points in june 2022 with further rate hikes likely later this year which along with other policy tightening points to a likely drop in the rate of inflation over the next half year or so looking into the future though equity markets have given back much of the gains made from the economic restart reflecting the anticipation of further interest rate hikes the rapidly rising cost of living and lower consumer spending higher operational costs for companies as the price of commodities and energy rise and ultimately lower overall levels of growth for uk public companies against the turmoil described above i am pleased to report that our portfolio has been resilient outperforming many of its sector peers and the benchmark return during the period in addition it is also positive to see that the revenue generated by our investment portfolio has risen versus the prior year despite the challenges during the period as you will read in the investment manager s report which follows our portfolio saw strong performance from our exposure to commodities and energy our financial holdings also performed well as interest rates rose and our portfolio managers have added several new holdings which are well placed to benefit from rising energy prices and the uk government s focus on energy security performance during the period the company s net asset value per share nav returned 4 5 compared with the company s benchmark the ftse all share index total return which returned 3 1 the company s share price returned 0 3 all percentages in sterling with dividends reinvested subsequent to the period end and as at 20 june 2022 the net asset value per share of the company has decreased by 6 5 from 207 67 pence per share to 194 27 pence per share and the company s share price has fallen by 5 3 from 187 00 pence to 177 00 pence per share the company s benchmark index has decreased by 5 6 over the same period further information on the significant components of overall performance and the changes to portfolio composition are set out in the investment manager s report below revenue profit and dividends revenue profit for the period was 3 53 pence per share six months to 30 april 2021 3 15 pence per share an increase of 12 1 year on year the board is pleased to declare an interim dividend of 2 60 pence per share 2021 2 60 pence per share this dividend will be paid on 1 september 2022 to shareholders on the company s register at the close of business on 22 july 2022 the ex dividend date is 21 july 2022 i am pleased to report that our interim dividend is fully covered by the revenue generated during the period after the payment of this year s interim dividend the company will have approximately one year s dividend cover in revenue reserves share capital the directors recognise the importance to investors that the company s share price should not trade at a significant discount to nav and therefore in normal market conditions may use the company s share buy back sale of shares from treasury and share issuance powers to seek to ensure that the share price does not differ excessively from the underlying nav buying back shares at a discount is accretive to nav and can help narrow the discount to nav at which the company s shares trade it can also help to provide additional liquidity during the period the company s shares traded at an average discount of 8 9 and ended the period at 10 0 at the close of business on 20 june 2022 the discount had narrowed to 8 9 a total of 198 206 ordinary shares were bought back and cancelled during the period at an average price of 183 65 pence and for a total consideration of 364 000 no shares were issued or sold from treasury during the period under review as at 20 june 2022 32 3 of the company s issued ordinary share capital is held in treasury and may be issued to satisfy any demand for the company s shares that may arise gearing the company operates a flexible gearing policy which depends on prevailing conditions and the outlook for the market gearing is subject to a maximum level of 20 of net assets at the time of investment the company reduced levels of gearing during the period under review and at 30 april 2022 the company had net gearing of 1 4 gearing levels and sources of funding are reviewed regularly to ensure that the company has access to the most competitive borrowing rates available to it the company currently has a two year unsecured sterling revolving credit facility of 4 000 000 with ing bank luxembourg s a which is fully drawn down and is scheduled to mature in november 2023 shareholder communication the board appreciates how important access to regular information is to our shareholders to supplement our company website we now offer shareholders the ability to sign up to the trust matters newsletter which includes information on the company as well as news views and insights further information on how to sign up is included on the inside cover of the half yearly financial report outlook as you will read in their report which follows below your investment managers continue to seek out companies that can generate strong consistent cash flow from robust business models which have favourable industry characteristics or scope for management driven self help they are focused on bottom up stock selection and are emboldened by the attractive stock specific opportunities on offer given the ongoing market volatility our portfolio managers continue to apply prudent balance to the portfolio which has resulted in resilience and the protection of shareholder capital during these most challenging times however they also continue to seek exposure to macro trends and growth through those companies best placed to thrive in the current environment whilst applying a degree of caution as the powerful macroeconomic drivers described above play out through the remainder of the year and beyond as we move into an economic and policy environment which is more than usually changeable your board remains fully supportive of our portfolio managers approach and to their aim of positioning the portfolio to deliver on the company s investment objective graeme proudfoot chairman 22 june 2022 investment manager s report performance for the six month period since 31 october 2021 the company s nav returned 4 5 outperforming its benchmark the ftse all share index the benchmark index which returned 3 1 over the same period all percentages in sterling with dividends reinvested investment approach in assembling the company s portfolio we adopt a concentrated investment approach to ensure that our best ideas contribute significantly to returns we believe that it is the role of the portfolio overall to generate an attractive and growing yield alongside capital growth rather than every individual company within the portfolio this gives the company increased flexibility to invest where returns are most attractive this approach results in a portfolio which differs substantially from the index and in any individual year the returns will vary sometimes significantly from those of the index the foundation of the portfolio approximately 70 is in high free cash flow companies that can sustain cash generation and pay a growing dividend whilst aiming to deliver a double digit total return additionally we look to identify and invest 20 of the portfolio in growth companies that have significant barriers to entry and scalable business models that enable them to grow consistently we also look for turnaround companies at around 10 of portfolio value which represent those companies that are out of favour with the market offering attractive recovery potential market review the benchmark index rose 3 1 over the six months to 30 april 2022 with oil gas utilities and basic materials as top outperformers the benchmark index was a notable outperformer versus other developed markets indices where a number of emerging and strengthening headwinds served to put pressure on risk assets globally these headwinds include the omicron covid 19 variant russia s invasion of ukraine as well as a general increase in geopolitical tensions rising inflation weakening consumer sentiment and record high energy prices the omicron variant created a ripple effect in developed markets early in the period and although its impact faded as 2022 has progressed it continues to disrupt economic activity most notably in china where stringent lockdowns are still enforced affecting global supply chains prior to russia s invasion of ukraine markets had been impacted by the steep rise in bond yields as investors rapidly repriced the scale and speed of interest rate rises in response to high and persistent inflation supply constraints have been widespread with the shortage of semiconductors perhaps the highest profile the war has only served to exacerbate those inflationary concerns with key commodities across energy and agricultural markets rising sharply in price security of energy supply becoming a key focus as countries seek to reduce their dependence on russia market performance was dominated by the strength in commodities prices which benefitted the mining and oil gas sectors these are relatively large weights in the benchmark index contributing to its relative resilience over this period defensive sectors such as tobacco and pharmaceuticals also benefitted from greater economic uncertainty meanwhile long duration assets were negatively impacted by rising interest rates which reduce the present value of their growth contributors to and detractors from performance positive contributors to performance included stock selection in the consumer services basic materials and consumer goods sectors and the overweight positioning to the health care sector the mining sector performed strongly during the period reflecting strength in commodity markets and continued capital discipline from the miners as demonstrated by further large shareholder returns as a result the holdings in rio tinto and bhp were significant contributors to the returns of the company during the period standard chartered was also a top contributor to performance benefitting from increases in interest rates and a return to revenue growth mastercard also contributed to performance after the company reported solid results with strong payment volumes and an encouraging acceleration in cross border volume linked to increased travel this supports our thesis that growth will accelerate as the continued structural shift towards digital payments is boosted by a normalisation in consumer activity post covid 19 as economic uncertainty boosted defensive holdings british american tobacco and nutrition ingredients business tate lyle rose and performed well during the period other positive contributors to performance during the period included education business pearson which received a takeover approach even though the bid has subsequently fallen away and drax group the power generator benefitting from the disruption in oil and gas markets both tate lyle and drax group were recent additions to the company having been purchased during the second half of 2021 detractors from performance included the underweight positioning to oil gas given the strength in the oil price and the sector holdings in the industrials sector also detracted impacted by the rotation away from growth stocks concerns regarding the risk of supply chain shocks and as recessionary fears emerged we remain confident that we have invested in franchises that have built durable competitive advantages are cash generative and boast strong balance sheets that are well placed to navigate this challenging operating environment notable detractors included hays and moonpig group which reflected concerns of a deterioration in the economic backdrop and consumer weakness given rising inflationary pressures taylor wimpey was impacted by fears of further costs associated with the cladding removal bill as well as the impact of rising inflation and interest rates on their customers and their profitability adobe systems also fell despite robust operational performance given the increase in the interest rates which has reduced the premium at which high growth technology companies are valued transactions we purchased a new holding in bt group which is building out the uk s national fibre network targeting more than 25 million homes providing consumers and businesses with access to high speed internet we believe that the regulatory landscape for the uk telecom industry is improving and that the market participants are behaving more rationally we are seeing price rises of consumer prices index cpi 4 with limited backlash so far and all operators are following suit the company has the ability to put through in contract price rises in their contract wording limiting any sticker shock the average telecoms bill represents 0 4 of uk household s bills such that the currently expected 9 price rise equates to a c 50 increase in the annual bill there is a high drop through from these price rises to the company s profits and cash flow while the capex investment phase around fibre slows in around 4 years at which point we expect a meaningful uplift in free cash flow generation we also purchased a new holding in centrica the british gas company as we view it as a beneficiary of rising energy costs and of the increased focus on security of supply during the period we continued to reduce our consumer exposure by selling next and tesco and reduced the us exposure with the sale of analog devices we sold our holding in oxford nanopore following the strong share price performance post initial public offering we also sold the position in smiths group after the successful sale of the company s medical division and recent strength in the share price the investment case required an acceleration in organic growth which we believe may prove more challenging given the difficult economic backdrop we also materially reduced our position in bp group given its large stake in rosneft continuing to favour a larger position in shell ferguson s strong logistics enabled the company to thrive during this period of disrupted supply chains while high commodity prices boosted revenues and margins the strong share price combined with our concern over the sustainability of this performance prompted us to sell the holding we used some of the proceeds of the ferguson sale to purchase a new holding in ashtead group the us focused equipment rental company offering attractive structural growth from continued outsourcing trends in this fragmented industry following recent share price weakness gearing our general approach to gearing is that we aim to run the company with a modest and consistent level of gearing to enhance income generation and capital growth accordingly the company is typically 5 10 geared however at 30 april 2022 the company had employed net gearing of 1 4 to reflect our more cautious views on markets outlook we are conscious that at the time of writing there is a significant conflict and human suffering whilst we continue to reference the investment implications of this we recognise there are also tremendous implications for humanity the russian invasion of ukraine has contributed not just to the volatility of 2022 but also to the range of outcomes the backdrop for global equities therefore in our view is mixed although demand remains strong the outlook for corporate revenue and earnings growth is likely to worsen over the course of 2022 as the potential negative jaws of rising oil prices and rates raise the spectre once again of stagflation it is still likely that despite the emerging cost of living crisis government stimulus continues to be retracted and monetary policy is tightened in the face of more persistent inflationary pressures it will be incredibly important to focus on companies with strong competitive positions that can deliver in this environment and that trade at attractive valuations central banks universally across the developed world have entered 2022 in a far more hawkish manner and as a result market expectations for higher rates and faster quantitative tightening have risen considerably time will tell whether the conflict impacts the growth outlook and therefore the hawkishness of central banks it is also more likely we will see increasingly divergent regional monetary approaches with the us being somewhat more insulated from the impact of the conflict than for example europe we still do not know whether the current inflationary trends are temporary or structural within this calculation one must consider the impact from the significant covid 19 stimulus the unwinding of extreme covid 19 behaviours a more structural shift in the cost of labour and the impact on costs from the decarbonisation agenda or indeed a combination of the above it is difficult to have a high degree of confidence in the outcome but we would note given the uncertainty there is a rising risk of a policy mistake either being too late to tighten and or tightening too hard we expect this and the geopolitical ramifications of the ukraine war to be the prevailing debate of 2022 and beyond the strain on supply chains caused by strong economic activity overwhelming covid 19 afflicted capacity and restricted labour availability will continue to provide inflationary pressures which can squeeze companies margins as a reminder we continue to concentrate the portfolio on businesses with pricing power and durable competitive advantages as we see these as best placed to protect margins and returns over the medium and long term however a notable feature of our conversations with a wide range of corporates in 2021 was the ease with which they were able to pass on cost increases and protect or expand margins management teams have pointed to robust demand prioritisation of security of supply as well as well publicised supply chain disruption and cost pressures however we believe that as some of the transitory inflationary pressures start to fade e g commodity prices supply chain disruption then pricing conversations will become more challenging we are also increasingly focused on wage inflation which may be more structural and yet in our experience harder to pass on corporates have already pointed to wages picking up the introduction of bonuses and growing pressure on employee retention rates as competition for labour intensifies we therefore believe that employee retention will be an important differentiator in 2022 given the productivity benefits of a stable workforce as labour markets tighten further the uk stock market has started the year far better than any other developed market indices benefitting from a far lower and thus more attractive starting valuation the benchmark index has benefitted from the lack of a widespread re rating seen in many other markets as well as its relatively high exposure to commodities we continue to see appetite to acquire great market positions real assets and or unlevered free cash flow as highlighted by takeover approaches for two portfolio holdings oxford instruments and pearson while most companies are paying dividends once more we note the large contribution from special dividends that may not persist that said as the highest dividend yielding market in the developed world we see the fundamental valuation of the uk as attractive we also view the outlook for ordinary dividends for the uk market with optimism as most companies have emerged from the covid 19 crisis with appropriate dividend policies we continue to have conviction in cash generative companies with durable competitive advantages exceptional management teams and underappreciated growth potential at present whilst we are excited by the attractive stock specific opportunities on offer we continue to approach the year with balance in the portfolio adam avigdori and david goldman blackrock investment management uk limited 22 june 2022 ten largest investments 1

rossen reports when will prices start dropping financial expert weighs in share copy link copy pete my wife is saying every day because we have lot of money in our four oh one k of course just like lot of people were watching it go down and down and down and crater and every day my wife is saying to me let s get out of this we need to get out of this like we re losing money by the day and i say i think that s the opposite of what experts say are supposed to do right now so pete i guess what i m mainly asking is who s right me and my wife you re gonna make me choose aren t you by the way you meant you had money in your 40 and k jeff um and uh yeah oddly you re right you re right and here s how i like to explain this let s say you re driving from indianapolis to orlando it s straight line south kind of straight and let s say you have to take detour to kansas city which is what the markets just done it s just taking this big detour you re not gonna get out of your car in kansas city because you re further away from your goal it just wouldn t it wouldn t make sense so what s happening right in the market is what happens every 10 years or so and it s really easy to freak out and what i tell people generally speaking is don t stare at your account balance you won t even notice the difference keep buying into the market because then you re buying at lower price so this is not the time to get out ride it out and you re actually saying buy more now there are some pretty good companies that you can get on sale absolutely there s some good bargains right now now i will note you want to make sure you ve got good emergency fund good cash position as i m sure we re gonna talk about like the recession is on the horizon and so you want to be little bit more cash heavy in case you need to deal with unemployment issues or something like that but yeah when the market s down that s when smart people make money let s talk about possible recession the treasury secretary yellen says that it s not inevitable that we re gonna have recession what are your thoughts about this and does it really matter we keep hearing the word recession is it just is it just semantics does it really matter if everything is down and inflation is high whatever you call it yeah it just makes it more difficult to run your household and by that i m not here to agree or disagree with the treasury secretary but i can i can say this all the signs point to recession is on the horizon you ve got high inflation you ve got rising interest rates which is trying to bring down the inflation and so what you re likely to see jeff is increased unemployment in the next few months um which is simple byproduct of in 2020 we were all scared and didn t spend any money in 2021 we were excited to spend money so we spent lot of money and 2022 was always going to be like this there was no chance it wouldn t be like this uh and so it s sort of just leveling out of this so what do you see happening for the rest of the year right the fed raising interest rates um is that enough are they doing enough when will we see inflation come down when will prices start dropping i think you ll start seeing prices drop in the late fall you re already starting to see the housing market shake up little bit with rising interest rates you re seeing rising mortgage rates and when that happens lot of the service companies that serve the home building community prices start to come down there so i think you ll start to notice price changes in the late fall i do have to admit that one of the last things you re gonna see change our food prices you re not you re not gonna see your beef price come back down where you re used to having it you re not you re not gonna see all your vegetables come back down i think that s gonna take little while longer why it s really about the supply chain i mean um the white house this week said that one of the primary reason for inflation is the conflict the war going on in ukraine uh where i acknowledge that inflation isn t helped by the war in ukraine it s not the primary reason however with grain and lot of different food supplies going you know being produced in the ukraine that does affect food prices here and so you will see increased food prices for the near future at least let s talk about gas prices i mean it s insane so the white house is talking about federal gas tax holiday where they would let that go is that enough to do the trick yeah i think the only thing that s gonna change gas prices where people choose to not use as much gas now gasoline has always been what s called in elastic meaning the price goes up and people don t care they keep using the same amount of gas jeff i think to get gas prices under control people need to start making choices of wind to drive in fact jeff i would argue this will keep the hybrid work from home situation going longer than it otherwise would have gone because i don t think people are gonna want to get in their cars and drive to work and then pay for an increased lunch price at work i think person can save 200 month by simply working from home and not subjecting themselves to all this inflation so why are companies still telling everyone to go back to the office there seems to be disconnect in that right it seems that people want to stay home more and actually in this case you re talking about it actually being helpful financially right not going out for lunch not paying the gas prices but then companies are telling people to go back i will note employers and employees are not aligned on this employers like myself we want people here because of collaboration we wanna it s the conversations in the hallway they get lot done not to mention you by lot of office space and you want to fill it up the employee though says look i m just as good at home if we need to collaborate send me text message and by the way i can work in sweatpants um so i i don t say that judgmental i just say like why get in your car sit in traffic and then eat lunch out and spend bunch of money so i don t think this work from home things gonna sort itself out for another 12 18 months just because of inflation alone so that s so interesting that if everybody drove just little less that could really potentially right because then what you it s it s high school economics it s supply and demand if demand goes down and supply stays the same you could see price decreases but uh it s summer driving season i ve got family trip heading down to charleston south carolina we are driving and we will spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars of fuel on fuel and jeff there s no way we re not going so it s not like we see gas prices and go well we re staying put no we ve planned this for long time we re going but i think people s habits will start to change people say i m not actually driving to that side of town today we ll figure out something else i think at 6 gallon which is where we re heading i think people are gonna start making that decision let s talk about crypto currency uh i own some crypto you want crypto i do not i m not big crypto guy i love talking about it but it s not my thing so is this thing gonna crater is it going to zero warren buffett says this thing is going to zero he famously said i think it was couple of months ago if somebody came to me with all the bitcoin in the world and they were gonna sell it to me for 25 i d say no thanks where do you stand on this is it going to zero or is it going back well i make it practice to never disagree with warren buffett however i don t think it s going to zero but i also think that um we ve learned lot in the last couple of months about the relation of crypto into the stock market in general are they aligned are they heading in the same direction it was supposed to be degree of hedge jeff right you could not expose yourself to the equity market the stock market and still get some some return out of the crypto market but if the crypto market crashes right alongside with the stock market then what value is it really providing i would also note you re getting lot more amateur investors in the crypto marketplace just as you had amateur investors in the late 1990s day trading like i used to write so i think you re just seeing inexperienced amateur investors learning what volatility really feels like with crypto i want to talk about the housing market little bit where do you say there is definitely softening going on but supply is still low if you look at lot of places it s not like you have ton of supply lot of people are saying well hold on the real estate market is gonna crash but really isn t it just like it s still gonna go up but it was going up like this now it s gonna go little slower like this potential yeah and look i don t think it s gonna crash i think it it ll definitely level out and and it s because there ll be there ll be fewer buyers that qualify for the higher priced homes when when interest rates were at 3 or 2 5 it s pretty easy to afford very expensive house depending on your income when that interest rate goes up by three or 4 the by the market of buyers shrinks significantly so again just based on economics alone if there s less demand because there s fewer buyers you re gonna see prices relax little bit not that you re real estate expert but just financially if you re if you have home that you plan on selling in the next you know 2 3 years is this the time to sell well wait again given that i m not real estate expert i would say you always want to sell at the top of market that the challenge of course as you know jeff is then where do you live you just gonna rent and and feel it out for couple of years i ll note this maybe i ll stay in different way the last thing i would do right now is buy home it would be the absolute last thing i would do high prices and high lending prices makes for bad time to buy home my wife and i bought our home in 2007 which was horrible time to buy home in retrospect high prices relatively high interest rates uh and and not that we ve had to deal with that for the last 14 years but it s it s certainly something that affected us for the first few years after that decision mm um do you see interest rates coming down at some point in couple of years will the fed pull back on these will they start cutting once inflation is under control do you think we ve got lot to go before that and in fact i would argue i would like to see the fed more aggressive they did 75 basis points basis point increase on the federally i would like to have seen it at 100 basis points full percentage point i d like to see him do it again um the sooner they get that done the sooner the sooner the economy can normalize of what people are used to it is worth noting that we have had unprecedented economic growth over the last couple of decades and so people are so used to low interest rates and or you know amazing stock market and robust economy these things correct there s balance in the world so this time we re about to go through it s going to be eye opening for people who weren t an adult in the last 20 years right it s gonna be the first period of time in which they ve experienced financial hardship back in like the seventies or was it eighties or seventies interest rates are really high right where they re like 9 or yeah you hear the stories about grandma had an 18 5 interest rate on their mortgage and you re like what how are you leaving yeah you wonder why real estate market wasn t increasing significantly in the late 70s and early 80s is because interest rates were so high there weren t enough buyers to go into the marketplace to to make home prices go up part of the reason why our housing market has been on fire is because of the low interest rates the low lending rates and so it will it will adjust because it always does when the fed raises the rates right that s also impacting your credit card interest right it s not just housing everything you know it s it s it s everything you want to talk about another market that s really gotten out of whack is is cars uh you know the average car payment america as of last month is over 700 month the supply chain is messed up and so with the higher interest rates that are upon us right now i think what you re gonna see is that market cool off little bit too and he could use it i mean it could i mean by the way car salesperson is not going to tell you they want the market to cool off but i will notice the supply chain normalizes and as those interest rates go up you re going to see it s easy being get the rossen reports newsletter deals scams your money unemployment jeff s newsletter cuts through the noise your

bitcoin the original cryptocurrency remains a bellwether for the sector it hit an all time high of more than us 68 000 55 600 in november 2021 when the overall value of the cryptocurrency market was close to us 3 trillion in the months since however most major cryptocurrencies have fallen by more 70 and bitcoin itself has dropped below us 18 000 is this just another crash in the volatile cryptocurrency market or is this the beginning of the end for this alternative asset class when bitcoin was first introduced in early 2009 it was a new type of asset while trading was thin initially price appreciation drove its value to nearly us 20 000 in late 2017 this happened as more retail investors were drawn to cryptocurrencies as a supposed hedge or safe haven versus other asset classes and as the market grew so too did the range of investment opportunities futures and options financial contracts to buy or sell an asset or security at a specific price or date are a common hedging tool used in other markets such as oil or the stock market in december 2017 the first bitcoin futures on a regulated exchange were listed by the chicago board options exchange bitcoin options followed on the chicago mercantile exchange in january 2020 this period of expansion was topped by the launch of the first bitcoin exchange traded fund etf in october 2021 providing investors with exposure to bitcoin without having to buy it on a crypto exchange growing crypto acceptance at the same time the traditional financial sector was becoming increasingly accepting of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class a 2021 study of institutional investors found seven in 10 expected to buy or invest in digital assets in the future this combination of maturity and acceptance however also increased the correlation between the stock market and cryptocurrencies leading to a decline in their safe haven properties bitcoin was fairly disconnected from traditional financial markets in its early days but as it became just another asset the sector began to be affected by the same macroeconomic factors that influence traditional markets the us federal reserve s decision to raise interest rates by 0 75 in june to combat growing inflation the ongoing war in ukraine and the subsequent rise in oil prices have all acted as a drag on cryptocurrencies in recent months moves to regulate the sector have also had an impact but it isn t only macroeconomic factors that have caused this crypto downturn in may and june this year stablecoin values plummeted major cryptocurrency exchange binance paused bitcoin withdrawals due to a stuck transaction and lending platform celsius network froze withdrawals and transfers citing extreme market conditions amid this disruption users of public blockchain platform solana have reportedly voted to temporarily take control of a so called whale account the platform s largest at around us 20 million to stop the account owner liquidating its positions and driving prices down even further together these factors have caused investor confidence to drain from the sector the crypto fear greed index is almost at an all time low of 9 100 which indicates extreme fear the index was at 75 100 when bitcoin reached its november 2021 high the crypto outlook so what does the future hold for this alternative asset class as can only be expected in the cryptocurrency ecosystem the range of views is extreme some see this market correction as a great time to buy the dip others believe this is the end of the party for cryptocurrencies resolute bitcoiners can always find positive signs in the market and many use on chain metrics trading signals based on data gleaned from public blockchain transactions to determine good times to buy recently popular metrics including market value to realized value mvrv a ratio showing current versus average coin prices suggest bitcoin is about to start an accumulation period based on past history on the other hand this may be an indication of confirmation bias as investors search for signals that confirm their beliefs others argue this is just one more instance in a long line of bursting cryptocurrency bubbles a typical crypto market cycle comparisons with the dotcom crash of 2000 have been rife in the market but crypto enthusiasts argue the basic premise of dotcom stocks was correct in that the internet was the future they believe the same is true of bitcoin predicting that the sector will recover economists have studied bubbles for centuries however and evidence shows many assets never recover nominal price highs after the market bubble bursts some of these economists including former us secretary of labor robert reich have equated cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes that unless regulated will go the way of all such schemes and eventually collapse certainly the vision of cryptocurrencies as a decentralized asset available on a peer to peer network with no barriers to entry goes against recent actions such as the freezing of withdrawals by some platforms these moves will not go down well with crypto enthusiasts further the increased correlation of cryptocurrencies to other asset classes is diminishing their value as a diversification tool while growing interest in central bank digital currencies threatens to further erode crypto s attractiveness to its core investors cryptocurrencies also face challenges around energy use privacy and security it is not clear if these issues can be solved without eroding the elements that made cryptocurrencies popular in the first place the recent us launch of a short bitcoin etf which enables investors to gain from declines in the bitcoin price will allow investors to hedge their positions and trade against bitcoin

every parent or caregiver s experience in navigating child care is different recently i was talking with someone about some of the things i ve personally learned since our child started attending a local early care and education center while my husband and i work monday to friday the more i went on about the added tasks to my day and the things we parents must do in preparation for sending our child to be cared for and taught by someone else the more i felt tired and the more my audience was amused and surprised it s a lot to juggle and it s exhausting but we re adapting at the same time it can be incredibly different based on someone s race or economic status and i recognize the privilege i carry as a white woman with a partner and a two income household those three things stare back at me every time i complain to myself in my head nevertheless the first days of having our baby cared for elsewhere felt like someone had ripped my heart out this little one is growing so fast and i don t want to miss a moment but i also want to work and i ve learned a lot in the past four months the following are 12 of my personal takeaways waitlists are real and space is limited for early care and education centers i should have gotten on a waitlist as soon as i found out we were expecting but i was too sick and tired to think about this and had no idea where to begin i was just trying to make sense of what was happening to my body and how to care for the baby growing inside we got on the waitlist at about 20 weeks gestation in june 2021 which meant only part time availability by the time i went back to work in january 2022 there is a child care resource referral program in north carolina i wish i d known about it sooner my baby already has empathy our baby who rarely cries cries when other babies cry this was one of the first things the administration told us when they gave us feedback about the adjustment to baby school as we call it your baby changes outfits more than celebrities at the oscars at least that s what we say when a baby has an accident during a diaper change or spit up that means an immediate preference or need for a different outfit we re required to keep two spare outfits at school but recently i sent eight all labeled to prevent the frequent need to supply more clothes every day that week the baby came home in a different outfit than the morning arrival our little tree must have known there was a selection to choose from parents have to stock and label diapers for child carer label every single one can you imagine sitting down to write your child s name on every diaper that goes with them i try to do it while watching television or a webinar that i m just listening to rather than on screen it s inevitable that every time my hand gets ink on it plus there s already an overlooked diaper need without diapers parents can t send their children to child care and without child care parents can t go to work diapers help parents work and set children up for more success in their future education supply and label wipes for the diaper changes at baby school we use a couple wipes per change so those go fast too and we don t want to send a lesser quality of wipes just because the baby is not with us so we buy wipes in bulk see above notes under no 4 supply and label fresh bottles for every single day and they re used with rules like a buffet line we started with taping post it notes to the bottles then we ordered a variety pack of multicolor masking tape only to learn that someone actually produces bottle labels wait they make bottle labels so now we actually have labels to write name date and contents on for the regularly cleaned and freshly supplied with breast or formula milk bottles that go to and from baby school each day meanwhile there s a formula shortage so on days when i haven t produced enough breast milk we must rely on powdered milk which is ever increasingly unavailable or increasing in cost and we learned there s regulations on bottle usage at the center much like a buffet once the baby s mouth has used a bottle for feeding they can t pick it up again to finish it later there are viruses and diseases you have never heard of or thought didn t exist anymore that are still very real in early childhood hand foot and mouth disease is still a thing and apparently adults can get rsv from kids need i say more if your baby or toddler is about to start child care here s a 2019 blog with what you need to know about the inevitable germ onslaught and babies get sick a lot in the first year but especially more so with all that extra close contact with fellow babies navigating the ever changing health and safety regulations landscape takes a lot of patience and attention keep your distance don t enter the building enter only certain parts of the building masks on masks off quarantine or isolate for five to 10 days it s hard to keep up no vaccines for covid 19 are available for children 5 and under yet so those of us who have little ones still have little freedom and rely very heavily on mutual consideration within our little early care and education communities to ensure health safety and well being this means we re not living freely yet while most adults have their masks off ours will stay on we re left behind they re coming soon but not fast enough as much as you have preferences for your parenting style you cannot totally influence others teaching styles we aspire to utilize a gender neutral parenting style and be as inclusive in our celebration of holidays we are more focused on offering all colors not just pink or blue and a variety of activities regardless of gender marketing says if you have a boy they re not going to want to play in a toy kitchen and a girl might not be playing with race cars we want our child to choose their interests based upon their interests not societal expectations for the sake of this blog i am keeping details about our child confidential but it pains me that we focus so much on sweet boy or good girl rather than on just who they re exploring what their interests are and identity means to them it is hard to find a center as inclusive or perfect for all the things your family may or may not celebrate and identify with while it was absolutely adorable to receive photos of our baby wearing a headband with bunny ears and a photo with an easter bunny what if we didn t celebrate easter did they acknowledge ramadan too i m trying to figure out how to bring up concerns without criticizing or being negative i never want to antagonize the people who are caring for loving on teaching and guiding my child through the most tender years you will never pay what quality early childhood care and education is worth to compensate the people who provide loving care for yet it s costing way too much people who work with infants toddlers and preschoolers don t get paid a fair living wage and are often not even provided benefits but child care costs exceed college tuition in north carolina right now we re paying 1 469 a month for one infant and in august it ll go up to 1 542 because of the costs of child care we cannot afford a second car yet and may not be able to afford a second child we are getting high quality early childhood education and care for our baby but it s not affordable for us is having a child in america becoming an unattainable privilege that s an analysis for another day but either way all teachers whether birth 5 k 12 or higher education deserve and should be compensated with worthy wages and benefits for worthy work early childhood parenting learning continues so many lessons and they continue i m tired don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free the ultimate epiphany navigating early care and education systems is hard for everyone right now and it doesn t do justice for anyone on either side of it no matter what there s guilt and a problem to solve i have realized i didn t want my baby at home because i couldn t concentrate on work and at home there would be no socialization with other little ones but i also didn t want my baby away from me in a building i d never been able to enter and see for myself with people i d never been able to meet because of a pandemic alas i had to trust the process because parenting is the ultimate group project without early education teachers like ms laura and ms liset as part of the team i would not be able to continue the career i love and we would not be able to pursue our financial and life goals and interests and that is something i don t take for granted i m so grateful to have them on our team again i recognize that even having access and being able to afford child care is a privilege that many parents and caregivers cannot afford especially single parents people with more children and lower income parents which tend to be women and people of color some parents might want child care and can t afford it while others want to stay at home with their children and some don t have a choice either way what are families and care providers early childhood aspirations i respect and support whatever someone s choice or desire is we all should and we must do more to support them no circumstance is the same and it s rarely easy the lessons will continue to grow just like our little tree either way we need a system that supports and allows for parents to have choices for options for their children to learn grow and work in their communities in the most successful way possible this article first appeared

economic financial and monetary developments overview high inflation is a major challenge for everyone the governing council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2 target over the medium term in may inflation again rose significantly mainly because of surging energy and food prices including due to the impact of the war in ukraine but inflation pressures have broadened and intensified with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly eurosystem staff have revised their baseline inflation projections up significantly these projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated for some time however moderating energy costs the easing of supply disruptions related to the pandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy are expected to lead to a decline in inflation the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area foresee annual inflation at 6 8 in 2022 before it is projected to decline to 3 5 in 2023 and 2 1 in 2024 higher than in the march projections this means that headline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above the ecb s target inflation excluding energy and food is projected to average 3 3 in 2022 2 8 in 2023 and 2 3 in 2024 also above the march projections russia s unjustified aggression towards ukraine continues to weigh on the economy in europe and beyond it is disrupting trade leading to shortages of materials and contributing to high energy and commodity prices these factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth especially in the near term however the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow on account of the ongoing reopening of the economy a strong labour market fiscal support and savings built up during the pandemic once current headwinds abate economic activity is expected to pick up again this outlook is broadly reflected in the eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections which foresee annual real gdp growth at 2 8 in 2022 2 1 in 2023 and 2 1 in 2024 compared with the march projections the outlook has been revised down significantly for 2022 and 2023 while for 2024 it has been revised up on the basis of the updated assessment the governing council decided to take further steps in normalising its monetary policy throughout this process the governing council will maintain optionality data dependence gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy first the governing council decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme app as of 1 july 2022 the governing council intends to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance second the governing council undertook a careful review of the conditions which according to its forward guidance should be satisfied before it starts raising the key ecb interest rates as a result of this assessment the governing council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied accordingly and in line with its policy sequencing the governing council intends to raise the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points at its july monetary policy meeting looking further ahead it expects to raise the key ecb interest rates again in september the calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium term inflation outlook if the medium term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates a larger increment will be appropriate at the september meeting third beyond september based on its current assessment the governing council anticipates that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate in line with the commitment to its 2 medium term target the pace at which the governing council adjusts its monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how it assesses inflation will develop in the medium term within the governing council s mandate under stressed conditions flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability economic activity the economic fallout from the russian invasion of ukraine and the new lockdowns in china represent two key headwinds to global growth in the near term survey indicators confirm that global activity is moderating disrupted economic activity in asia and the war in ukraine are putting pressure on global supply chains following a brief period of easing earlier this year supply chain and commodity market disruptions are stoking inflation amid growing evidence that inflationary pressures are intensifying and broadening increasing inflationary pressures are also evident from the rising export prices of the euro area s competitors commodity prices remain volatile and subject to supply risks whereas financial conditions have tightened global financial conditions tightened reflecting monetary policy normalisation falling prices of risky assets and rising yields against this background the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections indicate that global real gdp excluding the euro area will grow at 3 0 in 2022 3 4 in 2023 and 3 6 in 2024 a weaker growth trajectory than foreseen in the march projections the two key headwinds are projected to weigh significantly on trade in the near term but their impact is expected to dissipate thereafter the projected growth in euro area foreign demand is more subdued and has undergone more significant downward revisions than growth in world imports as european countries outside the euro area with tighter economic links to russia and ukraine are more affected by the economic shocks triggered by the invasion in an environment of elevated uncertainty the balance of risks around the baseline projections is firmly tilted to the downside for growth and to the upside for inflation the russia ukraine war is severely affecting the euro area economy and the outlook is still surrounded by high uncertainty but the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow and to recover further over the medium term in the near term the governing council expects activity to be dampened by high energy costs the deterioration in the terms of trade greater uncertainty and the adverse impact of high inflation on disposable income the war in ukraine and renewed pandemic restrictions in china have made supply bottlenecks worse again as a result firms face higher costs and disruptions in their supply chains and the outlook for their future output has deteriorated despite a better than expected outcome in 2021 the outlook for the euro area budget balance has deteriorated significantly since the finalisation of the march 2022 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the more adverse outlook is related to a worsening of the economic cycle increased expected interest payments and additional discretionary government spending fiscal support measures have been aimed in particular at countering the rising cost of living for consumers but also at financing defence capacities and supporting refugees from the war in ukraine nonetheless according to the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the euro area government budget deficit is expected to continue falling from 5 1 of gdp in 2021 to 3 8 in 2022 and further to 2 4 by the end of the forecast horizon after the strong loosening during the coronavirus crisis in 2020 the fiscal stance tightened last year and is projected to continue to tighten gradually in 2022 and 2023 the projected slight tightening in 2022 is mainly due to the reversal of a significant part of the pandemic emergency support which will be only partially compensated by additional stimulus measures in response to the energy price shock and other spending related to the russia ukraine war the fiscal tightening is projected to be somewhat stronger in 2023 when many of the recent support measures compensating for the impact of high energy prices are projected to expire in 2024 a more neutral stance is expected although compared to the pre pandemic period significant fiscal support to the economy is projected to remain in place in a context of heightened uncertainty and downside risks to the economic outlook in the light of the war in ukraine as well as energy price increases and continued supply chain disturbances the european commission recommended on 23 may 2022 the extension of the general escape clause of the stability and growth pact sgp to the end of 2023 this would allow fiscal policies to adjust to changing circumstances if necessary at the same time with fiscal imbalances still exceeding their pre pandemic levels and inflation exceptionally high fiscal policy needs to be increasingly selective and targeted in order not to add to medium term inflationary pressures while ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term fiscal policy is helping to cushion the impact of the war targeted and temporary budgetary measures protect those people bearing the brunt of higher energy prices while limiting the risk of adding to inflationary pressures the swift implementation of the investment and structural reform plans under the next generation eu programme the fit for 55 package and the repowereu plan would also help the euro area economy to grow faster in a sustainable manner and become more resilient to global shocks there are also factors supporting economic activity and these are expected to strengthen over the months to come the reopening of those sectors most affected by the pandemic and a strong labour market with more people in jobs will continue to support incomes and consumption in addition savings accumulated during the pandemic are a buffer the baseline projections of the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections are built on the assumptions that the current sanctions against russia will remain in place over the full projection horizon including the eu s oil embargo the intense phase of the war will continue until the end of this year with no further escalation disruptions to energy supplies will not lead to rationing in euro area countries and supply bottlenecks will gradually be resolved by the end of 2023 all this implies much weaker though still positive near term growth prospects with headwinds fading after 2022 and growth in the medium term standing somewhat above historical average rates reflecting a gradual recovery from the economic fallout from the pandemic and the fading of the negative impact of the war amid overall robust labour markets according to the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections euro area real gdp is expected to grow by 2 8 on average in 2022 of which 2 0 percentage points relates to carry over from 2021 and by 2 1 in both 2023 and 2024 compared with the march 2022 ecb staff projections the outlook for growth has been revised down by 0 9 percentage points for 2022 and by 0 7 percentage points for 2023 mainly owing to the economic impact of the war in ukraine while growth in 2024 has been revised up by 0 5 percentage points reflecting a rebound in activity as headwinds fade inflation inflation rose further to 8 1 in may although governments have intervened and have helped slow energy inflation energy prices stand 39 2 above their levels one year ago market based indicators suggest that global energy prices will stay high in the near term but will then moderate to some extent food prices rose 7 5 in may in part reflecting the importance of ukraine and russia among the main global producers of agricultural goods prices have also gone up more strongly because of renewed supply bottlenecks and because of recovering domestic demand especially in the services sector as the euro area economy reopens price rises are becoming more widespread across sectors accordingly measures of underlying inflation have been rising further the labour market continues to improve with unemployment remaining at its historical low of 6 8 in april job vacancies across many sectors show that there is robust demand for labour wage growth including in forward looking indicators has started to pick up over time the strengthening of the economy and some catch up effects should support faster growth in wages while most measures of longer term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and from expert surveys stand at around 2 initial signs of above target revisions in those measures warrant close monitoring following the surge in inflation in early 2022 the outlook is for higher and more persistent inflation headline hicp inflation is expected to remain very high for most of 2022 averaging 6 8 before abating gradually from 2023 and converging to the ecb s inflation target in the second half of 2024 price pressures will remain exceptionally high in the near term owing to elevated oil and gas prices and increases in food commodity prices which have been strongly affected by the war in ukraine as well as the effects of the reopening of the economy and global supply shortages the expected decline in inflation to 3 5 in 2023 and 2 1 in 2024 mainly reflects an assumed moderation in energy and food commodity prices in the absence of additional shocks as embedded in futures prices in addition the ongoing normalisation of monetary policy to the extent that it is reflected in higher interest rate assumptions in line with market expectations will contribute to the moderation in inflation with the usual transmission lags hicp inflation excluding energy and food will remain very elevated until the end of 2022 but thereafter it is expected to decline as the upward pressures from the reopening of the economy subside and as supply bottlenecks and energy input cost pressures ease the ongoing economic recovery tightening labour markets and some effects from compensation for higher inflation on wages which are expected to grow at rates well above historical averages imply elevated underlying inflation until the end of the projection horizon although the baseline assumes that longer term inflation expectations will remain well anchored compared with the march 2022 ecb staff projections inflation has been revised up substantially this reflects recent data surprises higher energy and food commodity prices more persistent upward pressures from supply disruptions stronger wage growth and the depreciation of the euro exchange rate these effects more than offset the downward impact of the increase in the interest rate assumptions and the weaker growth outlook risk assessment the governing council judges that the risks relating to the pandemic have declined but the war in ukraine continues to be a significant downside risk to growth in particular a major risk would be a further disruption in the energy supply to the euro area as reflected in the downside scenario included in the staff projections furthermore if the war were to escalate economic sentiment could worsen supply side constraints could increase and energy and food costs could remain persistently higher than expected the risks surrounding inflation are primarily on the upside the risks to the medium term inflation outlook include a durable worsening of the production capacity of the euro area economy persistently high energy and food prices inflation expectations rising above the ecb s target and higher than anticipated wage rises however if demand were to weaken over the medium term it would lower pressures on prices financial and monetary conditions market interest rates have increased in response to the changing outlook for inflation and monetary policy with benchmark interest rates rising bank funding costs have increased and this has fed into higher bank lending rates in particular for households nevertheless lending to firms picked up in march this was because of the continued need to finance investment and working capital against the backdrop of increasing production costs persisting supply bottlenecks and lower reliance on market funding lending to households also increased reflecting continued robust demand for mortgages in line with its monetary policy strategy the governing council has undertaken its biannual in depth assessment of the interrelation between monetary policy and financial stability the environment for financial stability has worsened since the last review in december 2021 especially over the short term in particular lower growth and increasing cost pressures as well as rising risk free rates and sovereign bond yields could lead to a further deterioration in the financing conditions faced by borrowers at the same time tighter financing conditions could reduce some existing financial stability vulnerabilities over the medium term banks which started the year with solid capital positions and improving asset quality are now facing greater credit risk the governing council will watch these factors closely in any case macroprudential policy remains the first line of defence in preserving financial stability and addressing medium term vulnerabilities monetary policy decisions based on its updated assessment the governing council decided to end net asset purchases under the app as of 1 july 2022 the governing council intends to continue reinvesting in full the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the app for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ecb interest rates and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance as regards the pandemic emergency purchase programme pepp the governing council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024 in any case the future roll off of the pepp portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic pepp reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time asset classes and jurisdictions at any time this could include purchasing bonds issued by the hellenic republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic net purchases under the pepp could also be resumed if necessary to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic the governing council undertook a careful review of the conditions which according to its forward guidance should be satisfied before it starts raising the key ecb interest rates as a result of this assessment the governing council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied accordingly and in line with its policy sequencing the governing council intends to raise the key ecb interest rates by 25 basis points at its july monetary policy meeting in the meantime the governing council decided to leave the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0 00 0 25 and 0 50 respectively looking further ahead the governing council expects to raise the key ecb interest rates again in september the calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium term inflation outlook if the medium term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates a larger increment will be appropriate at the september meeting beyond september based on its current assessment the governing council anticipates that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate in line with the governing council s commitment to its 2 medium term target the pace at which the governing council adjusts its monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how it assesses inflation will develop in the medium term the governing council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer term refinancing operations tltro iii does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy the governing council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance as announced previously the special conditions applicable under tltro iii will end on 23 june 2022 the governing council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments incorporating flexibility if warranted to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2 target over the medium term the pandemic has shown that under stressed conditions flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the governing council s efforts to achieve its goal more effective within the ecb s mandate under stressed conditions flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability following an ad hoc meeting on 15 june the governing council further communicated that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the pepp portfolio with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism a precondition for the ecb to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate in addition the governing council decided to mandate the relevant eurosystem committees together with the ecb services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti fragmentation instrument for consideration by the governing council 1 external environment the economic fallout from the russian invasion of ukraine and the new lockdowns in china represent headwinds to global growth in the near term against this background the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections expect that global real gdp excluding the euro area will grow at 3 0 in 2022 3 4 in 2023 and 3 6 in 2024 a weaker growth trajectory compared with the march projections the implications of the russian invasion and the pandemic measures in china are projected to weigh significantly on trade in the near term but their impact is expected to dissipate thereafter the projected growth of euro area foreign demand is more subdued and has undergone more significant downward revisions compared with world imports reflecting a worse outlook for russia and for european countries outside the euro area with tighter economic links to russia and ukraine in an environment of elevated uncertainty the balance of risks around the baseline projections is firmly tilted to the downside for growth and to the upside for inflation the economic fallout from the war and the new lockdowns in china represent headwinds to global growth in the near term through commodity prices supply chains and uncertainty the consequences of the war in ukraine are reaching well beyond the countries and regions closely associated with russia and ukraine via trade and financial linkages while the war is weighing on growth it is also adding to already heightened inflationary pressures particularly in emerging market economies emes where spending on energy and food constitutes a particularly large share of private consumption in addition the resurgence of the coronavirus covid 19 pandemic in asia and the associated tightening of containment measures particularly in economically important chinese provinces are adding pressure to global supply chains following a brief period of easing earlier this year the implications of the russian invasion and the pandemic measures in china are operating in an environment of high inflationary pressures which has prompted central banks across the globe to adjust their monetary policies thereby contributing to tighter financial conditions survey indicators signal that global activity is moderating the purchasing managers index pmi surveys for may suggest that economic activity remained resilient across advanced economies in spite of the ongoing invasion and that the services sector continued to outpace the manufacturing sector in contrast more

estimated global real gdp growth excluding the euro area slowed significantly to 0 5 in the first quarter of 2022 in line with the march 2022 ecb staff macroeconomic projections chart 1 pmi composite output by region diffusion indices sources markit and ecb staff calculations note the latest observations are for may 2022 disrupted economic activity in asia and the war in ukraine are putting pressure on global supply chains following a brief period of easing earlier this year the pmi suppliers delivery times had been improving throughout march especially in the united states and united kingdom though the indicator was still pointing to long delivery times remaining below the neutral threshold of 50 this positive trend was interrupted in april when suppliers reported lengthening delivery times in the case of the united states however a model based analysis suggests that this development was a result of stronger demand rather than supply factors at the same time a marked lengthening of suppliers delivery times in china largely on account of lockdown related supply factors has brought the global composite measure back to the levels recorded in late 2021 when supply bottlenecks were most acute more recently suppliers delivery times have shortened again as the improving situation in china meant strict measures were eased in may delivery times in the united states and the united kingdom have improved but are still far from normalisation chart 2 chart 2 pmi suppliers delivery times diffusion indices inverted scale sources markit and ecb staff calculations note the latest observations are for may 2022 supply chain and commodity market disruptions are contributing to inflation amid growing evidence that price pressures are intensifying and broadening annual headline cpi inflation across oecd countries excluding turkey rose to 7 2 in april reaching its highest rate in over three decades annual inflation excluding energy and food increased to 4 7 in addition the momentum in both headline and core inflation in the oecd area has picked up again and moved close to levels recorded in mid 2021 when demand recovered as economies reopened chart 3 survey data for input and output prices in the manufacturing sector confirm the elevated inflationary pressures for producers and consumers and prices in the services sector are rising gradually the general increase in global commodity prices observed this year is expected to add to already heightened inflation pressures in the near term especially across emes where energy and food account for a larger share of consumer expenditure than in advanced economies under the latest conditioning assumptions global consumer price inflation is expected to peak around the middle of this year and decline gradually over the rest of the projection horizon increasing inflationary pressures are also evident from the rising export prices of the euro area s competitors compared with the march 2022 ecb staff macroeconomic projections euro area competitors export prices were revised significantly upwards for this year and the next as higher oil and non oil commodity prices interact with rising domestic and global pipeline pressures chart 3 oecd consumer price inflation year on year percentage changes and three month on three month annualised percentage changes sources oecd and ecb calculations notes oecd aggregates are calculated excluding turkey in turkey annual headline and core inflation stood at 70 and 54 6 respectively annual headline and core inflation for oecd countries including turkey not reported in the charts was 9 2 and 6 3 respectively core inflation excludes energy and food the latest observations are for april 2022 commodity prices remain volatile and subject to supply risks while volatility in commodity markets has declined somewhat compared with the weeks directly following russia s invasion of ukraine substantial supply side risks persist affecting energy commodities in particular global oil prices have increased since the april 2022 governing council meeting on the back of the eu oil embargo and supply risks materialising this follows a short period of declining prices as the global oil market was calmed by the release of strategic oil reserves by the united states and other countries as well as by falling demand due to lockdowns in china european gas prices however declined as markets took comfort from rising inventories which outweighed intensifying supply side concerns and the usual summer seasonality in europe meanwhile russia halted gas deliveries to bulgaria finland and poland and after the cut off date for eurosystem staff projections also to denmark and the netherlands as they refused to comply with russian demands to settle gas payments in roubles overall the risk of broader gas supply disruptions in europe continues to be elevated composite food prices remained broadly stable at elevated levels whereas metal prices declined sharply amid lower demand from china global financial conditions tightened reflecting monetary policy normalisation falling prices of risky assets and rising yields the united states saw financial conditions tighten more than in other advanced economies financial conditions in emes have tightened markedly since the russian invasion of ukraine adding to previous trends that mainly reflect domestic monetary policy tightening capital outflows from emes have increased since the invasion which signals that further risks and uncertainties lie ahead in the united states economic activity contracted in the first quarter of 2022 real gdp declined by 0 4 but while this weak outturn generally surprised observers it showed that domestic demand remained relatively solid while activity was dragged down by negative contributions from net exports and the change in inventories looking ahead a return to positive albeit moderate growth rates is expected over the near to medium term amid high inflation substantial monetary policy tightening and a smaller fiscal impulse annual headline consumer price inflation decreased to 8 3 in april as energy prices moderated while core inflation fell to 6 2 nevertheless core month on month inflation jumped to 0 6 as underlying pressures remain high in particular services prices are continuing to increase at an elevated pace amid the ongoing rise in rents and transportation costs in china real gdp growth held up in the first quarter of 2022 despite the strongest resurgence in coronavirus cases since the beginning of the pandemic however the sweeping mobility restrictions implemented in the context of the zero covid strategy and the related changes in consumer behaviour are expected to impinge on activity in the second quarter of 2022 more accommodative policy is being implemented to mitigate the negative impact of lockdowns on economic growth in japan economic recovery halted at the start of 2022 amid the spread of the omicron variant and persistent supply constraints a firmer recovery is expected supported by pent up demand and policy support as well as a pick up in global demand and gradually declining pressures on supply chains economic growth is expected to moderate in the longer term and gradually return to the trend rate annual cpi inflation is projected to rise in the near term supported by higher food and energy prices as well as the declining effects from special factors such as cuts to mobile phone charges in the united kingdom economic activity has rebounded from the omicron wave more strongly than previously anticipated however the outlook is expected to remain rather subdued as the war in ukraine exacerbates already elevated price pressures and supply bottlenecks consumer confidence has fallen sharply in response to the squeeze on real household disposable income the tightening in the labour market has persisted with the unemployment rate continuing to decline despite the ending of the furlough scheme in september 2021 supply side bottlenecks and rising commodity prices are projected to push up consumer price inflation to substantially higher levels than in the march 2022 ecb staff projections until at least the second quarter of 2022 the russian economy is expected to fall into a deep recession this year this outlook reflects the more severe economic sanctions imposed since the march projections including an embargo on energy commodity imports from russia by the united kingdom and the united states as well as a commitment by all g7 countries to phase out or ban russian oil as soon as possible following its embargo on coal imports from russia the eu has also agreed to ban oil imports although this embargo had not yet been agreed by the time of the cut off date for the june 2022 eurosystem staff projections the baseline assumes that either the initially proposed embargo or a modified version excluding certain countries will be gradually implemented over the projection horizon the impact of the sanctions on activity in russia is further amplified by broader private sector boycotts disrupting production and logistics whereas rising inflation and tight financing conditions are weighing on domestic demand the expected pattern of a deep recession followed by a subdued recovery reflects an assumption that the economic sanctions imposed to date will remain in place for the rest of the projection horizon 2 economic activity the second paragraph and the last paragraph of section 2 were corrected the euro area economy grew by 0 6 in the first quarter of 2022 thus standing 0 8 above its pre pandemic level this stronger than expected outcome was driven by a double digit quarterly gdp increase in ireland on average the rest of the euro area economy grew by 0 3 modest positive growth is expected in the second quarter as the favourable impact from lifting pandemic related restrictions on euro area activity is counteracted by adverse factors caused or amplified by the war in ukraine as well as by new pandemic related measures in china despite the recovery in consumption of contact intensive services higher energy and food prices have dampened consumer sentiment and household spending persisting or even intensified supply chain disruptions including in the aftermath of the lockdowns in china and the war in ukraine are constraining manufacturing activity and trade elevated uncertainty rising costs and tightening financing conditions are also expected to weigh on both business and housing investment in the coming quarters nevertheless looking beyond these weaker near term growth prospects the conditions are in place for the economic activity in the euro area to regain momentum in the second half of the year this assessment is broadly reflected in the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area which foresee annual real gdp growth at 2 8 in 2022 and 2 1 in both 2023 and 2024 compared with the march 2022 ecb staff macroeconomic projections this outlook was revised downwards significantly for 2022 and 2023 but revised upwards for 2024 risks to the economic outlook are assessed to be tilted to the downside notably as a result of the possibility of a severe disruption to european energy supplies leading to further increases in energy prices and production cuts euro area domestic demand contracted in the first quarter of 2022 while gdp increased by 0 6 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of the year the contribution from domestic demand stood at 0 4 percentage points signalling an overall weakness in domestic sources of growth by contrast net trade and changes in inventories made a positive contribution to growth gdp growth was 0 3 percentage points higher than eurostat s flash estimate reflecting the inclusion of volatile data from ireland which showed double digit growth in the first quarter owing to developments in its multinational sector thereby boosting its net trade contribution to growth the level of gdp in the euro area stands 0 8 above its pre pandemic level observed in the final quarter of 2019 chart 4 on the production side total value added displayed a broadly based increase across the main sectors of the economy chart 4 euro area real gdp and its components percentage changes since the fourth quarter of 2019 percentage point contributions sources eurostat and ecb calculations note the latest observations are for the first quarter of 2022 economic activity is expected to be somewhat weaker in the second quarter of 2022 negatively affected by the consequences of the war in ukraine but still supported by the recovery in contact intensive services incoming survey data point to continued positive albeit slow growth in the second quarter of 2022 the composite output pmi indicator decreased in may but remains in expansionary territory and well above its long term average however there are signs of weakening activity in the manufacturing sector particularly affected by intensified supply chain disruptions and higher commodity prices due to russia s invasion of ukraine as well as the rise in overall uncertainty box 2 in may 2022 new orders in manufacturing decreased for the first time since june 2020 and 12 month ahead business expectations were among the weakest seen over the past two years this contrasts with the further solid growth of new business inflows into the services sector reflecting stronger activity in contact intensive services once the pandemic related restrictions were lifted chart 5a the different developments in confidence indicators across sectors corroborate this contrasted picture chart 5b the improvement in business confidence in may was mostly driven by the services sector while sentiment deteriorated further in the industrial and retail sectors consumer confidence edged up in may but remains well below its long term average pointing to risks to future demand against the background of higher energy and food costs box 1 box 6 overall while this combination of factors is likely to dampen growth in the near term the prospects for a strengthening of the recovery still remain given the reopening of the economy a strong labour market fiscal support measures and the continued high level of savings therefore this outlook clearly does not point to a stagflation scenario understood as a protracted period of low or even negative growth with persistently high or even accelerating inflation as witnessed in the main advanced economies in the 1970s box 5 chart 5 survey indicators across

in april 2022 broadly unchanged since march and around 0 6 percentage points lower than the pre pandemic level observed in february 2020 chart 6 this is also the lowest level recorded since the

pmi and april 2022 for the unemployment rate short term labour market indicators continue to develop favourably indicating an overall resilient labour market in the euro area so far the monthly composite pmi employment indicator reached 55 9 in may 1 2 points higher than in april thus remaining above the threshold level of 50 that indicates an expansion in employment the pmi employment indicator has recovered strongly following its all time low in april 2020 and has now been in expansionary territory since february 2021 looking at developments across different sectors the pmi employment indicator points to robust employment growth in all three key sectors i e services manufacturing and construction after contracting for two consecutive quarters private consumption should be supported by spending on services as pandemic restrictions are eased notwithstanding significant headwinds following a weak start to the year due to the pandemic households consumption of goods signals unfolding effects from the war in ukraine and persistent bottlenecks in goods production and distribution this is suggested by recent developments in retail sales which stood at 1 3 month on month in april after 0 5 quarter on quarter in the first quarter of 2022 and new car registrations which in april remained some 7 below their first quarter average despite a small month on month increase from the lows seen in march 2022 consumer confidence remained well below its long term average in may reflecting households ongoing concerns about the impact of the war in ukraine households and retail companies also became less optimistic about future spending on major goods purchases as flagged by the european commission s latest consumer survey in may their downbeat expectations about the future financial and economic situation despite a small improvement in may indicate that higher inflation and increased uncertainty are likely to weigh on their spending decisions box 2 nevertheless consumer spending on services is expected to strongly rebound amid easing pandemic restrictions this assessment is confirmed by the european commission s latest consumer survey suggesting that in anticipation of a restriction free summer expected demand for accommodation food and travel services has strengthened despite the ongoing war and falling real disposable income savings accumulated during the pandemic might only cushion the impact of the energy price shock to a limited extent as it is concentrated among higher income households with lower overall exposure to high energy costs on the other hand lower income households which spend a larger share of their income on energy should be able to benefit from fiscal income support measures business investment contracted in the first quarter of 2022 driven by developments in ireland non construction investment declined by 2 9 quarter on quarter in the first quarter reflecting a strong contraction in intellectual property investment in ireland which offset the strong surge seen in the final quarter of 2021 excluding ireland euro area investment grew by 0 8 quarter on quarter against a backdrop of record level equipment shortages reported by respondents to ecofin s quarterly business surveys all four of the largest euro area countries recorded ongoing growth in non construction investment particularly spain and to a lesser extent italy potentially reflecting reopening effects and early disbursements of next generation eu ngeu funds looking ahead business investment is expected to be adversely affected by elevated uncertainty related to the war in ukraine high energy prices ongoing supply bottlenecks and tightening financial conditions incoming survey data at the start of the second quarter suggest lower business confidence reflecting downgraded output and order book assessments among capital goods producers while lower expected turnover in manufacturing points to a quarter on quarter contraction of business investment in the second quarter of 2022 at the same time an improving outlook for services activity reflecting the lifting of pandemic related restrictions and broader support from ngeu funds are expected to support a return to growth later in the year housing investment increased significantly in the first quarter of 2022 but is likely to weaken in the near term housing construction investment increased by 4 5 in the first quarter of 2022 compared with the previous quarter as for the second quarter the european commission s indicator of recent trends in construction activity declined significantly in april and may on average compared with the first quarter the pmi for residential construction also declined significantly moving into negative growth territory in may on the demand side according to the european commission s latest survey data households near term intentions to renovate and to buy or build a house fell significantly in the second quarter on the supply side firms order books weakened and insufficient demand as a limit to production increased in april and may albeit remaining well below its long term average moreover firms production continued to be constrained by significant bottlenecks in the supply of labour and materials e g steel lumber which worsened after the outbreak of the war in ukraine and led to a sharp rise in construction prices this rise in construction costs combined with less favourable financing conditions is likely to weigh on housing demand and together with ongoing supply side constraints dampen growth in housing investment euro area trade lost momentum as extra euro area exports weakened and the outlook points to subdued trade particularly in manufacturing in february and march 2022 nominal extra euro area goods exports weakened while extra euro area goods imports continued to increase the goods trade balance shifted further into deficit owing to the higher cost of energy imports and subdued export performance exports to china decreased due to the pandemic related restrictions while exports to russia halved due to sanctions and the unsanctioned behaviour of market participants short term shipping and survey indicators suggest that supply bottlenecks may have re intensified as illustrated for example by an increase in the amount of goods blocked in key ports in may 2022 due to pandemic related lockdowns in china and the war in ukraine the weakening in external demand related to these events is reflected in forward looking pmi manufacturing export orders that declined somewhat further into contractionary territory in may by contrast the pmi for export orders in the services sector has moved into expansionary territory due to the relaxation of pandemic related restrictions in europe in particular survey indicators and travel bookings point to a strong recovery in trade in tourism this summer despite the weak near term prospects euro area economic activity is expected to regain momentum later this year and expand at a relatively solid pace this outlook is however surrounded by considerable uncertainty the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections foresee

observation for euro area real gdp which relates to the first quarter of 2022 the risks to the economic outlook continue to be tilted to the downside one key risk is the possibility of a severe disruption to european energy supplies from russia following the implementation of the eu sanctions leading to further increases in energy prices and production cuts 3 prices and costs according to eurostat s flash estimate inflation rose further to 8 1 in may mainly because of surging energy and food prices including due to the impact of the war prices have also gone up more strongly because of renewed supply bottlenecks and recovering domestic demand as the economy reopens especially in the services sector overall inflationary pressure has broadened and intensified and wage growth has started to pick up while most measures of longer term inflation expectations derived from financial markets and expert surveys stand at around 2 initial signs of above target revisions in those measures warrant close monitoring eurosystem staff have revised up their baseline for inflation in the june 2022 projections significantly compared to the march ecb staff projections the new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 6 8 in 2022 3 5 in 2023 and 2 1 in 2024 according to eurostat s flash estimate for may hicp inflation rose to a record high unprecedented in the history of the euro the increase from 7 4 in april to 8 1 in may reflects higher inflation rates for all main components but most notably for energy and food consumer energy prices which remain the primary contributor to headline inflation edged up again after a slight moderation in april high wholesale prices for gas oil and electricity as well as elevated refining and distribution margins for transport fuel particularly diesel oil offset a downward effect of the compensatory measures adopted by euro area countries food inflation also rose substantially pushed up by global food commodity prices and domestic producer prices this reflected cost factors such as those related to energy and fertilisers chart 8 chart 8 energy and food input cost pressure annual percentage changes source eurostat note the latest observations are for may for euro area farm gate prices and for april for the other data hicp excluding energy and food hicpx increased to 3 8 reflecting a further build up in both non energy industrial goods neig and services inflation chart 9 here too higher input costs as a result of the surge in energy prices remain a prominent driver neig inflation is also still affected by global supply disruptions which have intensified as a result of the war in ukraine and the aftermath of pandemic related developments in china services inflation reflects some of the

which time hicpxx inflation which excludes travel related items clothing and footwear as well as energy and food increased to 3 2 the upward movement of exclusion based indicators is illustrated by the distribution of the sub components that make up the hicp basket in april almost 80 of these sub components recorded annual growth rates of above 2 meanwhile the model based persistent and common component of inflation pcci stood at 5 5 in april and the supercore indicator which comprises cyclically sensitive hicp items edged up to 3 5 from 3 0 in march at the same time it remains uncertain how persistent these increases will be a large part of the upward push in underlying inflation dynamics can be attributed to indirect effects from the surge in energy and food prices and from exceptional developments in the balance between supply and demand related to the pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine looking ahead developments in wages will be a key factor for the future dynamics of underlying inflation chart 10 indicators of underlying inflation annual percentage changes sources eurostat and ecb calculations notes the range of indicators of underlying inflation

negotiated wages signal a strengthening in wage dynamics but this remains moderate when taking into account one off payments chart 11 growth in negotiated wages increased to 2 8 in the first quarter of 2022 compared with 1 6 in the previous quarter the upward movement is not fully indicative of the growth in base wages as the underlying wage agreements generally comprise one off payments to compensate workers for the exceptional developments that occurred during the pandemic more recent information on those wage agreements that were concluded since the start of 2022 confirm some strengthening in wage dynamics although wage growth remains contained compared with the current inflation rates wage developments measured by compensation per employee cpe also strengthened further in the first quarter of 2022 increasing to 4 4 compared with 3 8 in the previous quarter however this increase mainly reflected an increase in the average hours worked while the increase in compensation per hour cph remained far more contained at an annual growth rate of 1 1 pandemic related distortions to these indicators are declining as the impacts of government measures related to job retention schemes have continued to decrease chart 11 breakdown of compensation per employee into compensation per hour and hours worked annual percentage changes sources eurostat and ecb calculations note the

further to new all time highs on the back of supply chain disruptions and global commodity prices particularly for energy but also for some metals at the early stages of the pricing chain for hicp neig inflation the annual growth rate of producer prices for domestic sales of intermediate goods jumped to 25 1 in april 2022 up from 22 7 in the previous month import prices for intermediate goods also continued to grow at a strong pace 22 6 in april compared with 22 4 in the previous month input cost pressures also feature more prominently at later stages of the pricing chain with producer price inflation for domestic sales of non food consumer goods increasing from 6 0 in march to 6 7 in april which is exceptionally high when compared with the average annual rate of 0 6 over the 2001 19 period import price inflation for non food consumer goods edged up as well to 7 0 in april after a small decline between february and march overall these developments in import and producer prices for non food consumer goods imply that pressure on neig inflation in the hicp is likely to remain elevated in the near term this is also reflected in the data on selling price expectations in the manufacturing sector chart 12 indicators of pipeline pressures annual percentage changes sources eurostat and ecb calculations note the latest observations are for april 2022 market based measures of euro area inflation compensation increased markedly for the very near term but declined somewhat for longer horizons amid intensifying supply side constraints and a worsening economic outlook chart 13 market based measures of inflation compensation based on hicp excluding tobacco now suggest euro area inflation will peak at almost 9 during the third quarter of 2022 these measures of inflation compensation remain close to 8 until the end of 2022 around 3 percentage points higher than at the time of the march governing council meeting before declining to levels slightly above 2 5 in mid 2024 at the same time longer term measures of inflation compensation have recently declined somewhat once again after increasing strongly in the first half of the review period the five year forward inflation linked swap rate five years ahead temporarily reached 2 49 at the beginning of may before falling back to 2 28 at the end of the review period importantly market based measures of inflation compensation are not a direct measure of market participants actual inflation expectations since they contain inflation risk premia to compensate for inflation uncertainty currently these premia are assessed to be positive implying that actual inflation expectations are estimated to be lower than the simple readings of market based longer term measures of inflation compensation and thus closer to the ecb s symmetric 2 inflation target according to the ecb s survey of professional forecasters spf for the second quarter of 2022 longer term inflation expectations for 2026 rose further to 2 1

regarding the economic outlook and firming expectations of normalisation of monetary policy bank lending rates for firms and households have started to reflect the overall increases in risk free market rates over the review period the cost of market based debt financing for firms increased substantially while the cost of equity declined lending to firms and households remains robust however survey based data show that firms of all sizes perceive that financing conditions have deteriorated money creation has continued to normalise as the pace of deposit accumulation by firms and households has decreased further from the high levels recorded during the pandemic the funding costs of euro area banks have continued to rise amid firming expectations of monetary policy normalisation in may as shown by the nowcast the composite cost of euro area banks debt financing continued the upward trend that started in august 2021 chart 20 panel a this was mainly attributable to rising yields on bank bonds chart 20 panel b and these in turn reflected the increase in risk free rates such upward pressure on overall bank funding costs has so far been contained by two factors first rates on deposits which account for a large share of euro area banks funding have remained stable and close to their historical lows second targeted longer term refinancing operations tltros have provided banks with liquidity at favourable conditions nonetheless this cushioning effect is likely to wane in the coming quarters as deposit rates are expected to increasingly reflect the increase in market rates and tltros are repaid chart 20 composite bank funding rates in selected euro area countries annual percentages sources ecb ihs markit iboxx indices and ecb calculations notes

households have started to reflect the increases seen in risk free market rates but remain at low levels chart 21 the recent sharp increase in euro area government bond yields has started to pass through to lending rates although financing conditions for firms and households remain favourable and dispersion of lending rates is contained as measured by the cross country standard deviation chart 21 in april the composite bank lending rate for loans to households for house purchase increased sharply by 14 basis points to stand at 1 61 while the equivalent rate for loans to non financial corporations nfcs increased marginally to 1 51 the spread between bank lending rates on very small loans and large loans increased considerably reaching pre pandemic levels the increase in mortgage rates was broadly based across the larger euro area countries banks are also tightening their credit standards on loans to firms and households which signals a forthcoming contraction in credit supply that may coincide with higher lending rates in the coming months after a long period during which these remained compressed loan deposit margins on new business defined as the difference between average interest rates on loans and average interest rates on deposits have significantly increased while the margins on outstanding amounts have still continued to decline as loans tend to have longer durations than deposits and therefore take longer to reprice over time the higher interest rate environment and a lower level of non performing loans are expected to support bank profitability

cross country standard deviation is calculated using a fixed sample of 12 euro area countries the latest observations are for april 2022 over the period 10 march to 8 june 2022 the cost of market based debt issuance for firms increased substantially while the cost of equity financing for nfcs recorded a decline the increase in the cost of market based debt is accounted for by a significant increase in the risk free rates while corporate bond spreads declined marginally the decline in the cost of equity can be attributed to a decline in the equity risk premium as the uncertainty priced into equity markets fell notwithstanding the deterioration in long term earnings growth expectations see section 4 the increase in the discount rate pushed the cost of equity upwards but was not sufficient to compensate for the dampening impact of the decline in the equity risk premium assuming that the cost of bank borrowing has remained unchanged at the level recorded in april the overall cost of external financing is estimated to have declined to 5 6 on 8 june 2022 down from 5 9 on 10 march chart 22 since the beginning of 2022 the overall cost of financing has however recorded

april september 2022 the expectation of a deterioration was common to most countries and firm size classes in this survey round a significant net percentage of euro area firms reported that changes in the general economic outlook had had a negative impact on their access to finance in net terms 29 down from 8 with a similar negative impact across smes and large firms although the availability of external funds had still continued to improve albeit at a slower pace overall small improvements in firms access to external funds had broadly compensated for the moderate increases in their financing needs so the external financing gap the difference between the change in demand for external financing and the change in its supply reached 1 up from 4 in the previous round the annual growth of loans to nfcs and to households remained robust in april 2022 the annual growth rate of loans to nfcs accelerated to 5 2 in april after standing at 4 1 in march and 4 6 in february chart 24 panel a the recent increase in lending to firms largely reflects a base effect shorter term loans made a strong contribution given the persistence of supply chain bottlenecks and higher input costs both of which contribute to higher working capital needs of firms conversely longer term loans made a smaller contribution as the prevailing uncertainty is weighing on firms need to finance fixed investment the annual growth rate of loans to households remained unchanged at 4 5 in april chart 24 panel b supported by robust lending for house purchase while consumer loans held up despite falling consumer confidence as indicated by the ecb s consumer expectations survey this could be related to households expectations of tighter access to credit and higher nominal borrowing costs next year aggregate

year following the high flows at the end of 2021 chart 25 in march external financing flows were supported by higher volumes of bank loans to firms amid higher input costs and by working capital spending which was related to persistent supply bottlenecks in addition while net issuance of debt securities recovered towards the end of the quarter the increase in the relative cost of market based debt financing has induced firms to substitute debt securities issuance with bank borrowing the issuance of listed shares was subdued in the first quarter dampened by unusually large share buybacks

the pandemic chart 26 in april the annual growth rate of overnight deposits continued to moderate standing at 8 2 down from 8 7 in march the slowdown was observed for the overnight deposits of both firms and households as higher costs for food and energy have reduced firms cash buffers and limited the capacity of households to accumulate savings at the same time higher uncertainty related to the economic impact of the war in ukraine is still affecting deposit dynamics as highlighted by the outbreak of the pandemic firms and households respond to higher uncertainty with a change in their

continued to be the narrow aggregate m1 reflecting strong growth in overnight deposits on the counterparts side credit to the private sector continued to make the largest contribution to annual m3 growth as the contributions of other components dwindled the contribution of the eurosystem s net purchases of government securities under the asset purchase programme and the pandemic emergency purchase programme has been declining as purchases under these programmes are gradually being phased out at the same time money creation is being dampened by higher net monetary outflows to the rest of the world largely reflecting the negative impact of higher energy prices on the euro area trade balance 6 fiscal developments the euro area budget balance is projected to improve steadily in the period up to 2024 although by significantly less than foreseen in the march 2022 ecb staff macroeconomic projections and despite a better than expected outcome in 2021 the more adverse outlook is related to a worsening of the economic cycle increased expected interest payments and additional discretionary government spending fiscal support measures have been aimed in particular at countering the rising cost of living for consumers but also at financing defence capacities and supporting refugees from russia s war in ukraine nonetheless according to the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the euro area government budget deficit is expected to continue falling from 5 1 of gdp in 2021 to 3 8 in 2022 and further to 2 4 by the end of the forecast horizon after the strong loosening during the coronavirus covid 19 crisis in 2020 the fiscal stance tightened last year and is projected to continue to tighten gradually in 2022 and 2023 the projected slight tightening in 2022 is mainly due to the reversal of a significant part of the covid 19 pandemic emergency support which will be only partially compensated by additional stimulus measures in response to the energy price shock and other spending related to the russia ukraine war the fiscal tightening is projected to be somewhat stronger in 2023 when many of the recent support measures compensating for the impact of high energy prices are projected to expire in 2024 a more neutral stance is expected although significant fiscal support to the economy is projected to remain in place compared to the pre pandemic period in a context of heightened uncertainty and downside risks to the economic outlook in the light of the war in ukraine as well as energy price increases and continued supply chain disturbances the european commission recommended on 23 may 2022 the extension of the general escape clause of the stability and growth pact sgp to the end of 2023 this would allow fiscal policies to adjust to changing circumstances if necessary at the same time with fiscal imbalances still exceeding their pre pandemic levels and inflation exceptionally high fiscal policy needs to be increasingly selective and targeted in order not to add to medium term inflationary pressures while ensuring fiscal sustainability over the medium term according to the june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections the euro area general government budget balance will continue to improve over the forecast horizon the general government deficit to gdp ratio for the euro area declined to 5 1 of gdp in 2021 after having reached an unprecedented 7 1 in 2020 it is projected to fall further to 3 8 of gdp in 2022 and then to 2 6 and 2 4 respectively in 2023 and 2024 chart 27 following economic support measures amounting to around 3 9 of gdp in response to the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 crisis and recovery support in the euro area is estimated to have increased to about 4 2 of gdp in 2021 this reflects the fact that governments prolonged and gradually expanded the scale of pandemic emergency measures and or adopted new measures to support the recovery including measures set out in their national recovery and resilience plans under the next generation eu ngeu package the large negative cyclical component which contributed to the large increase in the government deficit in 2020 was moderately smaller in 2021 from 2022 onwards the continued improvement in the budget balance is projected to be driven primarily by the economic cycle but also by a higher cyclically adjusted primary balance as a large share of the emergency measures have started to expire and new measures are less sizeable over the whole forecast horizon interest payments are now expected to contribute significantly more to the budget balance than previously expected however interest payments as a ratio of gdp will still be broadly in line with what has been observed between 2019 and 2021 this reflects the fact that although interest rates on new issuances of sovereign debt have risen significantly these are close to the average rate of interest paid on the existing stock of debt chart 27 budget balance and its components percentages of gdp sources ecb and june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections note the data refer to the aggregate general government sector of euro area countries the euro area fiscal stance tightened significantly in 2021 but should do so to a lesser extent in 2022 as governments adopt measures in response to the effects of the russia ukraine war the tightening of the fiscal stance adjusted for ngeu grants in 2021 largely reflects non discretionary factors whereas discretionary fiscal measures remained supportive for the economy in 2022 the fiscal stance is projected to tighten slightly mainly owing to a continued withdrawal of a significant part of the pandemic emergency support which will be only partly compensated by additional expansionary measures these measures are aimed at countering the rising cost of living for consumers but also at financing defence capacity and supporting refugees from the war in ukraine the fiscal tightening is projected to continue in 2023 when most of these measures are expected to have expired at the end of the forecast horizon a broadly neutral stance is expected although significant support to the economy will remain in place despite the better than expected outcome in 2021 the euro area budget balance has been revised downwards over the whole forecast horizon compared with the march 2022 ecb staff macroeconomic projections the euro area budget balance to gdp ratio in 2021 was 0 4 percentage points higher than expected mainly on account of better than projected revenues despite this positive base effect the budget balance has been revised down by 0 7 0 5 and 0 4 percentage points per annum in 2022 2023 and 2024 respectively cumulatively over the forecast horizon these downward revisions are mainly due to a deterioration in the cyclical component and significantly higher interest payments but additional discretionary stimulus measures also contribute to a downward revision of the primary balance by 0 3 percentage points in 2022 following a large increase in 2020 the euro area government debt to gdp ratio fell slightly in 2021 and is expected to shrink slowly to just below 90 by 2024 well above its pre crisis level after the debt ratio increased by about 13 percentage points to 97 in 2020 a falling but still high primary deficit in 2021 is estimated to have been more than offset by a significant debt reducing contribution from a favourable interest rate growth differential throughout the period 2022 24 the debt ratio is projected to continue declining slowly but steadily as debt increasing primary deficits are outweighed by still favourable contributions from interest rate growth differentials and to a limited extent in the first two years from deficit debt adjustments chart 28 at the end of the projection horizon in 2024 the debt to gdp ratio is expected to stabilise at just below 90 i e 12 percentage points above its pre crisis level in 2019 chart 28 drivers of change in euro area government debt percentages of gdp unless otherwise indicated sources ecb and june 2022 eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections note the data refer to the aggregate general government sector of euro area countries the baseline fiscal assumptions and projections continue to be surrounded by high uncertainty mainly related to the war in ukraine in terms of fiscal assumptions risks to the current baseline are tilted towards additional fiscal stimulus in the near term such risks are assessed as being concentrated in 2022 and relate to further compensatory energy measures and other spending related to the effects of the war risks to fiscal developments over the remainder of the forecast horizon are assessed as broadly balanced targeted and temporary budgetary measures protect those people bearing the brunt of higher energy prices while limiting the risk of adding to inflationary pressures in a context of heightened uncertainty and downside risks to the economic outlook in the light of the russia ukraine war energy price rises and continued supply chain disturbances on 23 may 2022 the commission recommended the extension of the sgp s general escape clause to the end of 2023 this would allow fiscal policies to adjust to changing circumstances if necessary in the medium term a decisive shift towards a more growth friendly composition of public finances and structural reforms that raise the growth potential of euro area economies would create additional fiscal room for manoeuvre if needed while also helping to reduce budgetary imbalances boxes 1 the impact of the war in ukraine on euro area energy markets prepared by jakob feveile adolfsen friderike kuik eliza magdalena lis and tobias schuler the war in ukraine has generated a sharp increase in energy prices and significant volatility in energy markets amid fears of disruptions to energy supplies and increasingly strict sanctions on the russian energy sector prices have fluctuated in particular as markets have tried to assess the potential implications for global energy supplies given their heavy reliance on russian supplies before the invasion euro area energy markets have been especially affected this box provides an overview of the impact that the war in ukraine has had on euro area energy markets so far it outlines russia s role in the euro area s energy supply and looks at measures that have influenced prices in this context it also discusses the implications for euro area energy commodity and consumer prices 2 the impact of the russian invasion of ukraine on euro area activity via the uncertainty channel prepared by alina bobasu and roberto a de santis russia s invasion of ukraine has significantly increased uncertainty in the euro area while the very high energy prices and renewed supply shortages resulting from the war are key observable factors affecting economic activity a third unobservable factor the associated rise in uncertainty is also playing a major role the economic literature defines an uncertainty shock as an outcome of a random event such as a war that makes the economic outlook less predictable as a result of such an increase in uncertainty economic confidence declines leading to cuts in the expected spending of households and businesses this box aims to study the macroeconomic implications of the heightened uncertainty in the euro area that has been triggered by the invasion of ukraine focusing on gdp domestic demand such as business investment and consumption and developments in major individual sectors such as manufacturing and services and durable and non durable goods 3 the impact of the influx of ukrainian refugees on the euro area labour force prepared by vasco botelho the war in ukraine has triggered the largest displacement of european citizens since the second world war with women and children accounting for the vast majority of refugees according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees unhcr around seven million people have already crossed ukraine s borders chart a as chart a shows an average of around 330 000 refugees are currently leaving ukraine for neighbouring countries each week the unhcr estimates that a total of up to 8 3 million refugees could have fled ukraine by the end of the year and that up to 25 million people could be displaced and require humanitarian aid as a result of the war on the basis of this estimate the total number of ukrainian refugees is expected to keep growing in the coming weeks but this is highly dependent on the duration and severity of the war while the total number of ukrainian refugees is increasing a significant number of people around 2 1 million have temporarily re entered ukraine the unhcr indicates that such cross border movements may be pendular and should not be regarded as permanent returns so they have not been deducted from the gross figure 4 the impact of climate change on activity and prices insights from a survey of leading firms prepared by friderike kuik richard morris and yiqiao sun this box summarises the findings from a recent ecb survey of leading firms on the impact of

the very high energy prices and renewed supply shortages resulting from the war are key observable factors affecting economic activity a third unobservable factor the associated rise in uncertainty is also playing a major role the economic literature defines an uncertainty shock as an outcome of a random event such as a war that makes the economic outlook less predictable as a result of such an increase in uncertainty economic confidence declines leading to cuts in the expected spending of households and businesses this box aims to study the macroeconomic implications of the heightened uncertainty in the euro area that has been triggered by the invasion of ukraine focusing on gdp domestic demand such as business investment and consumption and developments in major individual sectors such as manufacturing and services and durable and non durable goods uncertainty affects the economy via a number of different channels one channel frequently cited in the literature relates to the irreversibility of investment investment is often very difficult to reverse given the associated fixed costs rising uncertainty can therefore lead firms to delay and or forgo investment with a view to making better informed investment decisions once the economic outlook is clearer a second channel is associated with precautionary savings in response to an uncertainty shock which can negatively affect future income households seek to save more and consume less a third channel relates to the interplay between heightened uncertainty and financial frictions such as borrowing constraints which can have powerful effects on economic activity with financial conditions for firms and households typically tending to deteriorate after an uncertainty shock a structural vector autoregression svar model with sign and narrative restrictions is used to identify uncertainty shocks chart a various approaches have been used to identify such shocks in the literature it is typically assumed that sudden changes in variables other than uncertainty do not affect uncertainty contemporaneously however causality can operate in both directions for example uncertainty shocks affect economic activity but adverse shocks to output i e negative demand shocks are also likely to increase uncertainty this box identifies uncertainty shocks using a svar model with sign and narrative restrictions which considers this contemporaneous relationship between variables specifically the model incorporates the harmonised index of consumer prices hicp monthly interpolated gdp the ten year overnight index swap ois rate corporate bond spreads and the composite indicator of systemic stress ciss the latter is used to identify uncertainty shocks through narrative restrictions by assuming that the uncertainty shock explains most of the dynamics of the ciss in september 2001 the terrorist attack on the world trade center in new york and august 2007 the interbank credit crisis chart a the ciss and uncertainty shocks left hand scale ciss index 0 lowest level of financial stress 1 highest level right hand scale standard deviation sources ecb and ecb calculations notes the svar model was estimated for the period from january 1999 to december 2019 identifying cost push demand interest rate financial and uncertainty shocks the variables incorporated in the model are the hicp monthly interpolated gdp the ten year ois rate corporate bond spreads and the ciss sign and narrative restrictions are in line with the approach adopted in antolín díaz j and rubio ramírez j f narrative sign restrictions for svars american economic review vol 108 no 10 2018 pp 2802 2829 the latest observations are for april 2022 the model is estimated for the period from january 1999 to december 2019 i e excluding the coronavirus crisis as macroeconomic time series have seen major structural breaks following the onset of the pandemic the estimated elasticities are then used to quantify uncertainty shocks in the period up to april 2022 the model is able to capture major events which led to a rise in uncertainty such as the invasion of iraq in march 2003 and the collapse of lehman brothers in september 2008 as well as episodes from the euro area sovereign debt crisis the estimated uncertainty shocks line up well with past political geopolitical and economic events that would typically be associated with high levels of uncertainty and likewise the recent intensification of uncertainty coincides with the ongoing war in ukraine the uncertainty shock in march 2022 following the russian invasion of ukraine has an estimated size of around six standard deviations making it the second largest shock on record after the episode in march and april 2020 on account of the pandemic uncertainty shocks negatively affect gdp and domestic demand with a larger impact on business investment than on consumption once uncertainty shocks have been identified using the svar model a local projection framework can be used to estimate the impact that those shocks have on euro area gdp and its demand components the household saving rate and value added in the manufacturing and services sectors the local projection approach is typically used when shocks are assessed as being exogenous to the variables of interest the estimated uncertainty shock in the period from february to april 2022 is expected to reduce euro area gdp relative to the level projected by the model in the absence of any shocks the trend level reaching a trough of about 0 7 in the fourth quarter of 2022 chart b panel a the increase in uncertainty is expected to weigh on the spending decisions of households and firms with the household saving rate rising by about 0 4 percentage points in the third quarter of 2022 the elevated uncertainty is expected to have a stronger impact on business investment than consumption with the two demand components being reduced by 1 1 and 0 5 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2022 relative to their trend levels at a sectoral level the uncertainty shock is expected to affect manufacturing more than services and to have a stronger impact on sectors producing goods with longer lifespans chart b panel b the larger impact on manufacturing could stem from the fact that manufacturing output has historically been more prone to cyclical swings and is more dependent on energy inputs which also exhibit significant volatility across cycles looking at the composition of consumption durable goods are more affected by uncertainty shocks than non durables consistent with the fact that spending on durables can be postponed in response to adverse shocks as existing stocks of durable goods can still provide utility given their longer lifespans indeed the effect on durable goods is three times the size of the impact on non durables overall the war and the rise in energy prices have made the economic outlook more uncertain especially in energy dependent sectors and in sectors producing goods with longer lifespans
