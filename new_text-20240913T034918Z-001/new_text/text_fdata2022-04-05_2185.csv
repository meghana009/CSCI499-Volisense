one of the main consequences of the us led sanctions designed to strangle the russian economy and lead to regime change has been to hasten the collapse of the us dollar as the dominant world currency and accelerate the crash in the once mighty us capitalist economy last week economists at the wall street bank goldman sachs issued a warning that freezing the russian central bank s foreign currency reserves has prompted other countries to start dumping us dollars and move as fast as possible away from a currency that has been weaponised in the drive by us imperialism to dominate the world alarm bells have been ringing for some years as us imperialism used economic sanctions against a number of countries including afghanistan iran and venezuela to crush any opposition many of these countries along with companies in russia have been adopting financial mechanisms to bypass the us dollar in international transactions for some time now but these moves have been vastly accelerated by the economic and financial sanctioning of one of the world s biggest economies for the first time russia a major economic power has been treated as a vassal state with the us uk and eu governments seizing 300 billion of its foreign exchange reserves held in western banks this has sent shock waves through the international financial and political system and forced economists at goldman sachs to confront the reality that american capitalism far from being the world s powerhouse in fact owes its position entirely to its ability to print trillions of worthless paper money and force the rest of the world to buy them the goldman sachs report highlights the fact that america has only a tiny share in global trade compared to the dominance of the dollar and that the country faces a massive national debt as it relies almost entirely on imported goods the dollar owes its position as the world s reserve currency to the fact that after the second world war it was guaranteed by the united states the world s largest industrial producer and preeminent military power which crucially insisted that all oil produced in the world was traded in dollars today however america is no longer the economic powerhouse it once was its industrial and commodity production is negligible vastly outstripped by china and with countries like india fast catching up the us national debt stands at over an eyewatering 30 trillion more than 124 of the country s gdp the only way it can afford this huge debt and finance all its military and government spending is by forcing other countries to trade in the worthless paper money it churns out money that is returned to the us as nations buy up america s government bonds and keep their dollar reserves in us banks which can be stolen from them anytime the us wants to discipline them with even close allies like saudi arabia seeking deals to sell oil to china in exchange for chinese currency and russia insisting that hostile countries pay for oil and gas in roubles the dollar is going the same way as the british pound once the preeminent world currency the pound collapsed under the weight of the huge debts the uk amassed after the second world war and as its imperial empire disintegrated goldman sachs report noted if a reserve currency issuers debt is allowed to grow relative to gdp eventually foreigners may grow reluctant to hold more of it not just reluctant countries are dumping the dollar as fast as they can across the world spelling the end of dollar supremacy and driving the collapse of us imperialism into bankruptcy and recession when british imperialism and the almighty pound collapsed in the 20th century america was strong enough to step up and take over running world capitalism today there is no capitalist country in the world that can step up as the us goes down dragging the entire capitalist system with it it now falls to the working class the only force powerful enough to step forward and put an end to this historically redundant bankrupt capitalist system through the victory of the world socialist revolution

austin texas ap tesla delivered 310 000 vehicles in the first quarter up roughly 68 per cent from the same period in 2021 the company said on saturday however the company s sales were slightly below expectations which were looking for tesla to produce 312 000 cars according to wedbush securities but the sales increase came even as tesla battled a global shortage of computer chips and other parts the austin texas maker of electric vehicles and solar panels announced its production and delivery results on saturday the old quarterly delivery record of 308 600 vehicles was set just one quarter ago from october through december of 2021 tesla delivered 185 000 vehicles in the first quarter of last year the global computer chip shortage has affected nearly all automakers but tesla seems to have dealt with the shortages better than the rest of the industry wedbush analysts said they believe 20 000 to 25 000 sales that would have happened in the first quarter have now been pushed into the second quarter due to supply and logistics issues we remain steadfastly bullish on the tesla story and believe when factoring in all the manufacturing headwind dynamics this was a modestly bullish print wedbush analysts said in a note last year the company delivered a record 936 000 vehicles an 87 per cent increase over 2020 numbers the company said in february that it expects 50 per cent annual growth in sales meaning it expects about 1 4 million vehicles to be delivered this year but on a conference call with analysts ceo elon musk said the chip shortage would stop the company from rolling out any new models this year earlier this week morgan stanley analyst adam jonas wrote in an investor note that he expected 320 000 to 325 000 deliveries from january through march more than most analysts given extraordinary supply chain pressures and tesla s continued significant price increases we believe a path to full year deliveries of over 1 4 million units would be impressive but in our minds difficult in isolation to move the stock from here jonas wrote tesla shares closed last friday at usd1 084 59

michelle chapman the associated press tesla ceo elon musk acquired a 9 stake in twitter to become its largest shareholder at a time when he is questioning the social media platform s dedication to free speech and the first amendment the ultimate aim of musk s 73 5 million share purchase worth about 3 billion is not known yet in late march musk who has 80 million twitter followers and is active on the site questioned free speech on twitter and whether the platform is undermining democracy it s unclear just when musk bought the stake a u s securities and exchange commission filing made public on monday says the event triggering the filing happened march 14 musk has also raised the possibility with his massive and loyal twitter following that he could create a rival social media network industry analysts and legal experts say musk could begin advocating for changes at twitter immediately if he chooses in a note to investors cfra analyst angelo zino wrote that twitter could be viewed as an acquisition target because the value of its shares have been falling since early last year jack dorsey stepped down as ceo in november musk s stake in twitter is now more than four times the size of dorsey s who co founded the san francisco company and had been the largest individual shareholder musk s actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth and an all out buyout should not be ruled out wrote zino who covers twitter and social media musk could see twitter as an investment with big growth ahead or he could have noninvestment reasons for the purchase such as buying to make sure the platform doesn t restrain his speech said erik gordon a law and business professor at the university of michigan what he could be worried about is if enough of his tweets start to look like disinformation that twitter says we re doing our job against disinformation gordon said no ceo would refuse to take a call from the company s top shareholder so the purchase gives musk access to twitter s top management he said musk has not spoken specifically about how he would change rules at twitter but the social media platform s history of suspensions and bans is well documented former president donald trump was banned from twitter and other top social media platforms following the jan 6 capitol riot last year that critics accused him of inciting the ban has raised difficult questions about free speech in a social media industry dominated by a few tech giants an issue that trump and conservative media have seized upon there was broad praise for musk from those circles monday michael flynn the retired general who served briefly as donald trump s national security adviser and who was suspended from twitter in january 2021 urged musk via telegram to make changes at twitter hey elon how about letting all of those dropped from twitter for being america first and pro trump back on twitter flynn wrote twitter earlier this year banned the personal account of far right u s rep marjorie taylor greene for multiple violations of the platform s covid 19 misinformation policy other people banned in recent years include steve bannon for suggesting the beheading of dr anthony fauci former ku klux klan leader david duke for breaking the social media site s rules forbidding hate speech and right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones and his infowars show for abusive behavior musk recently described himself on twitter as a free speech absolutist in explaining why the starlink satellite internet service part of his aerospace company spacex would not block russian state media outlets which have spread propaganda and misinformation in line with the kremlin s narrative on its war in ukraine but such absolutism would not be welcome by advertisers who are twitter s chief revenue source said brian wieser global president of business intelligence at groupm brands that advertise on twitter strongly prefer some content standards because a toxic platform can drive many other users away certain kinds of speech such as advocating an insurrection or advocating hurting people are not the kinds of things most advertisers want to support said wieser who analyzes the media industry for advertisers twitter s stock surged nearly 30 monday since march 14 the date listed on filing by twitter its shares are up nearly 50 meaning that musk s investment has paid handsomely so far twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment in march musk told his millions of followers on twitter that he was giving serious thought to creating his own social media platform and has clashed repeatedly with financial regulators about his use of twitter musk is locked into a bitter dispute with the sec over his ability to post on twitter his lawyer has contended in court motions that the sec is infringing on the tesla ceo s first amendment rights in october of 2018 musk and tesla agreed to pay 40 million in civil fines and for musk to have his tweets approved by a corporate lawyer after he tweeted about having the money to take tesla private at 420 per share the funding was far from secured and the electric vehicle company remains public but tesla s stock price jumped the settlement came after the sec brought a securities fraud charge it specified governance changes including musk s ouster as board chairman as well as pre approval of his tweets musk s lawyer is now asking a u s district court judge in manhattan to throw out the settlement contending that the sec is harassing him and infringing on his first amendment rights the sec says it has legal authority to subpoena tesla and musk about his tweets and that musk s move to throw out the settlement is not valid the sec also disclosed that it is investigating musk s nov 6 2021 tweets that asked followers whether he should sell 10 of his tesla stake the commission said it issued administrative subpoenas while investigating whether musk and tesla are complying with disclosure

recently gov ned lamont signed emergency legislation suspending connecticut s gas tax until june 30 to grant residents relief from the skyrocketing gas prices that have overtaken the state and the rest of the country due to the ukraine russia conflict as a gas station owner for the past 12 years i interviewed with wfsb last week and expressed my support for the governor s decision to aid residents with a tax holiday with a high gas circulation rate the tax would not really affect my bottom line however this relief comes at a time when gas is not the only expense that is plaguing residents skyrocketing rents are putting enormous pressure on area families norwich which was listed on the connecticut insider s 15 hottest housing markets in connecticut has seen a surge in rental prices now more than ever norwich renters are scrambling to pay increased rents and have less income to spend on necessities like food and medication this state wide rental market rate hike is no surprise as the lack of choice in the rental market has allowed many property owners to raise rates to extremes while pandemic programs like the unite ct rental assistance program were lifelines for thousands of residents the expiration of those funds has left those now struggling to cope with rent hikes without a safety net a quick search for apartments in norwich on most rental sites produces about 20 25 results with a population of about 40 000 it is no surprise that the hot market has lent itself to higher rates with little to no competition in the city s rental market in a recent legislative committee hearing a greenwich legislator relayed that housing is a want and the market would recalibrate to today s supply and demand and that those willing to work hard could acquire the housing they desired as a norwich city council member and someone who is closely connected with his community i can tell you that the market has instead produced giant waiting lists for 1 bedroom apartments and has caused working families to spend more than half their income on rent and for bipoc black indigenous and people of color individuals in norwich and across the state the rent hikes are even more problematic as a report by the connecticut fair housing center and ct data collaborative found that from 2017 2021 black and latino renters had cases filed against them at higher rates than white renters black renters were three times more likely than white renters to have an eviction filed against them and for latino renters it was two times more likely we know who is in danger of eviction during times of financial crisis and we must protect our vulnerable neighbors as i personally venture into the world of affordable housing development i can tell you that the stock of housing in norwich is very old 42 of owner occupied and rental units were built before 1950 and we need new construction however the timeline for creating new homes is measured in years new homes available in 2023 2024 or 2025 will be of no help to those struggling to make ends meet right now what can be done now to mitigate the rate hikes and give norwich renters much needed breathing room for years connecticut has continued investments in housing vouchers through the rental assistance program rap increasing these investments can lessen the impact of rent increases and limit future evictions the homeconnecticut campaign a statewide housing advocacy effort managed by the partnership for strong communities released a legislative agenda this year that asks the state to expand rap with an additional 20 million to flexibly support 2 000 more households governor lamont and the connecticut general assembly can act now to avoid an incoming wave of displacements and evictions with direct rental relief for households in norwich and across the state as a business owner and someone who cares deeply about norwich i know a community cannot thrive when so many of its residents can barely afford to keep a roof over their head swarnjit singh khalsa is a norwich city council member and small business owner

workers at a staten island amazon warehouse voted to unionize last week securing a significant victory for the labor movement against the retail giant that had successfully been able to fend off all prior organization efforts since its founding in 1994 so what made the difference that helped the amazon labor union score their win at the new york city facility known as jfk8 according to burt flickinger managing director of retail consulting firm strategic resource group which assisted in training for the organization efforts there were a number of factors that helped push the alu over the edge but the upstart union followed a playbook that has been used successfully in the past amazon ceo andy jassy s compensation valued at 213 million in 2021 srg has given full day seminars at unions requests on how to organize and bases its training on the strategy that helped former president barack obama get to the white house flickinger told fox business his firm teaches the methods former obama campaign manager david plouffe deployed in the 2008 democratic primary which he says helped obama beat hillary clinton it s really employing that successful strategy where president obama had less than 2 national name recognition but building that block by block through social digital connective media friends and family reaching out to neighbors that missionary or disciple like basis and going from groups of 4 to 24 then ultimately hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands to millions flickinger said that s the same strategy that the staten island union s employing and respectively the teamsters respectively the retail wholesale and department store union along with its sister union the he noted southern poverty law center employees protest return to work policy claiming racial disparity flickinger says that inflation already set the stage for workers to demand more from employers as they feel the pinch in their disposable income and that is giving the labor movement further momentum even with amazon s very meaningful increases in hourly compensation over the last 12 to 30 months the workers had still lost 3 to 5 of their purchasing power flickinger said so 70 are living paycheck to paycheck and have deficient benefits compared to the unionized employers with whom we work and don t have a pension plan and really don t have living wages and regular schedules which will be worked out in collective bargaining flickinger predicts that before long more amazon warehouses will unionize beyond new york and across the nation and so will the retail giant s truck drivers and its whole foods workers get fox business on the go by clicking here with more strikes coming around the corner and consumers really aggressively supporting the workers and the labor unions you ll see a transformation organizing effect on amazon which i encourage even as a very happy amazon shareholder for years he said

ed lentz columnist as a created capital city in 1812 columbus was an isolated frontier village for much of its early history by the time the ohio general assembly met in columbus for the first time in 1816 the village consisted of about 700 residents some of the new people were settlers looking for a new life among them doctors lawyers and sellers of goods and services but the primary businesses in the new town seem to have been inns and taverns an earlier history of the city described the drinking habits of the town the use of distilled liquors was very common and every tavern had its licensed bar the guest was usually invited by his host to one gratuitous dram in the evening and one in the morning whatever additional fluid refreshments he consumed he paid for tanzy bitters were freely imbibed as a supposed preventive of prevailing fevers the habit of treating was common and at the russell tavern it was a rule with the loungers who used to sit on the sidewalk benches in front that the first one to rise should treat the rest as it were canal lock was worthy choice for artist s fascination that history noted that coffeehouses had become popular as well the coffeehouse of the period was a place for gossip refreshment and gaming among the exhilarating drinks dispensed there coffee was one of the least called for or thought of the borough and early city life of the capital developed many of these establishments by far the most popular and important of which was that of john young originally in 1826 it took the humble title of bakehouse and grocery but in a few years it became known far and wide as the eagle coffeehouse people loved a little recreation then as they do now and john young s was the place to find it occasionally things got a little out of hand the establishment had a public bathhouse attached to it probably the only one in town the water for which was pumped by a big black bear chained to a treadmill in the backyard one of the bystanders remarked to a comrade that he would like to see just for the fun of it what would happen if the bear should break loose a few minutes later the bear did break loose and a general scatterment followed the bear was soon secured by his keeper and the loungers resumed their juleps and jollity for a time it was assumed that nothing could top the story of the day the bear broke loose then tippo came to town the early history of the city reported of theatrical entertainments the borough was entirely destitute but we hear of its visitation by certain vagrant exhibitions for village entertainment at quite an early period under date of april 21 1827 the arrival in columbus of tippo sultan the great hunting elephant was thus advertised the performance of tippo sultan together with the dexterity and intrepidity of his keeper produces a spectacle not only curious and diverting but in some instances interesting to the spectator and dangerous to the keeper the mammoth lion tiger cat lynx shetland pony dandy jack etc etc the above named animals will be seen at mr russell s tavern columbus on monday tuesday and wednesday the 27th 28th and 29th inst the exhibition will be accompanied with good music admittance 25 cents children under 12 years of age half price and once again as the early history reported things got a bit out of hand this is one of the first attempts at public entertainment made at the capital of ohio at night the hunting elephant was locked up in the tavern backyard where during one of the nights of his sojourn he broke loose and for awhile amused himself by pumping water at the well finally he broke the pump handle and looking around for some new pastime spied two barrels of flour standing on the back porch breaking into these he for a while ate flour and drank water alternately until he converted the residue of the flour into paste awakened by the noise mr russell descended and was received by the elephant with a fusillade of dough beating a retreat the discomfited host aroused the keeper of the frolicsome beast who after some effort succeeded in getting him tied again no further mention is made of problems so it seems that tippo and his animal associates were well received other traveling menageries musical groups and theatrical companies would visit columbus in the next few years with the first circus an english one called pippins arriving in 1834 or 1835 an early history reported the first building in columbus intended especially for a theatre was erected by a joint stock company in 1835 the establishment took the name of columbus theatre among the most popular plays at the old columbus theatre were st george and the dragon mazeppa and cataract of the ganges and apparently a good time was had by all local historian and author ed lentz writes the as it were column for thisweek community news and the columbus dispatch

donald trump s much touted social media platform that he hoped would be a new conservative alternative to twitter truth social has just reportedly lost two key executives six weeks after its launch back in february when truth social launched but kind of didn t with most users being put on a waitlist after downloading the app we gave the whole enterprise eight months before a likely implosion comes because launching a new social media company no matter who you are or what experts you hire is going to be rife with challenges these days and twitter wasn t built in a day and it s just all kinds of wrongheaded to think that what the world needs is a platform with less content moderation and good luck getting ad revenue from a place where everyone is just freely using racial slurs and making threats against whoever and whatever they please here we are less than two months since the launch and reuters reports that two key executives running truth social have already quit josh adams who was serving as the company s chief of technology has apparently resigned and so has head of product development billy boozer the whole story is a bit fuzzy and reuters said it was unable to confirm whether either adams or boozer were reassigned to other roles in the company and no one would comment the pair worked just below two former apprentice cast mates whom trump hired to run the day to day operations at truth social beneath ceo devin nunes wes moss and andy litinsky this is according to an anonymous source speaking to reuters neither adams nor boozer had disclosed their jobs at truth social on linkedin but reuters noted that both appeared to be frequent posters on the nascent platform writing as josh a and billy b if josh has left all bets are off one source told reuters referring to the fact that adams had been largely responsible for building the platform itself adams and boozer who both hail from alabama are reportedly staunch conservatives themselves and reuters reports that adams was a strong believer in truth social s anti cancel culture mission as the sf business times notes the truth social app still hasn t debuted in the google play store after only appearing in the apple app store in late february and after 1 2 million downloads per sensor tower there are reportedly still many users waiting on the wait list to actually use the app for reasons that aren t really clear trump himself has only posted one truth their version of tweet in the six weeks since the launch he has 848 000 followers on the app which is a far cry from the 88 million followers trump had on twitter before he was banned icon for truth social a social media network promoted in part by former united states president donald trump on a cellphone screen with information about a waitlist following the app s launch on president s day lafayette california february 21 2022 photo courtesy tech trends photo by gado getty images digital world acquisition corp dwac the spac that trump media technology group tmtg hopes to merge with to go public slipped 10 in trading on the nasdaq since this morning and at one point was trading down over 11 the new york times noted in february that tmtg was likely short on cash which could have been complicating the app launch this is because the merger with dwac remains slowed by an sec investigation blank check companies like dwac are not supposed to already have a merger target in mind when they raise money and investigators have suggested that plans to merge with tmtg may have already being discussed last year when money was being raised that investigation still has not concluded meanwhile trump himself has an ongoing federal lawsuit against twitter arguing that he shouldn t have been permanently banned from the platform previously trump s twitter for bigots truth social launches without a working app top image gado getty images

elon musk has acquired 9 2 of the shares at twitter making him the company s largest shareholder this 3 billion purchase comes on the heels of some staunch criticism that the heralded businessman had about the platform last month and the way in which it sensors posts from certain groups and individuals now that the south african native has a stake in the company nearly four times the amount of its former ceo jack dorsey many conservatives are already calling for him to reinstate donald trump s account indeed major changes may be coming to twitter soon which according to cfra analyst angelo zino may also include new ownership musk s actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth and an all out buyout should not be ruled out said the new yorker upon news of musk s recent transaction twitter s stock is soaring according to reports for more on the story hit the link below source hot new hip hop
elon musk tesla s chief executive has spurred speculation that he might seek to play a role in twitter when elon musk mulled taking tesla private in 2018 he posted on twitter to tell the world about it when he got stuck in traffic in 2016 he tweeted the idea of an underground tunnel system to alleviate soul destroying congestion and when he challenged president vladimir v putin of russia to one on one combat last month he broadcast it on twitter now mr musk is putting his money where he mouths off on monday a regulatory filing with the securities and exchange commission revealed that mr musk the billionaire chief executive of tesla and spacex and the world s wealthiest person had bought a 9 2 percent stake in twitter the social media platform where he has over 80 million followers the purchase appears to make mr musk twitter s largest shareholder ahead of the 8 8 percent stake owned by the mutual fund company vanguard and dwarfing the 2 3 percent stake of jack dorsey twitter s former chief executive mr musk s twitter investment which he has been accumulating since at least last month was worth about 2 89 billion based on the closing price of the company s stock on friday but by the end of monday after news of his buy in sent twitter s share price soaring more than 27 percent it was worth about 3 7 billion the shares are a fraction of mr musk s reported 270 billion plus net worth despite his penchant for sharing everything on twitter from business ideas insults and memes to this past weekend his experience at a famed berlin nightclub mr musk was uncharacteristically mum on the purchase of the company s shares at least initially oh hi lol he tweeted on monday without elaborating after news of his investment had spread across twitter mr musk 50 did not respond to a request for comment twitter declined to comment oh hi lol elon musk elonmusk april 4 2022 mr musk has bought into twitter at a delicate time for the company which is based in san francisco mr dorsey stepped down as chief executive in november and plans to leave the company s board when his term ends this year after facing down an activist shareholder and grappling with criticism from lawmakers and regulators about free speech censorship and toxic content mr dorsey handed the reins to parag agrawal twitter s chief technology officer who cuts a lower profile in silicon valley than mr dorsey did mr agrawal has reorganized the executive ranks of the company he is also deeply interested in a decentralized version of twitter one of mr dorsey s last pet projects at the company under that effort twitter would shift online power into the hands of its users and challenge behemoths like meta the owner of facebook and instagram twitter is funding an independent effort to build a so called open protocol for social media weaving cryptocurrency into its app and opening up to developers who want to build custom features for twitter what exactly mr musk plans to do with his twitter stake is unclear he has criticized the company in recent weeks for failing in his view to adhere to free speech principles and he has argued that users should be allowed to choose the algorithms that select the tweets they see or build their own instead of relying on twitter to curate posts the idea was one mr dorsey championed while leading twitter the choice of which algorithm to use or not should be open to everyone he said last month in response to a tweet from mr musk pushing for algorithms that outsiders can build for the platform it is unclear whether mr musk will ask or be invited to join twitter s board he filed a securities document called a 13g filing indicating that he planned for the investment to be passive and that he did not intend to pursue control of the company but wall street has already started speculating that mr musk could change the status of his investment continue buying twitter shares or even try to acquire the company outright image mr dorsey is expected to leave twitter s board in may credit alfonso duran for the new york times we would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the twitter board management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of twitter daniel ives an analyst at wedbush securities said on monday morning steven davidoff solomon a professor at the school of law at the university of california berkeley said the filing lets mr musk sort of hide whatever intent he might have with respect to twitter but he added filing as a passive investor with an actual intent to push for control by switching filing types is fraudulent though rarely prosecuted and difficult to prove mr musk s long and complicated personal relationship with twitter has already gotten him in trouble with his tweets about tesla s finances resulting in legal wranglings with the s e c if mr musk pushes for change at twitter he would not be the first agitated investor the company has had to contend with the activist firm elliott management took a position in twitter and called for mr dorsey s removal in 2020 it later struck a deal with twitter that included a 1 billion investment from the private equity firm silver lake and brought on new board members including silver lake s co chief executive egon durban silver lake teamed up with mr musk in his efforts to take tesla private mr musk s list of other business ventures runs long beyond tesla and spacex he is the founder of the boring company a tunnel construction services company adding a role to the list could irk tesla shareholders in the last two months of last year mr musk sold around 16 billion of tesla stock equivalent to roughly 10 percent of his stake in the electric vehicle company executives who have juggled media projects with other private endeavors have sometimes found themselves in politicians cross hairs former president donald j trump for example took a dim view of amazon because he disagreed with coverage in the washington post which jeff bezos bought in 2013 tesla is a large beneficiary of environmental credits while spacex pursues government contracts for mr musk the investment may also raise the volume of noise that he faces on twitter already on monday twitter users were inundating the billionaire with requests for an edit button on the social media service and asking him to reinstate certain banned accounts adam satariano jack ewing and peter eavis contributed reporting

coming in at a distant second place with 8 51 percent biden s speech was written 20 years ago just before gm killed the electric car maye tweeted his speechwriter uploaded the wrong file musk himself has joined in the mockery tweeting on november 21 let s see if we can get them to say the word tesla maye 73 has frequently accused biden and harris of ignoring her son the south african born billionaire has frequently found himself at odds with the biden administration criticizing their policies on pandemic lockdowns and taking issue with taxation in democrat run areas in october musk moved tesla s headquarters from california to texas musk s mother s chiding of the biden administration came as musk was revealed to have bought a nine percent share in twitter making him the largest shareholder twitter s founder jack dorsey only owns 2 25 percent republican lawmakers praised musk for protecting free speech on monday congressman lance gooden a republican for texas who co founded the freedom from big tech caucus lauded musk but said his purchase was a warning about the social media giant s power the fact that the world s richest man chose to outright buy twitter rather than develop a new platform shows twitter s monopoly power gooden told dailymail com i m glad elon musk is stepping up to protect free speech but congress must act to put the rest of big tech in their place numerous republicans have accused twitter of censorship including shadow banning which supposedly restricts a user s reach without their knowledge or appearing to do so republican study committee chair jim banks said on monday if can clean up twitter and stop online censorship i m all for him taking over the whole damn thing republican study committee chair rep jim banks was among the first elected officials to praise musk s purchase pro trump rep lauren boebert demanded that musk use his money invested in the company to push for a reversal of donald trump s permanent suspension another trump ally former treasury department official monica crowley also sounded off anger at the platform spilled over when it permanently suspended donald trump s account early last year following the january 6 attack on the us capitol some republicans now hope musk will have enough sway to get the ex president back on now that is twitter s largest shareholder it s time to lift the political censorship oh and bring back trump tweeted lauren boebert the outspoken pro trump colorado congresswoman former trump treasury department official monica crowley said he should demand the end of political censorship company wide reform and the reinstatement of president trump rep lance gooden rep jim banks white house press secretary jen psaki was asked during her monday press briefing if the billionaire s history with biden would force the administration to recalibrate its digital strategy which has so far relied heavily on twitter i expect we will continue to use twitter as you all will as well i would expect psaki answered while declining to comment on musk s ownership specifically the world s richest man worth an estimated 273 billion bought nearly 73 5 million shares a document filed with the us securities and exchange commission on monday shows it means the tesla co founder has more than quadruple the shares of twitter s founder jack dorsey who owns 2 25 percent his passive stake in the company is valued at up to 2 9 billion based on the stock s friday close and the estimated cost of the deal was 2 4 billion according to the stock price on march 14 when he bought the shares the news prompted twitter s stock to soar by more than 26 percent in pre market trade before wall street opened on monday meaning his shares are now worth around 3 6 billion earning him 1 2 billion in three weeks the news prompted twitter s stock to soar by more than 26 per cent in pre market trade before wall street opened on monday the world s richest man bought nearly 73 5 million shares a document filed with the us securities and exchange commission shows shares of other social media firms including meta platforms and snapchat owner snap inc were also trading higher musk s stake in twitter is considered a passive investment which means he is a long term investor that s looking to minimize his buying and selling of the shares we would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the twitter board management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of twitter dan ives of wedbush securities wrote in a client note early monday twitter s share price has rocketed since musk s investment on march 14 passive investment is a strategy for slowly building wealth by long term ownership of stocks rather than engaging in frequent trading which is often accompanies by additional fees and can be more volatile ives also told cnbc musk could try to take a more aggressive stance here on twitter this eventually could lead to some sort of buyout this makes sense given what musk has at least been talking about at least from a social media perspective the shares are held by the elon musk revocable trust of which he is the sole trustee on the same day as the filing of the sec document musk challenged vladimir putin to a fight on twitter and posted a meme about supporting current trends the mogul has been raising questions about the ability to communicate freely on twitter tweeting last month about free speech and the social media platform on the same day as the filing of the sec document musk challenged vladimir putin to a fight on twitter the mogul has been raising questions about the ability to communicate freely on twitter and on march 26 he asked what should be done about twitter s free speech principles and if a new platform is needed a day earlier he made a poll asking whether twitter adheres to the principle of free speech warning the results will be important free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he tweeted he accompanied it with a poll on march 25 with 70 per cent of two million users responding that the platform does not adhere to free speech musk said the consequences of this poll will be important please vote carefully in a separate tweet musk said that he was giving serious thought to creating a new social media platform musk was responding to a twitter user s question on whether he would consider building a social media platform consisting of an open source algorithm and one that would prioritize free speech and where propaganda was minimal also last month musk asked a federal judge to nullify a subpoena from securities regulators and throw out a 2018 court agreement in which musk had to have someone pre approve his posts on twitter us securities regulators said they had legal authority to subpoena tesla and musk about his tweets and that musk s move to throw out a 2018 court agreement that his tweets be pre approved is not valid the entrepreneur is a frequent user of twitter although his posts have occasionally landed him in hot water he has over 80 million followers on the site since joining in 2009 and has used the platform to make several announcements including teasing a go private deal for tesla that landed him in regulatory scrutiny it means the tesla co founder has more than quadruple the shares of twitter s founder jack dorsey pictured who owns 2 25 per cent in 2018 the tech ceo was slammed after calling a british diver who helped rescue a group of thai boys stuck in a cave a pedo his twitter posting has also led to accusations of stock manipulation regularly sharing polls and information about his companies online in august 2018 he wrote that he was considering taking tesla private at 420 funding secured a nod to musk s well known interest in marijuana the issue was he didn t actually have funding secured but the stock price soared at the time and it was later revealed that musk apparently wrote the tweet because he thought his girlfriend would find it funny he later tweeted how high the stock had gone later in 2019 when it did in fact hit 420 a share musk s revelation about his stake in twitter shares comes two days after tesla inc posted lackluster first quarter production numbers while the company delivered 310 000 vehicles in the period the figure was slightly below expectations musk has been selling his stake in tesla since november when he said he would offload 10 per cent of his holding in the electric car maker he has already sold 16 4 billion worth of shares since then twitter was the target of activist investor elliott management corp in 2020 when the hedge fund argued its then boss and co founder jack dorsey was paying too little attention to twitter while also running square musk and dorsey have had some common ground in terms of dismissing the so called web3 a vague term for a utopian version of the internet that is decentralized musk is also the founder and ceo of spacex and leads brain chip startup neuralink and infrastructure firm the boring company dorsey resigned as twitter ceo in november after 15 years at the helm advertisement he remains remains the ceo of square inc the hugely successful financial payments company that he co founded in 2010 and is the sixth largest shareholder in twitter

tesla ceo elon musk has acquired a 9 stake in twitter to become its largest shareholder while joining other critics in questioning the social media platform s dedication to free speech and the first amendment musk s ultimate aim in acquiring 73 5 million shares worth about 3 billion isn t clear yet in late march musk who has 80 million twitter followers and is active on the site questioned free speech on twitter and whether the platform is undermining democracy in years past twitter and other social platforms have taken fire for allowing harmful speech ranging from incitement to violence to coordinated harassment and racial abuse more recently these platforms have made concerted efforts to rein in such behavior often drawing criticism similar to musk s from the political right both twitter and facebook faced blowback after suspending the accounts run by former president donald trump following the jan 6 capitol insurrection last year it s unclear just when musk bought the stake a u s securities and exchange commission filing made public on monday says the event triggering the filing happened march 14 musk has also raised the possibility with his massive and loyal twitter following that he could create a rival social media network industry analysts and legal experts say musk could begin advocating for changes at twitter immediately if he chooses in a note to investors cfra analyst angelo zino wrote that twitter could be viewed as an acquisition target because the value of its shares have been falling since early last year twitter co founder jack dorsey stepped down as ceo in november musk s stake in twitter is now more than four times the size of dorsey s who had been the largest individual shareholder musk s actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth and an all out buyout should not be ruled out wrote zino who covers twitter and social media musk could see twitter as an investment with big growth ahead or he could have noninvestment reasons for the purchase such as buying to make sure the platform doesn t restrain his speech said erik gordon a law and business professor at the university of michigan what he could be worried about is if enough of his tweets start to look like disinformation that twitter says we re doing our job against disinformation gordon said no ceo would refuse to take a call from the company s top shareholder so the purchase gives musk access to twitter s top management he said musk has not spoken specifically about any twitter rule changes he might push but the social media platform s history of suspensions and bans is well documented trump s suspension from both twitter and facebook has raised difficult questions about free speech in a social media industry dominated by a few tech giants an issue that

one reason why investors have always been attracted to gold as an asset class is that it retains its value and can survive market fluctuations better than most other asset classes ironically this mentality allows gold and related assets like gold stocks to perform well especially when the broader market is suffering so if you are worried about inflation gold stocks could be a practical way to gain exposure to this shiny commodity and hedge your portfolio without forced asset class diversification one of the largest gold companies in the world barrick gold abx nyse nyse is a safe gold investment not just because of the stock s performance but because of the company s operational capacity and portfolio of assets it has a decent portfolio of mines in 18 countries six of which are tier one gold mines it has an extensive presence in africa as well as operations in south america and saudi arabia the stock offers a modest combination of dividends and cyclical growth it has gone through two major growth phases since 2015 when it grew over 200 and about 190 respectively it also pays dividends though the current yield is quite paltry at 1 66 however the stock is currently experiencing a bullish phase which may result in some capital appreciation that has the potential to balance out the yield an international gold producer another gold mining company with an international focus is b2gold tsx tsx it has three production stage mines in mali namibia and the philippines with at least five development and exploration projects under its belt as a low cost producer it aims to be more profitable with the same amount of gold produced by a peer in relatively costly regions its production capacity is quite substantial for a company its size as a mid cap company it offers slightly more pronounced capital appreciation potential during the same sector wide bullish phases an example would be its two growth phases since 2015 which returned 380 and over 220 respectively roughly following barrick s growth phases its yield is significantly sweeter at 3 59 a gold royalties company franco nevada tsx fnv nyse fnv is easily the gold standard when it comes to growth stocks not just among gold stocks but in the material sector as a whole it s has been one of the most consistently growing in the last 15 years and even though the pandemic market conditions disrupted the growth momentum its long term potential is still solid the company also offers more safety and stability compared to gold miners as a royalty company that s only financially tied to the operations and has minimal physical liability regarding the asset if any it keeps attracting investors during periods of both high and low inflation and in healthy and weak stock markets this makes it stand apart from the rest of the gold stocks in canada foolish takeaway the tsx is showing indications of an upcoming bearish phase it might just be a two or three week dip or it may turn into a full blown correction that would give you another reason to buy and hold gold stocks in addition to using them simply as a hedge against inflation the post 3 stocks to buy to hedge inflation appeared first on the motley fool canada fool contributor adam othman has no position in any of the stocks mentioned the motley fool recommends b2gold this article was first published on the motley fool

tesla ceo elon musk has acquired a 9 percent stake in twitter to become its largest shareholder while joining other critics in questioning the social media platform s dedication to free speech and the first amendment musk s ultimate aim in acquiring 73 5 million shares worth about 3 billion isn t clear yet in late march musk who has 80 million twitter followers and is active on the site questioned free speech on twitter and whether the platform is undermining democracy in years past twitter and other social platforms have taken fire for allowing harmful speech ranging from incitement to violence to coordinated harassment and racial abuse more recently these platforms have made concerted efforts to rein in such behavior often drawing criticism similar to musk s from the political right both twitter and facebook faced blowback after suspending the accounts run by former president trump following the jan 6 capitol insurrection last year it s unclear just when musk bought the stake a u s securities and exchange commission filing made public on monday says the event triggering the filing happened march 14 musk has also raised the possibility with his massive and loyal twitter following that he could create a rival social media network industry analysts and legal experts say musk could begin advocating for changes at twitter immediately if he chooses in a note to investors cfra analyst angelo zino wrote that twitter could be viewed as an acquisition target because the value of its shares have been falling since early last year twitter co founder jack dorsey stepped down as ceo in november musk s stake in twitter is now more than four times the size of dorsey s who had been the largest individual shareholder advertisement musk s actual investment is a very small percentage of his wealth and an all out buyout should not be ruled out wrote zino who covers twitter and social media musk could see twitter as an investment with big growth ahead or he could have noninvestment reasons for the purchase such as buying to make sure the platform doesn t restrain his speech said erik gordon a law and business professor at the university of michigan what he could be worried about is if enough of his tweets start to look like disinformation that twitter says we re doing our job against disinformation gordon said no ceo would refuse to take a call from the company s top shareholder so the purchase gives musk access to twitter s top management he said musk has not spoken specifically about any twitter rule changes he might push but the social media platform s history of suspensions and bans is well documented trump s suspension from both twitter and facebook has raised difficult questions about free speech in a social media industry dominated by a few tech giants an issue that trump and conservative media have seized upon there was broad praise for musk from those circles monday michael flynn the retired general who served briefly as donald trump s national security adviser and who was suspended from twitter in january 2021 sent musk some free advice via telegram advertisement hey elon how about letting all of those dropped from twitter

the social media site s rules forbidding hate speech and right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones and his infowars show for abusive behavior musk recently described himself on twitter as a free

the world needs to rapidly accelerate its transition away from coal and other fossil fuels to avoid extreme climate change according to a report monday by the u n climate science panel the report justifies the growing concern among scientists activists and governments that promises to slash greenhouse gas emissions so far are inadequate to keep global temperatures from rising more than 1 5 or 2 degrees celsius the level at which researchers say climate change risks spinning out of control in order to meet these targets you need credible commitments on public policy private investment innovation all happening quickly and then being sustained over several decades said john bistline a climate expert for the non profit electric power research institute and a contributing author to the ipcc report to keep warming in check global consumption of coal for example must drop by at least 67 by 2030 and 95 by 2050 while oil and gas use must also decline sharply according to the report that would mean retiring and replacing fossil fuel power plants and other facilities potentially decades earlier than planned and canceling new construction without early retirements or reductions in utilization the current fossil infrastructure will emit more ghgs than is compatible with limiting warming to 1 5 degrees c the report said the pace of the decline in fossil fuel consumption could be somewhat slower if facilities install carbon capture equipment to keep their emissions from reaching the atmosphere the report said while also acknowledging that the technology is not yet proven to be commercially viable at scale the rapid shift away from fossil fuels needed to limit warming poses a multi trillion dollar risk to investors and resource rich nations because it could leave infrastructure idle and untapped resources in the ground about 30 of oil 50 of gas and 80 of coal reserves will remain unburnable if warming is limited to 2 degrees c the report said adding that the loss of wealth from such stranded assets could create risks for financial markets but there are economic opportunities as well both for investors looking to profit from the growing solar wind and other clean energy industries and businesses keen to benefit from their falling costs and improved technology it said the report said transitioning to low carbon energy is already economical in some cases despite decades of international climate negotiations carbon emissions and fossil fuel energy demand have been rising steadily with current emissions projections putting 1 5 degrees c well out of reach tight global energy markets and high fuel prices meanwhile have led big energy consumer nations like the united states to call for increased oil and gas drilling in the near term reflecting a shift in priorities from tackling climate change to shoring up energy security reporting by richard valdmanis editing by katy daigle and lisa shumaker

it is a belief that helped drive a historic rise in u s firearms sales and first time gun owners during the covid 19 pandemic having a handgun at home for personal protection will make you safer groundbreaking new research conducted over a 12 year period in california shows that the opposite is true between october 2004 and the end of 2016 adults in the state who didn t own a gun but took up residence with someone who did were much more likely to die a violent death than people in households without a handgun researchers from stanford university found advertisement those who lived with a handgun owner were almost twice as likely to die by homicide as their neighbors without guns the researchers found more specifically adults who lived with the owner of a handgun were almost three times more likely to be killed with a firearm than californians in households where no handguns were present in addition people who lived with a gun owner and were killed in their homes were especially likely to die at the hands of a spouse or other intimate partner among the 866 homicide victims who died in their homes during the period studied cohabitants of handgun owners were seven times more likely than adults from gun free homes to have been killed by someone who ostensibly loved them rendered into the statistics of public health the findings suggest that for every 100 000 unarmed adults whose cohabitant acquired a handgun 4 03 more were killed by a firearm in the ensuing five years than would have been if their households had remained gun free the study was published monday in the journal annals of internal medicine the risk of living with a gun owner overwhelmingly falls on women said study leader david m studdert a professor of law and health policy at stanford almost 85 of the homicide victims living with handgun owners were women he said children also bear a disproportionate share of risks that come with living in households with firearm owners but their deaths were not tallied in this study studdert said the research comes amid a steep rise in gun sales spurred by anxieties around crime racial discord and a pandemic that has killed close to a million americans and laid bare dire inequities in healthcare advertisement in a 2015 survey researchers from harvard university found that the stock of handguns in american homes had nearly doubled from 65 million in the mid 1990s to 113 million in 2015 among handgun owners 2 out of 3 cited self defense as a primary motivation for their decision to keep a firearm a study published in february found that between jan 1 2019 and late april 2021 a period marked by pandemic lockdowns and nationwide protests touched off by the may 2020 murder of george floyd by minneapolis police officers roughly 7 5 million new firearms were purchased that shopping spree created an estimated 5 4 million new gun owning households in the united states and exposed more than 11 million household members including 5 million children to the risks of living with a gun indeed as historically low crime rates began to tick up during the pandemic americans raced to buy handguns with an eye toward protecting themselves and their families studdert said despite clear evidence that rates of suicide and firearms accidents are higher in households with guns the narrative that guns protect households in other ways has gained traction in the united states but that s wrong too he said people living with gun owners showed no evidence of lower rates of fatal assault by strangers studdert said that suggests there is no protective effect of a gun against intruders we just didn t see that many adults know that having a handgun in the home increases the risk that a troubled adolescent might use the weapon to commit suicide studdert said they realize that a curious child could seek out the weapon for play with disastrous results but many of those adults appear to believe that the same gun will ward off robbers rapists and other trespassers and protect family members from harm he added advertisement you might say that s worthwhile tradeoff but we don t see that protection he said there were no protective benefits of any kind that we could detect in this study the authors of the new report stress that like the smoke of a tobacco user the risk of living with a gun spreads beyond the person who voluntarily takes on the risk making that parallel clear they called the heightened odds of violent death for those who don t own guns the secondhand risks of gun ownership david hemenway an injury prevention researcher at harvard university said the analogy is no accident as efforts to capture and limit the harm of tobacco escalated at the end of the last century it was the notion of third party effects that moved the needle hemenway said science medicine guns kill people and leading doctors want to treat them like any other threat to public health the doctors who lead the medical profession s debates on how best to preserve and restore our health are done with moments of silence in the face of gun related violence hemenway called the new study really important and pathbreaking in its use of public records to track the whereabouts and well being of very large populations over a long period the stanford team linked gun purchase documents to public voting records which include the residences of more than 17 million californians those in turn were checked against death records and medical examiners reports this is like something that s virtually never done in injury prevention you have these millions of people and you follow them year after year after year hemenway said california with its strict gun purchasing laws and careful record keeping of gun ownership is one of the few states where a study like this could be pulled off and have national implications he said advertisement much more will be learned from the data assembled for this study he added you

motor industry association mia ceo david crawford says late changes to mechanisms of the clean car discount s latest wave of updates were frustrating for the industry the latest round of clean car regulations came into effect on april 1 however distributors and dealers had barely a few weeks notice to update fuel economy labels on their inventory this followed delays from the ministry of transport that only saw exact rebate and fee amounts being confirmed in early march our gripe is that officials took all the time they needed ahead of the deadline to get their bit right and then they just thought we could flip a switch crawford says the business processes we have to put in place to get these changes implemented without breaking laws requires a couple of months of prep and we didn t get that crawford says that the process of updating vehicle information at a new vehicle level requires numerous steps of data entry and processing raw model details go into the mia model information miami system which is then sent to the motor vehicle register that then goes to rightcar the bigger issue though was the scramble to print replacement for economy labels all new stock had to have new labels implemented by april 1 with existing stock given a slightly more generous grace period of until april 15 crawford says it s just the latest example of political process underestimating how long it takes for the local industry to be able to implement change be it regarding the introduction of new labels or be it the ability to secure supply of new low emission models it s just trying to get the flow from the officials to the minister to understand that if they don t tie down the final policy decisions for getting regulations in place in time then that places an unfair burden on industry to then get our house in order in time he says that message was just lost in a dark black hole he believes the next stumbling block that s set to cause similar nightmares is the ministry of transport s hesitation behind confirming its final tare weight coefficient figures that it will use to adjust emissions targets for certain vehicles in the future we know what that tare weight alpha coefficient is but it s not yet confirmed and it won t be confirmed until the regulations are in place crawford adds we re not expecting to see regulations until the middle of the year we hope they re in place by august so we can do a dummy run before all of the account holders have to have their accounts established on december 1 the problem is if they change those coefficients manufacturers have already committed to their 2023 production they ve missed the boat and if they change those coefficients then the penalties can change by a significant amount that s the risk we face not having things done in a timely manner to allow us to then alter our business practices to meet the new targets the government doesn t seem to have an understanding about how the new vehicle sector works and the timelines they require to get changes committed through the factories it usually takes us a year to 18 months to affect change in a meaningful way suzuki new zealand has been one of the most vocal brands when it comes to questioning the tare weight coefficient penalties in its land transport amendment bill submission to government late last year it felt that the tare weight coefficient in its current form is set to render light vehicles unviable versus medium sized cars and suvs it recommended in its submission that the weight based formula should only apply to vehicles above the national target meaning that everything meeting national target just gets that as their target in order to reduce the penalties to lighter cars suzuki s submission eventually went on to claim that the marque could leave the country if clean car legislation is passed into action without changes although it later walked back these claims the ministry of transport responded to suzuki s submission in december stating that the legislation around weight would be reviewed although it did not recommend any changes at the time we also note that our current design and formula which sets stronger targets for small vehicles than for large vehicles is deliberate the underlying policy is based upon the idea that moving consumers from large vehicles to small vehicles is not a sufficient way to reduce fleet emissions even though in general it would achieve this said the ministry s response to suzuki

the united states will work with the world to ensure that there is full accountability for the crimes by russia in ukraine us national security advisor jake sullivan has said we had already concluded that russia committed war crimes in ukraine and the information from bucha appears to show further evidence of the same and as the president said we will work with the world to ensure there is full accountability for these crimes he told reporters at a white house news conference on monday the united states us is also working intensively with its european allies on further sanctions to raise the pressure and cost on putin and russia early in the morning president joe biden told reporters that his russian counterpart vladimir putin is a war criminal you may remember i got criticised for calling putin a war criminal well the truth of the matter you saw what happened in bucha this warrants him he is a war criminal biden said on his arrival from his home in delaware but we have to gather the information we have to continue to provide ukraine with the weapons they need to continue the fight and we have to get all the details so this can be an actual have a wartime trial this guy is brutal and what is happening in bucha is outrageous and everyone has seen it biden said reiterating that putin should be held accountable the president said he is seeking more sanctions against russia we have to consult with our allies and partners on what makes most sense as a mechanism moving forward obviously the icc is one venue where war crimes have been tried in the past but there have been other examples in other conflicts of other mechanisms being set up so there is work to be done to work out the specifics of that sullivan later told reporters in response to a question between now and then every day what we are focused on is continuing to apply pressure on the russian economy and provide weapons to the ukrainian people to be able to defend themselves he added sullivan told reporters that russians have now realised that the west will not break at this juncture we believe that russia is revising its war aims russia is repositioning its forces to concentrate its offensive operations in eastern and parts of southern ukraine rather than target most of the territory he said all indications are that russia will seek to surround and overwhelm ukrainian forces in eastern ukraine we anticipate that russian commanders are now executing their redeployment from northern ukraine to the region around the donbas in eastern ukraine he added russian forces are already well on their way of retreating from kyiv to belarus as russia likely prepares to deploy dozens of additional battalion tactical groups constituting tens of thousands of soldiers to the front line in ukraine s east he said we assess russia will focus on defeating ukrainian forces in the broader luhansk and donetsk provinces which encompasses significantly more territory than russian proxies already controlled before the new invasion began in late february sullivan said the ukrainians he said are effectively defending themselves with us produced air defense systems and anti tank systems such as stingers and javelins as well as radar systems that give the ukrainians early warning and target data and multiple other forms of arms and munitions the administration is working around the clock to fulfill ukraine s main security assistance requests delivering weapons from us stocks where they are available and facilitating the delivery of weapons by allies where allied systems better suit ukraine s needs the official added

association ala released a report on monday finding that library staff in at least every state have faced an unprecedented number of attempts to ban books since 2000 ala s office for intellectual freedom counted at least 729 challenges to materials and services in schools libraries and even universities in the year of 2021 we support individual parents choices concerning their child s reading and believe that parents should not have those choices dictated by others young people need to have access to a variety of books from which they can learn about different perspectives so despite this organized effort to ban books libraries remain ready to do what we always have make knowledge and ideas available so people are free to choose what to read at least 1 597 individual books were targeted for censorship according to the ala most of the books attacked were those that centered around the subjects of black persons and lgbtqia persons of the books targeted the top 10 most challenged literary works included gender queer by maia kobabe which was the most challenged and banned book by far and was targeted for its sexually explicit images as well as its queer themes for similar reasons the second most challenged book was lawn boy by jonathan evison the ala reported the fifth most targeted book to be the hate u give by angie thomas a novel inspired by themes of black identity poverty and the black lives matter movement which conservatives challenged for profanity violence and promoting an anti police message tara huizenga a part time art teacher and parent of three who attend rowva in illinois where the hate u give was challenged in mid january started an online petition to stop the book s ban huizenga says she was taking action not because of the particular book in question but because she opposes the idea of book banning overall jesse andrews author of one of the top ten most banned books me and earl and the dying girl said that he initially found it funny when he saw his book being banned andrews says his book is potty mouthed but that it also focuses on central themes such as pain grief while being a coming of age story he argued that librarians have repeatedly told him the same story a kid thought he hated books then they gave him my book he liked it now he s reading more books andrews contends that this is why libraries need to stock as many books as they can so as to get kids reading regarding his book as obscene andrews tweeted that s a value judgment i myself think american gun culture is obscene but you don t see me campaigning to have john wick removed from the internet ala has stated that me and earl and the dying girl was challenged by book banners for being sexually explicit as well as degrading to women states take fight against books with legislationefforts to control what teachers say or do in the classroom go beyond simply banning books though and efforts to censor and control teachers and educational materials are ramping up in conservative states between january and september of 2021 24 legislatures across the us introduced 54 separate bills intended to restrict teachers in k 12 schools higher education and state agencies and institutions these bills targeted discussions on race racism gender and american history while only 26 of these gag orders were aimed at higher education for the year 2022 politicians are increasing efforts to censor classrooms for adults in higher education sachs says that 46 of all educational gag orders filed this year so far are directed solely at higher education with 38 higher education focused bills being pushed in 20 states as of january 24 of this year but rather than working to address the unaffordable cost of college tuition politicians are instead getting crafty in their efforts to dictate educators on what they can and cannot teach for example mississippi s proposed hb 437 bill would prohibit professors from teaching materials that include the idea that the state of mississippi is fundamentally institutionally or systematically racist or that racial equity should be given preference in education and advocacy over racial equality the bill would apply to all public and private colleges including mississippi s historically black colleges and universities hbcus teachers who go against the bill would result in a college losing all state funding meanwhile in missouri politicians are attempting to restrict professors at public colleges from teaching voting patterns at different income levels as well as assigning students to read from the giving pledge a movement started by warren buffet melinda french gates and bill gates in an effort to encourage the world s wealthiest to donate a majority of their wealth to philanthropic causes additionally in october 2021 a southlake school administrator from texas advised teachers that if they have books about the holocaust in their classom they should also offer students books from the point of view of nazis this motive came some months after the state s ban on teaching critical race theory in k 12 public classrooms was signed by texas governor greg abbott while some parents and politicians are proponents of book banning and educational gag orders in schools the ala pointed out that a survey they conducted in early march of 2022 found that a majority of voters both liberal and coservative were actually opposed to any efforts of having books removed from public libraries in fact 71 of those said they opposed efforts to have books banned in their local public libraries and 79 of respondents said they believe public libraries do a good job of offering books with a variety of viewpoints caldwell stone further noted that to combat these book bans the ala is launching the unite against book bans campaign which will organize those who oppose the censorship of free speech and education sputnik international feedback sputniknews com

imagine even if it looks unrealistic that one day canada will be cut off from the rest of the world and all import deliveries to the country will be possible for example only through alaska only by trains along one route it sounds absurd but ukraine in the very heart of europe is in a similar situation today at one point before the farmers of ukraine had adopted the latest technology that might not have hit them as hard or as early but for many years now they ve been using the same machinery pesticides and fertilizers that other commercial farmers around the world use advertisement read also eu provisionally agrees to ukraine farm import curbs the european union provisionally agreed on monday to restrictions on ukrainian food imports which some eu members say have destabilized the bloc s agricultural markets each global manufacturer has established its branches in ukraine and concluded agreements with dealers each dealer built its own service centres throughout our country and offered farmers excellent conditions for co operation advertisement this allowed farmers to do what they do best work on their farms producing their crops the local agriculture businesses managed the flow of spare parts and inputs from abroad and repaired the equipment and ensured inputs were available when needed this system worked fine for many years in a row and when such a cautious person as for example i asked the question what if the war starts they laughed at me what kind of war american german french agricultural machinery pesticides of world famous brands this is the best thing a farmer can buy he can work quietly and earn money why should he think about industry and the economic security of the state let the government worry about it advertisement but today a ukrainian farmer thinks every minute where to find spare parts which are produced in china italy or germany herbicides seeds nitrogen fertilizers and even where to buy fuel for tractors after all most of all these resources are imported to ukraine for example in our country there are six large oil refineries however almost all of them did not work and we imported diesel fuel and gasoline from belarus the country from which the russian army fires missiles at us every day advertisement at the same time although ukraine has its own factories for the production of agricultural machinery and fertilizers and has its own good selection of crops it was believed that all this was unpromising allegedly it is better to buy everything abroad and choose the best now even agricultural machinery made in ukraine in the majority cannot be produced without imported components you may think this doesn t apply to canadian farmers but while the underlying reasons are different the end result is very similar advertisement about 30 years ago big business in north america and europe decided that it was profitable to move factories to other countries this is how tens of thousands of modern enterprises appeared in china and other asian countries the idea then seemed just great pay less taxes lower wages for workers and sell part of the manufactured products right on the spot moreover many manufacturers scattered their factories around the world for example different parts for the same tractor model can be produced simultaneously in china turkey brazil russia and italy while the tractor itself is produced in the u s or germany by the way russia took advantage of this situation very well almost all the world s leading car manufacturers have built their factories in that country they were attracted by tax incentives as well as guaranteed sales of manufactured products as a result russia attacked ukraine using military equipment with components from well known world manufacturers yes most of these companies left the russian market but the factories equipment and specialists remained a well known brand is good but machinery is made in factories not on the stock exchange in connection with the globalization of production the role of logistics has increased dramatically containers with components had to move around the world and in order for you to get a ready made tractor for work a huge complex puzzle must be formed this puzzle depends on a million things weather politics various restrictions and more advertisement we saw that globalization is not always good two years ago when logistics around the world were disrupted due to quarantine restrictions this still hasn t recovered and now as we see this war is further disrupting them consider what a wider war or further unknown disruption could mean then the farmer may suddenly find out that the filters needed to run his tractor are made in china and to bring them in the near future is simply impossible after that the farmer will ask is it not possible to produce them in our country after all there is nothing complicated in the design of the filter they will answer him well it used to be not so profitable compared to the production of filters in china and now it takes a lot of time to create production capacity here advertisement i do not want to scare canadian readers with war it his my hope you will never see this horror but we must understand that the world is not as predictable as we would like it to be the day before i heard the rocket explosions on feb 24 2022 there were only two things i cared about what kind of vacuum cleaner should i choose and how best to plan the yard near my new house now i am most interested in whether i will be able to feed my family in a month two or six months and in general whether we will be alive by this time this also applies to the country as a whole we must be sure that the national economy and in particular the agricultural sector will work in any case such large agricultural countries of the world as ukraine or canada must fully provide themselves with resources for farmers farmers should not depend on filters bearings and pesticides being brought in from the other side of the planet yes it is very difficult to create but i don t see any other option in an uncertain world but farmers can also help themselves in ukraine some farmers made a decision not to depend on dealers even earlier these are mainly small and medium size companies in which they have created their own workshops for the repair of equipment and also independently produce seed some farmers even make their own organic fertilizer from compost the leaders of such independent companies have purchased machine tools and other equipment and pay salaries to qualified specialists blacksmiths locksmiths builders mechanics this allows us not to rely on other people but to independently repair agricultural machinery build production facilities infrastructure and even design some tillage machines now that the war has begun such farmers make bulletproof vests and repair armoured vehicles i do not know how useful this experience will be in canada but i think that several dozen farmers could maintain a regional station for the repair of agricultural machinery and infrastructure construction this would reduce their dependence on external factors also to centrally purchase fuel pesticides and fertilizers thus receiving a discount for a larger volume but that s another story at the end of our conversation i want to note again the country s economic security is not just words this is a harsh reality here in ukraine especially for farmers who need to plant grow and harvest their crops on time ihor pavliuk is a ukraine based agricultural journalist
