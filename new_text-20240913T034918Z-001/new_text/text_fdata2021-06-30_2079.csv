rhondella and jennifer o tyou rhondella thanks a j delta plus is now spreading in 11 cntouries raising new concerns about the impact of t efficacy of covid vaccines jennifer here to answer your questions is dr rk siedner the epidemiolostgi within the department of infectious diseases at mass general hospital how is the dtael plus variant different and is it more dangerous so we re still learning about this ayt or delta plus variant it s definitely one the scientific community is watching but i think what peopleho suld know is that as long as vaccination rates are low pretty much anywhere in the world he t virus will continue to spread and these variants will continue to emer we know that the parent virus the delta variant itself is spreading in massachusetts it s being seen in 10 20 of cases currently it s clearly more contagious and appears to be more severe particularly in young people so for those among us who have yet to be vaccinated i think especially among the younger folks i think this is something you should be keeping your eyes on rhondella ok we know people who are immunocompromised may not get the same protection from covid vaccines a w study suggests a third dose could be the answer what do you think autbo that there have been studies and they ve been reassuri ng in this sty organ transplant recipients got a third vaccine there are going to be some specific populations who need more vaccines than the rest of us jennifer if the protection is better with a third dose at least in some cases why doesn t everyone get one or is it possible to have too much vaccines so the flip side here in the vast majority of us over 90 of us clearly the current vaccines are working we ve seen that in clinical trials and real world data these vaccines are preventing 90 100 of deaths although boosters may be needed or immunity wanes or now these vaccines are working not much advanta to get a third dose especially with global shortes of the vaccines rhondella this trshuday registration opens for the vaxmillions getawa y we re learning there s a weid rangofe reasons people don t get vaccinated hopefully information sessions like these will help address their concerns there are people who ve had a difficult time accessing vaccines for work schedules or child care schedus le it s great to see that vax bus or the other programs in massachusetts to address people who have had these challenges there are just some who need an extra nudge in massachusetts and other states therere a a million more nudges for those who need that hopefuyll this will get more people to cross the finish line jennifer the numbers tick up dr mark sied advertisement how to protect yourself against the covid 19 delta variant according to experts the world health organization just released new guidelines on masks and social distancing for fully vaccinated people share copy link copy countries around the world are entering new lockdowns as the coronavirus delta variant continues to spread australia bangladesh germany and south africa are the latest in a string of nations to put new restrictions in place to try and curb the strain per the washington post even as the u s population inches closer to halfway fully vaccinated the world health organization is urging people not to throw caution to the wind the delta variant has already shown different mutations and a faster transmission rate than other strains and experts are continually learning more about it the who has been tracking covid 19 variants since the beginning of the pandemic and the delta variant has been elevated into a variant of concern because it s a more contagious strain here s everything you need to know about the delta variant and how to protect yourself and others what is the delta variant the who recently said that delta is becoming the dominant covid 19 variant worldwide per cnbc while the strain was first found in india it has now spread to 80 countries and it targets the most vulnerable individuals mostly in places with low vaccination rates per the new york times there isn t enough research available yet to confirm reports that the delta variant may cause more severe symptoms but delta is potentially more lethal because it s more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals dr mike ryan executive director of the who s health emergencies program said last week what is the delta plus variant after the delta variant surfaced a newer delta plus variant was also identified in india not much is known about delta plus since researchers haven t had much time to study it yet but it s believed to also be highly transmissible like the delta variant per los angeles times dr george rutherford an epidemiologist at the university of california san francisco says it sounds like just another variant that s no better no worse than the regular delta variant and it s a little unclear why everybody s pushing on it i don t see that this is a big big problem right now dr monica gandhi an infectious diseases expert at uc san francisco told the los angeles times that i know it keeps on seeming like there s more and more and so it s certainly understandable why people are like why doesn t it stop once you tamp down transmission it really will stop accumulating these mutations that is the reason why we want to of course have global vaccine equity to stop transmission is the delta variant already in the u s yes the delta variant has already arrived in america in a white house briefing last tuesday dr anthony fauci from the national institute of health said that 20 6 of new coronavirus cases in the u s are due to the delta variant per npr the cdc continues to add to its interactive map of delta variant cases in the u s based on the cdc map delta is most present in central and western states including colorado montana wyoming and nebraska but california and texas aren t far behind per fast company the delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the u s to our attempt to eliminate covid 19 fauci said he also explained that the number of cases that are caused by the delta variant is doubling every two weeks per npr we have the tools so let s use them and crush the outbreak he said who is at risk for contracting the delta variant experts say that people in places with low covid 19 vaccination rates are among the most vulnerable populations there still are big portions of the country where the rates of vaccination are quite low said dr jeremy luban a virologist at the university of massachusetts medical school per npr this delta variant is increasing in frequency the speed at which it s increasing in frequency is greatest in those areas where vaccination rates are lowest justin lessler an epidemiologist at johns hopkins university says experts are keeping an eye on the delta variant for the most part it s a moderate resurgence he said per npr we re not having massive epidemics at a national level but we have this kind of continuation of the virus just sticking around and keeping us on our toes and in specific places there could be substantial epidemics still what new guidelines have the who released about the delta variant on friday the who strongly advised fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks social distance six feet apart and practice other covid 19 safety measures per cnbc dr mariangela simao is the who assistant director general for access to medicines and health products during a news briefing she said that fully vaccinated people should continue to be cautious people cannot feel safe just because they had the two doses she said they still need to protect themselves she added that the vaccine alone won t stop community transmission people need to continue to use masks consistently be in ventilated spaced hand hygiene the physical distance avoid crowding this still continues to be extremely important even if you re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing per cnbc does the coronavirus vaccine protect against the delta variant yes dr rochelle walensky the director of the centers for disease control and prevention says that covid 19 vaccines do protect against the delta variant we know our vaccines work against this variant she said per npr however this variant represents a set of mutations that could lead to future mutations that evade our vaccines and that s why it s more important than ever to get vaccinated now to stop the chain of infection the chain of mutations that could lead to a more dangerous variant a new study found that the moderna vaccine did produce neutralizing antibodies for the delta variant plus a few others per cnbc however it s important to note that the study was small and the data hasn t been peer reviewed yet can i still get covid 19 if i m fully vaccinated yes but the chances are very small any case contracted after an individual has already been fully vaccinated is considered a breakthrough case and some delta cases have already been labeled breakthrough cases according to the wall street journal breakthrough cases are to be expected because the vaccines aren t 100 foolproof against covid 19 says professor ran balicer the chief innovation officer for clalit israel s largest health management organization the cdc stopped tracking all breakthrough cases back in may but they aren t as serious as they might sound if you are fully vaccinated you have a lot of protection l a county public health director barbara ferrer told the los angeles times and for the very small numbers of people that may end up in fact with a breakthrough vaccination case they really did not have serious illness dr fauci seconded that delta breakthrough cases tend to be less serious importantly the protection against severe disease resulting in hospitalization and death is over 90 93 94 so if you are vaccinated you re going to be protected he said in an interview with npr for more information the who recently posted a q a session about the impacts covid 19 variants may have on vaccines effectiveness on its instagram will i need a vaccine booster shot possibly some experts are beginning to consider vaccine booster shots as one defense against the delta variant per nasdaq they re studying whether people who received johnson johnson s one dose vaccine might need booster shots of the pfizer biontech or moderna mrna based vaccines in order to protect themselves a few experts have already gotten booster shots just to be safe even though only preliminary data exists on whether combining different vaccines is safe and effective dr peter hotez from baylor college of medicine tweeted that getting a j j dose on top of a pfizer or moderna dose could offer better protection but further guidance was necessary in the phase 1 2 data two doses of j j gave higher virus neutralizing antibodies than a single dose and therefore might be better and broader protection against variants hotez wrote or a single dose j j followed by mrna but we need data and cdc fda guidance johnson johnson said it is currently testing whether people s immune response from its vaccine could fight back against the delta variant but no data is available yet per nasdaq
upset and weary is how chef and restaurant owner noel keane felt after hearing that the return of indoor dining would be postponed once more he said the lack of clarity was destroying viable businesses alcohol and dry goods orders were already arriving to croí his 80 seat restaurant in tralee co kerry in anticipation of the now cancelled reopening of indoor dining on july 5 this is the third time we ve been closed with very little notice he said it doesn t just affect us it affects all our suppliers the printers the laundries our families we re all tired from it we re all worn down for the first time in my life i had serious mental health struggles earlier this year i know people who have walked away from their businesses walked away from their dream because they could not take the uncertainty hospitals now have very low numbers of covid patients but hospitality is flatlining and there is no icu for us we can t keep taking these blows the national public health emergency team s nphet advice is that indoor dining should only be permitted for the fully vaccinated taoiseach micheál martin said mr keane said he has serious concerns about the legality of policing this asking people are you vaccinated is asking a medical question he said explaining his discomfort with doing such a thing so will we be breaking the law if we ask and if they refuse to say or they re not vaccinated do we have to refuse entry and if so is that discrimination he also asked why antigen tests were consistently sidelined in this country when they had been used effectively in other jurisdictions denis cotter of paradiso restaurant on washington st cork city had already decided not to open his restaurant for indoor dining before july 20 assuming the july 5 date was too early at least we have a couple of weeks where we don t have to cancel people he said and the focus now is on vaccines if we make serious progress on that in the next few weeks then we may be more ready having to operate his restaurant at just 45 capacity or rearranging a few indoor bookings for outside instead are in reality small problems mr cotter said the government s job is not to bow to industry pressure it s the government s job to first of all look after the health of the population and secondly if they do have to put restrictions on businesses then to look after those businesses and they ve done that really well so far he said that people have reacted positively to outdoor dining and he believes it will continue in ireland post pandemic another cork publican with foresight maureen mclaughlin had not planned to reopen maureen s in shandon until october when more people will be vaccinated and things even out but the changes brought by the pandemic have made her examine other ways to serve the community without serving alcohol i m now thinking of new ways to use the space she said jack costello of the locke bar limerick picture brian arthur under the proposed rules for being vaccinated if dining indoors jack costello who runs the locke bar in limerick city would not be able to enjoy a pint inside his own pub as he is yet to be vaccinated he said pushing the date back makes sense but that the industry won t be happy about it however he said the recommendations for indoor dining to be restricted to people who are fully vaccinated just doesn t make sense i don t think that s going to fly well with the industry and the public as a whole i don t think it appropriate to ask someone for their health past if they want a pint or a bite to eat mr costello said mike ryan runs pharmacia another popular pub in limerick he has labelled the delayed reopening as a farce why are we being left behind yet again we can travel around the country no bother but cannot go inside for a meal and a drink it is gone beyond the joke said mr ryan publicans and restauranteurs will now be left with unusable stock ordered for the return of indoor dining he said
the windsor town board on monday june 21 asked several tough questions to chris ashby the director of the larimer county events complex the ranch during its work session at windsor town hall ashby was in attendance to present to the town board the ranch s plans to renovate and expand on its campus located north of crossroads blvd and east of i 25 many of the questions were regarding the funding for the upcoming remodel and expansion approved by larimer county taxpayers in 2017 the seven point master plan here outlines all upcoming projects estimated to cost around 38 million ashby opened up his presentation by saying in 2017 the ranch went back to the voters to extend the dedicated sales tax that funded the original construction of the ranch it is a dedicated 15 sales tax in larimer county on everything sold and that is what funded the original construction it was a 20 year window that expired in 2019 in 2017 it went back to the voters when they were asked to extend it another 20 years we took the concept that approved the tax and dug into it quite a bit more ashby elaborated on what he meant by dug into it more saying that he and a group of consultants in the industry looked over the original master plan and amended it the county commissioners approved these amendments on dec 16 2020 the county approved a new privately funded hotel and conference center attached or adjacent to a new exhibition hall the exhibition hall would replace what is currently the first national bank building ashby stated all the events we do there would now move into more of a true commercial space because that space is somewhat limited as an exhibition facility the new space would be a much larger facility than the one that is currently there now ashby also outlined a new recreational center with three ice sheets and a tournament style swimming pool the ice sheets would support the colorado eagles a member of the american hockey league and an affiliate with the colorado avalanche as a training facility and for local youth teams why does this matter to the larimer county taxpayer bill a1 was passed by the voter in the fall of 2018 extending it another 20 years the bill allocates 15 cents of every 100 spent in larimer county to improve the ranch until 2039 the a1 account has 22 million but it has yet to be spent by the ranch on any upgrades or renovations the big question on everyone s mind is why hasn t that money been spent yet it has been accumulating for the past two years since the bill was passed but so far the taxpayers have received nothing more than a plan for what is to come furthermore a section of the plan outlines an upgrade to the livestock and equestrian arenas a niche market even in northern colorado this is a market that also seems to be declining as the area becomes more developed ashby stated that they identified a market segment that is just slightly beyond where we are now but somewhat below national western stock show so kind of that mid range ashby also went on to say we know we are never going to be able to steal the national show from national western but we might take the junior show another question that arises is this how much revenue would be generated from expanding those livestock facilities the county seems to believe it would bring in a lot the windsor town board posed questions about the budweiser event center as well it would be the most expensive part of the proposed plan costing around 180 million to reconstruct that s almost all of our budget said ashby if we built that new building it would eliminate everything else we could do so that means we would have to find a private partner to do it a significant problem that the county is running into is that most of the buildings outlined in the plans are not profitable and operate at a loss the taxpayer is subsidizing these buildings through the sales tax making it difficult to get private companies to become funding partners what is currently being done ashby stated that the four lots planned for development are not under construction they will be saved until a private partner funds the hotel they want the possibility of discussing the placement of the hotel to be open with whoever decides to finance it right now however there are no bids for any of the other projects ashby promised that the projects would break ground this year despite the lack of bids for most of them currently the ranch is in full service to provide vaccines but that ended friday june 25 full capacity shows concerts and sporting events resumed last weekend update conversation with chris ashby a week after the article was finished townsquare media reporter henry dooley had a conversation with chris ashby regarding some questions about the funds from the a1 tax the first question was about the 29 million in cash reserves ashby had previously stated at the windsor town board work session meeting that there was only 22 million in the reserves ashby told townsquare that he does not know the exact number off the top of his head and that the cash reserves are always changing due to renovations to the budweiser event center he then stated that the rest of the money would be used for regrading and roadwork before any vertical construction right now a portion of the money from the fund is being used on a design team so that bids for the construction of the buildings can be sent out no bids for any of the buildings have been sent out but ashby assured they would be done with the design process by the fall or early spring the final questions for ashby regarded the money that came in during covid 19 most of the naming rights for the building during the pandemic were suspended while others were discounted all the money from those rights went to facility upkeep according to ashby the money from the state and uc health also went to keeping the facilities running during covid get our free mobile app

a d c federal court dismissed two antitrust cases brought against facebook last year in a huge setback for federal and state regulators the company s total stock value soared past 1 trillion after the ruling the hill reports that a d c federal court on monday dismissed two antitrust cases brought against the social media giant facebook last year the ftc will have an opportunity to file an amended complaint but the challenge from a coalition of state attorneys general led by new york s letitia james d has been dismissed an ftc spokesperson said in a statement the ftc is closely reviewing the opinion and assessing the best option forward the ftc argued that facebook stifled competition by acquiring competitors and called for the breakup of whatsapp and instagram judge james e boasberg an obama era nominee dismissed the ftc s complaint as presented but did not dismiss the claims that facebook may have a monopoly on personal social networking the judge stated that the regulatory agency provided insufficient evidence to prove that facebook controls over 60 percent o the market as the case alleges but that it could conceivably do so the ftc has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element of all of its section 2 claims namely that facebook has monopoly power in the market for personal social networking psn services the ruling reads the ftc has until july 29 to file an amended complaint the court further determined that the state ag case was filed too late the lawsuit which was filed last year challenged facebook s acquisition of whatsapp and instagram which took place in 2014 and 2012 respectively the state officials argument that facebook blocking interoperability for certain apps violated section 2 of the sherman act was dismissed as the acquisitions took place more than five years ago although the court does not agree with all of defendant s contentions here it ultimately concurs with facebook s bottomline conclusion none of the states claims may go forward the decision reads after the ruling facebook s market cap closed about 1 trillion for the first time ever read more at the hill here lucas nolan is a reporter for breitbart news covering issues of free speech and online censorship follow him on twitter lucasnolan or contact via secure email at the address lucasnolan protonmail com
stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper member am i ready or bgw320 500 hello there i have been using 1gmps plan for 6 years and currently using the 210 series modem in my previous apt there was a big ont box in the closet room and then cat5e cable came from closet to the living room in my new apartment there was a small box inside the closet room wall outlet and then cat5e cable came from closet to the living room i have experienced frequent dropouts in wifi i gave up on troubleshooting i heard about bgw320 500 modem and i am wondering whether this is supported by my existing fiber setup or not i have asked att and they told me that they must dispatch a tech to find out and can t guarantee to replace the modem and they do charge 99 as service fee does anyone has gone through similar issue any further advise is helpful thanks dave006 join 1999 12 26 boca raton fl dave006 member well to use the new bgw320 techs are required to have fiber available or run fiber to the back of the bgw320 50x 500 or 505 they are not allowed to use the ethernet interface at this time there is really good inside fiber specifically for apartments that could be run almost invisibly from the closet to where you want the bgw320 to reside however you will need permission from the management company for your apartment for this modification more questions just let us know dave stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper member cool thanks dave for your insights when i moved to this new apt att tech opens the wall outlet and setup that small box with fiber cable etc work to setup the 210 series modem in living room this apt complex was constructed in early 2020 does usually att tech handle the wiring in apartments i will reach out to my apt management to see if they allow this fiber wiring gadawg join 2006 01 27 louisville ky gadawg to stroper member to stroper where is the gateway located have you tried different wifi channels using only the 2 4 band radio being in an apartment multiple wifi networks could be causing your connection to drop stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper member do you mean the att modem router the small fiber box is inside closet wall outlet and the modem is at living room connected to ethernet port on the wall outlet what i don t know is that whether there is fiber cable all the way from the closet to the living room or it s simply cat5e cable i have tried both 2 4 and 5ghz i have scanned wi fi networks using airport utility built in wi fi scanner app on iphone and i get rssi between 41 to 53 this confirms the signal strength is okay the problem is that wi fi drops and reconnects i didn t pay attention to this while i go to office and having the issue since doing work from home and office meetings drops and reconnects frequently the apt complex big and number of same att modems and higher frequencies i heard that the 320 model modem has second 5ghz antenna with support to ax 160hz channels dls join 2018 12 07 chicago il dls to gadawg member to gadawg 2 4 is really bad in dense wifi environment wifi is shared medium simplex environment when one station is transmitting no other stations can transmit on channel or adjacent channels without causing interference if there is interference everyone is taking a random delay listen for clear channel and attempt transmission 2 4 goes through the walls better than 5ghz and has less available channels this means that it is more likely to be crowded with very little effective throughput even with strong signal due to high channel utilization you may have 100 signal level and still be unable to transmit because the channel is busy to make matters worse some users and router manufacturers crank up transmit power it decreases available bandwidth because more neighbors can hear your router and have to wait to transmit in turn they queue up their data and when they send it you are unable to transmit cranking up power decreases effective bandwidth in dense wifi environments decreasing transmit power or using 5ghz which bleeds through walls less than 2 4 increases the available bandwidth it s better to have smaller cells transmitting with less power than large cell with higher power rating you get a lot more throughput with smaller cells dls dls to stroper member to stroper signal strength has nothing to do with throughput without accounting for channel utilization you may have 100 signal connected at 450mbps and unable to transmit because the channel is busy with your neighbors stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper to dls member to dls now i got the context thank you so much for your detailed explanation there are at least three hundred families nearby and att is only the provider and i do see vast number of wi fi networks nearby smaller cells do you mean less transmit power gadawg join 2006 01 27 louisville ky gadawg to dls member to dls thanks for that i knew 5 0 had less range and i was thinking his signal drop was due to that so i was thinking the op needed 2 4 gadawg gadawg to stroper member to stroper i was concerned the gateway bgw210 was in the closet with the ont that would limit your wifi connection being in the living room should give you good coverage in the living room at least what size apartment are you far from the gateway when working stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper member the tool found 157 wifi networks nearby and among them 61 networks has signal quality of above 50 no the gateway bgw210 is in the living room the apartment is 850sqft i used the tool wifiinfoview and attached couple of screenshots of my wifi you are right channel utilization for 2 4 ghz is high and for 5ghz it s less the tool found 157 wifi networks nearby and among them 61 networks has signal quality of above 50 anon4d910 72 196 122 x anon4d910 to dave006 anon to dave006 if your talking about the invisilight inside fiber technicians do not stock that on their trucks and more to the point are unable to order it dls join 2018 12 07 chicago il dls to stroper member to stroper yes smaller cells less transmit power you would adjust your transmit power to lowest possible setting at which the devices at longest required distance from router ap are still able to connect on more advanced routers and access points you could also select mandatory and supported connection rates the lowest enabled mandatory rate is the speed that is used for ssid beacons and multicast traffic it is taking largest timeslots so you want to keep it as high as possible while still allowing your legacy devices to connect setting lowest mandatory rate to 12 or 18 mbps and disabling lower rates is recommended to avoid wasting bandwidth for bssid beacons and multicast it especially helpful when you are broadcasting multiple ssids like separate networks for guest access and iot since multiple ssids quickly eat up available airtime with their slow low data rate beacons julerobb1 join 2018 12 14 little rock ar julerobb1 to dave006 member to dave006 why are they not allowed to use the external onts bugs besides corporate policy that some genius or geniuses made d or is it a mystery dave006 join 1999 12 26 boca raton fl dave006 member the base reason is to future proof the configuration by getting the at t fiber wall plate installed everything after that is customer self install for replacement or even upgrades of the gateway or the sfp for higher speeds when they are announced a standalone ont is not a customer serviceable item and another failure point at t can t send a customer a replacement ont and have them install it yes many of the audience here at dslreports could handle the task however the average customer is not a good candidate there are also common dollars and sense reasons customers still tend to take the power cord for the ont when they move and or take the standalone ont at t property off the wall this means what would be a self install for the owner tenant now requires a truck roll this costs more money and valuable time where the customer could be up and running quicker just ship a self install kit no need to schedule a tech visit or for the customer to take off work to meet the tech for the install dave dave006 dave006 to anon4d910 member to anon4d910 said by anon4d910 if your talking about the invisilight inside fiber technicians do not stock that on their trucks and more to the point are unable to order it i know several markets in california have this setup today dave it depends on the market from my understanding for garages that primarily service mdu apartments there is a group that installs the invisilight from the network panel to the location for the gateway and the install tech takes it from there as a standard install i know several markets in california have this setup today dave stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper to dave006 member to dave006 agreed when i moved between apartments att asked me to take the router with me and let the tech decide to use the existing modem or a one that suitable for your home i see that there were few new modems were present in my apartment complex and that confirms that i am eligible to use the new modem i have talked to att support over the phone for couple of hours and finally decided to have a tech tomorrow to replace the modem fingers crossed stroper stroper member tech replaced with new modem bgw320 505 and even helped me in mac filtering to use 5ghz getting incredibly good speed he put the modem in the closet as the closet panel has two built in power slots but there is no setting for 6ghz in the router admin interface he said that at t will roll out firmware update soon with that feature for folks who are looking for this new model modem just ask att and have the technician dispatched to replace it tech will replace it if there is supported panel setup already if not it will cost service fee on consumer depending on building or home setup gadawg join 2006 01 27 louisville ky gadawg member anyone who requests a dispatch on demand is likely going to be charged so i wouldn t suggest people ask for the 320 the 210 works just fine for most typical att customers stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper member i don t think so there is nothing wrong in asking for newer model with wi fi 6 capability tech told me that he would have replaced the 210 with 320 anyway regardless of i ask for it if the existing setup control panel supports 320 model if not that would be a service charge unless you are new customer gadawg join 2006 01 27 louisville ky arris bgw210 700 gadawg member sure you can ask for a bgw320 but if you have a 210 the only way to get one is a tech install with a dispatch charge of 99 if you have a service issue and the tech switches your gateway to fix it that s no charge long time att customer who knows the fee schedule any customer should verify fees and charges before they request a change to services or equipment stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper member makes sense anonf7dc9 162 226 183 x anonf7dc9 anon doesnt make sense to me i called and asked to be upgraded to newer bgw 320 they said it is not available in their sytem to select to give and only for new customers essentially i would have to cancel service and then sign up again which is dumb they should offer a workaround this anonf7dc9 anonf7dc9 to stroper anon to stroper doesnt make sense to me i called and asked to be upgraded to newer bgw 320 they said it is not available in their sytem to select to give and only for new customers essentially i would have to cancel service and then sign up again which is dumb they should offer a workaround this gadawg join 2006 01 27 louisville ky gadawg member not dumb the 320 is for direct fiber installs fiber runs all the gateway requires a tech visit to change wiring inside the home not available in all markets yet anyway stroper join 2021 06 02 dallas tx stroper member that s correct in my case my building already has this type of wiring built in so it was easy for tech to replace the modem with 320 series without touching wiring moneyt8 join 2014 02 16 california moneyt8 to stroper member to stroper does a tech have to come out to install bgw320 i have the self install kit gadawg join 2006 01 27 louisville ky gadawg member i ve never heard of a bgw320 self install kit i ve only read of it being a tech install what gateway were you shipped moneyt8 join 2014 02 16 california 2 edits moneyt8 member really oh no i have a bad feeling i already have the at t fiber the older model bgw 210 so the rep stated i was being shipped bgw320 and all i had to do was install it myself i hope i m not being shipped the older model bgw210 lol do you guys know if the bgw320 is widely available it makes

monday fox news channel s tucker carlson argued president joe biden s infrastructure proposal seeks to end suburbs carlson pointed to prominent democrats calling traditional infrastructure including road bridge and the eisenhower interstate highway system racist transcript as follows carlson in early 2009 more than 12 years ago the obama administration made a surprisingly probably unprecedented accusation against westchester county new york a pretty liberal place according to the obama administration westchester was an instrument of white supremacy not the good liberals who live in westchester bill and hillary clinton alexandria ocasio cortez and many others no one accused them of being bigots the problem was the buildings they lived in all those single family homes row upon leafy row set back from the street well tended lawns and mailboxes those were all examples of racism literally structural racism and the only solution the obama people announced was much greater density more subsidized housing complexes in westchester more high rise apartment buildings maybe some drug addicted vagrants living on the sidewalk begging for change only if westchester county became more like the bronx could it become non racist well this was all something of a surprise to the people who live in westchester again most of whom are dutiful liberals they didn t realize they had a white supremacy problem between 2000 and 2010 for example according to the census numbers westchester s black and hispanic population had risen by more than 50 percent so how could the county be racist it didn t seem to make any sense in court the obama administration explained their reasoning they singled out westchester s practice of standard zoning that referred to county regulations that restricted the height of certain buildings and limited the placement of sewers to protect the drinking water it sounds reasonable but according to the obama administration those were restrictive practices restrictive practices as a legal term that under civil rights law means they were racist and because they were racist the obama administration withheld more than 20 million in federal funds from westchester county if the county wanted the money it would have to construct 10 000 low income high density very non racist apartments so this battle it didn t get a lot of news coverage but it went on for all eight years of the obama administration and in the end to its credit westchester fought back because they could afford good lawyers and they eventually won in court but many places couldn t afford good lawyers they are not as rich as westchester so they had to relent under pressure from federal ideologues communities in oregon and minneapolis for example with very little news coverage abolished single family zoning this all happened in recent years the question is why is it happening the goal isn t to eliminate racism the goal is to eliminate suburbs so rather than improve the lives of people who live in crappy places the idea is to destroy the lives of people who live in nice places why would you want to do that why would you want to eliminate the suburbs well there s a very clear political reason suburbs are typically purple politically republicans can win just as democrats can but if your goal is to make the country a one party state you d want to change this you d want to make suburbs into cities and if you did that you d win every time democrats win cities of the 10 biggest cities in the united states democrats run nine of them of the 50 biggest they control two thirds it doesn t mean they re good at running cities they re not many of our cities are on the verge of collapse people are running away from them but making cities better is hardly the point winning elections is the point democrats are happy to admit this here s congresswoman ayanna pressley of massachusetts from yesterday watch begin video clip rep ayanna pressley d ma this is about human and physical infrastructure progressives in congress have been leading this fight care economy is infrastructure climate justice is infrastructure housing justice is infrastructure transit public transit is justice infrastructure and so these bold investments must be made to support workers and families in order for us to have a just equitable and robust recovery from this pandemic end video clip carlson housing justice it sounds like a term that maybe ayanna pressley just made up what does that mean well if most people were asked they would say it means you re not allowed to prevent people regardless of what they look like or where they are from from moving into a specific neighborhood and that s true that s been federal law for a long time more than 50 years you can t discriminate in housing sales and you shouldn t be able to but that s not what she is talking about she is talking about something very different she is saying if neighborhoods look different then by definition they are racist if one is nicer than the other you have to make it less nice or else that s not equity the obama administration was on this early in 2015 the department of housing and urban development under obama issued a final rule on what it called affirmatively furthering fair housing now according to the hud secretary at this time julian castro the fair housing rule was simply intended to enforce the fair housing act of 1968 the law that makes it illegal to discriminate in housing sales or in renting on the basis of race again that law has been on the book a long time and it s not controversial but that law also requires local jurisdictions that receive federal money to take steps to affirmatively further the goal of eliminating race discrimination in housing huh this is a complex word play but here is what it means under the obama administration hud went one important step further according to julian castro the existence of quote concentrated poverty in urban centers as opposed to the suburbs constituted de facto evidence of racial discrimination in other words as long as there is a place that s poorer than the place you live the place you live is racist that s insane but on the basis of that assumption they move forward and local jurisdictions were told to eliminate single family zoning and increase density in business districts and if they didn t comply they might lose millions of dollars in community development block grants from hud that was a very radical step and most americans were unaware it was even happening and people who live outside the cities are very against it including faithful democrats none of them were for that if they wanted to live next to section 8 housing they would have stayed in the city in the first place so people hate this idea suburbs are very complicated organisms like everything humans build they ve developed over a century in some cases more than a century for good reason to have federal ideologues come in and destroy them is very threatening to people they re not for that again even democratic voters are not for that and of course joe biden understands that he is not a genius but he knows what people fear so when asked about it during the last campaign he lied watch biden reassure you that it is racist even to suggest that he would want to change america s suburbs here it is begin video clip joe biden d then candidate for president of the united states look what he s doing now the president he is kind of scared because an awful lot of suburbanites are now deciding they re going to vote for me at least the polling data suggests as opposed to him and he is talking about you know biden is going to what he s going to do he is going to send all these folks out to suburbia then they re going to end up with houses out in suburbia and apartments in suburbia end video clip carlson yes well a lot of suburban voters did vote for joe biden partly on the basis of that claim that he wasn t going to send a lot of people to the suburbs but that was a complete lie now joe biden is preparing to do just that now at the time his defense was that the hud rule by itself was not enough to restructure and eliminate suburbs local communities that didn t want to comply with the rule could simply refuse hud grants they d lose millions of dollars of course but they could survive what biden didn t say is that the hud rule was just the first step in his new infrastructure plan which you can read online and you should biden calls for dramatically expanding the federal government s power over suburbs the plan calls for implementing the provisions of something called the home act that was a bill first proposed by cory booker of newark who is a lunatic and reckless that legislation goes much farther than anything the obama administration even attempted it would cut billions of dollars of federal funding to any local government with quote ordinances that ban apartment buildings from certain residential areas or set a minimum lot size for a single family home so you under this law if you re a town are no longer in charge of how long large your lot sizes can be you have no control over anything what s the point of having a local government at that point but it goes farther the home act doesn t simply cut off hud funding to suburbs that don t comply with its equity rules it prevents states from getting federal transportation grants of any kind if they refuse to allow high rise apartments or other high density zoning in their suburbs and that s very different unlike a hud grant that is money that states have to have they can t refuse it states need federal transportation dollars to fix their streets and highways and by the way it is their money anyway it was dutifully sent to washington it is every year by citizens of their states but the biden administration is in no mood for negotiation with suburban homeowners screw them with their decent schools and crime free streets living in their little 1950s america according to the principles of equity those people must be bigots by definition they are living better than people who live in densely populated cities are living therefore we must crush them this is not a conspiracy theory very soon it could be the law read the bill abolishing the suburbs is a major part of the biden administration s infrastructure plan that legislation is still being negotiated tonight and it s not final but already the media are rushing to defend it what shills they are what liars here is usa today for example usa today the nation s largest quote newspaper quote biden s proposal would award grants and tax credits to cities that change zoning laws to bolster more equitable access to affordable housing a house with a white picket fence and a big backyard for a fourth of july barbecue may be a staple of the american dream but experts and local politicians say multi family zoning is key to combating climate change racial injustice and the nation s growing affordable housing crisis really because if you wanted to fix the affordable housing crisis maybe you would prevent foreign governments from buying up residential housing stock which they are doing or blackrock from buying up single family homes and turning them into rentals maybe you would make some effort to loosen the housing market a little bit but they re not doing that they re doing just the opposite so you may ask yourself can the federal government really ban you from having a suburban home with a backyard celebrating the fourth of july with your kids all the name of climate change and racial equity can they prevent suburbs from having roads if they don t build low income housing projects well under existing civil rights law a plan like this only works if the feds can prove that your roads are somehow racist and that is exactly the case they ve been making right out in the open why has nobody noticed this it s not just the obama administration that says roads and buildings are racist pete buttigieg is now saying it too watch this begin video clip april ryan thegrio com white house correspondent the interstate system was built to keep certain groups in and certain groups out so it was built on a racist system correct pete buttigieg u s transportation secretary yes often this wasn t just an act of neglect often this was a conscious choice there is racism physically built into some of our highways end video clip carlson eisenhower s interstate highway system is now racist really i 95 is route 5 is racist tell us how pete buttigieg does he even believe that no no one believes that just like nobody believes that westchester county is bigoted because it has rules about where you can put a sewer drain it s not about racism stop with that it s about power for democrats the goal of this infrastructure plan is permanent control over the federal government and for multinational corporations like blackrock the point is driving down the costs of homes even further and building more apartment high rises in the suburbs that has been the goal of the most powerful people in the world for some time in fact it was just a few years ago it was 2016 that the world economic forum released a video explaining and we re quoting you ll own nothing and you ll be happy what s less clear is why more self described conservatives their job though is to conserve things like america s self respecting independent middle class aren t objecting to this it s not that they even notice it is happening they are negotiating this bill the future of the way americans live is at stake and you never hear them say that

collbran del and lynne sherrod sold half their herd of black angus last year due to drought conditions they re likely to cut the herd by half once again as persistent drought conditions have seriously restricted the sherrod s supply of irrigation water the 120 head that remain are vocal about letting lynne sherrod know they re not fans of the drought diet where supplemental feed has taken the place of their luscious grass and hay meals del sherrod checks on his cattle in one of the grazing pastures on the rocking u7 ranch near collbran chelsea self post independent a grazing pasture at the rocking u7 ranch near collbran that should be lush and green but was unable to grow due to this year s drought chelsea self post independent so i went walking this morning and it s just disheartening when it s the middle of june and you see how dry the grass is and it s just crumbling underneath your feet lynne sherrod said when i get up and walk in the morning i can hear them and it s not the feed they love and appreciate you know they re not happy and you re doing the best you can for them the sherrods have also let some pasture go but still own and lease land if this summer goes the same way it went last summer we ll be getting rid of some cows lynne sherrod said the last line of water to the rocking u7 ranch barely trickles through the rocks due to this year s drought chelsea self

her husband that s got to be our philosophy everything is a gift and we have to take care of it and if we can t take care of it we need to pass it along we need to ensure that this land will recover as carbondale rancher sean martin cut hay june 21 he noted that even the old timers are likening the severity of the current drought to the drought of 1977 during which the state saw record low stream flows forcing the imposition of water restrictions on municipalities and agriculture producers alike martin remained optimistic about the conditions he s seeing near carbondale i d say we re looking better than last year for sure martin said but on irrigated ground we re 70 of what we d consider normal martin said the black angus herd he works with went from 220 last year to 130 i think i m probably going to have to get down to 70 or 80 martin surmised del sherrod checks on his cattle in one of the grazing pastures on the rocking u7 ranch near collbran chelsea self post independent terry fankhauser executive vice president of the colorado cattlemen s association is expecting an extremely tough summer due to drought conditions and subsequent wildfires i think wildfire is going to be more aggressive than it was a year ago fankhauser said we have a lot of producers that put up feed last year that aren t going to be able to this year they ll start shipping more feed into colorado we ll see the price increase we always see this the producers are going to have to decide if they want to feed their way through the drought or reduce numbers the latter is what i suspect will be the case fankhauser said cattle producers are holding on to their herds as long as they can with older operations having more flexibility to do so due to having additional acreage or reserves ginny harrington membership chairman for the holy cross cattlemen s association said that she doesn t know of anyone selling cattle right now due to drought conditions but it s a concern that s weighing on many in the industry heifers and their calves hang out around the one ditch line of water in a grazing pasture at the rocking u7 ranch near collbran chelsea self post independent there are many folks in carbondale and throughout the roaring fork valley that are already hauling water harrington said we had folks reporting that they re hauling to their summer private properties right now i ve heard of people taking rest which means they won t use their forest permit this year because there is no water i ve heard of people scrambling to find other summer pasture options hay prices are also a concern harrington said growing our winter forage and getting our hay crops are going to be a real concern or being able to purchase hay the cost of hay goes up tremendously shopping becomes quite expensive harrington said ranchers and farmers in the area have worked hard for many many years to employ the best conservation practices for the land and wildlife s sake this drought harrington said is a threat to the entire valley s ecosystem it s not only a concern for us but a concern for the elk and deer and wildlife too we provide healthy ecosystems for the wildlife too via irrigation coming

our land without those two we re not going to be able to take care of ourselves despite rains drought conditions persist drought conditions are expected to persist despite the recent rainfalls which

rhondella and jennifer o tyou rhondella thanks a j delta plus is now spreading in 11 cntouries raising new concerns about the impact of t efficacy of covid vaccines jennifer here to answer your questions is dr rk siedner the epidemiolostgi within the department of infectious diseases at mass general hospital how is the dtael plus variant different and is it more dangerous so we re still learning about this ayt or delta plus variant it s definitely one the scientific community is watching but i think what peopleho suld know is that as long as vaccination rates are low pretty much anywhere in the world he t virus will continue to spread and these variants will continue to emer we know that the parent virus the delta variant itself is spreading in massachusetts it s being seen in 10 20 of cases currently it s clearly more contagious and appears to be more severe particularly in young people so for those among us who have yet to be vaccinated i think especially among the younger folks i think this is something you should be keeping your eyes on rhondella ok we know people who are immunocompromised may not get the same protection from covid vaccines a w study suggests a third dose could be the answer what do you think autbo that there have been studies and they ve been reassuri ng in this sty organ transplant recipients got a third vaccine there are going to be some specific populations who need more vaccines than the rest of us jennifer if the protection is better with a third dose at least in some cases why doesn t everyone get one or is it possible to have too much vaccines so the flip side here in the vast majority of us over 90 of us clearly the current vaccines are working we ve seen that in clinical trials and real world data these vaccines are preventing 90 100 of deaths although boosters may be needed or immunity wanes or now these vaccines are working not much advanta to get a third dose especially with global shortes of the vaccines rhondella this trshuday registration opens for the vaxmillions getawa y we re learning there s a weid rangofe reasons people don t get vaccinated hopefully information sessions like these will help address their concerns there are people who ve had a difficult time accessing vaccines for work schedules or child care schedus le it s great to see that vax bus or the other programs in massachusetts to address people who have had these challenges there are just some who need an extra nudge in massachusetts and other states therere a a million more nudges for those who need that hopefuyll this will get more people to cross the finish line jennifer the numbers tick up dr mark sied advertisement how to protect yourself against the covid 19 delta variant according to experts the world health organization just released new guidelines on masks and social distancing for fully vaccinated people share copy link copy countries around the world are entering new lockdowns as the coronavirus delta variant continues to spread australia bangladesh germany and south africa are the latest in a string of nations to put new restrictions in place to try and curb the strain per the washington post even as the u s population inches closer to halfway fully vaccinated the world health organization is urging people not to throw caution to the wind the delta variant has already shown different mutations and a faster transmission rate than other strains and experts are continually learning more about it the who has been tracking covid 19 variants since the beginning of the pandemic and the delta variant has been elevated into a variant of concern because it s a more contagious strain here s everything you need to know about the delta variant and how to protect yourself and others what is the delta variant the who recently said that delta is becoming the dominant covid 19 variant worldwide per cnbc while the strain was first found in india it has now spread to 80 countries and it targets the most vulnerable individuals mostly in places with low vaccination rates per the new york times there isn t enough research available yet to confirm reports that the delta variant may cause more severe symptoms but delta is potentially more lethal because it s more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals dr mike ryan executive director of the who s health emergencies program said last week what is the delta plus variant after the delta variant surfaced a newer delta plus variant was also identified in india not much is known about delta plus since researchers haven t had much time to study it yet but it s believed to also be highly transmissible like the delta variant per los angeles times dr george rutherford an epidemiologist at the university of california san francisco says it sounds like just another variant that s no better no worse than the regular delta variant and it s a little unclear why everybody s pushing on it i don t see that this is a big big problem right now dr monica gandhi an infectious diseases expert at uc san francisco told the los angeles times that i know it keeps on seeming like there s more and more and so it s certainly understandable why people are like why doesn t it stop once you tamp down transmission it really will stop accumulating these mutations that is the reason why we want to of course have global vaccine equity to stop transmission is the delta variant already in the u s yes the delta variant has already arrived in america in a white house briefing last tuesday dr anthony fauci from the national institute of health said that 20 6 of new coronavirus cases in the u s are due to the delta variant per npr the cdc continues to add to its interactive map of delta variant cases in the u s based on the cdc map delta is most present in central and western states including colorado montana wyoming and nebraska but california and texas aren t far behind per fast company the delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the u s to our attempt to eliminate covid 19 fauci said he also explained that the number of cases that are caused by the delta variant is doubling every two weeks per npr we have the tools so let s use them and crush the outbreak he said who is at risk for contracting the delta variant experts say that people in places with low covid 19 vaccination rates are among the most vulnerable populations there still are big portions of the country where the rates of vaccination are quite low said dr jeremy luban a virologist at the university of massachusetts medical school per npr this delta variant is increasing in frequency the speed at which it s increasing in frequency is greatest in those areas where vaccination rates are lowest justin lessler an epidemiologist at johns hopkins university says experts are keeping an eye on the delta variant for the most part it s a moderate resurgence he said per npr we re not having massive epidemics at a national level but we have this kind of continuation of the virus just sticking around and keeping us on our toes and in specific places there could be substantial epidemics still what new guidelines have the who released about the delta variant on friday the who strongly advised fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks social distance six feet apart and practice other covid 19 safety measures per cnbc dr mariangela simao is the who assistant director general for access to medicines and health products during a news briefing she said that fully vaccinated people should continue to be cautious people cannot feel safe just because they had the two doses she said they still need to protect themselves she added that the vaccine alone won t stop community transmission people need to continue to use masks consistently be in ventilated spaced hand hygiene the physical distance avoid crowding this still continues to be extremely important even if you re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing per cnbc does the coronavirus vaccine protect against the delta variant yes dr rochelle walensky the director of the centers for disease control and prevention says that covid 19 vaccines do protect against the delta variant we know our vaccines work against this variant she said per npr however this variant represents a set of mutations that could lead to future mutations that evade our vaccines and that s why it s more important than ever to get vaccinated now to stop the chain of infection the chain of mutations that could lead to a more dangerous variant a new study found that the moderna vaccine did produce neutralizing antibodies for the delta variant plus a few others per cnbc however it s important to note that the study was small and the data hasn t been peer reviewed yet can i still get covid 19 if i m fully vaccinated yes but the chances are very small any case contracted after an individual has already been fully vaccinated is considered a breakthrough case and some delta cases have already been labeled breakthrough cases according to the wall street journal breakthrough cases are to be expected because the vaccines aren t 100 foolproof against covid 19 says professor ran balicer the chief innovation officer for clalit israel s largest health management organization the cdc stopped tracking all breakthrough cases back in may but they aren t as serious as they might sound if you are fully vaccinated you have a lot of protection l a county public health director barbara ferrer told the los angeles times and for the very small numbers of people that may end up in fact with a breakthrough vaccination case they really did not have serious illness dr fauci seconded that delta breakthrough cases tend to be less serious importantly the protection against severe disease resulting in hospitalization and death is over 90 93 94 so if you are vaccinated you re going to be protected he said in an interview with npr for more information the who recently posted a q a session about the impacts covid 19 variants may have on vaccines effectiveness on its instagram will i need a vaccine booster shot possibly some experts are beginning to consider vaccine booster shots as one defense against the delta variant per nasdaq they re studying whether people who received johnson johnson s one dose vaccine might need booster shots of the pfizer biontech or moderna mrna based vaccines in order to protect themselves a few experts have already gotten booster shots just to be safe even though only preliminary data exists on whether combining different vaccines is safe and effective dr peter hotez from baylor college of medicine tweeted that getting a j j dose on top of a pfizer or moderna dose could offer better protection but further guidance was necessary in the phase 1 2 data two doses of j j gave higher virus neutralizing antibodies than a single dose and therefore might be better and broader protection against variants hotez wrote or a single dose j j followed by mrna but we need data and cdc fda guidance johnson johnson said it is currently testing whether people s immune response from its vaccine could fight back against the delta variant but no data is available yet per nasdaq
after asian stocks sold off yesterday last night saw more drifting and hesitation from european and american markets although the s p500 did briefly put in a nominal new record high the usd rose against all the majors except yen with gold making a new monthly low while commodity prices were mixed with iron ore losing ground alongside copper as oil lifted slightly as the opec meeting gets underway bitcoin has turned its gap higher over the weekend trade into a little breakout overnight breaking through the 36k level to make a new weekly high momentum is picking up strongly now but overall price action requires a substantial breakout in the short term to overturn the medium to long term downtrend looking at share markets in asia from yesterday s session where the shanghai composite fell sharply going into the close down 0 9 to 3573 points while the hang seng index was off by nearly 0 9 to close just below 29000 points price action had broken out decisively here above the moving average band but again resistance overhead at the previous weekly highs at the 29400 level is proving to strong so far so this could turn into another trend reversal advertisement japanese stocks also fell with the nikkei 225 down 0 8 to close at 28812 points daily futures continue to suggest a flat start as heavy resistance remains at the 29000 point level and a slightly stronger yen continues to weigh nothing to do here yet advertisement australian stocks remained unsettled due to widening covid lockdowns but the asx200 put in another scratch session just above 7300 points spi futures are more bullish up nearly 40 points or 0 5 with momentum readings still in a neutral positive setting with a possible bounce off trailing atr support at 7150 points here building european markets got out of their stuck phase with a slight bounceback with the german dax again doing the best across the continent lifting 0 8 to 15690 points daily atr support remains firm at the 15300 point level but resistance at the 15700 point level remains equally strong so this still looks fully contained for now until a substantial breakout advertisement wall street was initially following along with european bourses but the three markets all put in scratch sessions at the end of the day with the broader s p500 gaining just one point to 4291 points to another record high this continues its breakout above the key resistance level at 4250 points and while price action on the daily chart is ready for more highs this is a very slow uptick advertisement currency markets are moving out of their holding patterns as the usd gains strength against most of the majors with euro declining fast overnight to finally break below the 1 19 handle this could turn into a further rollover as price approaches the previous weekly lows but momentum is oversold yet reverting the usdjpy pair continues to find heavy resistance at the 111 handle with last week s mid session turnaround still in play as a stronger yen deflates it back to four hourly atr support just above the 110 20 level this does not yet make a new four hourly session low so it still looks somewhat supported in the short term although momentum has now declined into the negative zone advertisement the australian dollar was hit hardest to be pushed decisively into the low 75 level against usd almost hitting the previous weekly low momentum and price action had been pointing to more downside here with further falls possible although extreme oversold levels could revert here slightly before the upcoming nfp print on friday night advertisement oil prices are firming slightly as the opec meeting gets underway with brent crude bouncing off the 74usd per barrel level while price has been strongly supported in this uptrend with momentum nicely overbought and not too far overextended the 2018 high at 83 maybe too far a bridge to make it through this meeting watch for high volatility here gold remains in the doldrums with a sharp move down overnight that was almost filled but failed to stave off a new daily low finishing at the 1761usd per ounce level the downside target at the april lows at 1670 are not far away watch for any close below the recent lows as a signal for more selling advertisement glossary of acronyms and technical analysis terms atr average true range measures the degree of price

yet another slate s care and feeding your white daughter had it coming article earlier by aveline talmadge and by steve sailer if you are a white parent whose white child is a victim of black or hispanic bullying don t come crying to slate s jamilah lemieux pictured right this is the third item in a 2019 slate care and feeding column in parental advice the headline is about the top item and is i m worried my friend s son is a psychopath he gives me the creeps and he just killed a bunny by jamilah lemieux september 11 2019 and is illustrated with a stock photo of a little white boy holding a hammer dear care and feeding we live in a very multicultural and socioeconomically diverse area in south florida we are white and both my husband and i are well off professionals our 4½ year old daughter has grown up socializing with all types of children and has a close friend who is black and one who is brazilian there are two hispanic little girls at the preschool that have made meanish comments to my child based on her race and appearance they have told her that they didn t like her because of her blond hair and that they won t be friends with her because she doesn t speak spanish i ve reiterated to my daughter that she should be kind that all people are the same on the inside and that we shouldn t judge people by their appearance people are not all the same on the inside and the problem is not her small blond daughter not being kind but her darker skinned classmates this past week she informed me that the girls have now told her that they will only be friends with other girls who have dark skin not light skin like hers we are only three weeks into the school year but i m thinking of emailing the teacher comments about skin color and hair color seem really wrong to me if my child said she didn t want to be friends with a little hispanic girl because her skin is brown or because her hair is black i would certainly take action is it too soon to reach out and if not what should i say lemieux s response is to literally blame the victim and her race and her nation s government and absolve the little brown bullies here s a list of her justifications for bullying which i ve put into point form you re in a culturally and economically diverse community which likely means an area that is undergoing gentrification means an area that is undergoing your family is well to do which leads me to infer that these children may be from a somewhat different background the increasingly open contempt for hispanic and latinx people that has been stoked by the current presidential administration people that has been stoked by the current presidential administration a strong possibility that these kids may have seen heard or experienced some things that might make them hostile toward or fearful of white folks some things that might make them or of white folks the girls may have heard their parents talk about rising rents pushing neighbors out of a neighborhood that may be changing to serve a wealthier whiter population pushing neighbors out of a neighborhood that may be to serve a wealthier whiter population they may have witnessed friends being mistreated by members of the maga hat masses or some racist ass liberals or some racist ass liberals they may even have seen loved ones harassed or detained by u s immigration and customs enforcement agents then there s this it may be comfortable to think no this is just a matter of kids seeing someone unfamiliar and not knowing how to react but i find that unlikely at 4 or 5 most children of color have already been widely exposed to positive representations of white people in the media disney princesses ensure that your daughter is not the first pale blonde they ve come across it s more likely that she represents to them either troubling events or things that they ve had to deal with when you speak to the teacher about what happened be careful not to suggest that these little girls have done something remotely comparable to a situation in which the children s races were reversed of course not all these things she s suggesting as justification for hating little blonde white girls are absolutely required to be overlooked by whites objecting to strange people moving into your neighborhood people of other colors victimizing your neighbors or a government that has increasingly open contempt for your race is practically the definition of white racism i think if jamilah lemieux would look into her own heart presuming she has one she d see that the reason the little girls hate their blonde classmate is that she s better looking than them and has better hair and if you re a white parent for god s sake don t get your parenting advice from slate

ms nakashima good afternoon i m ellen nakashima a national security reporter at the washington post my first guest today is senator angus king from maine he s a member of the senate intelligence committee and co chair of the bipartisan cyberspace solarium commission welcome senator king it s great to have you sen king ellen great to be with you on a very timely topic i m absolutely convinced we ll fill the time quite profitably ms nakashima indeed let s dive right in shall we senator earlier this month president biden sat down with president putin in geneva and warned him on cyberattacks including ransomware he said we have significant cyber capability and if in fact the russians violate basic norms the united states will respond with cyber in a cyber way do you think his signaling to putin in this way will have any deterrent effect advertisement sen king i think it will and i think it s important it was a very very important step ellen because for the past 15 years or so we haven t had much in the way of a deterrent we ve been a cheap date in cyber where we ve been attacked repeatedly in a variety of ways and no real serious response sanctions here and there but i believe that having a deterrent is absolutely critical otherwise they re just going to keep doing it cyber is cheap putin can hire 8 000 hackers for the cost of one jet fighter think of that for a second and that means cost is not really any kind of deterrent or disincentive they re got to feel that they re at risk i want somebody in the kremlin in the politburo to say gee boss i m not sure we ought to do this because we re liable to get whacked in some way by those americans if we follow through the best cyberattack is the one that doesn t happen ms nakashima well for years u s government policy has been that we do not have to respond to cyberattacks with cyberattacks in fact doing so is not always as you know the most effective counterpunch certainly not alone when there is a cyberattack that affects our critical infrastructure like a pipeline do you think that we should respond in a cyber way and should we target adversaries critical infrastructure advertisement sen king well i don t think we need to be that specific i don t think we need to say the response has to be cyber for cyber or critical infrastructure for critical infrastructure i think the important thing is that we have a clear declaratory policy that there will be a costly response and i don t think it s helpful to be terribly specific about what that would be now that means something more than we will respond in some way of our choosing ms nakashima right sen king i don t think that s sufficient i think it has to be specific and it has to be quick ms nakashima in fact president biden said we will respond in a cyber way which i think was what made me take notice i mean do you think we should respond in a cyber way to a cyberattack sen king well i think that s one of the tools in the toolbox i don t think it necessarily should be the only tool there may be others in the way of sanctions or other things that can be done that will send a message that this isn t anything to be trifled with in terms of our country i m not prepared to say it should be cyber for cyber but i do think that what the president did was signaling a deterrent policy is a big step forward and it s one that i support advertisement ms nakashima well one of our audience members mike russell from virginia sent us a question which follows from this line of discussion he asked what role if any should the military play in defending critical infrastructure or even the private sector in cyberspace and i d like to ask you if it should specifically be enabled to counter non nation state adversaries for instance to disrupt networks of criminal ransomware actors overseas so you could answer both of them sen king my answer to the second question is yes that to the extent we have the capability and i believe we do to disrupt a criminal ransomware attackers or criminal gangs in other countries we should do so i think that and you played a quote just before we went on the air we re really dealing with a new kind of conflict here ellen traditionally conflict has been army against army battleship against battleship now we re really talking about a case where 75 or 80 or 85 percent of the target space is in the private sector so we have to figure out a new relationship advertisement for example the federal government has all kinds of capabilities for attributing where a cyberattack is coming from that s critical you can t respond if you don t know where it s coming from attribution is something that we can do and we do have assets in cybercom and nsa that can disrupt networks of those who are trying to attack us whether it s a state actor or non state actor it s a different kind of relationship where the private sector but the private sector on their side particularly if it s a critical infrastructure have to be prepared to report these incidents we can t help unless we know that something is going on and the quicker we know the more help the federal government could be i think there should be a relationship where incident reporting is mandatory but that the federal government will use its assets to assist the attacked entity whether it s transportation pipeline grid telecommunications whatever but also there should be some liability protection if the critical infrastructure entity is following the rules following the standards and reports i think it s a burden and benefit relationship that we have to establish because when the attack comes it s likely to be on critical infrastructure not on the department of agriculture ms nakashima right so you re in favor of the mandatory reporting rule as long as there s some protection against legal liability or immunity from lawsuits would you say advertisement sen king right yeah i d say you know it s a burden and benefit situation where the assets of the federal government in terms of things like attribution and response ms nakashima right sen king i mean the fbi collected a bunch of money for colonial pipeline and i think there should be a relationship where there are reciprocal responsibilities and what we re really talking about here is not a heavy regulatory regime just a regime that says if you have an unauthorized entrance into your system you re going to let us know and then we can come to your defense and help out but it s got to be as i say a reciprocal relationship ms nakashima ransomware is a hot topic these days and the biden administration as you know is reviewing the ransomware policy apart from whether well first of all do you think ransomware payments should be banned that s a tricky question and at the very least should the government make ransomware payments public advertisement sen king well you re really getting into the details of this i mean one of the problems is a company that s attacked they re reluctant to make it public because it might hurt their stock price or it might have some other effects but on the hand if they just pay that just is going to lead to future attacks we do have the capability to deal with these non state actors or these criminal networks but we need to know that they re on the attack and we need to then find out who they are and where they are and we can start to strike back but ellen it s very important ms nakashima how would we strike back sen king well we can strike back in ms nakashima go ahead sen king we can strike back in cyber we can disrupt their networks i mean that s a capability that we have we ve demonstrated that capability or it could be sanctions it could be we can identify where these people are who they are sometimes we can get right down to the names of the individuals at the laptops in st petersburg or belarus or são paulo whatever they are and then we can apply sanctions advertisement there are two important points here that we haven t really touched upon one is this has to be an international effort it can t be just the u s against whoever these bad guys are we have to establish what i call a cyber geneva convention we have to have international norms and standards so that if an attack occurs these people are pariahs on the world stage and they don t have any place to hide and that includes russia and china they shouldn t be tolerating this within their borders sooner or later they re going to be the victims of it that s number one it has an international face to it the other piece that we haven t touch on and i know you re talking to kevin mandia in a few minutes is the responsibility of the individual sitting at the desktop who clicks on a phishing email the federal government can do everything right not that we would or do but we can certainly try but even if we do everything right if somebody in a utility clicks on a phishing email and their credentials get to the bad guys we re sunk it sounds sort of mundane but part of this the big part of the solution to this is individual cyber hygiene on behalf of companies and i think companies if i was running a major utility for example i would be constantly testing my systems i would be hiring outside friendly hackers to show me where the vulnerabilities are and i d be sending my employees fake phishing emails to see who bites and if you bite too many times you re going to go find another place to work but this you know as i say we re talking about sort of these big national issues but it s also right prevention starts at the desktop advertisement ms nakashima let s turn to your cyber solarium commission one of its big recommendations which was adopted was to create a national cyber director and chris inglis who served with you on the commission was recently confirmed as the first ncd what should be first on his agenda sen king i think i hesitate to say because chris inglis is a very knowledgeable and capable guy and i m hesitant to tell him what he should be doing but i think one of the first things i would do would be to call a two or three day summit with all the cios within the federal government all the people dealing with cyber throughout the federal government to try to bring some coordination and cooperation across the federal all the federal agencies that s one of the problems and that s why we need it the national cyber director one of my mottos in business was i want one throat to choke i want somebody who is responsible where they can t say oh no that s somebody else that s dhs s problem that s not the fbi s problem or the defense department that would be meeting number one then the following week would be a meeting with what i call the sici industries the systemically important critical infrastructure the grid the pipeline telecommunications and get their top people in a room and talk about how we re going to work together and that s the role that i think the national cyber director has is essentially coordination and convening and chris is a great there could not have been a better person in the country in my opinion to be appointed to this position and i think that s the direction he s going to move in ms nakashima so chris is not the only senior white house cyber official as you know anne neuberger is the deputy national security advisor for cyber they both advise the president how should they avoid working at cross purposes how will they not get in each other s lane sen king well i think one of the positive aspects of both of those appointments is that these two people know each other they ve worked together in the past they re not rivals there s not a professional jealousy that i know of anne neuberger is immensely capable and i see them in complementary roles the cyber advisor on the national security council is a critical role in advising the president and the national security advisor by the way one of the reasons we wanted a presidential appointed senate confirmed national cyber director is that two years ago there was no cyber coordinator at the national security council john bolton abolished it when he was national security advisor three or four years ago cyber is too important to be up to the whim of a particular president or national security council chair and so that s one of the reasons the third person you didn t mention is jen easterly who is awaiting confirmation ms nakashima just going to mention her right sen king well she s awaiting confirmation as the head of cisa the cybersecurity infrastructure security agency at dhs and this is the triumpher these are the three top people and you know i don t want to sound like i m sucking up to the administration but these are the three best people i think could have been put in these positions ms nakashima well you mentioned jen easterly her nomination had been held up by politics in this case by a senator who wanted vladimir putin harris to visit the border and now that harris has been to the border senator scott said he s i think lifting the hold on the nomination do you know when this nomination will move and to what extent is dysfunction in congress making the u s more vulnerable in cyberspace sen king well chris was held up for chris inglis was held up for a while jen easterly has been held up and of course we re in recess now so she can t be confirmed i m assuming if the hold has been lifted she will be confirmed like the day we get back in a week a week and a half it clearly was not good to be without the leadership in these three in two of the three key positions but it looks like we now have a national cyber director in place and if you re the reporter you just reported to me that the hold may be lifted so i think that will happen very promptly after we get back ms nakashima yeah i wanted to just kind of press you on something i asked you a little earlier about the ransomware payments just quickly here do you think i know it s a difficult issue but just one do you think they should be banned sen king i don t see how you can say that to a private company i mean this is not something i thought deeply about but a private company has to protect themselves and i don t think it s a good idea because of course every time you pay you re rewarding bad conduct on the other hand to tell a company you just have to sit and have your critical data exfiltrated and published or destroyed or whatever i think that s a tough call i think the role ought to be more working with these companies and being tough with them about preventing it from happening in the first place i m much less sympathetic to a company that doesn t pay attention to cyber hygiene and then gets hit that s like you leave your door unlocked and the door wide open and then you complain to the police about getting robbed this is a partnership it has to be a relationship that the private sector has serious responsibilities and i don t think any of us realize how vulnerable we are kevin mandia may be the only guy in the country that knows how serious this vulnerability is we re all more vulnerable than we think whether it s in our phones or our internet router or in the network we really the joke the cliché around here is all of government this is an all of society effort this is the most serious international challenge we face today ms nakashima senator real quickly before we run out of time the tsa out of dhs is finally moving to regulate pipelines after years of doing this voluntary public private collaboration approach it seems like the government is finally starting to move in some areas to regulate cybersecurity standards at critical infrastructure number one do you support that idea do you think it s good and number two how do we do that without turning this into a sort of check the box cyber exercise sen king well number one i think it s too little too late i don t think tsa should have ever been in charge of cyber with the pipelines tsa is a transportation regulation agency and at one point they had like two people on cyber one or two people i mean it was just not adequate i m not sure they re the right people for this the ferc has a very strong relationship with the utilities the utilities are far ahead of the pipeline companies pipeline companies are trying to act like they re not involved in this they are they re critical infrastructure in new england 60 percent of our electricity comes from natural gas and all of it comes through pipelines if the pipelines go down the grid goes off i think we need to step up dramatically the regulation of these utilities and i consider the pipelines in that category the other big vulnerability ellen that nobody has talked about is water systems there s something like 50 000 separate water systems in this country and i would venture to say that very few of them have really adequate cyber protections particularly the smaller ones and that s something that we really have to get after in a serious way ms nakashima that s another area ripe for regulation you think that should be regulated sen king well it s ripe for regulation or it s ripe for some kind of what i think one way to deal with this is to have a friendly hacking group if you will within the federal government who can go to these companies and say look here s how vulnerable you are there s nothing like a skull and crossbones ms nakashima senator sen king coming up on the ceo s desktop to let him know how vulnerable they are ms nakashima we are running out of time before we let you go you are part of a bipartisan group of senators working on an infrastructure deal with the white house what do you think does the bill pass before the summer is out share this article share sen king i believe it will i think there s universal acknowledgement that we have to do infrastructure at least this part of it and there s a consensus on the major elements i think the deal that was negotiated with the white house is a good one now it s getting tangled up as you know with politics and do they do one by reconciliation and are they linked and all those kinds of things i certainly hope that doesn t bog this down we ought to go forward with the one that we have in hand which by the way includes broadband which to me is the essential infrastructure of the 21st century that s my bottom line if it has broadband in it then i think that s an important part of the package ms nakashima well we are out of time for this segment unfortunately but senator angus king thank you so much for joining us today i really enjoyed this discussion sen king ellen thank you and i know you are going to get some good information from kevin coming up and i hope he doesn t make a liar out of me ms nakashima we ll see ms nakashima thanks again senator sen king thank you ms nakashima stay with us and i ll be right back with fireeye ceo kevin mandia in a few minutes ms nakashima welcome back if you re just joining us i m ellen nakashima a national security reporter at the washington post my next guest is fireeye s ceo kevin mandia welcome to washington post live kevin mr mandia ellen good to see you thanks for having me ms nakashima great well let s dive right into the threat that s most in the news ransomware there s been loud u s government reaction to the colonial pipeline and jbs attacks with president biden warning putin about ransomware attacks darkside one of the threat actors seems to have well gone dark has the outrage and publicity resulted in any diminution or change in adversary behavior that you can detect or what trends are you seeing in this space mr mandia well that s a great question ellen and it s good to see we re trying to garner a national level attack all the ransomware attacks we re seeing right now as we sit here we re responding to well over 150 breaches at fireeye so from my vantage point there s still a bunch of ransomware actors they re acting with impunity they re acting without risk or repercussions and i just believe wherever money goes crime follows so if you can hack and make a lot of money off of it especially anonymously in safe harbors that are 10 000 miles away from where the crimes are being committed it s not going to stop do i think the next great ransomware attack is around the corner it might be i don t think there s a real change in behavior based on the last few months but i can tell you this ellen it was kind of interesting colonial pipeline jbs meat those happened right before the heads of state spoke and way in the back of my mind there s this little spider sense wondering was that intentional was that deliberate were those attacks allowed to happen just so that there s more collateral to put on the table and have a discussion i don t know i do know there s an increase in ransomware that s happened really kind of its evolution mirrors the adoption of anonymous currencies ms nakashima well let s move to that issue with the ransoms some experts said that companies should refuse to pay ransoms because it only encourages the cyber criminals and fuels their activity the government is reviewing the policy now what s your take and what percentage of your clients actually wind up paying a ransom mr mandia well a couple ways to address that first i think senator king was right in his assessment of that situation he said he hadn t given a lot of thought i don t know if it takes that much thought i ve been thinking about it for years you can t just ban the payment of ransomware in isolation you have to have a multipronged approach to how we as a nation or any nation really or even society is going to address ransomware and first and foremost you want to foster especially for critical infrastructure health and welfare of their systems the blocking and tackling necessary to raise the bar on security whether that s regulation standards or legislation critical infrastructure needs to have a different risk profile than other infrastructure you also need to impose risks or repercussions to the actors i think it is not fair nor will it have the desired outcomes to just say you can t pay the ransomware extortionist you can t pay them without imposing risk to those folks otherwise here s what you re doing we re all playing goalie in both the public and private sector trying to keep the ball from going in the goal and the person is getting unlimited penalty shots you got to impose risk or repercussions to the actors as well so you get better baseline for security and benchmarks you get risk and repercussion to the actors that are doing the ransomware or the nations harboring those actors i think there s a certain level of behavior that a nation has to follow to earn the right to be part of a global economy then i think the third thing is you address the ransomware payments and i ll leave this question with this remark no ceo wants to pay it it s not the default answer ever every time we deal with this the ceo who owns the incident and owns the response and is figuring out what s the best thing for the company to do has to do the risk calculus and they don t start with hey let s just pay it and it s not a flippant decision it is one based on the risk versus rewards of that particular breach and what s at stake ms nakashima what percentage of your clients actually wind up paying the ransom and what percentage therefore end up not having to because they ve covered mr mandia you know that s a great question and i ve asked that same question to our frontline responders i try to not know i hate to say it i don t want to be subpoenaed and have to go to the carpet saying here s who paid and here s who didn t and i don t always know the answers i have been in the room with folks who ve deliberated about it and everybody takes it very seriously i think the percentage is going down the estimate that i would have had maybe six months ago is around 40 percent but i think it s going down i think i m less than two months removed ellen from getting a phone call from a ceo right out of the gates the ceo said we ve got some encrypted systems he said the exact number and he said and we re not paying and that was his default position right from the get go i think that is the sentiment that people start with the vast majority of the time but again if you re a hospital and you got people in harm s way and you ve got health care machines that maybe aren t going to be predictably reliable i think you have a different risk calculus than a lot of other folks so bottom line i think the percent is going down i believe it is way less than half at this juncture and that trend will probably continue ms nakashima what s driving that trend down kevin the downwards trend mr mandia i think a couple of things ellen it s the work you do ahead of time right now if i m on a board or i m the ceo of a company the question i ve got from my it staff is what s the worst case scenario if we have a ransomware breakout and there s two things you try to do for every company out there you re already doing this and if you re not you need to first you start thinking about how do we reduce the blast radius how do we make sure if a ransomware outbreak occurs it has the least amount of impact and it doesn t impact our core assets our most critical assets people are thinking of reducing the blast radius with micro segmentation of their networks with making sure they have privileged account management that s very effective that really only works in pockets so you don t have one account that works on 100 000 machines you may have one account that has admin privileges for 60 machines and you rotate that account s credentials every six hours or so everybody has got to figure out how do you reduce the blast radius and then it s also ellen about redundancy or disaster recovery just like a hurricane you got to think of this ransomware as it s lights out on a bunch of machines i would recommend to every organization figure out your assets that matter by the criteria it could be customer the application the business process the people the geography whatever those systems are and get out in front of it saying are those machines secure how did we back up those assets are the backups secure and how fast can we get them back up and running should they get bricked somehow by being encrypted or some kind of physical disaster and that sort of resiliency drill not everybody can practice it all the time ellen but people have to think about it and the question every ceo should ask is how fast are we up and running should a ransomware outbreak hit these 10 systems or these 2 000 machines and the answer today could be i don t know and then the answer in about eight months could be maybe it s two days but over time maybe we get to it s three hours it s four hours and we can roll back to our state our known good state of an hour prior to the outbreak that s why i think you are seeing less people pay is we re reducing the target area and we re more resilient ms nakashima oh terrific you heard senator king say he was in favor of regulation he thought it was about time this is happening mr mandia right ms nakashima critical infrastructure do you agree and what specifically if you could be brief too about this but what specifically do you think the rules should look like to avoid not becoming the sort of check the box exercise mr mandia right ms nakashima that doesn t really improve cybersecurity mr mandia just so you know as a private sector ceo whenever you hear the term regulation you have to twitch and say no not that that s the default answer out of the gates but when you break it down here s the facts i think regulated industries ordinarily when they re regulated in regards to their cybersecurity risk probably are better defended and i think the risk profile for critical infrastructure probably needs to be different in cyberspace in a lot of industries if you re a restaurant maybe you don t need to have fort knox cybersecurity but if you re a utility or you heard the senator refer to all the different water utilities out there we ve got a whole bunch of industry in the private sector we have a lot of critical infrastructure that may be regulation can raise the sea level for their security programs you would like to see it not happen but at the end of the day if the private sector can t self regulate you may have to impose a risk profile from the government with some regulation best way to test it by the way don t make it a paper drill you heard the senator talk about having good hackers try to address risk i think the best way to get unvarnished truth is have potentially a federal agency or the private sector test network security run real attacks that are very realistic that could happen that are emulating the threat groups we re up against and just see how people do if you re a water utility and you re expected to withstand a cyber espionage attack well let s do a live fire drill and see how well you do about it and those exercises ellen are happening more and more you re seeing the energy come together they re doing their own drills the financial services do their own drills you ll probably see pipelines over time joining one of those isacs or joining some of those groups that are doing dry runs and simulations to see how they withstand the attacks and that s the only way to get truth shy of doing that if it s a paper drill well intentioned people will answer all the questions you ll think you re doing pretty well you may have raised the bar a little bit but at some point in time as a nation we have to harden our defenses by live fire drills ms nakashima okay moving to attribution for a moment you often hear government officials talk about difficult attribution is russia and china like to say as much in order to cast doubt on the u s government s assertions that they re behind certain hacking campaigns how difficult is attribution really and do you think the u s government would have reached the point of attributing to foreign governments as it does now without companies like fireeye and crowdstrike pushing them along mr mandia yeah i think attribution could be had many different ways i can tell you it s hard to pull the thread on every security incident we respond to and not every incident is a breach but when you have a security breach of impact and consequence and we start pulling the evidentiary threads good hackers can remain at least in the gray area for attribution i think we can get the nation that they re in the geography they re in but there s got to be other means to get attribution besides just following the evidence back you can follow bitcoin payments back as best as you can and maybe we can pierce anonymity that way i do know that even if you don t get it right even if you re not sure who gave the order whether they re government or just a lone actor there could be classification that this is a state level attack versus standard criminal based attack i think it s harder to discern the difference but i do think the label matters because it goes towards liability i go back ellen to anthem getting compromised it was a nation that compromised anthem but nobody did attribution and anthem had to take a constant onslaught of plaintiff lawsuits when in reality i believe it was people in uniform that compromised them meanwhile sony pictures gets compromised and the president did attribution at the time and said it was north korea that attribution goes a long way to assisting the victim companies into a recovery and helps deflate some of the plaintiff lawsuits that i don t think are warranted we don t want to establish the bar as a nation that every one of our companies that the washington post should stop the russian svr from breaking in because i think when a nation goes against a company the nation is going to win in cyberspace over time so we ve got to be careful and we got to figure out how to label these things appropriately because it will help the victims it will help insurance companies and it will actually help the nation in the long term we don t need perfect ms nakashima should the u s well so should the u s government be doing more to beat back these denials by states and to help these companies by doing more public attributions the way you re saying it happened with sony and helped sony mr mandia well i think all you need to do for me categorical attribution is good enough meaning it was a nation state that attacked ms nakashima i see mr mandia the victim company a and don t say the nation if it s pie in their face and it impacts other diplomatic efforts on your agenda but let people know maybe in a back room through a back tunnel hey we know this is you we find it unacceptable you got to have in my opinion here s the good news ellen i m not a diplomat i have the easier job of figuring out cybersecurity you know at the end of the day as diplomats i do believe there will be diplomatic solutions i do believe what we see in cyberspace in aggression on offense is directly tied to the geopolitical conditions it s absurd to think that geopolitical relationships won t impact cybersecurity i know they will for those folks that are chartered with diplomacy i think that is a valid tool and we can t just attack cyber defense with technology alone ms nakashima right mr mandia we do need diplomacy and you heard the senator say we need international cooperation he s exactly right you re going to see geopolitical alignment both for economy as well as security and those countries that are like minded are going to enforce certain rules of engagement ms nakashima the senator also said he thought it was a good idea to use cyber command to punch back overseas even at criminal actors for instance to disrupt ransomware rings what do you think of that idea and how effective do you think it will be mr mandia you know i thought about that a lot for 15 years or more and there s risks to it and obviously i like the idea and the senator alluded to this we have to have a doctrine on proportional response to cyberattacks we have to respond as a coordinated nation and now with the national cyber director you can see that we should be able to coordinate a little bit better and with the team that we have in the government now i think we will respond more holistically as a nation to attacks that hit the private sector or the public sector but i think that attacks in the cyber domain the only challenge that i d warn us against there is the asymmetry of it we re in the glass house in cyber that doesn t mean our defenses are bad what i m saying is we re in the expensive house if cyber domain is where we choose to go tit for tat in the challenge we ve got is we stand to lose more as a nation than other nations take for example north korea i doubt they rely on the internet and interconnectedness like the united states does so if we escalate in cyberspace against north korea and that forces their side to escalate the damage to our side is far greater and i ll leave you with this ellen if they re throwing rocks at our house and we re throwing rocks at their house they re destroying trillions of dollars in our house and we re destroying millions of dollars in their house so it s too asymmetrical i think it is a tool but i think you have other levers that you can pull as well to enforce better behavior in cyberspace ms nakashima with the pandemic over the last year many more people have been working from home how has that changed the attack surface for criminals in nation states and does going back to the office change any of that in your view mr mandia i don t think so i can tell you yes certainly when we all were in the room together one of the things that i think i can tell you this i don t feel like the threat has changed that much in 2020 other than ransomware grew i can say that by the end of 2020 we had the solarwinds implant and then the beginning of 2021 we had microsoft exchange zero days we had an accellion zero day we had zero days in sonicwall that s an escalation more zero days being armed by bad guys to take advantage of them but in 2020 the biggest change i saw is people were collaborating slightly less effectively than they used to at least at the 1a enterprises we talked with their security staff was in a close geographic nucleus they all spread out and i think some of the breaches that we saw were because there s a small delay in coordination and correspondence because they were all remote and when they re all in the same room together the security operations center can push their chair back or even if it s just it where security has a side car job they had the ability to communicate face to face i think it took all of the american society it took all societies a little bit of time to get used to the work from home but we ve got a good battle rhythm now and i feel the attacks haven t changed too much other than the zero days increasing in 2021 i think it was just our collaboration and the response that changed it we might have come down a notch you know our company was used to responding remotely but i m talking internal security teams their efficacy may have just dropped a tiny bit because they couldn t work as well or collaborate as well together ms nakashima gotcha okay well with so many folks working from home companies are making a big deal about ensuring that employees are educated about phishing attempts and malware et cetera kevin how do we ensure endpoint security mr mandia well you got to go to next gen endpoint you know people hate the whole concept of defense in depth but i think you really need it you have to have good network based countermeasures good endpoint based countermeasures you do want to train your users that doesn t put an end to people hacking themselves when you have great hackers targeting your average citizen the great hackers are going to beat them and dupe them every single time in the video we saw in between this ellen the concept of our children using our work machines our home machines is going to create vulnerabilities so we do have to think of upgrading the tech that we use and then testing how effective that tech is against known attacks i can tell you the security industry is getting better and so are these security postures of most organizations but the additional risk is we used to see all traffic to our networks because everybody was inside the four walls and that s just not the case anymore you ll hear people talk about zero trust that idea that every single resource you access you re not just building a moat around the castle anymore you re building a moat around every single system and you can feel that as people go more to the cloud more distributed workforce you can have more of a zero trust based environment ms nakashima well as always kevin the time just flew discussing with you so we have to close here but i just wanted to thank you very much for a great discussion and thank you everyone for joining us kevin mandia thanks again hope to see you soon mr mandia take care ellen thank you ms nakashima please come back and join washington post live tomorrow at 9 30 a m my colleague geoff edgers will interview kennedy center president deborah rutter i m ellen nakashima thanks for watching

noel king host in surfside fla rescue crews are going into day six of their efforts rachel martin host the results of the search thus far have been grim searchers found another body yesterday bringing the confirmed death toll to 11 there are still 150 people missing king npr s jasmine garsd is in miami beach good morning jasmine jasmine garsd byline good morning king on day six what is the mood like there garsd well there is a mix of optimism and hope you hear it all day long from local officials and search crews but at the same time you also sense that reality is setting in for some people as you say there are about 150 people that are quote unaccounted for complicating the search efforts are thunderstorms and stifling heat at a press conference last night chairman of the miami dade county commission jose pepe diaz thanked all of the rescue teams from around the state as well as crews from israel and mexico that have come to assist soundbite of archived recording jose pepe diaz these people that are coming to help our people out here have the hope to find people alive and that s something we cannot stop we have to continue with that hope garsd you know we should point out in the past earthquakes around the world search crews have pulled people out alive from buildings seven or eight days after the fact king and that may be what these rescue workers are counting on you spent time yesterday with some of them what was that like garsd well it was raining heavily when i met jonathan blinkey ph he s a supervisor with the urban search and rescue florida task force he s working nights here he still had grime under his nails he looked tired with glassy eyes it was his fifth day of work and he d been out and about for around 18 hours like most of his team he is more used to hurricane recovery this has been different jonathan blinkey one of the main things that stood out to me in the file was and is once if we found the victim ruins pretty much the whole site shuts down and we ll line our entire crew from all the different task forces there s like eight and pay their respects the whole pile will shut down all the equipment and it was pretty i guess you could say emotional garsd it s also physically grueling work most of the teams work 12 hours on 12 hours off i also sat with captain adam brown from hillsborough county fire rescue and jonathan hamilton from tampa fire rescue these crews specialize in removing the large concrete sections they use heavy lift equipment at disaster sites like this one hamilton says this is a bigger and more complex collapse than they typically get called in to handle king and is that why it s moving so slowly or appears to be moving so slowly garsd it s the magnitude of the disaster a collapsed building the size of this 12 story condominium is a race against time as they search for the missing captain brown says it s also a really delicate balancing act adam brown every time we move something a rock a boulder a piece of metal it changes the whole dynamic of the entire pile of rubble but it is a very unsafe thing to do you re talking about thousands of tons of material so we do have to take our time garsd the process isn t just physically slow but they re trying to be respectful blinkey says they re just not digging through rubble they re sifting through thousands of fragmented and shattered pieces of people s lives king and jasmine at the same time there is this big investigation into what exactly happened here the wall street journal is reporting new information from april of this year about the need for repairs to the champlain south tower what is that wall street journal reporting about garsd the president of the champlain south tower s condo association told residents in april their building was in desperate disrepair and urged them to pay the 15 million in assessment needed to fix structural problems florida buildings are required to be recertified for electrical and structural safety after 40 years that condo building had already begun the process king npr s jasmine garsd in miami beach thank you jasmine for your reporting we appreciate it garsd thank you soundbite of music king a federal judge dismissed two significant antitrust complaints against facebook martin yeah these suits were filed in december one by the federal government and one by around 40 of the country s attorneys general but this does not mean the complaints against facebook are now over king facebook we should note is one of npr s financial sponsors but we cover them like any other company and npr tech correspondent shannon bond has been following this story good morning shannon shannon bond byline hi noel king what was facebook sued over bond well the federal trade commission and 48 attorneys general had accused facebook of crushing its competition by buying up rivals like instagram and whatsapp and also suffocating other companies now facebook disputed these claims it said the government hadn t really shown any illegal behavior in its case so it asked the court to throw these suits out and yesterday the judge largely agreed with the company and tossed these complaints king why did the judge agree bond well you know facebook of course boasts more than 2 billion users around the world it s the world s largest social network but judge james boasberg he says the ftc needs to show more evidence to back up its claim that facebook has a monopoly under the law so he s given the ftc 30 days to file a new complaint addressing these concerns now when it came to the states case the judge said their accusations about instagram and whatsapp just came too late these deals were made years ago facebook bought instagram in 2012 whatsapp in 2014 now people i talked to said that s actually kind of surprising because back at the time the deals were made the states did not take a look at whether they were good or bad and yet here is the judge saying it s now just too late to object king yeah that s interesting so is facebook celebrating bond well it s definitely a temporary win a spokesman says the company is pleased that the court recognized the quote defects in the government s cases that says facebook competes fairly investors are also quite happy the stock rose after the news facebook s market cap passed 1 trillion for the first time very few companies can claim that kind of size king sure and so is the federal trade commission going to try again do you think bond the ftc and state ags they say they re reviewing the judge s opinions they re weighing their options i think we can expect the ftc to refile we could also see appeals of this dismissal and the ftc is not going to back down it just got a new chairwoman lina khan she s an outspoken critic of big tech i spoke to bill kovacic he s a former chair of the ftc and he told me he sees two paths forward for the agency bill kovacic one is we re going to keep our foot on the accelerator when it comes to bringing tough cases but the second path is to go to the congress and say see this is why you have to do your job to give us better tools bond and indeed right now the house judiciary committee did this big investigation into big tech and antitrust it s now advancing a bipartisan package of bills that seeks to really rein in the power of big tech you know curb what some of these companies can do and also beef up anti monopoly enforcement at agencies including the ftc and then you know just yesterday we heard from democrats as well as republicans on the committee making this case they are putting out statements saying you know what happened here this dismissal this difficulty in proving the case shows exactly why we need these kind of reforms king npr tech correspondent shannon bond thanks shannon bond thank you soundbite of music king all right so covid cases keep dropping here in the u s but in parts of the world with low vaccination rates there are now surges martin right so south america is now a hotspot in southeast asia indonesia is setting records for daily cases same thing in bangladesh where the government is planning a national lockdown later this week parts of australia and africa are facing lockdowns too many of these spikes are linked to the highly contagious delta variant king npr s jason beaubien is on the line with us from freetown the capital of sierra leone hi jason jason beaubien byline hey good morning king so during much of the pandemic there was kind of a mystery it looked like the continent of africa was not getting hit as hard as other parts of the world is that now changing beaubien yeah africa is solidly into a third wave of infections overall cases have surpassed the first wave that hit in the summer of 2020 and there was a second wave around the christmas new year s holiday of 2021 and this third wave now looks to be the worst yet and partly why this is so concerning is that compared to other regions very few people in africa are vaccinated it s roughly 1 fully immunized and you ve even got some countries that haven t started vaccinations at all king ok so grim numbers on vaccinations is this wave this surge happening all across the continent beaubien you know it s kind of interesting it s not every country on the continent that s reporting these surges some places still are recording very low numbers but you re seeing record breaking numbers of infections coming from every part of the continent you know where i am here in west africa sierra leone is at an all time high in terms of infections then you go all the way across the continent rwanda is also setting numbers that are off the charts for them you go down to southern africa zambia namibia they re being very hard hit and they re at all time highs and hospital beds are at 100 capacity south africa this week went into a very strict level four lockdown so the impact is being felt all across the continent king and is this being driven by the very contagious delta variant beaubien the delta variant is definitely part of what s driving the surges in african countries who says that testing done in uganda finds that 97 of the current cases there are the delta variant also samples out of the democratic republic of congo found that the majority are linked to the delta variant but testing for variants is really complicated and where i am here in sierra leone they don t even have the lab capacity to do this type of genome sequencing you know and it s similar in other countries on the continent so it s unknown whether it is this more transmissible delta variant that s driving these surges here king ok so if some of it is unknown and some of it is just lacking vaccinations and lab capacity we have the eternal question which is how much of a threat do these surges pose beaubien well you know this absolutely poses a threat to the overall efforts to contain this pandemic you know africa is a big continent you ve got more than a billion people here highly vulnerable to covid because of these low levels of vaccination and the more transmission that occurs here or anywhere else in the world the more variants that potentially can emerge variants that could even potentially evade some of the vaccines so long as you have these high levels of transmission occurring anywhere in the globe it continues to pose a threat to the rest of the world king npr s jason beaubien in freetown sierra leone thank you jason for your reporting we appreciate it bond you re welcome transcript provided by

rhondella and jennifer o tyou rhondella thanks a j delta plus is now spreading in 11 cntouries raising new concerns about the impact of t efficacy of covid vaccines jennifer here to answer your questions is dr rk siedner the epidemiolostgi within the department of infectious diseases at mass general hospital how is the dtael plus variant different and is it more dangerous so we re still learning about this ayt or delta plus variant it s definitely one the scientific community is watching but i think what peopleho suld know is that as long as vaccination rates are low pretty much anywhere in the world he t virus will continue to spread and these variants will continue to emer we know that the parent virus the delta variant itself is spreading in massachusetts it s being seen in 10 20 of cases currently it s clearly more contagious and appears to be more severe particularly in young people so for those among us who have yet to be vaccinated i think especially among the younger folks i think this is something you should be keeping your eyes on rhondella ok we know people who are immunocompromised may not get the same protection from covid vaccines a w study suggests a third dose could be the answer what do you think autbo that there have been studies and they ve been reassuri ng in this sty organ transplant recipients got a third vaccine there are going to be some specific populations who need more vaccines than the rest of us jennifer if the protection is better with a third dose at least in some cases why doesn t everyone get one or is it possible to have too much vaccines so the flip side here in the vast majority of us over 90 of us clearly the current vaccines are working we ve seen that in clinical trials and real world data these vaccines are preventing 90 100 of deaths although boosters may be needed or immunity wanes or now these vaccines are working not much advanta to get a third dose especially with global shortes of the vaccines rhondella this trshuday registration opens for the vaxmillions getawa y we re learning there s a weid rangofe reasons people don t get vaccinated hopefully information sessions like these will help address their concerns there are people who ve had a difficult time accessing vaccines for work schedules or child care schedus le it s great to see that vax bus or the other programs in massachusetts to address people who have had these challenges there are just some who need an extra nudge in massachusetts and other states therere a a million more nudges for those who need that hopefuyll this will get more people to cross the finish line jennifer the numbers tick up dr mark sied advertisement how to protect yourself against the covid 19 delta variant according to experts the world health organization just released new guidelines on masks and social distancing for fully vaccinated people share copy link copy countries around the world are entering new lockdowns as the coronavirus delta variant continues to spread australia bangladesh germany and south africa are the latest in a string of nations to put new restrictions in place to try and curb the strain per the washington post even as the u s population inches closer to halfway fully vaccinated the world health organization is urging people not to throw caution to the wind the delta variant has already shown different mutations and a faster transmission rate than other strains and experts are continually learning more about it the who has been tracking covid 19 variants since the beginning of the pandemic and the delta variant has been elevated into a variant of concern because it s a more contagious strain here s everything you need to know about the delta variant and how to protect yourself and others what is the delta variant the who recently said that delta is becoming the dominant covid 19 variant worldwide per cnbc while the strain was first found in india it has now spread to 80 countries and it targets the most vulnerable individuals mostly in places with low vaccination rates per the new york times there isn t enough research available yet to confirm reports that the delta variant may cause more severe symptoms but delta is potentially more lethal because it s more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals dr mike ryan executive director of the who s health emergencies program said last week what is the delta plus variant after the delta variant surfaced a newer delta plus variant was also identified in india not much is known about delta plus since researchers haven t had much time to study it yet but it s believed to also be highly transmissible like the delta variant per los angeles times dr george rutherford an epidemiologist at the university of california san francisco says it sounds like just another variant that s no better no worse than the regular delta variant and it s a little unclear why everybody s pushing on it i don t see that this is a big big problem right now dr monica gandhi an infectious diseases expert at uc san francisco told the los angeles times that i know it keeps on seeming like there s more and more and so it s certainly understandable why people are like why doesn t it stop once you tamp down transmission it really will stop accumulating these mutations that is the reason why we want to of course have global vaccine equity to stop transmission is the delta variant already in the u s yes the delta variant has already arrived in america in a white house briefing last tuesday dr anthony fauci from the national institute of health said that 20 6 of new coronavirus cases in the u s are due to the delta variant per npr the cdc continues to add to its interactive map of delta variant cases in the u s based on the cdc map delta is most present in central and western states including colorado montana wyoming and nebraska but california and texas aren t far behind per fast company the delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the u s to our attempt to eliminate covid 19 fauci said he also explained that the number of cases that are caused by the delta variant is doubling every two weeks per npr we have the tools so let s use them and crush the outbreak he said who is at risk for contracting the delta variant experts say that people in places with low covid 19 vaccination rates are among the most vulnerable populations there still are big portions of the country where the rates of vaccination are quite low said dr jeremy luban a virologist at the university of massachusetts medical school per npr this delta variant is increasing in frequency the speed at which it s increasing in frequency is greatest in those areas where vaccination rates are lowest justin lessler an epidemiologist at johns hopkins university says experts are keeping an eye on the delta variant for the most part it s a moderate resurgence he said per npr we re not having massive epidemics at a national level but we have this kind of continuation of the virus just sticking around and keeping us on our toes and in specific places there could be substantial epidemics still what new guidelines have the who released about the delta variant on friday the who strongly advised fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks social distance six feet apart and practice other covid 19 safety measures per cnbc dr mariangela simao is the who assistant director general for access to medicines and health products during a news briefing she said that fully vaccinated people should continue to be cautious people cannot feel safe just because they had the two doses she said they still need to protect themselves she added that the vaccine alone won t stop community transmission people need to continue to use masks consistently be in ventilated spaced hand hygiene the physical distance avoid crowding this still continues to be extremely important even if you re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing per cnbc does the coronavirus vaccine protect against the delta variant yes dr rochelle walensky the director of the centers for disease control and prevention says that covid 19 vaccines do protect against the delta variant we know our vaccines work against this variant she said per npr however this variant represents a set of mutations that could lead to future mutations that evade our vaccines and that s why it s more important than ever to get vaccinated now to stop the chain of infection the chain of mutations that could lead to a more dangerous variant a new study found that the moderna vaccine did produce neutralizing antibodies for the delta variant plus a few others per cnbc however it s important to note that the study was small and the data hasn t been peer reviewed yet can i still get covid 19 if i m fully vaccinated yes but the chances are very small any case contracted after an individual has already been fully vaccinated is considered a breakthrough case and some delta cases have already been labeled breakthrough cases according to the wall street journal breakthrough cases are to be expected because the vaccines aren t 100 foolproof against covid 19 says professor ran balicer the chief innovation officer for clalit israel s largest health management organization the cdc stopped tracking all breakthrough cases back in may but they aren t as serious as they might sound if you are fully vaccinated you have a lot of protection l a county public health director barbara ferrer told the los angeles times and for the very small numbers of people that may end up in fact with a breakthrough vaccination case they really did not have serious illness dr fauci seconded that delta breakthrough cases tend to be less serious importantly the protection against severe disease resulting in hospitalization and death is over 90 93 94 so if you are vaccinated you re going to be protected he said in an interview with npr for more information the who recently posted a q a session about the impacts covid 19 variants may have on vaccines effectiveness on its instagram will i need a vaccine booster shot possibly some experts are beginning to consider vaccine booster shots as one defense against the delta variant per nasdaq they re studying whether people who received johnson johnson s one dose vaccine might need booster shots of the pfizer biontech or moderna mrna based vaccines in order to protect themselves a few experts have already gotten booster shots just to be safe even though only preliminary data exists on whether combining different vaccines is safe and effective dr peter hotez from baylor college of medicine tweeted that getting a j j dose on top of a pfizer or moderna dose could offer better protection but further guidance was necessary in the phase 1 2 data two doses of j j gave higher virus neutralizing antibodies than a single dose and therefore might be better and broader protection against variants hotez wrote or a single dose j j followed by mrna but we need data and cdc fda guidance johnson johnson said it is currently testing whether people s immune response from its vaccine could fight back against the delta variant but no data is available yet per nasdaq
for senior citizens colorado springs dearth of affordable housing has become another frustrating cog in the wheel of aging that seems to spin life backward many seniors live on fixed incomes and don t drive anymore so are particularly vulnerable to rising rents said steve posey housing and urban development manager for colorado springs they re often in a position of having to make difficult choices between paying the rent buying food and being able to afford medications he said to make a dent in the increasing need silver key senior services is moving ahead with plans to build a new apartment complex adjacent to its headquarters at 1605 s murray blvd in southeast colorado springs said jason deabueno president and ceo of silver key the level of stock of opportunities for seniors is so low right now in our community and we know this doesn t solve the entire need but we hope this is a start for many things to come to provide options in colorado springs he said the nonprofit organization that provides a host of programs and assistance for seniors is preparing to submit an application to the colorado housing and finance authority for low income housing tax credits to help fund construction deabueno said silver key also has been awarded a 50 000 pre development loan from the pikes peak real estate foundation for consultation on the application he said with costs of construction materials and supplies rising exponentially in recent months an initial 70 unit complex costing 12 million to build has been scaled back to 50 to 60 units at a price to be determined deabueno said if all plays out construction will begin next spring although plans are not solidified deabueno said an estimated 70 of the units would be reserved for tenants who have an income of 30 or less of colorado springs median which would amount to about 19 500 annually the remaining apartments would be leased to renters who earn between 40 and 60 of the area s median household income he said featured local savings the apartment complex will be built to the northeast of the organization s offices on 3 acres of vacant land silver key purchased the site and the office building in 2015 for about 2 million according to property records the location will enable silver key to easily provide other services for tenants available from its headquarters next door deabueno said such as meals a food pantry transportation legal aid mental health assistance a thrift store and other resources in fielding requests for assistance options for senior housing is one of the top concerns deabueno said we ve had a housing navigator for several years and the lion s share of calls is challenges around affordable housing and utilities assistance he said local waiting lists for affordable housing units can be several years long he said as a result sharing housing with roommates or relatives has become more popular locally deabueno said some seniors have relocated to the suburbs and plains where costs are lower and others have taken to living in their cars or shelters because they don t have enough money for a security deposit and aren t able to afford rent he said there are not enough places for immediate needs for seniors deabueno said and we know unstable housing increases the mortality rate with not only economic and social impacts but also functional and health impacts while the venture represents silver key s first housing project the organization has experience in the market deabueno said silver key has provided governance over senior heritage plaza in golf acres a city managed department of housing and transportation apartment complex since the 1980s the sooner the new apartments can get off the ground the better the city s posey said the silver key project will help fill a critical need for affordable housing for seniors in colorado springs and is well aligned with mayor john suthers goal to build or preserve 1 000 units of affordable housing each year posey said the proposed apartment building also is a great example of a well established local nonprofit taking steps to expand its mission into housing

rhondella and jennifer o tyou rhondella thanks a j delta plus is now spreading in 11 cntouries raising new concerns about the impact of t efficacy of covid vaccines jennifer here to answer your questions is dr rk siedner the epidemiolostgi within the department of infectious diseases at mass general hospital how is the dtael plus variant different and is it more dangerous so we re still learning about this ayt or delta plus variant it s definitely one the scientific community is watching but i think what peopleho suld know is that as long as vaccination rates are low pretty much anywhere in the world he t virus will continue to spread and these variants will continue to emer we know that the parent virus the delta variant itself is spreading in massachusetts it s being seen in 10 20 of cases currently it s clearly more contagious and appears to be more severe particularly in young people so for those among us who have yet to be vaccinated i think especially among the younger folks i think this is something you should be keeping your eyes on rhondella ok we know people who are immunocompromised may not get the same protection from covid vaccines a w study suggests a third dose could be the answer what do you think autbo that there have been studies and they ve been reassuri ng in this sty organ transplant recipients got a third vaccine there are going to be some specific populations who need more vaccines than the rest of us jennifer if the protection is better with a third dose at least in some cases why doesn t everyone get one or is it possible to have too much vaccines so the flip side here in the vast majority of us over 90 of us clearly the current vaccines are working we ve seen that in clinical trials and real world data these vaccines are preventing 90 100 of deaths although boosters may be needed or immunity wanes or now these vaccines are working not much advanta to get a third dose especially with global shortes of the vaccines rhondella this trshuday registration opens for the vaxmillions getawa y we re learning there s a weid rangofe reasons people don t get vaccinated hopefully information sessions like these will help address their concerns there are people who ve had a difficult time accessing vaccines for work schedules or child care schedus le it s great to see that vax bus or the other programs in massachusetts to address people who have had these challenges there are just some who need an extra nudge in massachusetts and other states therere a a million more nudges for those who need that hopefuyll this will get more people to cross the finish line jennifer the numbers tick up dr mark sied advertisement how to protect yourself against the covid 19 delta variant according to experts the world health organization just released new guidelines on masks and social distancing for fully vaccinated people share copy link copy countries around the world are entering new lockdowns as the coronavirus delta variant continues to spread australia bangladesh germany and south africa are the latest in a string of nations to put new restrictions in place to try and curb the strain per the washington post even as the u s population inches closer to halfway fully vaccinated the world health organization is urging people not to throw caution to the wind the delta variant has already shown different mutations and a faster transmission rate than other strains and experts are continually learning more about it the who has been tracking covid 19 variants since the beginning of the pandemic and the delta variant has been elevated into a variant of concern because it s a more contagious strain here s everything you need to know about the delta variant and how to protect yourself and others what is the delta variant the who recently said that delta is becoming the dominant covid 19 variant worldwide per cnbc while the strain was first found in india it has now spread to 80 countries and it targets the most vulnerable individuals mostly in places with low vaccination rates per the new york times there isn t enough research available yet to confirm reports that the delta variant may cause more severe symptoms but delta is potentially more lethal because it s more efficient in the way it transmits between humans and it will eventually find those vulnerable individuals dr mike ryan executive director of the who s health emergencies program said last week what is the delta plus variant after the delta variant surfaced a newer delta plus variant was also identified in india not much is known about delta plus since researchers haven t had much time to study it yet but it s believed to also be highly transmissible like the delta variant per los angeles times dr george rutherford an epidemiologist at the university of california san francisco says it sounds like just another variant that s no better no worse than the regular delta variant and it s a little unclear why everybody s pushing on it i don t see that this is a big big problem right now dr monica gandhi an infectious diseases expert at uc san francisco told the los angeles times that i know it keeps on seeming like there s more and more and so it s certainly understandable why people are like why doesn t it stop once you tamp down transmission it really will stop accumulating these mutations that is the reason why we want to of course have global vaccine equity to stop transmission is the delta variant already in the u s yes the delta variant has already arrived in america in a white house briefing last tuesday dr anthony fauci from the national institute of health said that 20 6 of new coronavirus cases in the u s are due to the delta variant per npr the cdc continues to add to its interactive map of delta variant cases in the u s based on the cdc map delta is most present in central and western states including colorado montana wyoming and nebraska but california and texas aren t far behind per fast company the delta variant is currently the greatest threat in the u s to our attempt to eliminate covid 19 fauci said he also explained that the number of cases that are caused by the delta variant is doubling every two weeks per npr we have the tools so let s use them and crush the outbreak he said who is at risk for contracting the delta variant experts say that people in places with low covid 19 vaccination rates are among the most vulnerable populations there still are big portions of the country where the rates of vaccination are quite low said dr jeremy luban a virologist at the university of massachusetts medical school per npr this delta variant is increasing in frequency the speed at which it s increasing in frequency is greatest in those areas where vaccination rates are lowest justin lessler an epidemiologist at johns hopkins university says experts are keeping an eye on the delta variant for the most part it s a moderate resurgence he said per npr we re not having massive epidemics at a national level but we have this kind of continuation of the virus just sticking around and keeping us on our toes and in specific places there could be substantial epidemics still what new guidelines have the who released about the delta variant on friday the who strongly advised fully vaccinated people to continue wearing masks social distance six feet apart and practice other covid 19 safety measures per cnbc dr mariangela simao is the who assistant director general for access to medicines and health products during a news briefing she said that fully vaccinated people should continue to be cautious people cannot feel safe just because they had the two doses she said they still need to protect themselves she added that the vaccine alone won t stop community transmission people need to continue to use masks consistently be in ventilated spaced hand hygiene the physical distance avoid crowding this still continues to be extremely important even if you re vaccinated when you have a community transmission ongoing per cnbc does the coronavirus vaccine protect against the delta variant yes dr rochelle walensky the director of the centers for disease control and prevention says that covid 19 vaccines do protect against the delta variant we know our vaccines work against this variant she said per npr however this variant represents a set of mutations that could lead to future mutations that evade our vaccines and that s why it s more important than ever to get vaccinated now to stop the chain of infection the chain of mutations that could lead to a more dangerous variant a new study found that the moderna vaccine did produce neutralizing antibodies for the delta variant plus a few others per cnbc however it s important to note that the study was small and the data hasn t been peer reviewed yet can i still get covid 19 if i m fully vaccinated yes but the chances are very small any case contracted after an individual has already been fully vaccinated is considered a breakthrough case and some delta cases have already been labeled breakthrough cases according to the wall street journal breakthrough cases are to be expected because the vaccines aren t 100 foolproof against covid 19 says professor ran balicer the chief innovation officer for clalit israel s largest health management organization the cdc stopped tracking all breakthrough cases back in may but they aren t as serious as they might sound if you are fully vaccinated you have a lot of protection l a county public health director barbara ferrer told the los angeles times and for the very small numbers of people that may end up in fact with a breakthrough vaccination case they really did not have serious illness dr fauci seconded that delta breakthrough cases tend to be less serious importantly the protection against severe disease resulting in hospitalization and death is over 90 93 94 so if you are vaccinated you re going to be protected he said in an interview with npr for more information the who recently posted a q a session about the impacts covid 19 variants may have on vaccines effectiveness on its instagram will i need a vaccine booster shot possibly some experts are beginning to consider vaccine booster shots as one defense against the delta variant per nasdaq they re studying whether people who received johnson johnson s one dose vaccine might need booster shots of the pfizer biontech or moderna mrna based vaccines in order to protect themselves a few experts have already gotten booster shots just to be safe even though only preliminary data exists on whether combining different vaccines is safe and effective dr peter hotez from baylor college of medicine tweeted that getting a j j dose on top of a pfizer or moderna dose could offer better protection but further guidance was necessary in the phase 1 2 data two doses of j j gave higher virus neutralizing antibodies than a single dose and

norwich city leaders and finance officials presented a plan tuesday that would fully fund the city s unfunded pension obligation by bonding the entire estimated 144 million at current low interest rates saving an estimated 43 million over 30 years members of the city council board of education board of public utilities commissioners and personnel and pension board listened as finance and bonding experts explained the plan tuesday it would need voter approval in a november referendum and approval by the state treasurer and office of policy and management this could really be a game changer in the way the city funds its annual pension obligations city manager john salomone said he said the city could take advantage of the extraordinarily low interest rates to finance the plan the city would purchase an estimated 144 million in pension obligation bonds pob which are taxable municipal bonds and use the revenue to fully fund the estimated unfunded portion of the city s pension liability officials estimated norwich could purchase the bonds at a 3 interest rate then instead of the city paying rising annual amounts into the pension fund from the city school and norwich public utilities operating budgets they would pay the current year s pension obligations for active employees and debt service on the pob the move essentially replaces one liability with another city comptroller josh pothier said but with the historically low interest rates the city expects the bond debt payments to save an estimated 43 million over 30 years in this year s operating budget the city is paying 13 7 million into the pension fund the historically low interest rates are much to blame for the rising unfunded pension despite negotiations with unions to raise pension contributions and reduce retiree pension benefits the fund has lost interest income the interest income on a typical pension portfolio has fallen from 8 25 to about 5 with no changes in investments becky sielman consulting actuary for milliman inc said each 1 of interest income lost translates to 10 of unfunded pension liability she said sielman recommended norwich use 6 25 in pension investment income sielman credited pothier for proposing a payment stabilization mechanism for the norwich pension fund a reserve fund would be created so that in years when pension interest income drops below a certain point the reserve fund could replenish at least part of the gap if the pension fund earns more than expected a portion of the city s annual pension payment could go into the reserve fund if the city goes forward with the plan the pension bonds would be issued in february the 13 7 million the city has budgeted this year for the pension contribution would be used to start the pension reserve fund pothier said city council president pro tempore mark bettencourt asked about risk factors in the models sielman said the actuaries and bonding experts analyzed 10 000 financial scenarios over the next 30 years projecting both positive and negative extremes in the investment market in 80 of the scenarios the city came out with savings with the pob john stafstrom jr bond counsel for pullman comley llc said several connecticut cities have issued pension obligation bonds including bridgeport waterbury and most recently west hartford which issued its pension bond monday he said the state review would ensure the norwich plan is financially sound with realistic projected interest income and well structured bonds norwich s bonds would be invested over a three to five year period rather than immediately putting all the money into the stock market thus avoiding hitting a potential short term market slide stafstrom said c bessette theday com

a trans south asian poetry collective though she was neither trans nor a poet she stockpiled oil paints and turned stray sheets of paper into canvases mostly for paintings of silhouettes resembling her younger self me or my brother she also constructed woodblocks stamps and art books it seemed as if she would continue her weekend artisanship until retirement at which point she could spend her days in front of an easel on a ridge with late sunlight casting a golden hue on the canvas but something changed in barack obama s second term mom complained more often about microaggressions at work and in public about white people whom she barely knew claiming to be good friends and about white californians who paraded their progressivism while inadvertently uttering antiblack sentiments in the same breath they had bumper stickers that said black lives matter in her account while advocating for racist housing policies that displaced people of color in oakland and san francisco california liberalism she once wrote me in an email hides super conservatism underneath a veneer of political correctness she spoke of her neighbor a british expat who told her the only jamaicans he d ever met were british bus drivers who smiled a lot she sent me several emails each week about politics the subject of one read bwoy colonialism is a bitch another read wow u kno that fdr was a real fukka she sent these critical emails from her government address i asked her to stop fearing it would cost her her job she said she didn t care after donald trump s election mom grew even more vocal about her anger but she also began to talk about something else home she called to share long forgotten stories often told in one breath about growing up on a coffee farm in new monklands jamaica did i know that after grandma moved to the states and left them with her stepfather she and her sister spent many friday nights in muck turning over rocks and catching janga crayfish to cook on an open fire for dinner while their stepfather drank at the rum bar no i hadn t heard that one what about the time her sister auntie peaches named and befriended a goat that the family later slaughtered and served for dinner had i heard about her bawling at dinner that one was new to me too did she ever tell me about how grandma had warned her not to hug the newborn chicks but when she saw them in the coop they were too cute to resist and so she picked one up and drew it close and squeezed until she felt something wet on her feet suddenly realizing that she d popped the chick like a balloon its innards tumbling out that story i did know since she shared it every christmas dinner mom s art also turned to stories of home she began researching our ancestry reaching as far back as barrett mclean who was born in 1828 she compiled a family tree into a hundred page long art book full of woodblock prints photocopied birth certificates and jamaican nursery rhymes she sent the book to me she said so that i would not be confused when she spoke about our family history and perhaps so that i would not forget our ancestors she also made a shorter book replete with handmade stamps and stories of her sliding down a grassy hill past yellow tipped birds and spotted cows she sent that book to auntie peaches who responded with stories of catching lizards and digging for potatoes her research forged winding paths through several of the islands regions through family name changes and two centuries all of it leading to her childhood it was as if history ended on a farm in a remote corner of the island none of her stories was happy they blended the everyday traumas of farm children with histories of enslavement on the black side of our family and indenture on the indian side of our family layered over with the uncertainty of a country taking its first steps after independence even if she rarely spoke of life after she left the farm i knew that her own childhood was cut short when she and auntie peaches were sent to live with a relative of one of grandma s friends who beat them the optimism of jamaican independence meanwhile as david scott has memorably written now looks tragic from the contemporary perspective the burgeoning nation s dreams of economic equality were undermined by widespread poverty and the visions of safety that came with nationhood were replaced with a murder rate that rose to the world s highest in the late 2000s the future both hers and the country s cast a dark pall on mom s tales of fishing in the morant river but these qualms about what came after those years were my problem when she spoke about her youth her words flowed quickly she seemed transported to a place beyond reproach so it wasn t a surprise when she started talking about returning i thought the decision was risky if not irresponsible in california she had work if she left how would she feed herself or pay her rent but whenever i raised this concern she said she would figure it out and told me to stop fretting these conversations often reminded me of the times she d tell me boy you a boy and you no man yet besides she d say she d moved without work before since 1992 she had lived in no fewer than six places in two different countries including three states in america her itinerancy made me wonder what she was looking for most of her complaints about the places we lived were about the racism and sexism she experienced she may have thought she would find freedom from antiblackness if not freedom from misogyny in a majority black country like jamaica that seemed unlikely but i tried to let go of my anxieties no matter how much i worried she would do as she pleased beyond that when she spoke about home she reveled in the idea of wading in rivers and sharing mountain landscapes with animals which never happened on her hikes in california so maybe it was the natural world that lured her back there may also have been something else she wanted to recover the deeper stability in belonging to and understanding a people and a terrain i can t say for certain but i wanted her to find a place where she felt like she could live the rest of her life in comfort so despite my fear that she would run out of money i did my best to trust her mom planned to stay at the home of one of her best friends when we lived in jamaica auntie h a former senior lecturer at the university of the west indies who had moved to canada after her daughter grew up auntie h owned a home in silver sands a gated resort community in trelawny a parish on the north side of the island named for the eighteenth century british governor of jamaica william trelawny the parish contains much of the cockpit country an interior mountainous region that was home to the leeward maroons a group of largely black people who fled slavery created new settlements away from british slaveholders surveillance and fought several wars against the british the parish was also home to almost one hundred sugar plantations that fed into the triangular trade wherein enslaved africans were brought to the colonies to cultivate sugar and other goods sold in europe the profits from which were then used to purchase more enslaved people the tension in this history slavery in jamaica was defined by high death rates yet marronage in the region has made it a beacon of hope in academic black studies intrigued mom she wanted to visit anyone and any place that could teach her about trelawny the pandemic changed her plans jamaica s response to covid 19 kept infections and deaths low by december only 258 of the island s nearly three million people had succumbed to the disease about 6 500 fewer than comparably sized chicago but the country s success had required heightened restrictions as a result mom was not sure when she would be able to enter the country and even if she did the government s understandable commendable regulations ensured that she wouldn t go rafting with a guide or tour maroon land or visit historical archives in light of all this i assumed mom would postpone her plans indefinitely but in the summer of 2020 she put in her two weeks notice renewed her passport and bought a plane ticket on september 13 she got tested for covid two days later she was tested again both tests came back negative she boarded her flight to jamaica on the seventeenth what she found was predictable yet it still surprised her after landing in montego bay she waited in customs with a mask on when she finally approached the officer she handed him her passport rodriques he remarked big name that he told her to quarantine for two weeks and instructed her to download an app that would track her location and her covid status she hired a car east to trelawny as she traveled she saw a red and white helicopter stationed on a flat plane of bright green grass its propellers cutting a sharp line against the pale blue sky to its right just beyond two lushly canopied trees and a line of dark green bushes a sandy colored roof peeked out day one she wrote to me and she knew she could never live here again the helicopter was how wealthy people traveled while their gardeners and other laborers maintained the property she asked how much i thought they paid their employees i wondered what the exchange rate was but didn t bother to look it up the question made her point clearly enough shortly thereafter mom arrived at the house alone auntie h was recovering from eye surgery which made it hard to travel and the pandemic had largely closed canada s borders nonetheless she graciously let mom stay at her place rent free mom and i didn t have the kind of relationship where i could have asked what the absence felt like and received an answer other than i m fine still i assume showing up without her friend knowing that she would have to self isolate for two weeks came with the quiet pang that accompanies seeing the emptiness of a home one is leaving for the last time that it may have even come with fear whatever she felt she was not unaccompanied for long just hours after she got in a health officer showed up to ensure she was indeed quarantining and staying put then she heard the news from a passerby something had happened to d k duncan a politician born to relative poverty in 1940 who had risen through the ranks to become the minister of national mobilization and human resource development under the socialist leaning prime minister michael manley in 1977 as his son keith said of his work he was a champion of poor black jamaicans and equal rights in one of jamaica s most radical periods helping to usher in nationalized health care paid maternity leave and more and as mom learned he had died at the age of eighty from complications related to covid 19 his passing must have felt like an unnecessary reminder that the midcentury s anticolonial fervor and the 1970s radical dreams were both long gone in trelawny mom was surprised by the heat having spent the last decade in the bay area she was used to less humidity and breezes blowing even on ninety degree days the heat never lasting past dusk jamaica on the other hand was an oven that had been preheating since march when she awoke around 5 30 in the morning the thermometer often read ninety two degrees and when she went to bed around 8 30 at night it was still above ninety bound inside she left the doors open to let salty breezes enter with the sound of the distant sea mosquitoes pockmarked her body with bites the occasional cat wandered in she also saw mouse droppings but the cats didn t seem to help once while she was in the living room she heard shredding and tearing somewhere else in the house she followed the sound to the kitchen and there saw a mongoose a long tan ferret like creature trying to get into her garbage upon seeing her it scurried out i assume mom envied its freedom unable to leave mom found life more expensive and cumbersome than she d expected she paid a taxi driver to buy her groceries and he understandably hiked up the prices to account for his labor she bought produce from an older man who passed by the property twice a week his sweet potatoes she said were reasonably priced but the fruits were expensive i suspect they were worth the cost since leaving jamaica i have not had a single mango that compares to those on the island nor have i been able to find good breadfruit or any fresh ackee all the while the local health officer called every few days to ensure that she had not broken quarantine she hadn t but that was getting harder to do as the days wore on still she found ways to pass the time she read she made a makeshift greenhouse by covering planters with plastic bags she birdwatched from the backyard she sent me a blue ink drawing mostly contours with the occasional curve to mark a feather of a heron standing by a pool sketched into the title page of modern nature the journals of derek jarman 1989 1990 you should hear the night herons she texted she thought they lived on the roof and came down in the evening to look at their reflections in the pool it was dangerous to be around when they descended they guarded their territory the pool viciously she also sent a phone recording of birdsong over a staticky rustling perhaps waves storming the shore or the wind jostling leafy branches a bird emitted cries in twos its trilling voice softening then cutting through the air again in time another faraway bird responded i hoped they provided some solace and if not a vision of days to come a reminder that somewhere living things communed i wondered if she would remain attentive to their songs once she could leave the house or if she would tune them out relegating them to background noise finally at the end of september her quarantine ended she had long been looking forward to this day when she could go to the grocery store to stock up on whatever was available at market prices but the fridge had broken she could only buy nonperishables as she waited on the mechanics to receive the part to fix it they had been waiting for several days already and it looked like it would take several more welcome to the 3rd world she texted she didn t know when she would have a fridge again a few weeks after that first encounter another mongoose wandered into the house this time when mom walked into the kitchen the animal stayed put she didn t know what to do she couldn t pick it up mongooses are essentially land otters in that they appear to be cute but are in fact apex predators with very sharp teeth no matter what noise she made it didn t budge eventually she backed away went to the next room and emailed me asking how to get a mongoose out of the house i had no idea if i were on the island i would have come over though i was just as likely to get hurt as she was with a sea between us i couldn t do anything even more alarming she was emailing while the animal was still there part of me was afraid that she wasn t taking the threat seriously our family had a long history of foolhardiness in the face of danger once when the police locked down my septuagenarian grandmother s block in flatbush and positioned snipers on roofs for a raid grandma snuck around to the back entrance to get into her building i suggested mom call animal control she didn t respond when she awoke there were no new mouse droppings she suspected the mongoose had killed the mice by the afternoon it sounded as if she had begun to grown fond of it same way it find its way in she wrote it can find its way out at this point i grew even more worried not only had she gone to sleep with a predator in the home but now it seemed that she was considering living with it i told her she had to get rid of it mongooses were dangerous she responded that she knew mongooses were dangerous they killed her chickens in new monklands but she had not seen the mongoose since it must have left if it had while the doors were closed that meant there was a hole in the house somewhere the mongoose was gone for now but others might come back what if they didn t let mom go so easily the ludicrousness of a near sixty year old woman not mongoose proofing her home so frustrated me that i couldn t help but complain to my friends that she was being unreasonable to which they often responded that the animal might not be so bad one said we were encroaching on its home it was just reclaiming its territory she was well within her rights to kick it out i argued and the more i spoke about it the more i raised my voice the more i began to suspect that my passion was motivated in part by uncertainty i knew my mother and the mongoose couldn t cohabitate but i didn t know who had the stronger claim to auntie h s house neither of us neither the mongoose nor my family were native to the land the british brought our ancestors from africa and india through slavery and indenture and they brought the mongooses from india to hunt rats given the mongoose s overpopulation it was likely that animal control would kill it i started to pity the thing thankfully the mongoose had disappeared i thought about how mom considered any intention of fully separating oneself from nature through a home for instance likely to fail one could never really keep the mongooses or the mosquitoes or the cats or the birds out not completely even if she wasn t paying attention even if she did not notice the birds kept singing though the animals of the island would not leave her alone she was isolated from the people she loved and it took some effort to conjure them at one point she began painting an abstract landscape of yellow dunes bordering the sea a roughly shaded blue sky where the sky met the shore two silhouetted boys sprouted from the sand their bodies emerging at about the waist one of them had a few facial features drawn in a few lines to suggest a shirt standing half a head taller than the other he reminded me of my brother the other boy shaded in red had no features or shirt i suspected he was me and that the painting reflected mom s sense that she didn t quite know me that was my fault after i left for college i threw myself into my job nightlife and friends all while missing her calls and neglecting to return them while she came to know my brother who lived with her as an adult she knew little of the adult i had become the distance didn t make it easier for us to communicate two weeks after the mongoose incident mom asked when i was coming to visit it would be good for my writing career she said to train my eye on the landscape she could have said that she wanted to see me but instead she justified our reunion with the carrot of professional success even during my teenage years i made it clear that school was my first priority using homework and the prospect of leaving poverty going to college and getting the hell out of florida in order to be left alone unsurprisingly my response to her question about when i would visit jamaica avoided sincerity i wrote that i wasn t sure if i could come i didn t want to quarantine and we didn t know what the covid rates would be even though it was possible to fly and not contract the disease the thought of traveling felt irresponsible i didn t want to be the cause of an outbreak in jamaica and i certainly didn t want to kill my mother but not visiting made me worry about our relationship especially on her birthday when she turned fifty nine without anyone to celebrate with i tried reaching her through whatsapp but she didn t answer i tried again with no luck i texted waited stressed finally after what seemed like a painfully long time she texted back using someone else s wi fi to let me know that the internet in her house was out she was waiting on the repairmen but it was friday and they wouldn t be back to work until monday earliest i never reached her on the phone that day now that she was on the other side of a border which made calling her on my cell difficult and where fears of spreading a disease prohibited me from traveling there she seemed even farther away than she was when she was in california even if jamaica was miles closer separated from her friends and family mom dove into the history of the region s people at one point she sent me a picture of rum jetty a six bedroom beachfront home in silver sands it had once been a warehouse for the sugar and rum cultivated by enslaved people there her picture framed the home as if approached from the ocean a long squat cement rectangle topped by a series of pyramids austere and imposing the house was a part of jamaica s history of slavery mom wrote as was the jetty for which the compound was named a spit of concrete with a veranda at its end i feel those spirits when i walk out there she wrote and the warehouse turned resort house makes me sad every time i look at it what spirits followed mom as she wandered the island she once called home what did she feel now that she was a tourist standing above the sea her ancestors crossed by way of the middle passage she was not in the picture itself but i couldn t help but see her walking down that jetty barely more visible than the spirits themselves almost translucent sure to fade enough to match the luster of ghosts bobbing on the tide like sea foam in late fall mom emailed i belong she had been waiting for the early october rains of her childhood at the foot of the blue mountains the ones she said blanketed the sky every year on her birthday in the states whenever it failed to rain on that day she would say she felt out of place the same seemed to be true of her birthday that year in jamaica town gets rain mom wrote montego bay gets rain st thomas and portland but apparently not trelawny but then just a few days later at 5 30 a m water poured from the sky by the time she emailed me late that afternoon it still had not stopped the rain had finally come bringing her home that rain was different than the ones of her youth hurricane season which officially runs from june to november with the stronger storms mostly coming toward the end was the busiest on record in 2020 with thirty named storms the previous high was twenty eight in 2005 the year katrina ravaged new orleans the shower that mom wrote about came as a precursor to tropical storm zeta which hit the region after three weeks of precipitation the storms damaged dozens of roads flooded riverbanks triggered landslides to say nothing of the estimated 18 million in infrastructural damages and 13 million in agricultural losses the following week tropical storm eta wreaked yet more havoc when mom reached out again she said little about the rain i d read the news and assumed the aftermath was too painful to talk about so i didn t push but i remembered what she did during hurricanes in florida when i was younger as storms blanketed our windows blurring a perpetual dusk she read and painted in the gray light of each day she watched the palm trees stretch and bend in the wind maybe she did the same during storms in jamaica and maybe she and many jamaicans who remained unhurt by the rain who escaped the flooding and landslides and had space to think beyond their own survival wondered what future awaited the island in the face of ever worsening assaults from the weather i avoided beginning with violence in this story about mom s return to jamaica in part to make room for some other vision of the island the overwhelming association between the country and murder can cast too long a shadow to let anything else grow it is an old cliché of anthropological area studies deborah thomas wrote at the beginning of exceptional violence if one wants to study violence one goes to jamaica but violence often comes regardless of one s choice in early november after the rain mom caught a cab to montego bay along the way she saw cops stopping motorists they were just making money off people with cars mom said ticketing instead of taxing the driver who was also black responded that black people were the ones giving trouble getting themselves pulled over frustrated mom described the ways racial profiling worked in the states when she relayed the story i recalled the time my friend and i were pulled over suspected of having robbed a nearby cheesecake factory mom was in the backseat when we talked about this incident later she asked where my friend and i learned to sit so still to her it seemed almost genetically inherited the way our hands rested on our knees or the dash looking straight ahead never making eye contact with the officer as if the slightest movement could get us killed she may have recalled that night or any of the other nights she feared that her sons might be gunned down as she insisted to the driver that all cops everywhere were violent and racist if you find your head in a lion s mouth the driver responded you take your time to get it out mom agreed though she disagreed over who was to blame she didn t like cops she wrote me but she knew who had a gun a badge and who was backed by the powers of the state so she kept her distance should she cross paths with the police she was always aware that they could kill her so that is what my taxi guy was saying she wrote he plans to live to see another day like the cops or not she planned to do the same shortly thereafter she went to the supermarket in town so she could stock up on all the goods she d run out of while stuck inside there she saw a taxi van with the back door open the driver was helping a passenger on the other side of the vehicle a young man midtwenties by mom s estimation saw a backpack sticking out of the open back door and snatched and slung it across his shoulders he tried to walk away nonchalantly but someone told the driver who though closer to middle aged was well spry he spotted the thief ran after him grabbed ahold of the bag they wrestled for control the younger man spun and contorted his limbs until he slipped out of the straps like an eel escaping a bare handed fisher the confrontation however was not over the driver ran back to his taxi and grabbed a metal bat weapon in hand the driver ran after the thief swung and hit him on his rear passersby lambasted the young man how did he let himself get beat up by someone so old frustrated with their jeering he put his hands up and swung at the driver and failed to make any serious contact the driver swung even harder beating him with that metal bat all over mom feared the driver might hit the boy in the head a metal bat even without much room for a full swing could certainly do plenty of damage she had just planned to go to the store she had not intended to witness a murder one of the onlookers said they should get the police we don t need the police for this someone said somehow the scuffle ended the jeering stopped and the crowd dispersed the driver kept the luggage and the young man hadn t been killed he disappeared as did she knowing better than to linger at the scene of a fight she couldn t help but wonder if he d actually made it home i asked mom how she felt after witnessing it all she repeated the story as though there was nothing to think but that it had happened what she saw was what she thought the violence was a fact of life i wondered how it colored her sense of this place she called home perhaps her resignation to the assault came from a sense that the island was a far cry from the place she grew up in having left in 1999 she missed the country s most violent years statistically though she continued reading the gleaner and remained aware of the prevalence of violence including the year that jamaica topped the world s murder rates at sixty one per one hundred thousand by the time she returned in 2020 the annual murder rate rarely dipped below forty perhaps she just saw the violence that day as part of the new jamaica then again mom never harbored any naïve ideas about jamaica being a peaceful place her biological father had killed someone with a knife in self defense her stepfather had hit and killed a bicyclist while driving when she was young she was viciously beaten by caretakers and robbers had held up her and her mother at gunpoint in their own home when we lived there briefly in the 1990s our home was broken into twice and she lived through enough political riots to know the sight of jamaica defense force tanks rolling down the streets of kingston an image that constitutes one of my own earliest memories one of the reasons she often gave when asked why she left was that things were getting too wild on the island a claim met with nods and murmurs of agreement from jamaicans of her generation statistics suggest that violence got worse over time nonetheless these jamaicans seem to have the sense that it had always been dangerous maybe mom saw the driver beating that young man as the cost of being home as far as mom was concerned the omnipresence of violence was not that different from her experience of the states when she was a teen in america her own mother had been mugged and shoved leading to a lifelong knee injury in her twenties her younger brother had been found with a bullet in his head in an abandoned warehouse in philadelphia when we lived in florida she feared my interactions with cops and self identified rednecks could turn lethal now that she was home in jamaica reading the news about the states she talked about the two countries as though they were the same in the days leading up to the 2020 presidential election she warned me to stay inside fearing political riots would sweep the country she emailed to note that the carter center the center just for countries with despots in her account was monitoring the us election as it had the jamaican elections in 1997 and 2002 it was impossible to escape the specter of violence she suggested the fear of having the weapon turned on her migration has never been a simple means of finding safety for most of the jamaicans i have known many of whom followed relatives to cities in the us canada and the uk where they found poverty to say nothing of health disparities and unfulfilled ambitions this didn t stop them from moving searching and hoping mom had been disappointed by moves before but she still kept seeking a life free from violence and inequality a life filled with birdsong and wandering cats the steady clapping of waves on the shore and the sensation of spirits all around her rain that announced her birthday without prophesying destruction and a history that spoke to her retirement in california was a fantasy more mine than hers she knew well the ways of the world the difficulty of getting a fridge fixed in jamaica the fear of being held up at gunpoint a son drifting away into professional american dreaming for now she s searching for some other better life than the one she has found i don t know what that will look like or where she ll find it but i trust that she ll recognize it when she does

as filed at case allegations the rocket companies class action lawsuit alleges that throughout the class period defendants made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose that i rocket companies gain on sale margins were contracting at the highest rate in two years as a result of increased competition among mortgage lenders an unfavorable shift toward the lower margin partner network operating segment and compression in the price spread between the primary and secondary mortgage markets ii rocket companies was engaged in a price war and battle for market share with its primary competitors in the wholesale market which was further compressing margins in rocket companies partner network operating segment iii the adverse trends identified above were accelerating and as a result rocket companies gain on sale margins were on track to plummet at least 140 basis points in the first six months of 2021 iv as a result the favorable market conditions that had preceded the class period and allowed rocket companies to achieve historically high gain on sale margins had vanished as rocket companies gain on sale margins had returned to levels not seen since the first quarter of 2019 v rather than remaining elevated due to surging demand rocket companies company wide gain on sale margins had fallen materially below pre pandemic averages and vi consequently defendants positive statements about rocket companies business operations and prospects were materially misleading and or lacked a reasonable basis on may 5 2021 rocket companies reported that it was on track to achieve closed loan volume within a range of only 82 5 billion and 87 5 billion and gain on sale margins within a range of only 2 65 to 2 95 for the second quarter of 2021 at the mid point this gain on sale margin estimate equated to a 239 basis point decline year over year and a 94 basis point decline sequentially which represented rocket companies lowest quarterly gain on sale margin in two years the stunning collapse in rocket companies gain on sale margin reflected the fact that the favorable market conditions purportedly being experienced by rocket companies during the class period had in fact reversed during a conference call to explain the results rocket companies chief financial officer and treasurer defendant julie r booth revealed that the sharp decline in quarterly gain on sale margin was being caused by three factors i pressure on loan pricing ii a product mix shift to rocket companies lower margin partner network segment and iii a compression in price spreads between the primary and secondary mortgage markets defendant booth also admitted that certain of these trends began at the end of q1 on this news the price of rocket companies class a common stock

a daring junior oil and gas explorer has set out to put the african country of namibia which has never produced a single barrel of oil on the world s energy map in a wildcat drill campaign that has taken many by surprise the namibian government was sitting on a treasure chest of data on the giant kavango basin and it seems like no one knew when reconnaissance energy africa tsx v reco otcmkts recaf initially saw the data while searching around africa what could be the untapped final frontier of energy it called on world class geologist bill cathey for a second opinion as to what they might be looking at here cathey whose clients have included supermajors such as exxonmobil conocophillips and chevron performed the entire magnetic survey interpretation of the kavango basin for reconafrica and was very clear about it nowhere in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce hydrocarbons reco acquired the exploration rights to the entire 6 3 million acre kavango basin in namibia then it extended that holding to over 8 million acres by obtaining rights to botswana s portion of the basin though cathey is a renowned geologist that s no guarantee of success this is after all a huge undertaking for a junior explorer which we think makes it a very high risk high reward play cathey s statement garnered a bit of attention for recon africa and for namibia but then another world class geochemist jumped on board and upped the stakes dan jarvie one of the industry s most famous geochemist wildcatters and a major figure behind the texas barnett play estimated what he thinks the potential oil generated in kavango could be at billions of barrels conservatively you can forget about super majors like exxon chevron when it comes to onshore exploration outside of the united states they aren t the ones who make these onshore discoveries work instead you should be looking for locations where independents are out in force looking for the next big thing jarvie told oilprice com there is a very strong independent junior explorer here sitting on a sedimentary basin that rivals south texas in a massively under explored region he said that gained the company more attention still but it wasn t until reconafrica started drilling that this stock started to gain greater attention for better or worse in january reconafrica launched a 3 well drilling campaign that they hoped would prove there was an active petroleum system here many of us weren t expecting any results until the end of the campaign instead the company surprised us with results indicating a working petroleum system after only the first test drill then less than two months later and only at the beginning of its second drill which it spudded on may 5th reco announced further indication of a working petroleum system in the shallow section of its second well interest around this stock has grown significantly as results from the full drill reaching 12 500 feet of the second well are expected in the first week of july in the meantime there looks to be a war looming over reco with one report saying short sellers having amassed huge positions that they must now cover prompting a barrage of misinformation and fake news campaigns targeting the company here is a must read report on short and distort campaigns on seeking alpha and the lengths short sellers will go to time is running out and fact checking has never been more important for investors investors need to understand the exploration processes the pitfalls that face a junior explorer in a huge basin and the environmental social and governance issues that we believe represent the only way forward right now because no one wants another situation like nigeria just as important investors need to understand how short sellers operate these days so they can navigate the sea of misinformation the geology of kavango indications of an active petroleum system the history of the geological data for the kavango basin starts with the government of namibia which commissioned aeromagnetic survey data that was then purchased by reconafrica who further had it analyzed by bill cathey s houston based earthfield technology we believe there are a number of facts here that can help readers navigate the barrage of misinformation floating around out there about the geology itself and the nature of the drilling campaign 1 the 3 well drill campaign is about establishing the existence of a working petroleum system this is where readers can easily be misled because oil and gas exploration is complicated to fully understand the exploration process you have to understand that there are different processes based on whether there are already wells on a specific play or not if there are wells already in existence then the task is to acquire seismic data to identify potential reservoirs if there are no wells yet as in the case of kavango a virgin basin the task is to drill stratigraphic test wells first to determine if there is an active petroleum system that is what reconafrica is doing with its 3 well campaign the acquisition of seismic data only makes sense once an active petroleum system has been identified as otherwise where do you start on 8 million acres 2 reco has twice so far provided drilling results that indicate an active petroleum system in kavango the first stratigraphic test well 6 2 results were released on april 15th the sample log provided over 200 meters of light oil and natural gas indicators over three discrete intervals in a stacked sequence of reservoir and source rock oil was then extracted from these samples and the results supported an active petroleum system with multiple source intervals the second stratigraphic test well 6 1 is designed to be drilled to a depth of 3 800 meters 12 500 feet in its first shallow section the well encountered 343 meters of oil and gas indicators further confirming an active petroleum system in kavango the company says the well will likely reach its full depth in the first week of july there was a short break for maintenance that has now been completed and drilling is reported to be underway as we speak in a recent statement dr james granath phd structural geology and director of reconafrica noted dr james granath phd structural geology director of reconafrica the 6 2 and 6 1 wells are stratigraphic tests science wells if you like but the data from the wells including hydrocarbon shows have hinted at something very interesting and they emphatically scream the imperative to follow through on a comprehensive exploration program these wells suggest there is commercial potential in the basin it took 30 wells in offshore norway to get to this point we ve been lucky enough to do it in the first two and well analysis is coming from among the best in the industry including schlumberger along with core labs geomark research and netherland sewell it doesn t get any more reputable or independent than this 3 the next step is seismic acquisition now that evidence of an active petroleum system has been determined the next step is to understand any commercial potential of reco s project and the next step is the acquisition of seismic data recon africa and its partner namcor the namibian government s oil company will conduct an initial 450 kilometer low impact 2d seismic acquisition program for which they have hired polaris natural resources inc for a cost of under 4 5m the seismic operations are scheduled to begin in mid july and are subject to final permitting 4 more wells and seismic planned reco and namcor also plan to seek approval from the ministry for the drilling of more wells beyond the initial 3 well campaign and for additional seismic which they are targeting for the second half of this year pending permitting and licensing where the namibian government stands does recon africa tsx v reco otcmkts recaf have the namibian government s support for its kavango basin project yes and that has been demonstrated multiple times since the company s acquisition of aeromagnetic survey data from the government it also has the support of the governor of east kavango bonifasius wakudumo we are pleased with reconafrica s approach to working closely and in constant consultation with our office the traditional leadership local authority and the community this is only the beginning stages and we have already started to experience the positive economic and social impact of the project in our regions kavango east governor bonifasius wakudumo said in response to short selling reports spreading what the namibian government has said is disinformation the government on june 25th announced it was creating a cohesive public relations strategy that would involve all stakeholders to counter misinformation regarding the exploration project a government communique notes cabinet took note of the progress made by recon africa under petroleum license cabinet directed the ministry of mines to develop an efficient and effective public relations strategy with a communication plan for stakeholder engagement on the project including constituency councilors traditional leaders and local communities in the kavango east west and zambezi regions the petroleum agreement as examined by our correspondents appears to be solid once exploration is concluded reconafrica will potentially return up to 75 of the licensed basin area to the government of namibia that return would encompass any territory that is not included in a commercial discovery zone the current exploration license is extendable with ministry approval to the end of january 2023 after that a second extension period is allowed to two more years of exploration and beyond that one year extensions are part of the agreement to 2026 if there is a commercial discovery the petroleum agreement is said to entitle recon africa and its local partner to a 25 year production license that is renewable for an additional 10 years in namibia and 20 years in botswana it s all pretty straightforward in our view recon africa s cash position one of the first questions any investor should ask about this company is whether it has the cash to carry out the exploration as planned it is a huge basin as has been said for a very small explorer it is a basin that would typically be explored by a supermajor there are very few junior oil and gas companies of this size that would be able to pull this off and we think reco is one of them reconafrica recently completed a cdn 41 million equity raise and has disclosed that it has cdn 63 000 000 51 2 million in cash reserves for the 3 well drill campaign of which it s almost done with drill no 2 plus the upcoming 450 km of seismic which will cost around 4 5 million and it has zero debt that means no debt covenants to crush them and no interest payments esg initiatives spreading the wealth let s start with water many residents of kavango east do not have clean drinking water an estimated 40 of the 250 000 people of the kavango region live in generational poverty an oil discovery could mean jobs and improved access to basic human rights such as clean water and medical services they do not have the resources to drill water wells even though they are sitting on top of a freshwater aquifer instead they walk long distances every day to carry huge volumes of water back home recon africa is drilling those wells as part of its responsibility to give back to the local communities that are allowing the company to explore for oil in the basin alongside namcor the government owned oil company in the meantime reconafrica has committed 10 million to esg and has been using some of its resources to drill water wells for local inhabitants water is scarce in northeast namibia and among other things to date the company has drilled four solar powered community water wells with plans to drill and donate eight more water wells for the local community for which permits have already been awarded it s been cause for celebration in kavango the company has formally received all water well regulatory approvals for drilling operations from the ministry of agriculture water and land reform furthermore reconafrica has committed over 1 million to namibia s covid 19 vaccine rollout campaign in addition to its contributions last year to healthcare support in the kavango region kavango s environment reconafrica is not operating in an environmental vacuum here these aren t the days of shell in nigeria when it was about nothing more than exploiting a country for its natural resources because no one was paying attention today thankfully everyone is paying attention and reconafrica has far too much at stake particularly given the reputations of the world famous geologists and geochemists backing it to ignore the essential aspects of the environment social responsibility and good governance as a canadian company reconafrica employs best practices and technologies and has assured the public time and again as has the namibian government itself that they are operating in line with legal obligations its permitting licensing and operations have also not taken place in a legal vacuum everything is under constant review by multiple agencies including the ministry of mines energy of namibia the ministry of agriculture water land reform the ministry of environment forestry tourism the ministry of home affairs immigration safety security and others at the local and regional levels and it s not fracking while earlier estimates of potential oil in kavango done by sproule had noted the unconventional potential estimates by dan jarvie for billions boe of conventional oil which is exactly what reconafrica is pursuing reconafrica reports it does not have any fracking permits nor has it applied for any it s the conventional potential that they re focusing on the company reports they are also not threatening the region s okavango river which is more than 50 kilometers north of reconafrica s operations nor the ecologically vital okavango delta which is 260 kilometers west of reco s operations reconafrica is using seismic equipment owned and operated by polaris natural resources inc out of alberta canada this is the lightest impact seismic equipment the world has to offer more specifically according to bill mooney ceo it is a 9 foot wide mercedes benz tractor that drives soundwaves into the ground sent to wireless geophones at a low or idle rpm finally with regard to drilling fluids reconafrica reports it is only on each location for a few months and then the land is reclaimed and returned to normal they say they use the most advanced drilling fluid in the industry which is a polymer water based fluid in other words plant oil it s benign 100 biodegradable and 100 organic not only that but steinke says it is actually used to enrich soil in the united states local residents are already going through a pilot project where they cultivate a large area for vegetable gardening fertilizing it with reconafrica s organic drilling fluid excess fluids and cuttings are managed in a reserve pit adjacent to the drilling rig the rocks being drilled through for the three exploratory wells are environmentally benign unlike in mining operations and this is true for most conventional oil and gas wells in general any fluids encountered while drilling stay in the formation due to the equivalent circulating density of the drilling fluid system the cuttings from the well are also being captured and bagged with half of the cuttings set aside for the namibian government for future study an organic gel clay barrier at the pit base prevents seepage into groundwater and soils this approach is better than polyurethane pit linings which are easy to install but challenging to remove during reclamation which can lead to shredding and leaks furthermore local community leaders have come out in defense of the truth recognizing that external forces and fake news have hijacked their own ability to speak predatory tactics threatening namibia for short seller gains short sellers first attempted to boost their short position chances on reco by alleging environmental negligence when that misinformation campaign failed to have the desired impact we believe the campaign was tweaked to focus on the oil prospects an area that is easier to mislead investors who are not familiar with the exploration and production phases and who much like the authors of the short reports themselves have no education in geology the problem we see for short sellers now is that reconafrica tsx v reco otcmkts recaf either got lucky on its first two wells in finding an active petroleum system or it knew what it was targeting in the first place and luck had nothing to do with it either way it s good news for namibia and bad news for short sellers whose misinformation campaigns have fallen short of the desired impact under increasing pressure from investors now to reverse these losses the fake news campaigns have taken on a new form of aggression in the past two weeks we think that is largely because time is running out in our view the world class status of dan jarvie and bill cathey has rendered the geology related slander ineffective for the most part and the namibian government itself has rendered the environmental libel null and void now short sellers are faced with the looming completion of the second well by reconafrica probably within a week and the start of 450 kilometers of seismic the july august timeline is what is worth watching very closely seismic the permit is expected any day with first activity expected in the beginning of july including the vertical seismic profile of both wells drilled to date 6 1 well completion of drilling first well took four months this one 10 weeks 6 2 well compilation of all technical evaluations from third parties core labs schulmberger geomark research netherland sewell completion of roe acquisition court approval expected in the third or fourth week of july site preparation for the third well with drilling expected to start in september if the completion of drill no 2 and the return of lab results top even the first and second showings of an active petroleum system and oil encounters the short sellers could be crushed in our pick for the oil play of the decade we believe it will likely be a seismic defeat quite literally for those employing dirty tactics to destroy a company that has some of the biggest names in the industry behind it other companies looking to capitalize on the oil recovery petrochina co nyse ptr is the second largest fuel company in the world and operates 30 countries across our planet including china where it was founded back in 1999 petrochina specializes mainly on oil exploration but has also extended into other sectors such as equipment manufacturing for petroleum engineering purposes financial services like investing funds merger and acquisition analysis or commodity trading new energy development to identify opportunities related to emerging technologies that can help mitigate climate change through sustainable resource utilization like many other oil companies petrochina had a difficult time grappling with the covid 19 pandemic in response petrochina created an anti covid 19 steering team to work among other things on reducing expenditure as well as cutting costs and enhancing profitability controlling the capital expenditures and costs optimizing

oil price fluctuations and strives to maintain stable and healthy development of production and operations petrochina said advertisement petrochina has recently unveiled plans to spend 239 billion yuan 37 billion in annual capital spending the highest for any gas and oil company globally in an effort to increase domestic production over the next five years and also to improve china s energy security like its peers exxon nyse xom was hit with incredible losses sparked by the global covid 19 pandemic and the resulting demand destruction earlier this year the company even did something that it was holding off on doing long after all the rest of the big oil club did it it revised down its oil reserves the move shocked markets as exxon slashed reserves down by almost a third in the most radical revision in its modern history the supermajor reported reserves totaling 15 3 billion barrels as of the end of 2020 in a regulatory filing this compared with 22 44 billion barrels a year earlier netherlands based royal dutch shell plc nyse rds a operates as an integrated oil gas and chemicals company shell remains one of big oil s least optimistic companies when it comes to the long term oil and gas outlook shell says we might already be past peak oil demand and is bracing itself for a worst case scenario demand to never fully recover i think a crisis like this has the potential to capitalize society into a different way of thinking much as the paris agreement has had company ceo ben van beurden has told investors shell has also revealed that it expects 75 of its proved oil and gas reserves to be exhausted by 2030 and nearly all by 2050 africa in particular south africa is key for shell because the government has been significantly more stable than some of the other big bets on the continent moreover the country has been very open to shell in its projects the company s operations in south africa include retail and commercial fuel lubricant chemical and manufacturing it s also heavily invested in upstream exploration it even holds the exploration rights to the orange basin deep water area off the country s west coast and has applications for shale gas exploration

onshore offshore wind power and solar power generating facilities also known as british petroleum bp is a multinational energy company that has been around for over 100 years bp was formed in 1909 by the merger of two rival companies anglo persian oil company and royal dutch shell with operations in more than 80 countries and regions bp is one of the world s largest oil and natural gas producers we are still a long way from beyond petroleum but chief executive bernard looney believes that we are only 30 years from a net zero bp he has promised that in september the company will lay out a more detailed plan that shows the path to that destination but he has shown already that there is more to his commitment to net zero than there was to beyond petroleum 20 years ago renewables and natural gas together account for the great majority of the growth in primary energy in our evolving transition scenario 85 of new energy is lower carbon spencer dale bp group chief economist said commenting on the outlook to 2040 bp has lately become less aggressive with its oil production and exploration but still remains more active than the likes of shell recently the company revealed that it had discovered oil at the puma west prospect in the deepwater u s gulf of mexico with preliminary data pointing to good potential for a commercial volume of hydrocarbons kinder morgan nyse kmi a major north american pipeline operator has been particularly upbeat in recent months in fact in early december it issued optimistic updates planning higher dividends and expecting more profits in 2021 after the challenges the oil industry has faced last year due to the covid 19 pandemic and the wider market crash kinder morgan also expects to raise its dividend for 2021 by 3 percent compared to this year kinder morgan inc s chief executive officer steve kean noted with budgeted excess coverage of that dividend we expect also to be able to engage in share repurchases on an opportunistic basis kinder morgan is a must watch in the industry with dividends on the rise oil prices increasing and bullish sentiment returning to the oil industry there could be some significant upside left for this pipeline operator especially as oil begins flowing at pre pandemic levels chevron nyse cvx is a leader in the industry and the second largest oil company on the new york stock exchange it was founded in 1879 in california by john d rockefeller and partners as the standard oil company of ohio which became part of the standard oil trust when it was dissolved on january 1 1911 one year later chevron corporation then texaco bought out its former partner for 10 million 2 billion today the new corporation then changed its name to reflect this shift from being primarily an oil refining business to one also involved in natural gas exploration and production chevron is also betting big on africa particularly nigeria and angola the supermajor ranks among the top oil producers in the two african nations other areas on the continent where the company holds interests include benin ghana the republic of congo and togo chevron also holds a 36 7 percent interest in the west african gas pipeline company limited which supplies nigerian natural gas to customers in the region with bets on both oil and natural gas the company is looking to take advantage of both fossil fuels though prices are still depressed at the moment as fuel demand returns to normal chevron could be a big winner as prices climb back up to pre pandemic levels total nyse tot barely squeezes into the top 4 oil and gas companies in the world and for good reason the company is one of the most diversified and forward thinking oil majors in the business and it s no stranger to the african oil game either total betting big on the region s potential the company has been in the region for over 90 years and it is showing no sign of reducing its footprint anytime soon recently total said that it would accelerate its

announced total said it s also one of the most conscious companies in the business total checks every box in the esg checklist it is promoting diversity and safety making massive changes in its operations to ensure that its business is environmentally sound and has even committed to going carbon neutral by 2050 or sooner it s no surprise that shareholders are loving its forward thinking approach asia isn t going to be left behind in the oil race in fact as demand for energy continues to explode in a post pandemic china cnooc limited nyse ceo tsx cnu will likely be one of the biggest benefactors it s the country s most significant producer of offshore crude oil and natural gas and may well be one of the most controversial oil stocks for investors on the market a label that has nothing to do with its operations however cnooc recently started production from the first deepwater gas field it operates fully reuters has reported adding that the field is expected to yield some 4 39 billion cubic meters of natural gas representing 2 percent of china s total output the chenhai 1 well was drilled at the lingshui 17 2 field in the south china sea and according to cnooc could push its total natural gas production capacity to more than 13 billion cubic meters annually enbridge tsx enb is in a unique position as oil and gas stages its 2021 comeback as one of the more potentially undervalued companies in the sector it could be set to win big this year but that s only if it can overcome some of the challenges in its path most specifically its line 3 project which has faced scrutiny from environmentalists while this challenge may prove difficult for enbridge to overcome the health of the canadian oil industry is improving and with it the outlook for canadian producers such as enbridge the company has already started the year off strong and if it can continue its momentum it will likely be able to see a sustained rally in its share price over the course of the year canadian natural resources tsx cnq has been able to do what many of its canadian counterparts haven t been able to keep its dividend intact after swinging to a loss for the first half of the covid pandemic while canada s producers are scaling back production by around 1 million bpd amid low oil prices and demand though canadian natural resources kept its dividend it withdrew its production guidance for 2020 however it also said it would curtail some production at high cost conventional projects in north america and oil sands operations and carry out planned turnaround activities at oil sands projects in the second half of 2020 though there is a lot of negative press surrounding canada s oil sands the industry is starting to clean up its act a bit and canadian natural resources is leading the charge and if analysts are right about canada s comeback canadian natural resources could be in for a big year tc energy corporation tsx trp is a calgary based energy giant the company owns and operates energy infrastructure throughout north america tc energy is one of the continent s largest providers of gas storage and owns and has interests in approximately 11 800 megawatts of power generation it s also one of the continent s most important pipeline operators with tc energy s massive influence throughout north america it is no wonder that the company is among one of canada s strongest and well known companies like a number of its peers one of tc energy s biggest challenges in recent years was grappling with the particularly difficult approval process for its keystone pipeline but that s all history now and with the bounce back in oil and gas demand tc energy could stand to benefit while tc energy s stock price has yet to recover from pre pandemic levels it is one of the few industry giants which has managed to keep high dividends rolling in with quarterly payouts exceeding 6 tc has remained appealing for investors in the industry suncor energy tsx su is another giant in canada s industry it has set itself apart from some of its peers through a number of high tech solutions for finding pumping storing and delivering its resources not only is it big in the oil sector but it is also a leader in renewable energy recently the company invested 300 million in a wind farm located in alberta showing that it is committed to reducing its carbon footprint now that oil prices are finally recovering giants like suncor looking to capitalize while many of the oil majors have given up on oil sands production those who focus on technological advancements in the

california lawmakers voted monday night to approve a record busting state budget that reflects new agreements with gov gavin newsom to expand health care for undocumented immigrants spend billions to alleviate homelessness and help californians still struggling through the pandemic the 262 6 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that begins july 1 was fueled by a 76 billion state surplus and 27 billion in federal aid democrats who control the capitol wanted to use the windfall to help the state recover from the coronavirus pandemic and its uneven toll on californians while the state s top earners continued to accrue wealth from a strong stock market booming tech sector and rising home values low wage californians suffered from job losses child care cutbacks and a dysfunctional unemployment insurance system the state s progressive tax structure allowed newsom and lawmakers to infuse social service programs for the needy and middle class with billions of dollars largely from wealthy taxpayers we re investing that in the unprecedented challenges the state faces including into addressing the needs of people that are working hard playing by the rules and barely making ends meet newsom said friday the pandemic and its economic impacts have not only colored state budget negotiations they also disrupted california s political landscape this year giving rise to a gop backed effort to throw newsom out of office with the recall now qualified to hit the ballot electoral politics also loomed over budget negotiations this year here are five things to know about california s new spending plan the budget is still not totally done even with the record busting enormity of this year s budget and democrats holding all the power in sacramento newsom and legislative leaders were not able to reach agreement on everything they did not issue public statements announcing a broad budget deal even as bills went into print friday reflecting some new agreements that modify the placeholder budget lawmakers approved on june 14 the lack of the usual bravado indicates that while this budget meets the legal requirements to craft a spending plan by july 1 significant negotiations will continue some key expenditures will likely be approved later this summer through a special kind of legislation known as budget trailer bills anne wernikoff calmatters assembly budget committee chairperson phil ting left talks to senate budget committee chairperson nancy skinner during a press conference at the unity council in oakland where gov gavin newsom announced additional stimulus checks with the state surplus on may 10 2021 for instance they did not decide exactly how to spend billions of dollars to address the threats posed by wildfires and drought the budget includes 1 billion over several years for wildfire prevention 3 billion to alleviate drought and 3 7 billion over three years to mitigate dangers posed by climate change but newsom and legislative leaders are still figuring out how to spend the funds the budget doesn t contain any spending on california s controversial high speed rail project that aims to connect san francisco and los angeles newsom in may proposed spending 4 2 billion in bond funds to complete construction in the central valley which critics deride as a train to nowhere and move toward launching service between merced and bakersfield but legislators pushed back and left the money out of the budget we just seem to be at loggerheads with elements within the administration about how much of the plan to fund assembly speaker anthony rendon told calmatters lawmakers and newsom also failed to agree on how to expand broadband service in california an infrastructure need that became obvious during the pandemic as millions of people shifted to remote school and work but suffered from insufficient internet connections the budget includes 6 billion to expand broadband service but details remain to be hashed out child care funding is also still in flux when he ran for office in 2018 governor dad newsom campaigned heavily on his support for families and early childhood education but child care including pay rates for some providers was a final sticking point in the budget negotiations rendon told reporters and many details are still to be worked out one key piece was settled friday in a first ever agreement with the new providers union the state approved the first increase in pay rates in five years plus funding to train and license more providers according to a statement from the union which said raises of at least 15 would start in 2022 child care providers united recognized as a union in a 2019 bill signed by newsom held a rally thursday at the capitol attended by rendon and senate leader toni atkins to press the governor to sign on to the legislative proposal that called for an additional 1 billion for the pay increases newsom s team had pushed back officials close to budget talks told politico voicing concerns about the impact increased rates will have when the state does not have a surplus of cash the pay rate increase comes at a time when california s child care sector has been hit hard during the pandemic about 8 500 licensed child care sites shut down that took tens of thousands of slots for kids who need care while their parents work or attend school and also took employment from thousands of women of color who make up a majority of the child care workforce the agreement also increases the number of child care slots available by 200 000 over the next four years including 120 000 in 2021 22 the budget includes a big expansion of health care california took another step toward trying to achieve universal health care with this budget as newsom and lawmakers agreed to offer medi cal health insurance to undocumented residents age 50 and older it s the latest expansion in democrats years long effort to allow unauthorized immigrants to participate in the state funded health care program for low income residents previous budgets opened the program to undocumented children and then young adults as old as 26 this year newsom proposed making undocumented residents age 60 and older eligible for medi cal while the legislature wanted to offer it to those age 50 and up a key sticking point covering health care for more people commits the state to ongoing spending that it might not be able to afford in a future recession advocates said this budget makes california the first state in the nation to provide government health insurance to undocumented immigrants at age 50 it also eliminates an earlier rule that made people ineligible for medi cal if they had a small amount of savings in the bank also local public health departments weary after a year of managing covid 19 testing vaccinations and residents testy over business closures won new funding in the budget newsom initially did not propose significant funding to rebuild the state s public health infrastructure but the legislature wanted to give local public health departments an additional 200 million annually to add staff and modernize equipment in the end the budget gives them 300 million a year but delays payments until 2022 it puts billions more into tackling homelessness legislative leaders and newsom ended up on the same page about how much to spend on homelessness and affordable housing a total of 12 billion over the next two years but they made a few concessions on how exactly to spend all those billions in their proposed budget the legislature had made ongoing funding a top priority they pitched four years in steady funding to the tune of 1 billion a year for cities and counties to combat homelessness the key was flexibility as local jurisdictions would be able to decide what exactly would be most effective the governor had proposed no money for that purpose the compromise split right down the middle two instead of four years of 1 billion annually for local jurisdictions it s still the biggest repeat pot of funding for homelessness in california to date funding will be re evaluated in the third year and rules must still be hammered out on who will get that money and how they ll have to spend it to ensure accountability and results the budget deal also includes 1 75 billion to build shovel ready backlogged affordable housing projects 300 million to preserve existing affordable rental housing and 130 million to build and maintain farmworker housing earlier friday newsom and legislative leaders announced a deal to extend the statewide eviction moratorium through sept 30 and to try to speed up rent relief using 5 2 billion from the federal government democrats used the budget to fight the newsom recall with california recovering from the pandemic and newsom s job approval rising in public polls democrats are pushing to get the recall on the ballot sooner rather than later they included 250 million in the budget to cover the cost of putting on the special election to help expedite the process they also wrote a budget related bill that sets the stage for an earlier election date by allowing the legislature to skip a 30 day fiscal review period if they ve already put money aside to cover election costs the date is still not set but a september election is looking increasingly likely anne wernikoff calmatters recall newsom volunteer pat miller makes a sign during a petition signing event at savemart in sacramento on jan 5 2021 and as newsom fights to hang onto his job he s used the budget process to show voters his priorities in may he barnstormed the state announcing multi billion dollar budget nuggets in every major media market as he touted that california is roaring back from the pandemic in june he launched the first tv ads of his anti recall campaign featuring the same roaring back branding and a focus on the same budget items funding to house 65 000 homeless people 600 stimulus payments for most californians and 4 billion in grants for small businesses newsom is delivering money to your pocket the ad says and free pre k for every california child regardless of income republicans who have

legendary investor warren buffett said the economic consequences of the pandemic are falling disproportionately on small businesses and the unpredictability of covid 19 is far from over the economic impact has been this extremely uneven thing where many hundreds of thousands or millions of small businesses have been hurt in a terrible way but most of the big companies have overwhelmingly done fine the berkshire hathaway ceo said during an interview with becky quick on cnbc s special buffett munger a wealth of wisdom which aired tuesday in march 2020 the pandemic cut a deadly swath across america which led to a shutdown of a 20 trillion economy in full swing thousands of small businesses were forced to close their doors while big box retailers and e commerce giants took in those customers gross domestic product for the first quarter last year dropped 31 4 which was unprecedented in post great depression america it s not over the 90 year old investor said i mean in terms of the unpredictability it s been very unpredictable but it s worked out better than people anticipated for most people and most businesses and it s just for no fault of their own it s just decimated all kinds of people and their hopes get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters covid created fabulous success for some businesses like auto dealers the pandemic even brought on windfall profits said charlie munger vice chairman of berkshire and buffett s longtime business partner it didn t create just a return to normal it created fabulous success they didn t anticipate munger said the auto dealers are coining money that they wouldn t have had except for the pandemic due to factory shutdowns and a global shortage of semiconductors automakers and dealers have experienced surging if not record profits and even selling vehicles before they arrive at dealerships berkshire hathaway automotive is one of the largest dealership groups in america with more than 78 independently operated dealerships the conglomerate also owns the bnsf railway and netjets a private business jet charter and aircraft management company all of the dealers that we have partners in each dealership they very sincerely felt that they were going to have one hell of a problem in march and april buffett said some might have wanted to go in for the assistance from the government but we wouldn t let them because they had a rich parent we didn t know what was going to happen with netjets in terms of the demand the biggest lesson buffett said the biggest lesson he learned from the unprecedented pandemic is how ill prepared the world can be for emergency situations that are bound to happen i learned that people don t know as much as they think they know but the biggest thing you learn is that the pandemic was bound to occur and this isn t the worst one that s imaginable at all buffett said society has a terrible time preparing for things that are remote but are possible and will occur sooner or later more than 600 000 people have died of covid in the u s and countries are grappling with new variants amid vaccine rollouts the delta variant now in at least 92 countries including the united states is expected to become the dominant strain of the disease worldwide in the u s the prevalence of the variant is doubling about every two weeks there ll be another pandemic we know that we know there s a nuclear chemical biological and now cyberthreat each one of those has terrible possibilities buffett said and we do some things about it but it s just not something that society seems particularly capable in fully coming to grips with a steady uptick in sweeping cyberattacks this year has directly impacted americans and hampered logistics and services in the united states in may a ransomware attack on colonial pipeline forced the u s company to shut down approximately 5 500 miles of pipeline charlie and i have been ungodly lucky in many ways but the luckiest thing was actually being around at this time and place buffett said how do we actually do this so that mankind 50 and 100 and 200 years from now should enjoy the incredibly better life that could be enjoyed while not screwing it up enjoyed this article for exclusive stock picks investment ideas and cnbc global livestream sign up for cnbc pro start your free trial now
kuala lumpur malaysiaâ efforts to produce its own covid 19 vaccine is the best way to reduce its dependence on the superpowers to obtain future supply of the vaccine immediate steps in that direction need to be taken following various issues having cropped up including problem of not enough stock as well as the recipients countries having to pay high cost to obtain the supply the world health organisation who in a report on june 19 was quoted as saying that a large number of poor countries including in the indian continent sub saharan africa latin america and west asia had to postpone their covid 19 vaccination programme due to shortage of vaccine doses causing individuals who have already received the first dose to have to wait longer for the second dose the report also stated that such a situation occurred when countries that have financial resources and produce the vaccine have access to the vaccines it is also saddening when the rich countries such as the european union eu and the united states of america us monopolise the covid 19 vaccine supply causing other countries including malaysia to be slow to receive their supply thus affecting efforts to increase the vaccination rate of their population this was raised by the coordinating minister of the national covid 19 immunisation programme pick khairy jamaluddin who also said that malaysia is able to open a large vaccination centre ppv such as at the bukit jalil national stadium but there must be sufficient supply of the vaccine however a recent statement by health minister datuk seri dr adham baba that malaysia is developing the first vaccine to fight the covid 19 pandemic in collaboration with the institute of medical research imr and universiti putra malaysia upm gives hope of continuity of the vaccine supply for the people senior lecturer at the environmental health cluster department of earth science and environment universiti kebangsaan malaysia ukm dr nurul yuziana mohd yusof said the emergence of sarscov 2 coronavirus that causes covid 19 should make malaysia realise the need for a proactive action to intensify efforts to produce the vaccine in the country this is not only to curb the spread of covid 19 but to also combat the spread of other new variants in future she added â the covid 19 virus is a â wake up callâ for us to prepare ourselves and strengthen the countryâ s health barrier by developing our own vaccine â this covid 19 emerged 17 years after the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and even the mers cov middle east respiratory syndrome corona virus outbreak in 2012 was also caused by the coronavirus group â this shows that the probability for the coronavirus to reappear as a new pandemic in future is high â she told told bernama nurul yuziana said if malaysia is able to produce the covid 19 vaccine it would be able to resolve various crises related to the vaccine including the issue on supply shortage due to the high dependence on producing countries she said such a problem exists when the producing countries have to meet the needs of the local population and at the same time also had to supply or sell the vaccine to other countries on a very large scale thus putting pressure on both sides â â as we see in the current covid 19 situation it is a world health crisis regardless of developed countries or poor countries therefore as a developing country we can reduce our dependence on external vaccine by developing a local vaccine manufacturing industry to enable our society to have direct access to vaccines â with the existence of the vaccine manufacturing industry we can guarantee the well being of the nationâ s generation this is because when we have the experience and â templateâ for the vaccine production process it can indirectly be adapted to any type of pathogen germ â apart from that this effort will also be able to enhance human resources or technical expertise that we have from time to time â said nurul yuziana who is currently developing a biosensor platform for covid 19 disease through a ukm grant and an international grant from the international centre for genetic engineering and biotechnology icgeb she is also leading a research involving the identification of memory b cells that produce specific antibodies against sars cov 2 through blood samples of individuals who have recovered from covid 19 therefore for malaysia to be one of the vaccine producing countries there have to be careful planning and strategy at the research and development r d level this is important to ensure the continuous development of vaccines at the large scale manufacturing level especially with the cooperation of research institutions medical expert groups and the national pharmaceutical industry to accelerate and strengthen the clinical testing process for the vaccine malaysia needs to make india an example in producing its own vaccine by using local expertise â although india is a poor country she uses its own expertise to produce vaccines especially to reduce the cost of buying vaccines from other countries which are expensive to meet her large population â she added according to records india produces 60 per cent of the total global vaccine and houses the serum institute of india sii the worldâ s largest vaccine manufacturer bernama

rubber plantations have been a main historical cause of tropical deforestation and are generally responsible for a range of environmental and social ills but rubber grown in agroforestry systems in combination with fruit and timber trees useful shrubs medicines and herbs is shown by a new report to increase ecosystem services and biodiversity while sequestering carbon and diversifying farmers incomes additional to providing shelter and forage for a range of species rubber trees are not shown to suffer yield declines due to implementation of the more sustainable method mongabay interviewed the three authors of the new report rubber agroforestry feasibility at scale to learn more agroforestry is the most beneficial agricultural technique from a climate and biodiversity perspective growing food fuel fiber medicines and more under the cover of or adjacent to woody perennials like trees and shrubs makes intuitive sense for sustainability and science agrees these systems currently sequester 45 gigatons of carbon globally across a global area the size of canada according to one estimate published in the journal nature and shade grown is an increasingly common label on consumer products yet one of the main drivers of deforestation the conversion of tropical forests to monocultures of commodity crops like oil palm coffee and cocoa is not often mentioned in this context despite agroforestry s ability to improve such crops sustainability and in some cases yields too for its ongoing agroforestry series for instance mongabay recently interviewed a researcher in brazil who has documented greater yields from oil palms grown in agroforestry systems which also did not rely on chemical fertilizers or pesticides a practice for which oil palm monocultures are infamous now rubber can be added to the list of commodity crops which can get a sustainable makeover via agroforestry without suffering a loss in yields in the new report rubber agroforestry feasibility at scale authors maria wang eleanor warren thomas and thomas cherico wanger synthesize current knowledge of the environmental and social benefits of rubber agroforestry and provide detailed recommendations for large scale implementation across asia africa and latin america our report provides evidence that agroforestry yields are similar to those in rubber monocultures especially if the same planting density is maintained and high yielding planting material is used rubber yields in brazil even increased compared to monocultures when rubber was intercropped with beans says co author wanger in this exclusive interview not only does this system benefit carbon sequestration and crop diversification which increases farmers food security it also boosts biodiversity rubber plantations containing additional trees e g cocoa banana jackfruit and guava were also used by endangered golden headed lion tamarins and wied s marmosets as part of their home range in one example their report notes from brazil the trio of researchers discussed these findings with mongabay via email and their responses have been lightly edited for clarity and brevity mongabay rubber is mostly grown by smallholder farmers in monocultures across southeast asia what social and environmental costs come with this thomas cherico wanger indeed monocultures are the dominant farming method for rubber production in some of the most biodiverse areas of the world a major environmental cost is the reduction of natural forest cover to establish new rubber plantations the consequences are carbon emissions reduced carbon sequestration capacity plant and animal biodiversity loss and a decline in downstream ecosystem services such as clean drinking water biocontrol or pollination moreover monocultures increase the risk of soil erosion climate impacts and pest outbreaks relative to diversified or mixed systems these environmental impacts affect the entire rubber supply chain and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers despite the benefits that rubber cultivation can bring as a very valuable cash crop smallholders are also suffering from higher vulnerability to rubber price volatility without additional crops or products from their land they lose out when rubber prices fall what are the benefits for people environment and wildlife from rubber grown in agroforestry systems eleanor warren thomas what s really exciting about our report is that we provide very strong evidence that rubber agroforestry systems can provide multiple benefits on all these fronts for people to benefit from agroforestry these systems must work for them this may require technical information and support access to traditional knowledge or farmer networks but also policy environments that support farmers to diversify such as facilitating markets or modifying conditions for farmers subsidies on the environmental side evidence from china shows that simply intercropping secondary plants between rows of rubber trees whether tea cinnamon ginger or nitrogen fixing shrubs increases the amount of water getting into the soil and reduces soil erosion on the livelihoods side there are examples from laos liberia thailand sri lanka cote d ivoire and nigeria where intercropping with extra food crops or agroforestry with other cash crops improves food security and income in some cases agroforestry meant an additional meal available to households each day whereas in others it provided a social function that was highly valued in terms of biodiversity there is a spectrum of complexity in agroforestry systems from jungle like systems that yield very little rubber to very simple and clean intercropping systems systems with more complexity tend to support more biodiversity jungle rubber in indonesia has been shown to support forest dependent bird and plant species while even relatively simple intercropping systems in thailand contained more butterfly species than monocultures there are also benefits for understudied aspects of biodiversity such as soil macrofauna and microbes agroforests could also play a really important role as stepping stones in the landscape between remaining areas of natural forest as they are likely to be more wildlife friendly thanks to the additional vegetation cover it s also possible to improve bird diversity in rubber farms just by allowing more understory plants to grow but it s important to emphasize that none of the studied agroforestry systems can support as much biodiversity as natural undisturbed forest can you describe what a typical rubber agroforest looks like maria wang in the literature the term rubber agroforest has been used to describe widely different systems from jungle rubber with little management to production driven simple inter plantings of timber species like teak and mahogany with clonal rubber trees to a more complex mix of clonal rubber with two or more annuals perennial shrubs and trees short term intercropping of light demanding crops with young rubber trees is a common practice e g maize pineapple and banana a typical rubber agroforest in southern thailand could have rubber trees alongside fruit trees e g mangosteen snake fruit or salacca vegetables e g gnetum stink bean and sometimes timber trees e g ironwood or neem there is also a variety of livestock that can be part of the mix i e silvopasture we found reports of farmers keeping bees cows chickens pigs goats sheep fish ponds rabbits and snails in rubber plantations although larger livestock may damage trees what kinds of chemicals are normally applied to rubber crops maria wang the recommendations may differ by country but the chemicals normally applied include inorganic fertilizers e g nitrogen phosphate potassium and magnesium herbicides for weed control like glyphosate roundup and paraquat fungicides for disease control and stimulants e g ethephon in addition formic acid or sulfuric acid is often used as a coagulant for the latex agroforestry reduces the need for weeding because of increased plant cover and leguminous cover crops and manure reduce the need for fertilization however rubber disease is still an issue and some intercrops like cassava may be a carrier of white root rot rigidoporus lignosus current knowledge gaps include whether smallholders grow natural insecticides and if they typically apply green manure or livestock manure as fertilizer in their rubber agroforests or monoculture plantations both aspects should be considered when developing good agricultural practices for smallholders researchers in brazil have demonstrated higher yields for oil palms grown in agroforestry systems do we know what the yield is for agroforestry grown rubber thomas cherico wanger on average latex yields are the lowest in indonesia at around 1 ton ha and the highest in thailand at 1 8 tons ha however these yields differ between agroforestry practices for instance in indonesia jungle rubber produces only 0 5 tons ha but monocultures with clonal varieties can produce 1 8 tons ha much of this variation depends on the planting density of rubber trees which is low in jungle systems and the planting material so keeping these differences of agroforestry systems in mind our report provides evidence that agroforestry yields are similar to those in rubber monocultures especially if the same planting density is maintained and high yielding planting material is used rubber yields in brazil even increased compared to monocultures when rubber was intercropped with beans and studies from several countries have found intercropping has a positive effect on rubber tree growth and can lead to earlier commencement of tapping time it is indeed important to look beyond these yield benefits rubber agroforestry provides insurance against price volatility risk can reduce climate and pest impacts increase soil water content and thereby improve microclimatic conditions when compared to monocultures jungle rubber has been in production a very long time where is it most commonly grown in agroforestry systems today eleanor warren thomas the term jungle rubber is often used to define systems in indonesia where hevea rubber trees are planted under the natural forest canopies but these systems have only existed since the introduction of rubber to asia in the 19th 20th century but of course hevea brasiliensis is native to and widespread across the amazon tapping of latex from wild trees has the millennial history you are referring to we call this wild rubber in our report and mostly refers to brazil acre bolivia and peru this was hugely exploited by colonists during the 20th century rubber boom to the detriment of peoples living in the region and led to the rubber tappers social movement in acre in the late 20th century wild rubber tapping has now become almost unprofitable due to the low density of wild rubber trees and the distances needed to travel between them some communities still practice wild rubber tapping but it is rarely a main economic activity measuring the area of jungle rubber in indonesia is a really tricky thing to do as the canopy is often of natural forest trees it is not readily detectable from space using remote sensing in addition jungle rubber is often practiced in places that are hard to access and data on land management may be scarce so the best estimates of area come from government reports but the accuracy of these estimates is a bit unclear the area of jungle rubber systems elsewhere in asia is not really known there are a handful of known examples from thailand although these are monocultures gone wild rather than planting within natural forest and as it is prevalent in kalimantan there could also be areas of jungle rubber in malaysian borneo though it has a long history what is the future for agroforestry grown rubber who can help smallholder farmers transition to this sustainable method maria wang we found that national policies were an important factor determining the uptake of rubber agroforestry so national extension centers should ideally be involved for long term success and it wouldn t hurt to have well thought out policies to support smallholders financially and materially to try out agroforestry grassroots networks and farmer co ops are important to accelerate the transmission and adoption of agroforestry practices especially those that local farmers have found to work well for them icraf cirad and other research institutes and universities are well placed to provide evidence based recommendations for agroforestry practices as well as to conduct ongoing research global platform for sustainable natural rubber gpsnr has shown interest in agroforestry as one of the tools for transitioning to a sustainable rubber industry but more work needs to be done to move the focus from maximizing yields via conventional best practices to a more holistic approach involving the whole rubber agro ecosystem corporations can definitely play an important role in financing and increasing demand for agroforestry grown rubber in our report we highlight einhorn s partnership with agroforestry farmers in southern thailand which has helped the farmers secure a price premium and direct access to a dedicated processor thus contributing to the financial sustainability of agroforestry rubber however einhorn is a small company and can only purchase 30 35 of the agroforestry latex produced so there is definitely lots of room for other companies to step up and grow this industry what is the potential climate benefit of rubber agroforestry eleanor warren thomas clearance of natural forest to make way for rubber cultivation systems of any kind whether monoculture or agroforestry will result in carbon emissions from the vegetation and soil and huge biodiversity loss from the perspective of climate change and biodiversity conservation keeping natural forests in place and avoiding any deforestation is absolutely paramount but where land has already been cleared for cultivation rubber can offer greater carbon drawdown and storage than say annual crops and with agroforestry there are additional carbon benefits relative to monocultures after the initial carbon emissions from natural forest clearance to make way for rubber there are two key things to think about when it comes to carbon in rubber systems first the amount of carbon stored in the system by the plants growing on it and the soils in general adding more plant biomass to an agroforestry system will increase the amount of carbon sequestered and stored in that system so any system with more plants especially woody species will draw down and store more carbon second the cyclical process of plantation systems versus maintaining constant cover when rubber trees are felled at the end of a plantation cycle e g after 20 years some carbon is stored long term as timber but much is re emitted through burning or decomposition so it s not just the stock that matters but the so called time averaged carbon stock that tries to take this into account some agroforestry systems aren t cyclical some permanent jungle rubber agroforests exist which is best for carbon storage or are replanted on a 40 year cycle rather than a 20 year cycle which will have carbon benefits we have a very handy table in our report outlining carbon stock measurements from a range of systems if anyone is looking for numbers and more detail but generally yes agroforestry will offer greater carbon drawdown and storage than monocultures although the magnitude of the benefit will depend on the system gains in latex yields from rubber plantations have been driven lately by development of high yielding clones and improved tapping strategies are these applicable to agroforestry systems too thomas cherico wanger technically there are no limitations compared to monocultures agroforestry systems provide additional opportunities to reduce pest pressures and avoid climate impacts for instance if cover crops are planted soil erosion and nutrient runoff are reduced and secondary crops can increase humidity in rubber systems these mechanisms may help explain why rubber tree growth is reported to be greater in some agroforestry systems than in monocultures and why evidence so far shows yields are unaffected as for other agroforestry systems such as cocoa and coffee reducing climate impacts will avoid yield declines in the mid to long run so they provide additional benefits to these immediate yield boosters through clones and enhanced tapping strategies how long does a rubber agroforest remain productive are they typically cut and replaced at the rate of monocultures maria wang we have not come across any studies comparing the long term productivity of rubber agroforests versus monocultures but in both cases improved tapping methods can prolong the productive life of rubber trees and this is an area that needs more work in terms of farmer training and knowledge sharing in terms of cutting and replanting practices it really depends on the type of agroforest the farmers decisions and in some cases rules around subsidies in the case of traditional jungle rubber rubber trees are typically only replaced when they are well past their prime on an individual basis in timber rubber intercropping systems the cutting might be timed according to the lifecycle of the timber trees but in most cases where rubber trees are the primary source of income for the agroforest rubber is felled using a similar lifecycle to rubber monocultures which are typically cut and replaced after 20 30 years when latex production slows what are the main barriers to wider implementation of rubber agroforestry thomas cherico wanger although rubber agroforestry strategies have many benefits the uptake of agroforestry practices has been slow a main barrier for instance in thailand is policies in favor of monocultures that are only slowly transitioning towards promoting agroforestry systems from a smallholder perspective it is critical to ascertain land tenure rights to make long term investments worthwhile in addition high rubber prices make agroforestry practices less attractive because these systems generally require more labor to harvest intercrops in general labor shortages due to economic development and urban immigration are a key barrier for agroforestry implementation for producers there is also a lack of knowledge about agroforestry and a concern about rubber yield reductions in the context of tightly managed larger plantations the adoption of agroforestry or diversified planting would be a new and untested model but one which could provide long term benefits via improved soil quality and water use as such starting small testing how different intercrops are performing and then scaling up the successful cases is critical see related to save chocolate s future start now and go big on agroforestry what else do you want to share about your findings eleanor warren thomas a take home from all of this research is that we have found little evidence for negative impacts of adopting agroforestry practices in rubber systems so far we have found cases where agroforestry doesn t work well due to a lack of markets for secondary products or a shortage of labor but where farmers have choices to design systems that work for them the benefits are clear alongside many others we suggest that agroforestry may actually be a more precautionary and less risky approach for people s livelihoods their environments and the wider ecosystems we live in than monocultural practices and should be treated as such to quote from report overall creating an environment where farmers have access to knowledge information capital markets and importantly the autonomy to choose which components of agroforestry best suit their needs and constraints would allow them to exercise creativity and sovereignty in their farms and livelihoods access the full 125 page report about rubber agroforestry here this interview is part of mongabay s ongoing series about agroforestry

compensation from the links on this page btw prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting the marvel cinematic universe now contains over 20 films multiple tv shows spin off shorts and more as a newcomer it can be overwhelming and even revisiting your favourites can be a monumental task but it is possible whether it s by chronological order release date or just watching the highlights here s a few key ways you can watch every marvel cinematic universe tie in if you re a completionist and want the whole story comprehensive chronological order is the best way to kick off this article has been updated since its original publication how to watch the mcu in chronological order there s a lot of chapters in the marvel cinematic universe and not all of them were released on a chronological timeline this order contains everything the mcu has to offer in the order it happened note that some shows like runaways and cloak and dagger are technically in the mcu but don t operate within a strict timeline so they can be watched whenever we ve indicated our preference below captain america the first avenger agent carter season 1 2 agent carter one shot captain marvel iron man iron man 2 the incredible hulk the consultant one shot a funny thing happened on the way to thor s hammer one shot thor the avengers item 47 one shot iron man 3 all hail the king one shot thor the dark world captain america the winter soldier agents of shield season 1 guardians of the galaxy daredevil season 1 guardians of the galaxy vol 2 the avengers age of ultron agents of shield season 2 ant man daredevil season 2 jessica jones season 1 captain america civil war luke cage season 1 agents of shield season 3 spider man homecoming doctor strange black panther iron fist season 1 the defenders event series agents of shield season 4 the inhumans event series thor ragnarok jessica jones season 2 the punisher season 1 daredevil season 3 agents of shield season 5 the runaways seasons 1 3 cloak and dagger seasons 1 2 iron fist season 2 the punisher season 2 jessica jones season 3 ant man and the wasp avengers infinity war black widow avengers endgame spider man far from home wandavision the falcon and the winter soldier loki note it appears wandavision the falcon and the winter soldier and loki all take place simultaneously so they can be watched in any order but watching it chronologically isn t the only way to go and if you re strapped for time you might like to reconsider watching every tv show movie and one shot out there instead consider watching the movies in phases how to watch the mcu in phase order this order is fairly simple and groups the movies by their release dates each phase as defined by marvel is capped off by a large scale avengers movie which ties the phase together this is the order that the filmmakers intended and how the action originally unfolded but that doesn t mean you have to stick to it here s how the phases work and what order you might like to watch the movies and or tv shows in marvel phase one this phase introduced the main characters of the avengers saga and began the tale of the infinity stones iron man the incredible hulk iron man 2 thor captain america the first avenger the avengers marvel phase two this phase continued the adventures of our intrepid heroes introduced the space faring guardians of the galaxy and culminated in the ultron sovokia disaster that bleeds into the third phase of marvel iron man 3 agents of shield season 1 thor the dark world captain america the winter soldier guardians of the galaxy agents of shield season 2 avengers age of ultron ant man agents of shield season 3 daredevil season 1 jessica jones season 1 marvel phase three phase three is the largest of marvel s phases and introduces several new heroes that go on to play a pivotal role in the two part avengers finale these films and tv shows effectively draw the first lot of marvel entertainment stories to a close and open up the world to new heroes and tales in the future captain america civil war doctor strange agents of shield season 4 daredevil season 2 luke cage season 1 guardians of the galaxy vol 2 spider man homecoming thor ragnarok iron fist season 1 agents of shield season 5 the defenders miniseries black panther avengers infinity war ant man and the wasp daredevil season 3 jessica jones season 2 luke cage season 2 iron fist season 2 captain marvel agents of shield season 6 avengers endgame spider man far from home jessica jones season 3 marvel phase four wandavision the falcon and the winter soldier loki black widow in future this phase will also presumably include shang chi and the legend of the ten rings eternals spider man no way home doctor strange and the multiverse of madness thor love and thunder black panther wakanda forever the marvels ant man and the wasp quantumania and guardians of the galaxy vol 3 for now it s a much easier ride if that seems like too many hours of entertainment you can also consider being a bit pickier the most important marvel movies and tv shows to watch while marvel s television series can add a lot to every movie they re mostly considered supplemental material and aren t necessary to understand the whole story if you re looking to watch the marvel movies and don t want to get bogged down with hours of content there s plenty you can skip origin stories like doctor strange and the incredible hulk aren t necessary to understand the larger marvel narrative the spider man movies are fun but can also be skipped as can iron man 3 there are some movies on this list that rank low on marvel s best ofs list but these are still necessary for the larger plot here s every essential marvel movie you can t skip and the order you should watch them captain america the first avenger the first captain america takes place chronologically before every other marvel movie and introduces steve rogers one of the key players in the avengers saga while his origin story isn t essential the film introduces the tesseract an item which goes on to play a big role in the avengers also introduced is rogers best friend bucky barnes who also plays a pivotal role in the wider saga iron man while iron man is an origin story tony stark is the heart of the mcu making his story one of the most important you ll need to understand who he is as a person to understand how the films progress thor this film gives background to thor and loki s struggle and ties directly into the events of the avengers while the story isn t particularly compelling it s a great character study and reveals a lot about thor and his family the avengers the first crossover is the most essential not only does it introduce the concept of space monsters and aliens it also introduces audiences to thanos for the first time and showcases the character dynamics and teamwork of the avengers thor the dark world thor the dark world is often considered the worst of the marvel movies despite being boring and uninspired it does contain a key piece of infinity stone lore that you ll need to understand for the later films it also explains part of loki s journey towards redemption and how he ends up more involved in later films captain america the winter soldier the winter soldier features a key breaking point in the history of the avengers with villainous organisation hydra wreaking havoc on the team s support network it also introduces the winter soldier who goes on to play a larger part in the later avengers flicks and tv shows guardians of the galaxy this space faring adventure is mostly self contained but introduces the guardians of the galaxy who go on to play a pivotal role in the later avengers films this movie also introduces a new infinity stone and expands on the lore behind them avengers age of ultron age of ultron is the least essential avengers film but it sets up key dynamics and events that go on to impact the avengers in civil war it also introduces wanda maximoff aka the most powerful avenger captain america civil war it s here that the avengers go through their most difficult conflict as the team goes their separate ways this film also sets up the sokovia accords which dictate the powers that superheroes can use and gives a fairly good introduction for ant man if you want to skip his solo film thor ragnarok while thor ragnarok is mostly non essential viewing it is the funniest film of the bunch and the finale leads directly into the events of the final two avengers movies ant man and the wasp this film is also mostly standalone but the finale ties directly into the events of infinity war and endgame it also provides some essential character growth for hope van dyne avengers infinity war this film kicks off the beginning of the end for the avengers as we know them thanos finally rises to become the big bad and the entire saga of the infinity stones comes to a head the film leads directly into the final chapter of modern marvel stories avengers endgame this film is massive and totally essential it s the product of over ten years of build up and it absolutely doesn t disappoint as a major spectacle it also sets up the action of every major marvel tv show that followed wandavision this tv series kicked off a new phase for marvel and also set wanda maximoff on a very important path it s likely this show will connect with doctor strange in the multiverse of madness in a big way so it s essential viewing the falcon and the winter soldier this standalone story deals with the impact of steve rogers decisions in endgame and explores what it means to be captain america in the modern day like other recent tv shows it ll link directly into marvel s next phase loki how loki will connect to the future of marvel is currently unclear but given the universe hopping shenanigans in the show it s likely the story will play into future films like doctor strange 2 and spider man no way home while there are multiple disagreements about the best ways to watch marvel movies and tv shows it s important to remember that your enjoyment is key if you don t particularly like one movie or another it s easy enough to skip it and move on there s plenty of content out there to get started if you re looking to revisit the mcu or begin your journey for the first time disney has the vast majority of the movies released so far

by lawrence hurley washington reuters the u s supreme court on tuesday ruled in favor of a consortium of energy companies including enbridge nyse inc seeking to seize land owned by new jersey to build a federally approved pipeline despite the state s objections though hurdles remain for the 1 billion project the 5 4 ruling authored by conservative chief justice john roberts handed a victory to penneast pipeline company llc a joint venture seeking to build the 116 mile 187 km pipeline from pennsylvania to new jersey the justices overturned a lower court ruling in favor of new jersey s government other companies joining enbridge in the consortium include south jersey industries nyse inc new jersey resources nyse corp southern co nyse and ugi nyse corp the decision enables interstate pipelines to proceed with efforts to seize state owned lands without a state s consent as long as federal regulators have approved the project but new jersey attorney general gurbir grewal said the ruling does not end the state s fight against the penneast project we still have other ongoing legal challenges to this proposed pipeline which is unnecessary and would be destructive to new jersey lands grewal added as he urged the federal government to take another look at this harmful proposal climate activists native american groups and some states have increased opposition to pipeline construction across the united states shutting down some projects including the long planned keystone xl crude pipeline from canada few pipeline battles have been fought over eminent domain issues penneast wants the land to build a pipeline to deliver 1 1 billion cubic feet per day of gas enough to supply about 5 million homes from the marcellus shale formation in pennsylvania to customers in pennsylvania and new jersey penneast said it plans to put the first phase of the project about 68 miles 110 km of pipe in pennsylvania into service in 2022 and is targeting completion of the second phase the line from pennsylvania into new jersey in 2023 the court ruled that a 1938 u s law called the natural gas act that lets private energy companies seize necessary parcels of land for a project if they have obtained a certificate from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc can be applied to state owned land the law effectively gives private companies the power of eminent domain in which government entities can take property in return for compensation specifically we are asked to decide whether the federal government can constitutionally confer on pipeline companies the authority to condemn necessary rights of way in which a state has an interest we hold that it can roberts wrote in the ruling roberts added that the u s constitution s 11th amendment which prevents courts from hearing certain lawsuits against states does not bar the lawsuit as the state had argued we are pleased that the supreme court kept intact more than seven decades of legal precedent for the families and businesses who benefit from more affordable reliable energy this decision is about more than just the penneast project said anthony cox chair of the penneast board of managers ferc in 2018 approved penneast s request to build the pipeline the company then sued to gain access to properties along the route after a federal judge approved the property seizure the philadelphia based 3rd u s circuit court of appeals ruled in 2019 that penneast could not use federal eminent domain to condemn land controlled by the state prompting the appeal to the supreme court the court which has a 6 3 conservative majority was divided along non ideological lines roberts was joined in the majority by two conservative justices samuel alito and brett kavanaugh and two liberals stephen breyer and sonia sotomayor
economic recovery set to get further policy boost from chinadaily 2021 06 30 07 20 china s economic policies will remain generally stable to solidify the recovery in the second half of this year and the policy focus may increasingly shift toward curtailing risks at home and abroad according to policymakers and advisers as strong economic growth momentum continues policy measures should prevent external shocks to improve china s resilience and stabilize the overall leverage level in case global economic conditions change said economists who shared the policy outlook with china daily on tuesday in the second half of the year monetary policy normalization in china should continue to proceed cautiously unless inflation moves well above target and inflation expectations become unanchored sebastian eckardt the world bank s lead economist for china said on tuesday in an exclusive written interview with china daily his comment was based on an updated forecast on tuesday from the world bank which sees the world s second largest economy reaching gdp growth of 8 5 percent in 2021 thanks to pent up demand and strong exports the forecast marks an upward revision of 0 6 percentage point from the world bank s projections in december largely due to stronger than expected foreign demand the bank said in a report china s consumer price inflation is expected to remain below target this year despite the recent surge in imported raw material prices and firming domestic demand the bank predicted adding that the rise in inflation is most likely going to be transitory in the absence of excessive wage growth yi gang governor of the people s bank of china the central bank chaired the bank s quarterly monetary policy meeting on friday policymakers and advisers agreed that the monetary policy should remain prudent flexible and targeted and should keep liquidity ample at a reasonable level according to a meeting statement released on monday it was seen as an important meeting for setting the monetary policy tone for the second half said analysts according to the meeting s statement it is expected that the monetary policy stance will remain stable and neutral and it is difficult to see additional easing in the following months said ming ming a senior researcher at citic securities in recent months the policy mix has been reflected in tight to neutral financial conditions said shaun roache asia pacific chief economist with s p global we expect policies to remain broadly unchanged albeit with some targeted tightening especially in the property sector roache does not expect that inflationary pressures in china will force policy rate hikes because the pass through from high producer price inflation to consumer prices is typically weak china has already started to normalize policies and in terms of monetary actions the central bank allowed interest rates to rise and liquidity to tighten which has cooled credit growth and restrained leverage according to analysts as the recovery solidifies we expect the policy focus to increasingly shift toward deleveraging risks associated with high corporate leverage and inflated property markets will need to be closely monitored said eckardt of the world bank the pboc meeting highlighted prevention of external shocks as well as keeping the macro leverage level stable it also called for adjustments in the measure for setting the upper limits of deposit rates research tools for supporting carbon emission reduction and improved risk prevention capacity when the financial market opens up further the prospect of more hawkish monetary policy in the united states may cause some near term volatility in financial markets and cross border capital flows but associated risks should be manageable unless the policy adjustment is much faster and sharper than currently expected eckardt said so china may see more volatile two way cross border capital flows as financial markets continue to adjust to the varying speeds of covid 19 pandemic recovery and policy outlooks in major economies he added reflecting progressive efforts to reduce risks and deleverage as well as policy normalization and diminished support from net exports china s year on year gdp growth may moderate to 5 4 percent in 2022 when the low base effects dissipate the world bank predicted china has policy space to act at the central level and policymakers should be ready to use it in case private investment and consumption demand remain sluggish and external imbalances further increase the bank s economists suggested

100 export driven from the get go austrade helps establish credibility with us defence forces according to vornik the biggest challenge in setting up a defence electronics business in the us was establishing credibility that s where austrade helped we needed to pitch to high grade military and security personnel who protect defence establishments and sensitive assets says vornik nurturing those relationships took time but austrade helped in multiple ways austrade recommended finding a commercial partner while droneshield was building out its own business development team advisors

the us or france will frequently look to national tech companies first we have to show we can out compete australian exports built on home grown ingenuity the company has so far spent a 35 million in research and development all of it in australia vornik credits successful outcomes on his company s ability to source expertise locally a lot of our success is due to the quality of education in

cfos face rising heat to combat climate change from a range of stakeholders activists demand commitments to shrink carbon footprints investors want both green operations and robust profits regulators including the securities and exchange commission sec are gearing up to require detailed disclosures on climate risks when handling such pressure financial executives draw from an ill fitting set of tools they lack a single detailed framework for measuring climate risk that is recognized across industries markets and jurisdictions worldwide instead cfos must choose from among several systems that use different calculation methods and data definitions the result they often get just a loose grip on climate risk according to accountants and experts in sustainability measurement lack of standards and differences among standards can create barriers to climate risk management according to a commodity futures trading commission cftc panel it is extremely difficult for individual institutions to secure all the data necessary for detailed datasets cfos can still yield useful insights on the impact of climate change by following strategies that range from scenario planning and identifying their company s worst vulnerabilities to relying on the highest integrity data and separating estimates from facts the insights can reveal ways for cfos to curb risk eliminate waste and cut the cost of capital through green financing according to accountants and experts in sustainability measurement with a clearer view of a company s environmental social and governance esg performance a cfo can also improve capital allocation by identifying merger and acquisition opportunities or business lines that are difficult to switch to low carbon operations and ripe for divestiture more and more people are seeing opportunities with respect to esg creating new products developing new materials finding new ways to get a product to market according to robert hirth co vice chair of the sustainability accounting standards board sasb there s absolutely an increased demand for this reporting hirth said predicting that lenders and insurers at some point will routinely ask financial executives for esg performance data jimtyson cfo dive data from ifac cfos can find big vulnerabilities when gauging climate change impact the accountants and experts in sustainability measurement said for example fannie mae and freddie mac government sponsored enterprises guaranteed 6 88 trillion in mortgage debt in 2019 without pricing flood risk into their guarantee fees also the value of assets at fossil fuel companies worldwide might fall from between 250 billion and 1 2 trillion during the transition to alternative energy the cftc s climate related market risk sub committee said in a september report at the same time cfos who identify and curtail climate risks or who help speed the transition to clean energy can reduce their companies cost of capital in a high profile example of the payoff from sustainable business tesla s share price has surged more than sevenfold since the start of 2020 lesser known companies focused on battery technology and solar or wind power have scored spectacular gains as well in the less glamorous market for municipal bonds most counties pay less in underwriting fees and bond yields than their counterparts that are vulnerable to climate change meanwhile lending for sustainable business is growing jp morgan chase and bank of america have recently committed 2 5 trillion and 1 5 trillion respectively toward low carbon business and sustainability during the coming decade cfos slow to go green may soon get a nudge from u s regulators sec chair gary gensler aims to require companies to disclose their response to climate change risks including details on metrics such as greenhouse gas emissions treasury secretary janet yellen in april backed the sec s push for disclosure and said the treasury will consider ways to promote the biden administration s greenhouse gas reduction goals through taxation international cooperation and economic policy also the federal reserve in january announced the creation of a supervision climate committee to develop an appropriate program to ensure the resilience of supervised firms to climate related financial risks high hurdles cfos face several challenges as they follow regulatory pressure and try to translate climate change data into actionable metrics for strategic planning such as capital allocation and risk management when considering the impact of climate change financial executives need to shift to a much longer time horizon rather than focus on quarterly or year end reporting they need to think in periods extending a decade or several decades in the future according to rebecca self director of sustainable finance at south pole a carbon finance consultancy cfos also need to keep in mind that when they extend the forecast duration they need to adapt to greater imprecision and uncertainty accountants are used to dealing with very rigorous audit requirements compliance requirements very precise sets of reporting according to self an accountant and former cfo for sustainable finance at hsbc holdings turning that to climate change and these long time frame scenarios like the paris agreement is really challenging also financial executives should recognize that vulnerabilities from climate change often vary much more across a company than credit interest rate currency and other types of risk for example a petrochemical plant near the louisiana coast is more at risk than company headquarters on high ground physical climate risks can get very detailed even down to building type and building construction self said in an interview cfos need to delve into really granular things including whether a building has steps from ground level measuring climate risks also requires taking into account complex indirect costs to stakeholders such as vendors employees and neighboring communities as public companies start reporting on esg they also get pressure to report more on their supply chain hirth said last month in a webcast hosted by the american institute of certified public accountants investors and customers will ask cfos how their supply chain has helped them meet their zero carbon goals when choosing how to measure their companies climate impact financial executives must pick from a jumble of inconsistent frameworks that vary in scope and depth of detail hirth calls the myriad systems the alphabet soups of esg reporting some companies simultaneously use as many as four different frameworks companies in the u s and germany most commonly follow a system created by the global reporting initiative while their counterparts in the u k and france favor the united nations sustainable development goals the international federation of accountants ifac said in a recent study with so many systems in use climate data measurement technologies and methods for risk analysis widely vary according to the cftc subcommittee significant gaps in sectors and across asset classes are impeding not only climate risk management but also aspects of operations and investment analysis that depend on data informed processes the subcommittee said information is not comparable causing measurement divergences current measurement systems are especially ill suited for banks according to the bank for international settlements bis existing analysis does not generally translate changes in climate related variables into changes in banks credit market liquidity or operational risk exposures or bank balance sheet losses the bis said in a recent study the accounting profession has yet to turn climate change data into numbers that accurately gauge the full range of financial risks according to arnaud picut the global head of risk practice at finastra a software provider to financial institutions the underlying financial risk across the wider spectrum has been dealt with on the fringe or not at all consensus building industry and government standard setters aim to build a uniform system for esg disclosure but achieving consensus may take some time hirth said the next couple of years will probably be a little rough as we work towards moving from all these different frameworks to agreeing on something while flagging the inconsistency of reporting methods ifac said most companies threaten market stability by failing to subject their sustainability reports to quality independent assurance low quality assurance is an emerging investor protection and financial stability risk ifac said adding that only 51 of 1 400 companies worldwide back up their esg reports with assurance with many of them relying on consultants rather than professional accountants when gauging climate change risks cfos need to capture several categories of data from sources outside their enterprise resource planning system financial executives need to determine which data to capture and how they will define it organizations follow different definitions for even greenhouse gas emissions some companies have entered into supply arrangements where they have a contractual commitment to report on greenhouse gas emissions wes bricker vice chair and assurance leader at pwc said in an interview what if i ve got multiple customers with different definitions according to bricker sec chief accountant from 2015 until 2019 by overcoming the above challenges cfos can make progress toward reliably translating climate change data into gaap and ifrs treatment of goodwill intangible assets valuation of inventory and other topics the accountants and experts in sustainability measurement said at the end of the day those are the metrics that determine things like your capital management and your profitability according to kelly hereid director of catastrophe research and development at liberty mutual if you can understand at what point is climate change so significant that it would change your risk appetite then you can actually start making decisions based on it cfos can take several steps to turn the obligation to report on climate change risks into an opportunity to gain insights for improving their business the accountants and sustainability measurement experts said 1 favor credible readily obtainable data financial executives should first focus on data that can be captured and confirmed as credible bricker said for example a cfo can determine a company s greenhouse gas emissions by a combination of verifiable data and estimations clearly differentiating between the two as in any financial reporting start with what we know identify what we don t know and create estimates clearly identifying what s known and what s been estimated bricker said financial executives should also clearly define the several types of data used in gauging climate risk and ensure definitions align for use both inside and outside the company cfos can have a really positive impact by helping their internal users as well as their external stakeholders focus on what s important in curbing the costs of climate change bricker said they are increasingly spending time with external stakeholders so that they understand reporting by the business what it conveys where to locate the disclosure 2 set short term milestones while pursuing long term goals a cfo can ensure measurable progress in shrinking a company s carbon footprint by defining several near term milestones across a long term planning horizon the accountants and sustainability measurement experts said a series of short term goals can reassure staff investors and other stakeholders that the company is on course or help it determine when to make changes to meet its objectives i see cfos watching a long term planning horizon with near term milestones extra measurements and accountability to know whether they re on track bricker said 3 use scenario planning to frame long term uncertainties by using scenario planning financial executives can pursue their objectives for carbon emissions during the coming decades within a high low range of possible costs and opportunities the analysis doesn t pretend to be a perfect vision or forecast of what the future will be self said it s about running those different scenarios running different what if questions that are long term in nature so they can help inform your decision making today 4 rank vulnerabilities focusing on the biggest a cfo can limit the cost and period of analysis by focusing on identifying a company s largest physical climate risks whether drought flooding heat or storm and prioritizing them across locations and business lines the accountants and sustainability measurement experts said such analysis using geospatial and other data will probably reveal high risks in a few places self said and in line with the pareto principle show that most risk resides in about 20 of a portfolio companies should be focusing on where the losses are actually happening and where our scientific certainty is the highest hereid said this month during a liberty mutual panel discussion for example estimates of risk from storm surge flooding are comparatively reliable through 2030 and may justify moving warehousing or other operations to higher ground by identifying the biggest risks early a cfo can avert unnecessary research and confidently say i need to do a much deeper dive in this particular location self said without prioritizing you could almost go on forever going down to very fine detail 5 focus on specific metrics among u s companies studied by ifac that publish esg disclosures 31 provided reports based on a framework recommended by the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd created by the financial stability board at the request of the group of 20 nations tcfd describes 11 types of disclosures across four areas governance strategy risk management and metrics and targets the tcfd provides only a framework not in depth details on how to measure climate risk for specific measurement guidelines bricker recommends that cfos follow sasb standards which describe sustainability disclosures for 77 industries across 11 sectors forty eight percent of u s companies use sasb according to ifac cfos should ride rather than resist the rising tide for esg disclosures hirth said you ve got to tell your story at the end of the day to attract your investors and satisfy your individual stakeholders financial executives he said should view sustainability disclosures not as a cost but as a way to focus on some factors that make you a better company that reduces risk that makes you more attractive to customers more attractive to employees gives you a better supply chain
