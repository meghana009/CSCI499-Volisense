close to its 10 week line msft stock is flashing buy signals but market conditions raise concerns amd stock amd stock did rebound tuesday but otherwise had a difficult week retreating 3 8 to 138 55 shares are moving back toward their 10 week line that could provide a buying opportunity assuming amd stock bounces if amd stock struggles at that level it would be a bad sign for rival nvidia nvda which has held up better in recent weeks and chip stocks overall nxp stock nxp semiconductor stock whipsawed last week breaking out powerfully on tuesday but pulling back below the 227 60 cup with handle buy point on a wednesday sell rating since then nxp stock has been trading just above the 21 day line and below the buy point shares dipped 0 3 to 226 46 for the week if there s a confirmed market rally there s a good chance the auto and wireless chip maker will clear the buy point decisively but if the market reverses nxp very likely will fall back adobe stock adobe stock rebounded 6 15 last week to 654 45 trading just above its 50 day line and below an old 659 29 buy point that s no longer valid investors could buy this long term leader off the 50 day line but probably should wait until earnings on thursday it ll be an important report for business software makers generally which are trying to rebound after big sell offs tesla stock tesla stock edged up 0 2 to 1 017 03 last week but it was another wild ride shares tumbled below their 50 day line and recent lows on monday but closed above that key level a midweek rebound hit resistance at the 21 day line then like a lot of growth stocks tsla stock sold off thursday before a slight bounce on friday the ev giant is working on a new base though that needs another week to form with a likely 1 202 05 buy point drawing a trend line from the record high could offer an early entry around 1 150 if tesla can rebound decisively that would likely reflect on and spur gains among other ev plays as well as highly valued growth stocks generally that s key given how narrow the market leadership has been but a sharp sell off including a clear close below recent lows would be a negative sign for tsla stock and the market it would put the 900 50 buy point from the long cup consolidation at risk rivian stock rivian stock came out like a lion racing from a 75 ipo price on nov 9 to a 179 47 intraday peak in just five sessions but since then the ev startup has tumbled back starting to consolidate generally between 100 120 shares rallied 9 5 to 114 66 last week motor trend named the rivian r1t its truck of the year after previously declaring the lucid air the car of the year rivian reports earnings on thursday for the first time since its ipo with only minimal deliveries of its r1t ev pickup rivian revenue will remain low with hefty losses so investors will be looking for guidance on a production ramp for the r1t and when the r1s suv will debut as well as mass production of delivery vans for amazon com amzn a key rivian investor rivian will announce a new vehicle assembly and battery plant in georgia bloomberg news reported friday evening citing sources that followed local reports along those lines the announcement will likely come thursday the same day as earnings rivian already has a factory in normal illinois but there is no question that rivn stock is highly speculative if rivian stock rebounds especially after earnings it will soon have a deep ipo base with a 179 57 buy point investors may want to look for earlier entries perhaps in the 120 125 area even with its big retreat rivian stock has a market cap of 102 billion higher than general motors gm 91 8 billion and ford motor f 86 billion ford owns a hefty stake of rivian as well and surged to a long term high on friday the rivian valuation is positive for tesla stock if rivian stock can have a valuation north of 100 billion with just a handful of deliveries that certainly justifies tesla s 1 trillion valuation as the company has topped a 1 million delivery run rate why this ibd tool simplifies the search for top stocks market rally analysis a new stock market rally attempt got underway this past week with strong gains but then paused late in the week that s not that unusual in early october the major indexes rebounded for three days then pulled back slightly over the next three sessions before the market began its decisive move higher the market performed fairly well on friday given the hot inflation data and the prospect of a faster fed taper and for the week all the major indexes had strong gains regaining their 50 day lines and closing in the upper third of their ranges the s p 500 index moved to an all time closing high on friday however much of the market rally s strength has been in apple microsoft and google the three most valuable stocks the russell 2000 had a solid percentage gain for the week though it fell back below its 200 day line on thursday and edged lower on friday as the big cap indexes powered higher the small cap index closed just below the midpoint of its weekly range the action of growth stocks was mixed with the ffty etf also unable to hold its 200 day line losers outpaced winners once again on friday continuing a weekslong trend with only a few exceptions new lows outnumbered new highs especially on the nasdaq ultimately the stock market rally attempt still needs a follow through day until there is a confirmed uptrend or the major indexes undercut recent lows the market direction is in flux it s possible that the fed meeting announcement could be a catalyst for a confirmed market rally or a renewed sell off but a decisive move may come before the fed meeting or not at all keep in mind that confirmed market rallies don t always work if market breadth remains narrow making gains could be difficult even as the major indexes advance time the market with ibd s etf market strategy what to do now early last week aggressive traders might have

chatham asset management llc a private investment firm which manages funds that beneficially own approximately 14 9 of the outstanding common stock of r r donnelley sons company and which is the largest bondholder of the company responded to a press release issued today by rrd regarding its acceptance of a revised proposal from affiliates of atlas holdings llc to acquire the company for 10 35 per share in cash in a letter sent to rrd s board of directors chatham submitted an increased binding fully financed offer to acquire all the common stock of the company not already owned by chatham for 10 85 per share in cash chatham s increased offer will expire at 11 59 p m et on december 13 2021 unless it receives a countersigned merger agreement from the company chatham said rrd s board has once again shirked its fiduciary duties and deprived stockholders of receiving a higher price for their shares by refusing to meaningfully engage with chatham and agreeing to an inferior transaction with a higher entirely avoidable termination fee and expense reimbursement we urge the board to act in the best interest of its stakeholders declare our increased offer superior and proceed quickly to finalizing our proposed transaction the full text of the letter follows december 9 2021 the board of directors r r donnelley sons company 35 west wacker drive chicago illinois 60601 ladies and gentlemen chatham asset management llc together with its affiliates we us or chatham the company s largest stockholder and debtholder is writing in response to the press release issued by r r donnelley sons company rrd or the company a short while ago that the company intends to proceed with its previously announced transaction with affiliates of atlas holdings llc atlas following atlas increased bid to 10 35 per share despite the company issuing a press release on december 1 2021 stating that its negotiation period with atlas would expire on december 7 2021 the company s board of directors the board continued those negotiations for an additional two business days and refused to meaningfully engage with us or approach us with respect to countering any new offer since declaring chatham s proposal to purchase all shares of rrd not currently owned by chatham at a price equal to 10 25 per share a superior proposal under the terms of the atlas merger agreement in fact rather than engage with us during this time the board just agreed to write atlas an even bigger check if the company signs a deal with us by increasing the termination fee and expense reimbursement payable to atlas from 20 million to 32 million thereby depriving stockholders of approximately 0 39 per share that could have been completely avoided if the board had engaged with us back in october when we made our initial bid to acquire the company the board s determination to avoid signing a deal with chatham at all costs flouts any measure of good corporate governance and the directors fiduciary duties and is having a deleterious effect on all rrd stakeholders this behavior must stop the board s conduct is creating confusion in the market and for all rrd stakeholders causing a serious delay in consummating a transaction and threatening to deprive stockholders of receiving the maximum price for their shares this is not how a public company should run an orderly sale process nevertheless chatham is prepared to top atlas offer and is hereby increasing its offer to purchase all common stock of rrd not already owned by chatham at a price equal to 10 85 per share our offerremains a fully financed all cash firm offer our revised offer continues to be supported by a debt commitment letter led by jefferies finance llc in an aggregate amount of up to 1 675 billion a capital commitment letter from chatham in an amount of up to 400 million a rollover of all shares of common stock of rrd beneficially owned by chatham having a value of approximately 118 6 million based on our proposed purchase price of 10 85 per share and the equitization and or subordination into pik instruments of up to 795 3 million of the aggregate principal amount of rrd s outstanding notes that chatham currently owns which represents approximately 57 3 of rrd s outstanding notes including more than 50 of the company s 6 125 senior secured notes due november 2026 assuming all 795 3 million of the company s outstanding notes are equitized or subordinated by chatham the company will reduce its annual interest expense by approximately 60 9 million all other proposed terms set forth in the merger agreement and related documents delivered to the company concurrently with this letter remain applicable to this offer while we understand that the board is contractually bound to give atlas two business days to respond to our latest offer we urge the board to limit that time and engage with us before issuing any new mid market announcements this offer will expire at 11 59 p m et on december 13 2021 unless we receive a countersignature to our merger agreement sincerely anthony melchiorre managing member source chatham asset management the preceding press release was provided by a company

washington rising prices throughout the economy threaten to swamp the white house s legislative agenda during a critical moment for president joe biden as persistently high inflation spooks both voters and lawmakers a government report released friday showed that prices have risen nearly 7 in the past year the biggest one year surge since the early 1980s a combination of soaring demand and supply disruptions has for many americans tarnished an otherwise robust economic recovery subscribe to the post most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from the washington post the legislative implications of the new report could be immense the primary democratic holdout on biden s 2 trillion tax and spending package is sen joe manchin of west virginia manchin for months has cited inflation as one of his primary reasons for urging democrats to proceed with caution arguing that pumping more money into the economy could make inflation worse not better since manchin began airing concerns inflation has only intensified in the united states and spread to a broader range of consumer products including gasoline rent and groceries senate democrats had hoped they could pass the spending measure in the next two weeks but they do not have the votes if manchin remains noncommittal manchin didn t comment on the new inflation report friday and the senator will speak to the president early next week about the spending bill and inflation the white house said asked friday if he could get manchin on board to support the social spending plan biden said he was unsure i don t know the answer to that the president told reporters biden and his allies attempted to deflect mounting criticism of inflation by saying the new spending package is necessary to help americans deal with rising costs they said the spending package is designed to reduce families costs on household items such as prescription drugs housing and health care on friday biden blamed supply chain dysfunction not government spending for pushing prices higher still he referred to the current inflationary surge as a real bump in the road i think you ll see it change sooner quicker more rapidly than most people think every other aspect of the economy is racing ahead it s doing incredibly well biden said but inflation is affecting people s lives he also said that prices on some products in recent days have eased a dynamic that white house officials believe wasn t reflected in the new data this line of reasoning though has proved to be a tough political sell republicans argued that the inflation data showed the white house should abandon its spending plan altogether on friday senate republicans touted a report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office outlining how the cost of the biden economic program would be much higher if the programs it created last 10 years democrats dismissed the report as misleading because they have said they would pay for any extensions of the programs with new revenue even with these big red flags the biden administration and my democrat colleagues would rather spend trillions more on liberal wish list items with money we don t have instead of getting the problem under control sen shelley moore capito r w va said in a statement these efforts will hit american families with higher prices and greater tax burdens when they can least afford it administration officials are taking pains to emphasize that inflation is just one part of an economy that is otherwise strong by many measures roughly 13 million americans quit their jobs between august and october in part because they had better opportunities and pay elsewhere a trend with no precedent the economy has created more than 6 million jobs since biden took office something that has also never happened before the stock market is up roughly 25 and economic growth is surging far faster than most analysts predicted before this year and the stock market continued to climb friday even after the inflation figures were released because many investors believe the economy is set for more growth in 2022 on thursday in anticipation of the inflation report white house chief of staff ron klain released a video with charts illustrating ways in which the economy had healed with remarkable speed under the president s tenure klain and other senior administration officials have on twitter expressed discontent with what they believe is the media s focus on negative economic trends on friday shortly after the big inflation report was released klain took to twitter again this time to say that gas prices are now below 3 10 a gallon in one third of states i understand why the white house is frustrated we ve had the media consistently emphasizing the bad things while downplaying or outright ignoring what are really positive things in the economy said dean baker a liberal economist the media has been finding people who claim to be experiencing real hardship in the economy and telling stories that are either not true or if they are true are incredibly idiosyncratic but other economists including many liberals and allies of the white house say that voter frustration with the economy reflects real challenges facing millions of americans primarily inflation that has reversed the growth in wages in the u s recovery rapid job growth and plentiful job openings are helping people at the bottom of the income distribution and economic growth is recovering at a faster pace than from any other recent major downturn yet most american families are seeing their wage increases erased by staggering price hikes over the last year according to jason furman an economist who served in the obama administration price increases are hitting every part of the income distribution including the vast middle class across key household necessities like fuel food and housing the rapid recovery of jobs at the bottom is critical for the lowest wage americans including millions who have for decades suffered from sluggish economic growth but primarily helps a relatively small portion of the country s population and voting base americans have more money in their bank accounts compared to before the pandemic due to stimulus checks and other coronavirus relief measures approved by the government that boosted family net worth but that boost is starting to fade stimulus payments were disbursed more than six months ago and families received comparable amounts of government aid under the trump administration the typical family is spending an extra 4 000 this year because of excess inflation furman said it does not seem like much of a mystery why people are upset when they have to spend thousands of additional dollars more because of inflation the white house has said it is taking a range of actions designed to head off inflation from coordinating a release of the gas reserves to looking at anti competitive behavior in a range of industries pushing up consumers prices still some white house allies are urging the administration not to fixate on the media and instead emphasize that the president s economic agenda is designed to address strains on family budgets i understand they re frustrated they re not getting any credit for the good stuff happening in the economy one outside adviser in touch with white house officials said but this media conspiracy theory the idea that this is driven by the media is a bit much ninety two percent of americans say they re concerned about inflation name anything else 92 of americans agree about whatever the cause there is growing evidence that voters are blaming biden for high prices in a way that could spell political disaster for democrats in 2022 roughly 70 of americans rate the economy negatively with nearly half of americans and political independents blaming biden for inflation according to a recent washington post abc poll biden s approval rating on the economy has fallen dramatically the poll found with 55 of the country now viewing his economic stewardship negatively compared to just 39 who view it positively republicans say attempts to reframe the economy as a success for the country could backfire on biden by making the white house appear out of touch the more the white house tries to claim that the economy is hunky dory while families are struggling to fill their gas tank and put food on the table the more out of touch they look said chris hartline communications director for the national republican senatorial committee voters just don t believe them some white house officials have become exasperated by the negative perception of the economy because they believe it has made a remarkable turnaround since biden took office as first reported by cnn white house officials in recent days have briefed the television networks about the supply chain crisis in an attempt to improve economic coverage many liberal economists have echoed the administration s frustrations it is surprising to me there s so little attention to very low unemployment very historically low black unemployment very little receipt of unemployment insurance unprecedented growth of jobs said larry mishel an economist at the economic policy institute a left leaning think tank rep tim ryan d ohio said democrats should not downplay the extent of inflation and instead emphasize that the white house is taking steps to address it through the build back better agenda ryan said former president barack obama and 2016 presidential candidate hillary clinton were hurt by democrats at the time who tried talking about the strength of the economy under the obama administration even though many americans didn t feel like the economy was strong democrats now risk making a similar mistake ryan said you have to acknowledge where people are and the squeeze they are under if we learned anything from the obama to clinton they said the economy is going great and people say not really not for us said ryan who is running for the u s senate you have to acknowledge the pain the people are under and emphasize that s what s driving the agenda related content

listen to this article listen to this article when cities consider requests for tax increment financing or school districts seek help with bond referendums people like greg crowe at roseville based ehlers are oftentimes crunching the relevant numbers behind the scenes ehlers a provider of public finance services for 1 500 clients in five states recently promoted crowe to president an ehlers employee since 2012 crowe previously worked as a senior municipal adviser and principal for the company s education finance team previously the grand rapids minnesota native worked as the primary budget analyst for education finance and co controller for the minnesota house of representatives according to his company bio as the company s new president crowe takes the baton from jeff eaton who announced plans to retire at the end of the year in the following interview crowe talks about his new role with the company the outlook for the bond market the balancing act that school districts walk as they consider bond referendums and more the interview has been edited for length and clarity q talk about your time at ehlers and how you advanced to your current position a i actually have been at ehlers for just over nine years now before that i spent almost 20 years at the state house of representatives as a nonpartisan budget analyst working primarily on k 12 education finance so when it came to ehlers it was a natural transition to continue to work with school districts we work with tax exempt bond issuers and cities counties townships schools across minnesota and wisconsin primarily but also do some work in kansas colorado and illinois i ve been doing that for as i said just over nine years during that time i became part of our management team and became the leader of our internal operating team that works with school districts i ve done that for about six years so when this opportunity came up it seemed like a natural fit given where we are right now and given where i am in my experience i m excited about what the future holds q talk specifically about what you do for school districts do you work with them on bond referendums things of that nature a for our education group one of the biggest things that we focus on is bond referendums and capital projects for school districts white bear lake school district for example passed a bond referendum over 300 million it s the largest in the state we helped them design the financing in a way that would meet their capital needs while at the same time being responsive to their taxpayers and the board s feelings about tax impact and things like that on the municipal side we do bond insuance of course but we also do economic development tif work and rate studies for different municipal governments so a little bit broader practice when it comes to city and county work versus the school district work q talk a bit more about your work with communities on tif a we have a fiduciary responsibility to our public sector clients so our goal is to help them make sure that what they re doing is best for them and so we re approaching the table helping those municipal entities from that side of it q tif is something we hear about all the time but i m not sure the meaning is well understood can you define tif a i ll give you broad strokes if you want to get deep into tif we have some experts i d love to refer you to but generally tax increment financing reserves a certain amount of the tax base growth that happens with the development and uses that to help encourage the development q can you give us a read the current bond market is this a good time to issue bonds a rates are at historic lows right now generally there s a lot of uncertainty around inflation and some of the fed discussions but we re seeing a lot of demand still for tax exempt municipal debt and there s a lot of activity when we conduct competitive sales of those bonds we re seeing rates coming in still relatively low some of the index indexes that we follow ticked up a bit in october but then have fallen back a little bit again so in the short term we aren t seeing a lot of upward pressure on rates but when you re at really low levels that s really where the pressure is right q getting back to school districts they have certain capital needs but they also want to make sure that they come up with a bond referendum plan that will be acceptable to taxpayers how do you help them walk that tightrope a they re obviously acutely aware of the deficiencies that they have in their capital plans and the needs that they have when they ve identified those and prioritize those that s when we step in and say here are some options for how you potentially finance improvements to your facilities the first thing on their minds is improving education opportunities for students but they also need to be responsive to their taxpayers and so that s one of our areas of expertise where we work with them to identify what opportunities they might have that would minimize or mitigate tax impact or sometimes come with no tax impact and then if they do have to ask their voters to approve some sort of financing that has a tax impact what s the best way to manage that in a way that s satisfactory to them while they often come with tax increases there s also the long term planning that goes into making sure that once those taxes are in place that they re predictable and sustainable and we work with them on that that can include different types of bond issuance different structures different timing all of those things come into play when we re working with the school district q talk a little more about your background are you from the twin cities a i am a proud graduate of grand rapids high school in northern minnesota and went to college at st john s university and graduate school at the university of minnesota minnesota is definitely my home and i enjoy being here and i really enjoy serving the communities in minnesota over the last eight or nine years i think i ve traveled on just about every highway in the state visiting those school districts and other clients i m proud to be from here and i m very happy when we re able to help those communities i m working on a bond issue right now with grand rapids school district where i graduated from and so it s a way for me to continue to feel connected to those communities that are really important to me q talk a bit about your vision for the company a we have a significant presence in minnesota and wisconsin i actually lived in madison for a while so i do have some wisconsin ties as well even though i call minnesota home over the last three years we ve done a bit of a reset in terms of where we want to be at as a firm and we had a longtime president who served us very well the board had specific direction for the president who s retiring now he s been able to accomplish much of that sort of repositioning and reset and so we re at a really good place we ve had record profitability over the last couple of years my goal in the short term is just to make sure that we re continuing on the path that we started down and i think we re at a place where we need continuity in our leadership but we don t need to stay status quo so my vision going forward is to continue to keep our focus on our clients and the importance of our teams the folks that work here we re an employee owned company so people have a vested interest in our success and in each other s success and that s very important to me i would say internally i m pretty well known as a good team builder so i just want to expand that and keep building the teams that we have our success is based on the people that we bring into our organization and so i want to make sure that we continue that history of success like this article gain access to all of our great content with a month to month subscription start your subscription here

real or artificial it s been a bit difficult lately to find a quality christmas tree it hasn t always been that way just a few years ago at least three prominent tree farms operated in bartholomew county but one of them hackman tree farm at 12076 w county road 50s didn t open this holiday season diana hackman says she and her husband roger decided to retire from the christmas tree business at the end of last year the pandemic kind of booted us along that way and we just haven t reopened diana hackman said meanwhile the tower family christmas tree farm on west lowell road closed for the season immediately after their busiest day of the year the saturday after thanksgiving our suppliers only gave us two thirds of what we ordered co owner cathy tower explained and we had to recall about 100 trees because they were too dry and their needles were falling off we ended up having a very short season but if you are in the market there is one tree farm that at last check was still open the 35 year old romine tree farm located at 16747 huffer road hope the farm still had about 45 cut trees to sell early this week owners mark and carol romine said while there were between 20 and 30 white pines available for customers who prefer to cut their own tree some of that inventory is about 4 to 5 feet tall and may be smaller than some families prefer carol romine said the challenges although covid 19 has certainly impacted christmas tree sales it differs from place to place tower said for example many people wanted real trees last year because it gave them a reason to get out of the house at the height of the pandemic she said as a result christmas tree farms oversold which left a bit of a shortage since you should always keep some trees for the next year tower said along with only receiving a partial order with many in poor condition those were the reasons why tower closed a few days after thanksgiving another adverse reason was last summer s heat and drought that plagued the pacific northwest it s a region that is the largest producer of live trees in the u s with about 5 million cut annually that account for nearly 25 of the national supply the hot and dry weather in the pacific northwest reduced that stock by about 10 according to doug hundley spokesman for the national christmas tree association another problem is that it takes several years for a christmas tree to grow to full size during the financial crisis of 2008 many growers didn t have the funding to plant a lot of trees although that didn t create a shortage in itself it did reduce bargain prices by keeping supply and demand at nearly the same level hundley said as a result prices for live trees have been about 5 to 10 higher than last year he added due to its blue green needles with silvery undersides the fraser fir is one of the most popular christmas trees the stiff branches hold ornaments well the tree itself gives off a pleasant aroma and the needle retention is considered excellent the problem is that there are few if any fraser firs left that haven t already been bought tower said we ve been trying to get some from somewhere else and they just aren t available she said limited choices those inclined to buy an artificial tree this year can expect to pay 10 to 30 more than last year according to jami warner executive director of the american christmas tree association a trade group representing the artificial tree industry supplies of artificial trees largely coming from china are being affected by the same shipping and labor problems plaguing many industries warner said it s not easy to operate a christmas tree farm and carol romine said she and her husband had once considered closing their operation but instead they simply scaled back their operation to a more manageable level she said folks have been coming here for generations and many like to bring their families carol romine said we like seeing people at christmastime and when they come here they are always happy in addition to trees the romines also sell wreaths and grave blankets on the weekends there s an effort to entire families to visit the farm by providing children with hayrides and horseback rides mark romine said

washington ap government reports on rising inflation and the potential costs of president joe biden s social and environment legislation raised fresh questions friday about the bill s fate with both sides hoping the new numbers would influence pivotal sen joe manchin the moderate manchin d w va has spent months forcing democrats to trim the 10 year 2 trillion package arguing it s too expensive and at times citing growing inflation as a reason to slow work on the bill on friday the labor department said consumer prices grew last month at an annual rate of 6 8 the highest in 39 years a separate report from the nonpartisan congressional budget office said that if many of the bill s temporary spending boosts and tax cuts were made permanent it would add 3 trillion to the price tag that would more than double its 10 year cost to around 5 trillion democrats called the projections from the republican requested report fictitious manchin aides did not respond to requests for comment manchin said in a brief interview thursday that he wanted to know where we are in inflation and where we are on the true price of the bill adding he was very concerned the latest inflation figures prompted biden to use some of his strongest language yet telling reporters at the white house on friday i think this is the peak of the crisis while the numbers illustrate a clear political danger for the administration the recent performance of financial markets suggests investors don t see inflation as a long term problem friday s reports popped out two weeks before christmas by when senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y hopes to end months of talks among democrats and finally push a compromise bill through the senate the house approved an initial version last month with manchin still seeking cuts in a measure that originally cost 3 5 trillion the day s reports at the least increased his leverage in a tortuous process that s already seen several near death moments caused by democratic infighting at worst the numbers fueled worries that manchin might abandon the package sinking it i don t know the answer to that biden said at the white house when asked if he could win manchin s support he said he d talk to the lawmaker early next week every democrat in the 50 50 chamber will have to back the bill so vice president kamala harris can cast a tie breaking vote to approve it the political sensitivity of inflation and its impact on the democratic bill a collection of family services health care and climate change priorities was illustrated as leaders of both parties tried to spin the numbers to their advantage democrats argued that the inflation report intensified the need to approve the measure they said the legislation s spending and tax credits for health care children s costs education and other programs would help families cope with rising prices most of the bill is paid for with tax boosts on the wealthy and big corporations the legislation s impact will be reducing costs for ordinary people biden said republicans said the legislation s expenditures would further feed inflation which has been driven by supply chain delays making products less available and spending prompted by a strong underlying economy senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said inflation means the average american has gotten a pay cut adding it is unthinkable that senate democrats would try to respond to this inflation report by ramming through another massive socialist spending package in a matter of days possibly mitigating the political impact of friday s inflation numbers was that they were expected and represented a modest rise from october s 6 2 adding any additional juice to the economy might worsen inflation but the extra fiscal stimulus over the next several years in democrats bill would be less than 1 the size of the entire u s economy making its likely inflationary impact mild said the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget democrats limited the duration of many initiatives in their package to help contain the bill s price tag that includes extending enhancements to the child tax credit for just one year and free universal pre school for only six years it s an accounting move both parties have used to make their budget plans seem more affordable even though they would like their proposals to be permanent and some may be extended because they are popular republicans used such phaseouts robustly for their big tax cuts in 2001 and 2017 if you believe these programs go away after one two or three years you shouldn t have a driver s license said sen lindsey graham of south carolina top republican on the senate budget committee who requested the cbo estimates he said the bill s higher price tag and rising inflation meant democrats legislation would be lethal to the economy and lethal to your paycheck democrats argued the estimated added 3 trillion cost was bogus because if they decided to seek any future extensions of their initiatives they would propose savings to pay for them as if sharing a script psaki called the gop claims fundamentally dishonest and senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said republicans were using fake scores based on mistruths house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called the numbers a phony score of an imaginary bill outside groups have produced similar estimates about the legislation s cost if its programs were permanent cbo numbers usually have more clout in congress because the agency s impartiality is respected much about the legislation remains in play manchin still wants to remove a paid family leave program and curb or eliminate some tax breaks aimed at encouraging a shift to cleaner energy moderate sen kyrsten sinema d ariz has also pushed to trim the measure democrats have also had differences over how to ease limits on federal tax deductions that people can take on state and local taxes in addition the senate parliamentarian must decide whether some provisions including a top party priority of letting millions of migrants remain in the u s violate the chamber s rules and should be removed that s left it unclear whether schumer will be able to meet his christmas deadline ___ ap reporter josh boak contributed to this report
by lewis krauskopf new york reuters investors are bracing for the last federal reserve meeting of the year with market participants hungry to learn how quickly the central bank plans to finish unwinding its bond buying program and pick up signs of when it may start to raise rates in 2022 stocks are back at record highs following last week s selloff a market spasm brought on by worries over the omicron variant of the coronavirus and comments from fed chairman jerome powell who said the central bank may discuss speeding up the reduction of its 120 billion per month bond buying program at next week s meeting there is potential for renewed volatility however if the fed takes a more hawkish than expected view on rolling back the easy money policies that have helped stocks more than double from their march 2020 lows including a rapid reduction in bond buying that clears the way for the central bank to raise rates sooner markets could also be roiled if the fed signals greater worry about inflation which powell said can no longer be described as transitory data on friday showed consumer prices last month notched their largest annual gain in nearly four decades bolstering the case for higher rates the biggest factor in the equity market remains and will remain to be interest rates said jack ablin chief investment officer at cresset capital management higher yields which can rise on expectations of tighter monetary policy can dim the allure of stocks by creating a greater discount for companies future cash flows potentially pressuring valuations that are already elevated by historical standards the s p 500 which has climbed 25 this year is trading at 20 5 times forward 12 month earnings estimates compared with its historic valuation average of 15 5 times according to refinitiv datastream the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note has climbed about 15 basis points from the start of the month to 1 49 but is below the 1 776 it reached in march some stocks have already been hit by higher rate worries this year including technology and growth companies that thrived during 2020 s lockdowns the broader market however has generally tolerated tightening monetary policy analysts at bofa global research said in a recent report noting that stocks mostly climbed as the fed normalized policy in the last decade the fed last month began tapering its purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities at a pace that would have put it on track to complete the wind down by mid 2022 following powell s comments investors now believe the fed could quicken the pace of reductions that will end the bond buying by march which could allow the central bank to potentially start raising rates sooner bets on earlier rate increases have also grown traders late on friday saw a more than 50 chance of a rate hike by may 2022 up from a roughly 30 chance a month ago according to the cme group s fedwatch program investors are also keen to learn the central bank s view on the omicron variant s potential impact on economic growth or inflation one possible scenario outlined by ubs global wealth management in a report sees the virus complicating supply chain issues that have helped stoke inflation in recent months bringing concerns the fed may need to tighten monetary policy faster the bank s base case scenario however assumes the omicron variant will not derail the recovery mona mahajan senior investment strategist at edward jones said the fed meeting could bring more clarity to investors after an upsurge of volatility in recent weeks it feels like the market has climbed two walls of worry already omicron and the path of the fed she said i do think over the next couple of weeks we will get a little bit more certainty on both fronts reporting by lewis krauskopf in new york additional reporting by gertrude chavez dreyfuss in new york editing by ira iosebashvili and matthew lewis

inflation in us surges to 40 year high at 6 8 per cent in november economists expect the fed policymakers to end its 120 billion treasury bond and mortgage backed security purchases sooner our bureau new york times news service agencies inflation in the us surged to a 40 year high at 6 8 per cent in november putting immediate pressure on the federal reserve to roll back its pandemic era stimulus when its policy makers meet next week economists expect the fed policy makers to end its 120 billion treasury bond and mortgage backed security purchases sooner this would put it in a position to start raising rates which the us central bank has held near zero since the outbreak of the pandemic fed officials have already announced plans to slow those purchases by 15 billion a month which would have the program ending midway through 2022 advertisement an accelerated rollback of the fed s bond purchases could trigger fund outflows from emerging markets such as india and spark severe turmoil in its stock and currency markets it would also exacerbate pressure on the reserve bank of india which has been pinning its hopes on a benign inflation environment to justify its decision to hold interest rates in an effort to re ignite economic growth rupee falls 18 paise the us inflation data release had kept indian markets on the edge on friday with the rupee dropping 18 paise to an over 16 month low of 75 78 provisional on higher dollar outflows stock market investors across the world had remained on the sidelines on friday in anticipation of the us inflation data us stock indexes rose on friday after the data showed the inflation figure largely in line with estimates last month analysts however said it won t deter the federal reserve from speeding up the taper process the big inflation number from the us included a strong increase in food prices which rose 6 1 per cent from a year earlier according to the us consumer price index report the 0 7 increase in november came on the heels of several months of strong gains the food index climbed 0 9 per cent in october and september rent of shelter also rose 0 5 per cent last month reflecting a tight housing market that is feeding into inflation the surge in rent costs has stemmed from strong demand for owned homes and as people have searched for extra space but found that houses were in short supply inflation has continued to surge as supply chain disruptions strong demand for goods and rising wages have pushed prices higher complicating us president jo biden s agenda and depressing his approval ratings americans have felt the increase in prices which has dented their finances and forced them to cut back in other ways consumers have grown more wary of the surge in costs expressing less optimism about their personal finances and the overall growth of the economy according to a recent university of michigan survey alan detmeister a senior economist at ubs who used to be chief of the wages and prices division at the fed board in washington said that rents would continue to move up strongly in the near term but real time trackers like us apartment list have showed some softening in recent readings which could be a good sign that those pressures will cool off toward the middle of 2022
prices for u s consumers jumped 6 8 in november compared with a year earlier as surging costs for food energy housing autos and clothing left americans enduring their highest annual inflation rate in 39 years the labor department also reported friday that prices rose 0 8 from october to november a substantial increase though slightly less than 0 9 increase from september to october inflation has been inflicting a heavy burden on consumers especially lower income households and particularly for everyday necessities it has also negated the higher wages many workers have received complicated the federal reserve s plans to reduce its aid for the economy and coincided with flagging public support for president joe biden who has been taking steps to try to ease inflation pressures fueling the inflation has been a mix of factors resulting from the swift rebound from the pandemic recession a flood of government stimulus ultra low rates engineered by the fed and supply shortages at factories manufacturers have been slowed by heavier than expected customer demand covid related shutdowns and overwhelmed ports and freight yards employers struggling with worker shortages have also been raising pay and many of them have boosted prices to offset their higher labor costs thereby adding to inflation the result has been price spikes for goods ranging from food and used vehicles to electronics household furnishings and rental cars the average price of a used vehicle rocketed nearly 28 from november 2020 to last month to a record 29 011 according to data compiled by edmunds com the acceleration of prices which began once the pandemic hit as americans stuck at home flooded factories with orders for goods has spread to services from apartment rents and restaurant meals to medical services and entertainment even some retailers that built their businesses around the allure of ultra low prices have begun boosting them over the past 12 months the costs paid by a typical american family have surged by roughly 4 000 according to calculations by jason furman a harvard economist and former obama white house aide in a statement friday biden said more could be done if congress passed his sweeping social spending and climate package which is intended to reduce household costs for health care prescription drugs and child care we have to get prices and costs down before consumers will feel confident in that recovery the president said that is the top goal of my administration though americans overall income has also increased since the pandemic a new poll found that far more people are noticing higher inflation than higher wages two thirds say their household costs have risen since the pandemic compared with only about a quarter who say their incomes have increased according to the poll by the associated press norc center for public affairs research among them is karyn dixon who received a raise this year that hasn t come close to covering her higher expenses dixon 55 works as a materials handler at a warehouse near her home not far from knoxville tennessee like many companies at a time when some worry about their workers leaving for higher wages elsewhere her employer raised pay in her case by 1 75 an hour yet that d hardly enough to keep pace with higher health insurance costs and costlier food and gas pricier gas puts a damper on things especially when you live in a rural area dixon said if we need anything important we have to travel to the next town over or knoxville our options are limited there really hasn t been much of a benefit from it she said of the raise you make the extra money but you turn around and have to pay more for food and gas just so you can get to work outside the u s too surging inflation is squeezing households and businesses in europe energy costs have driven up consumer prices to the highest level since the euro launched more than 20 years ago annual inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro hit 4 9 in november according to the european union s statistics agency inflation has gone much higher in some other european countries with poland close to 8 lithuania above 9 and turkey at an eye popping 21 for american consumers the 6 8 jump in inflation for the 12 months that ended in november was the largest year over year increase since a 7 1 surge for the year ending in june 1982 that spike occurred at a time when the federal reserve had driven up interest rates to double digits in its effort to stem runaway inflation triggered by the oil price shocks of the 1970s the persistence of high inflation has surprised the fed whose chair jerome powell had for months characterized inflation as only transitory a short term consequence of bottlenecked supply chains two weeks ago though powell signaled a shift implicitly acknowledging that high inflation has endured longer than he expected he suggested that the fed will likely act more quickly to phase out its ultra low rate policies than it had previously planned doing so would put the fed on a path to begin raising its key short term interest rate as early as the first half of next year that rate has been pegged at nearly zero since march 2020 when the coronavirus sent the economy into a deep recession borrowing rates would rise for some consumer and business loans financial markets which had largely anticipated friday s inflation figures took them in stride treasury yields and stock prices held relatively steady while a measure of fear on wall street eased russell price chief economist at ameriprise said the market response suggests that investors have become accepting of the reality that the fed will accelerate its pullback of the emergency economic aid it supplied after the pandemic driving much of the inflation last month were energy prices particularly gasoline pump prices which are up a dizzying 58 1 from a year ago the costs of housing food vehicles airline tickets clothing and household furnishings were also big contributors to the november price surge core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy prices rose 0 5 in november over the past 12 months core prices are up 4 9 the biggest such increase since 1991 some economists are holding out hope that inflation will peak in the coming months and then gradually ease and provide some relief for consumers they note that supply shortages in some industries have begun to gradually ease and while higher energy costs will continue to burden consumers in the coming months americans will likely be spared from earlier forecasts that energy prices would reach record highs over the winter oil prices have been declining modestly and leading in turn to slightly lower gasoline prices even more dramatically natural gas prices have plummeted nearly 40 from a seven year high reached in october food prices too could potentially ease as a result of sharp declines in corn and wheat prices from their highs earlier in the year what s more the emergence of the omicron variant of the coronavirus has renewed the prospect of more canceled or postponed travel and fewer restaurant meals and shopping trips all of that if it happened would slow consumer and business spending and potentially restrain inflation still analysts caution that unexpected developments including heavy winter storms with potentially increased demand for energy could send energy prices surging again and they note that easing overall inflation pressures will depend on further progress in normalizing global supply chains white house officials have said they believe that a series of actions that the administration has taken from boosting the processing of cargo from the ports of los angeles and long beach to the release of crude oil from the petroleum reserve would help defuse inflation pressures some outside economists have begun to echo that view november could be the peak of the bad news on inflation said gus faucher chief economist at pnc financial we are already starting to see energy prices decline we are still dealing with dislocations from the re opening of the economy but i expect those problems in supply chains and labor shortages in some industries will get worked out over the next year
new york wall street stocks capped a strong week with a fresh record on friday despite the latest spike in us consumer prices that has bolstered expectations the federal reserve will accelerate plans to lift interest rates following a down day in leading asian and european equity markets the broad based s p 500 piled on 0 9 percent to finish at 4 712 02 eclipsing a record from last month and scoring a weekly gain of nearly four percent advertisement the gains came even as the labor department reported that the consumer price index jumped 6 8 percent last month compared to november of last year its biggest gain since june 1982 as prices for gasoline used cars food rent and other items continued to climb markets took the data in stride in spite of the eye popping figure in part because inflation was largely expected as long as things happen inside of consensus the market s had enough time to digest this said art hogan chief strategist at national securities and he noted that investors also are relieved that the latest covid 19 strain appears less virulent than earlier variants but oanda s edward moya warned that consumer sentiment still looks vulnerable and will likely struggle if these widespread price increases continue the cpi data came after federal reserve chair jay powell had already signaled plans to accelerate the tapering of stimulus payments many analysts expect the central bank to hike interest rates at least twice in 2022 powell will update the markets next week following a two day policy meeting advertisement in europe official data showed britain s economic recovery slowed in october even before the appearance of the omicron variant that has pushed the uk government to restore restrictions uk gross domestic product increased 0 1 percent in october compared with output of 0 6 percent the previous month analysts said the growth slowdown made it less likely that the bank of england would next week raise its main interest rate although a rate rise can t be completely ruled out most bets are off that the bank will push them up so soon given this latest downbeat reading and the fact that the omicron variant is still an unknown quantity said susannah streeter senior analyst at hargreaves lansdown the government of prime minister boris johnson will from monday tighten virus restrictions in england asian equity markets closed down following overnight losses on wall street and a positive start to the week for global stocks as traders assessed developments surrounding the omicron coronavirus variant key figures around 2100 gmt new york dow up 0 6 percent at 35 970 99 close new york s p 500 up 0 9 percent at 4 712 02 close new york nasdaq up 0 7 percent at 15 630 60 close london ftse 100 down 0 4 percent at 7 291 78 close frankfurt dax down 0 1 percent at 15 623 31 close paris cac 40 down 0 2 percent at 6 991 68 close euro stoxx 50 down 0 2 percent at 4 199 16 close tokyo nikkei 225 down 1 0 percent at 28 437 77 close hong kong hang seng index down 1 1 percent at 23 995 72 close shanghai composite down 0 2 percent at 3 666 35 close euro dollar up at 1 1317 from 1 1293 pound dollar up at 1 3225 from 1 3221 euro pound down at 85 29 pence from 85 42 pence dollar yen down at 113 37 yen from 113 49 yen brent north sea crude up 1 0 percent at 75 15 per barrel your subscription could not be saved please try again your subscription has been successful subscribe to our daily newsletter sign me up west texas intermediate up 1 0 percent at 71 67 per barrel gsg
nato secretary general jens stoltenberg today rejected russia s call for the west to withdraw its invitation to ukraine to join the alliance nato s relationship with ukraine is going to be decided by the 30 nato allies and ukraine no one else stoltenberg said at a joint news conference with germany s chancellor olaf scholz we cannot accept that russia is trying to re establish a system where big powers like russia have spheres of influence where they can control or decide what other members can do earlier russia s foreign ministry had said that nato should formally scrap a 2008 declaration opening the door to georgia and ukraine two former soviet republics in the fundamental interests of european security it is necessary to officially disavow the decision of the 2008 nato bucharest summit that ukraine and georgia will become nato members it said russian troops now occupy two breakaway regions of georgia and moscow has annexed ukraine s crimea region while allegedly supporting separatist rebels in the neighbouring donbas in the past few weeks russia has moved around 100 000 troops to ukraine s border sounding alarm bells in washington and at nato s brussels headquarters this week russian president vladimir putin and us leader joe biden held two hours of talks with the kremlin chief demanding the west guarantee that ukraine would not become a nato launchpad advertisement high price the western allies are concerned about the russian build up but have redeclared support for ukraine s sovereignty and warned russia of deep strategic and economic consequences if it invades stoltenberg was clear insisting that while western leaders are open to talks they will not compromise on the rights of every nation in europe to decide their own path this is enshrined in many documents and agreements that also russia has signed he said citing european security agreements going back to the cold war it has been clearly stated that any sovereign independent nation of course has the right to choose his own path including what kind of security arrangements he wants to be part of scholz who took power on wednesday and was on his first trip as chancellor to nato also warned russia nato allies agree that any further aggression against ukraine will come at a high price and have serious political and economic consequences for russia he said the german leader is under pressure to commit to halting the opening of the nord stream 2 pipeline between russia and germany if moscow attacks ukraine he has not promised this but he said we call on russia to return to diplomacy and to de escalate and to respect ukraine s sovereignty and territorial integrity ukraine and georgia are not on the verge of joining nato which has a mutual defence pact that would see other members mobilise to defend a partner if attacked but the united states and some allies help train ukrainian forces and washington committed more than 2 5 billion to bolster a military that crumbled in the face of the russian assault back in 2014

technologies â added dr jin the study of the new dual technology application was published in the november 2021 issue of life an international peer reviewed open access life sciences journal ï advanced filtration tech could help stop life threatening cytokine storm in covid 19 patients cytokine storm has made frequent appearances in the news lately as a life threatening complication in patients suffering from covid 19 the condition is an inflammatory syndrome triggered by hyperactivation of immune cells that can significantly impact the patientâ s chances of making a full recovery or surviving the infection at all fortunately avco has already been developing a range of therapies that have the potential to help target cytokine storm and other risk factors that make the widespread virus so difficult to get under control what is cytokine storm the immune system uses cytokines to perform a variety of important tasks from clotting blood to triggering antibody production when overworked â as can happen when the body is fighting off an aggressive difficult disease like covid 19 or is being treated with therapies designed to activate an immune response â that same immune system can end up producing too many cytokines when the ones that trigger an inflammatory response are produced in excess the cytokines trigger severe inflammatory symptoms damage healthy tissue and can even cause multiple organs to fail leading to death avco ava trapâ already targets cytokine storm because cytokine storm is a common risk factor in many cancer therapies the oncology focused avco was already hard at work on a way to calm down cytokine storms the avco ava trapâ therapeutic program was developed to target this potentially fatal complication by using cytokine receptor proteins the ava trapâ program could dampen the release of cytokine essentially filtering out the excess cytokines when covid 19 started to spread through populations around the globe in 2020 doctors soon realized that the virus could induce a cytokine storm and that when it did the chances of that patient surviving grew slim avco moved quickly to file and expanded patent for the proprietary filtration technology so it could be used to help covid patients increase their chances of recovering from the disease avco launches full scale plan to tackle covid 19 pandemic in addition to leveraging its existing ava trapâ program to help combat cytokine storm and improve patient outcomes avco also began working on a slate of other tools doctors can use to keep the evolving virus at bay in partnership with adial pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq adil avco is distributing a rapid diagnostics test that can detect multiple covid antibodies with between 92 9 and 98 6 accuracy in just 10 minutes using the avco existing global distribution network the 2 companies are able to make this rapid and highly accurate test available to healthcare providers worldwide in another partnership with austriaâ s university of natural resources and life sciences boku avco is working on an intranasal spray vaccine for covid 19 based on innovative s layer technology that creates uniform repetitive protein structures the vaccine could become a highly effective formula in a format that people could self administer â reducing the burden on healthcare providers to individually vaccinate the worldâ s population and reducing barriers to access for people with mobility challenges or who live too far from the nearest vaccine administration site finally avco began practical testing for its allogeneic msc based cellular therapy acetexâ which could treat the acute respiratory distress syndrome ards and multisystem inflammatory syndrome that can also come with severe cases of covid 19 infection and like cytokine storm significantly increase the risk of mortality ards alone has been the cause of death in 70 of fatal covid 19 cases where an aggressive inflammatory response happens acetexâ uses mesenchymal stromal cells taken from bone marrow fat tissue or other tissue types and adapts them to help moderate the bodyâ s immune system response because cytokine storm ards and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in covid 19 patients are all triggered by a hyperactive immune response the potential acetexâ has for better regulating the immune response could offer a reliable treatment option to stop these complications in their tracks and prevent them from progressing to a fatal stage ï avco and university of natural resources and life sciences boku co develop innovative in silico technology enabling the design and synthesis of novel cell membrane receptor targets for cancer and immune related diseases on october 7th avco announced co development of a novel cell free in silico system to facilitate the companyâ s drug development efforts together with the institute for synthetic bioarchitectures at the university of natural resources and life sciences boku in vienna austria a study of the new technology was featured in the september 2021 issue of membranes an international peer reviewed journal the new avco technology reveals that difficult to study cell membrane proteins can be efficiently expressed in a cell free system allowing for their evaluation as potentially druggable targets the technology expands avalonâ s ability to design and produce novel membrane proteinsâ including receptors found on the surface of immune cells and cancer cells that are important for cell signaling and diseases such as cancerâ providing avalon an efficient tool to screen and optimize potential therapeutic targets proteins function within cells and are also present on cell surfaces embedded within the cellâ s outer membrane these membrane proteins include cell surface receptors that function in cell signaling and regulation of communication with other cells and tissues these molecules are important drug targets and include receptors on immune cells such as t cells for the development of cellular immunotherapies the researchers used computer based models developed at the university of vienna to identify factors that optimize the expression of membrane proteins in a cell free in silico system resulting in high protein yield the avco study demonstrated the success of this method by showing the ability to manipulate and express a drug target membrane protein a human voltage dependent anion channel at high yield the use of this novel avco technology can improve knowledge about receptors and other membrane proteins to better understand the biology of drug targets and to develop novel therapies including immunotherapies for cancer the new technology is a direct result of a collaboration between avco and researchers at boku vienna the university

bakersfield calif kero it s an issue other communities have faced who owns the natural resources in the area in kern county the resource battle is over water and several local entities have been fighting over who gets it for over a decade now this battle is because whoever has the water rights is allowed to choose how to use and divert water from water sources which in this case is the kern river this impacts domestic use irrigation recreation stock watering just to list a few this week the state water board has taken up the case in part of the kern river that runs through bakersfield there s nothing more than sand and some brush while some believe there is a way to bring water back to the river others argue that is just not viable the kern river once ran from the sierra nevada mountain range through the southern san joaquin valley into the city of bakersfield i would argue that our water resources have been really mismanaged under an old model of take it and run with it like americans have always seemed to do because it has been so plentiful it is not plentiful anymore bill cooper bring back the kern committee co founder kern river parkway foundation the take it and run model as cooper called it is a set of agreements created by the state through the decades that list how the storage and distribution of the kern river water is allocated also known as the law of the river cooper argued that these agreements were created so long ago with the earliest version set in the 1800s we just think that is getting ready to change or is changing and we hope the state recognizes the public trust issues and realizes water as a public resource and has to be managed for everybody said cooper currently bring back the kern and the kern river parkway foundation wants the state to give the over 50 000 acre feet of kern river water in limbo to the city of bakersfield the body of water in question was removed from the management of the kern delta water district in 2007 after the north kern water storage district sued them over it claiming the delta did not need the water as they had not used it in five years the courts agreed with that but did not rule on who had jurisdiction over the water rights six entities are fighting over the water rights north kern water storage district and the city of shafter are working together entities individually fighting for the rights include buena vista water storage district kern water bank authority kern county water agency rosedale rio bravo water storage district city of bakersfield the city wants to run the water down the river they want to have their water available for their people where it would benefit the people and it will serve as a drinking water supply said colin pearce an attorney with law firm duane morris outside special water counsel to city of bakersfield while the attorney for bakersfield said the fight is for residents the north kern water district manager said the law is clear and running it down bakersfield is not viable that water for many years decades now has been used to irrigate farmland helps support our economy drinking water supports local business said david hampton general manager north kern water storage district as part of their fight for water rights north kern water storage district created a new group called the sustainable kern river coalition made up of seven other entities it is an organization that provides a platform for kern river water users to come together and work through any differences and collaborate on finding win win solutions said hampton however the city of bakersfield said the solution would be to share the water and argue the north water district is not on board with that plan the water in the river is still available for these corporations it just cost them a little bit more money to pump it out so this is not about sustainable it is not about the environment it is about money said pearce but gabriel gonzalez the manager for the city of shafter and city representative in the sustainable kern river coalition argues it is about much more than money he says he has seen this issue take the jobs of many farm workers in other areas of the central valley and does not want that to happen here if farmers aren t able to support their crops and their fields with sufficient water then that means that our residents within our community will have a difficult time being employed locally that would require them to have to commute to outside the area whether that is arvin tulare county or fresno county to look for the jobs said gabriel gonzalez shafter city manager meanwhile the city of bakersfield argues that if the north kern water storage district does keep the water it will only benefits the large companies that have farmland in that area the water issue is economic and it impacts these corporations economically and they want to get the water for free or at minimal unrealistic costs it just cost them a little more money to pump the water that is all it is everybody can still have jobs there will still be plenty of jobs plenty of agriculture it is just going to cut a little into the profits of these private corporations said pearce the state says they expect the case to go well into 2022

well who are you i told you george i m your guardian angels what is it you want you want the moon just say the word and i ll throw a lasso around and pull it down frank capra never intended it for it to be a christmas movie because it was supposed to be released at the beginning of the next year and and the movie sinbad the sailor wasn t quite ready so they came to frank hyper and they said get your movie ready and so he rapidly put it together and it was released at the globe theater in new york city on december 20 so that was a little late for christmas but like i say you know they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then bombed more or less it was not a hit me have a hectic day oh yeah another big red letter day for the baileys i have vivid memories of doing that film working on the set don t remember much about off the sex um just remember getting up real early in the morning it was dark and taking busses and streetcars out to colder city uh to do a day s work um but on the set capra would you know squat down i d i tell me what he wanted me to do and do i understand it and i said yes sir and that s funny 4 5 years of age and i remember so vividly daddy kinch hey film that can evoke that kind of emotion in a lot of men means an awful lot in our hearts and really does touch our lives and i think it impacts us in a way that we want to be like georgia to learn what he learned and we look at our lives and we say oh my gosh i do have something positive here and it just turns us around every year at christmas time and some people watch it all year long because it gives us such an optimistic view of of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen advertisement two stars of it s a wonderful life look back at the christmas classic share copy link copy it was just another job for child actor karolyn grimes she was 6 and had already done four movies by the summer of 1946 when filming began on it s a wonderful life the only thing she recalls about the biggest movie of her career was being delighted to play in the snow on the set that single job would become very memorable to a lot of other people it s a wonderful life which marks its 75th anniversary this year is now a beloved holiday tradition across the globe it s a once a year pick me up for the humanity of america and the world grimes told the associated press it s a good impetus to really keep us going in a positive direction it s a wonderful life was released in late 1946 produced and directed by frank capra and starring jimmy stewart and donna reed it takes place on christmas eve in a small town the film centers on the character of george bailey played by stewart who considers suicide until his guardian angel intervenes and shows him all the people whose lives he has touched and the difference he has made in the community one memorable character is zuzu played by grimes she gets to say every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings and the petals from zuzu s rose stuffed into a pants pocket by stewart s bailey as he comforts his sickly daughter become a symbol of life if grimes is sort of fuzzy on the filming details jimmy hawkins another former child actor who played tommy in the film is the opposite he recalls as a 4 year old getting up while it was dark and taking buses and streetcars to culver city to film his scenes i have vivid memories of doing that film he says on the set capra would squat down eye to eye tell me what he wanted me to do and did i understand it i said oh yes sir grimes and hawkins are the last surviving members of the cast and have chosen to represent the film s legacy and spread its lesson of doing good we feel we re lucky to have played those parts and carry frank capra s message he s not around to do it and he gave us a great part and a lot of wonderful memories so we just naturally do it says hawkins we want to carry on that message whether it s to inmates at attica or ringing the bell at the stock exchange we talk to everybody to keep it going paramount home entertainment has released a limited edition two disc blu ray set with a colorized version of the film in high definition as well as the original digitally remastered black and white movie in high definition the set includes over 45 minutes of bonus content the movie was nominated for five oscars and has been recognized by the american film institute as one of the 100 best american films ever made the movie also earned first place for most inspirational american film of all time by the afi it gives us such an optimistic view of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen said grimes hawkins recalls capra with a strong vision for the film faith hope and life renewed the movie he made might be sentimental but on the set the director was not at all it was his movie he says people fell by the wayside because it was his vision if you didn t have his vision you weren t making his move he was very precise very nice to everybody on the set but now it s a job the film now closely associated with christmas wasn t initially intended to be released over the holidays but rko s scheduled christmas movie in 1946 sinbad the sailor wasn t ready so the studio asked capra to rush production of it s a wonderful life it was released dec 20 at the globe theatre in new york a little late for a traditional christmas rollout they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then it bombed more or less it was not a hit says grimes but then in the early 70s it became public domain and it was on every channel every year grimes still gets letters from all over the globe and from generations of viewers i get a lot of fan mail from great britain and even the mideast and all kinds of places she says it s reaching a lot of people and i think people will want to make a difference
d keine a warehouse worker in tennessee is running up against price increases that far exceed her modest pay raise the owner of a pastry business in massachusetts has had to reduce his product offerings and personally absorb higher costs a grocery chain executive in connecticut said he s splitting his higher costs with his suppliers so he doesn t have to raise prices across the board across the united states in homes and in businesses the highest inflation in a generation is heightening financial pressures and forcing people to adapt to a new reality the government s report friday that consumer prices jumped 6 8 over the past year the highest such inflation rate in 39 years showed that some of the largest cost spikes have been for such necessities as food energy housing autos and clothing they are goods and services that millions of americans regularly depend upon in their daily lives especially hard hit are lower income households with little or no cash cushions for them the acceleration of consumer prices has negated any higher wages they may have received the price surge has also complicated the federal reserve s plans to reduce its aid for the economy and coincided with flagging public support for president joe biden who has been taking steps to try to ease inflation pressures fueling the jump in inflation has been a mix of factors resulting from the swift rebound from the pandemic recession a flood of government stimulus ultra low rates engineered by the fed and supply shortages at factories manufacturers have been slowed by heavier than expected customer demand covid related shutdowns and overwhelmed ports and freight yards employers struggling with worker shortages have also been raising pay and many of them have boosted prices to offset their higher labor costs thereby adding to inflation the result has been price jumps for goods ranging from food and used vehicles to electronics household furnishings and rental cars the average price of a used vehicle rocketed nearly 28 from november 2020 to last month to a record 29 011 according to data compiled by edmunds com the acceleration of prices which began once the pandemic hit as americans stuck at home flooded factories with orders for goods has spread to services from apartment rents and restaurant meals to medical services and entertainment even some retailers that built their businesses around the allure of ultra low prices have begun boosting them over the past 12 months the costs paid by a typical american family have surged by roughly 4 000 according to calculations by jason furman a harvard economist and former obama white house aide though americans overall income has also increased since the pandemic a new poll found that far more people are noticing higher inflation than higher wages two thirds say their household costs have risen since the pandemic compared with only about a quarter who say their incomes have increased according to the poll by the associated press norc center for public affairs research among them is karyn dixon who received a raise this year that hasn t come close to covering her higher expenses dixon 55 works as a materials handler at a warehouse near her home not far from knoxville tennessee like many companies in recent months her employer raised workers pay in her case by us 1 75 an hour yet that s hardly enough to keep pace with higher health insurance costs and costlier food and gas pricier gas puts a damper on things especially when you live in a rural area dixon said if we need anything important we have to travel to the next town over or knoxville our options are limited there really hasn t been much of a benefit from it she said of the raise you make the extra money but you turn around and have to pay more for food and gas just so you can get to work james lawson who runs a pastry business in stockbridge massachusetts says skyrocketing food prices have forced him to reduce the number of croissants and wedding cakes he makes prices for his basic ingredients have spiked an average of 25 in the past six months and lawson says he can pass only some of the additional costs on to his customers his business is down 30 to 40 from a year ago it s stressful lawson said there are nights you don t sleep i think it s going to get worse before it gets better lawson used to buy 100 pounds of kerry gold butter for 300 for his business now he said it costs him us 450 to us 475 and he feels he can t raise prices for his desserts enough to make up for his own higher expenses so he s had to absorb much of the cost himself which means cutting back on his own purchases of food and clothing instead of buying a gallon you buy a quart and see how long that lasts lawson said and then you don t spend as much on your food stew leonard jr who is president and ceo of a family owned supermarket chain based in connecticut and new york founded by his father said that by sharing his higher costs with his suppliers he s managing to avoid raising prices drastically on his customers we are absorbing a lot of costs leonard said we are trying to hold our prices low and we will get through it and see where it goes it s a very erratic market right now his chain is avoiding raising prices for such staples as milk butter and eggs but it s charging more for more discretionary items like lobster and filet mignon a pound of lobster has gone from us 8 to us 11 though some of leonard s customers are still buying those pricier items lower income shoppers are trading down from beef to chicken and from blueberries to bananas outside the u s too surging inflation is squeezing households and businesses in europe energy costs have driven up consumer prices to the highest level since the euro launched more than 20 years ago annual inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro hit 4 9 in november according to the european union s statistics agency inflation has gone much higher in some other european countries with poland close to 8 lithuania above 9 and turkey at an eye popping 21 for american consumers the 6 8 jump in inflation for the 12 months that ended in november was the largest year over year increase since a 7 1 surge for the year ending in june 1982 that spike occurred at a time when the federal reserve had driven up interest rates to double digits in its effort to stem runaway inflation triggered by the oil price shocks of the 1970s the persistence of high inflation has surprised the fed whose chair jerome powell had for months characterized inflation as only transitory a short term consequence of bottlenecked supply chains two weeks ago though powell signaled a shift implicitly acknowledging that high inflation has endured longer than he expected he suggested that the fed will likely act more quickly to phase out its ultra low rate policies than it had previously planned doing so would put the fed on a path to begin raising its key short term interest rate as early as the first half of next year that rate has been pegged at nearly zero since march 2020 when the coronavirus sent the economy into a deep recession borrowing rates would rise for some consumer and business loans in canada inflation is also on the list of risks to watch for the central bank in its latest rate announcement this week the bank of canada warned that high inflation rates will continue through the first half of next year noting that it won t be until the second half of 2022 that inflation falls back toward its comfort zone of between 1 and 3 financial markets which had largely anticipated friday s inflation figures took them in stride treasury yields and stock prices held relatively steady while a measure of fear on wall street eased russell price chief economist at ameriprise said the market response suggests that investors have become accepting of the reality that the fed will accelerate its pullback of the emergency economic aid it supplied after the pandemic speaking at the white house biden said of the inflation report i think it s the peak of the crisis and i think you ll see a change sooner and more rapidly than most people think to more moderate price increases

come back to them anytime got it share juan vargas from melbourne butcher john cesters poultry and game which has already sold several turduckens and is expecting another big christmas chris hopkins is it a table centrepiece that s the height of indulgence or a frankenstein food that should never have been created the turducken a turkey stuffed with duck stuffed with chicken is a christmas main course that divides opinion but you may be seeing more of the poultry trifecta this year as coles offers the seasonal specialty for the first time the supermarket giant joins aldi and specialty butchers who have for many years assembled thousands of these russian doll style roasts each december it s like a complete christmas feast in one bite says sydney butcher adam stratton turduckens the chicken inside a duck inside a turkey creation for christmas edwina pickles advertisement the deboned many layered creation also makes for easy carving can solve the problem of dry turkey and gives more choice to picky eaters stratton who owns four tender gourmet butchery stores across sydney is expecting to sell 600 to 700 turduckens as people plan to splash out on christmas to make up for family gatherings missed throughout the pandemic his free range mutli bird roast is 140 about 30 a kilogram which is on par with coles luxury butcher victor churchill charges approximately 66 per kilogram for its version a thanksgiving staple in the us since at least the 1970s turducken searches on google soared in the states between 2007 and 2011 but only gained momentum in australia after 2010 likely thanks to the power of food blogs sydney butcher adam stratton of tender gourmet butchery with a turducken edwina pickles our thirst for the triple treat roast peaked in 2014 according to google search data but all signs point to a comeback this year particularly as turduckens show up in hundreds of coles across the country from december 18 advertisement it has a lot of wow factor says harrison nguyen owner of john cester s poultry shop at prahran market nguyen has already sold several turduckens to americans in melbourne who celebrated thanksgiving on november 25 and he expects this christmas to be another big year based on current orders stratton says if you cut one directly in half you look at all those colours in there and it s like a medieval feast ancient and later tudor feasts often involved a multibeast centrepiece dish to impress powerful guests engastration is the technical term and the turducken is just the latest example i guess everything has its place back in the sun says american barbecue specialist lance rosen of melbourne s southern grace diner who enjoys the technical aspects of assembling a turducken advertisement there is some dispute over the best way to approach this feat of culinary engineering some butchers such as john cester s reduce the size of the final product by using cuts of turkey and duck a smart move when a whole bird turducken can weigh up to seven kilograms cester s turduckens made with either breast or maryland weigh between three and five kilograms rosen likes to zero in on a single cut of meat for more even cooking he creates a roulade using the breast from each bird stratton however is about whole birds he butterflies a deboned turkey to create a 45 centimetre surface area that can accommodate a free range duck and a chicken then the whole lot is rolled and secured with twine he and four other experienced butchers will form an assembly line and can turn out a fully trussed turducken in about two minutes advertisement you can t have the apprentice on this one he laughs coles and aldi have inverted the turducken presumably to reduce its heft creating what might be called a chuckey a whole chicken stuffed with duck and turkey then there s the stuffing debate stratton uses three different stuffings between the layers to enhance each bird s natural flavour nguyen of john cester s sticks to one stuffing throughout to prevent competing flavours coles offers an assertive mix of davidson plum five spice and pistachio the flavours are unexpected but complement the protein perfectly says coles development chef michael weldon rosen leans into his love of american barbecue using a layer of sausage stuffing to add moisture to the breast meat plus the traditional cornbread and cranberry advertisement whatever way you feel about it the turducken is undeniably a conversation starter if your christmas table needs an icebreaker this year you could do worse than a trifecta of meat how to turducken look for one that s been assembled fresh not pre prepared and frozen buy free range if you can afford to the birds taste significantly better many butchers offer gluten free stuffing or other allergy friendly stuffing just ask turducken can be cooked at temperatures ranging from 105c to 180c cover with foil for most of the cooking time for a more even result cooking time will depend on weight but most recipes suggest 40 60 minutes per kilo consult the cooking instructions provided with your turducken a whole bird turducken will take longer to cook than one made with smaller cuts adding a small layer of chicken stock to the roasting pan will create steam and stop the poultry drying out for a glossy finish follow adam stratton s lead heat equal amounts of maple syrup and butter in a small saucepan until sticky then baste the roast with this glaze every 10 minutes for the final 30 minutes sturdy spatulas can be helpful when transferring the turducken when carving don t cut

well who are you i told you george i m your guardian angels what is it you want you want the moon just say the word and i ll throw a lasso around and pull it down frank capra never intended it for it to be a christmas movie because it was supposed to be released at the beginning of the next year and and the movie sinbad the sailor wasn t quite ready so they came to frank hyper and they said get your movie ready and so he rapidly put it together and it was released at the globe theater in new york city on december 20 so that was a little late for christmas but like i say you know they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then bombed more or less it was not a hit me have a hectic day oh yeah another big red letter day for the baileys i have vivid memories of doing that film working on the set don t remember much about off the sex um just remember getting up real early in the morning it was dark and taking busses and streetcars out to colder city uh to do a day s work um but on the set capra would you know squat down i d i tell me what he wanted me to do and do i understand it and i said yes sir and that s funny 4 5 years of age and i remember so vividly daddy kinch hey film that can evoke that kind of emotion in a lot of men means an awful lot in our hearts and really does touch our lives and i think it impacts us in a way that we want to be like georgia to learn what he learned and we look at our lives and we say oh my gosh i do have something positive here and it just turns us around every year at christmas time and some people watch it all year long because it gives us such an optimistic view of of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen advertisement two stars of it s a wonderful life look back at the christmas classic share copy link copy it was just another job for child actor karolyn grimes she was 6 and had already done four movies by the summer of 1946 when filming began on it s a wonderful life the only thing she recalls about the biggest movie of her career was being delighted to play in the snow on the set that single job would become very memorable to a lot of other people it s a wonderful life which marks its 75th anniversary this year is now a beloved holiday tradition across the globe it s a once a year pick me up for the humanity of america and the world grimes told the associated press it s a good impetus to really keep us going in a positive direction it s a wonderful life was released in late 1946 produced and directed by frank capra and starring jimmy stewart and donna reed it takes place on christmas eve in a small town the film centers on the character of george bailey played by stewart who considers suicide until his guardian angel intervenes and shows him all the people whose lives he has touched and the difference he has made in the community one memorable character is zuzu played by grimes she gets to say every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings and the petals from zuzu s rose stuffed into a pants pocket by stewart s bailey as he comforts his sickly daughter become a symbol of life if grimes is sort of fuzzy on the filming details jimmy hawkins another former child actor who played tommy in the film is the opposite he recalls as a 4 year old getting up while it was dark and taking buses and streetcars to culver city to film his scenes i have vivid memories of doing that film he says on the set capra would squat down eye to eye tell me what he wanted me to do and did i understand it i said oh yes sir grimes and hawkins are the last surviving members of the cast and have chosen to represent the film s legacy and spread its lesson of doing good we feel we re lucky to have played those parts and carry frank capra s message he s not around to do it and he gave us a great part and a lot of wonderful memories so we just naturally do it says hawkins we want to carry on that message whether it s to inmates at attica or ringing the bell at the stock exchange we talk to everybody to keep it going paramount home entertainment has released a limited edition two disc blu ray set with a colorized version of the film in high definition as well as the original digitally remastered black and white movie in high definition the set includes over 45 minutes of bonus content the movie was nominated for five oscars and has been recognized by the american film institute as one of the 100 best american films ever made the movie also earned first place for most inspirational american film of all time by the afi it gives us such an optimistic view of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen said grimes hawkins recalls capra with a strong vision for the film faith hope and life renewed the movie he made might be sentimental but on the set the director was not at all it was his movie he says people fell by the wayside because it was his vision if you didn t have his vision you weren t making his move he was very precise very nice to everybody on the set but now it s a job the film now closely associated with christmas wasn t initially intended to be released over the holidays but rko s scheduled christmas movie in 1946 sinbad the sailor wasn t ready so the studio asked capra to rush production of it s a wonderful life it was released dec 20 at the globe theatre in new york a little late for a traditional christmas rollout they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then it bombed more or less it was not a hit says grimes but then in the early 70s it became public domain and it was on every channel every year grimes still gets letters from all over the globe and from generations of viewers i get a lot of fan mail from great britain and even the mideast and all kinds of places she says it s reaching a lot of people and i think people will want to make a difference

harrisburg pa beaver county will soon be the home of the largest petrochemical plant in the appalachia region but a new report cautions with the project near completion the promise of an economic boom for western pennsylvania so far has not materialized shell s pennsylvania petrochemicals complex an ethane cracker plant was announced in 2012 and is expected to open in 2022 or 2023 the ohio river valley institute s recent report found over the last decade beaver county has seen no reduction in poverty and once construction is complete the 6 000 temporary jobs will reduce to 600 permanent work opportunities eric de place research fellow at the ohio river valley institute said the realities in the county are dire since the project was announced the county has lost population de place observed it actually lost businesses it has fewer people employed now in that county than it did before the project was announced so if you re another community thinking about petrochemicals i would say beaver county is a big red warning flag once fully operational the plant is expected to produce 1 6 million tons of polyethylene each year in an attempt to attract shell to the region state lawmakers approved a 1 6 billion tax break for the company the largest ever in state history a recent study from robert morris university found the shell plant could add nearly 4 billion to the pennsylvania economy annually with hundreds of millions of dollars going directly to beaver county but de place noted headwinds in the petrochemical industry make it worth questioning if the project will be viable in the future as the cracker facility opens and as it shifts to actually producing polyethylene let s continue to look back at the track record on the ground and compare it to the promises and see whether economic growth happens or not de place urged we can use that to make decisions about the relative tradeoffs there are some environmental impacts of course with a project that

who built the better gingerbread house you decide campus life who built the better gingerbread house you decide friendly holiday competition pits a faculty in residence against two students the weather outside was frightful okay maybe it was just cold on a recent night outside warren towers but inside a friendly competition was heating up for more than 20 years faculty in residence bryan stone and his wife cheryl have been hosting weekly open hours in their warren towers apartment complete with an abundance of snacks and a home away from home vibe where students can unwind and watch and gossip about the latest episode of tv shows like the bachelor this particular night was a bit different a competition that pitted stone e stanley jones professor of evangelism school of theology associate dean for academic affairs and center for practical theology codirector against students hannah miletello sargent 22 and nina wilson sargent 22 to build the most elaborately decorated gingerbread house how might decades of wisdom and life experience match up against the free spirit and agility of youth the rules were simple in addition to a liberal supply of icing sprinkles candy canes and cinnamon toast crunch each team was supplied with a stock gingerbread house kit to manipulate as they saw fit in addition each team could bring outside accoutrements to adorn their houses provided they were edible stone s vision for his gingerbread edifice was singularly his own creating a confectionary copy of warren towers with his wife lending a helping hand his first move involved some knife work as he set about sawing off the house s eaves so he could craft a gingerbread box much like the storefronts parking garage dining hall and lobby spaces that form the the residence hall base as for the towers themselves stone mashed together several packages of rice krispie treats he already had on hand for snacking during bachelor viewing miletello and wilson looked to the f scott fitzgerald classic the great gatsby for inspiration for their gingerbread house the two were determined to create as opulent a gatsby mansion as jelly beans and colored icing would allow wilson meticulously picked through bottles and packets of edible decorations to introduce some non holiday colors to the details around the house blue candy for the water around the green light at the end of daisy s dock and a single orange sprinkle for the carrot nose of the snowman who would serve as this gingerbread mansion s jay gatsby i feel l m on the great british baking show wilson said early in the house building exercise i m more stressed about this than i am about finals her partner nodded agreement same said miletello i have a physics exam tomorrow as the first half hour passed structure became an increasingly urgent issue for both teams unbeknownst to the bu today competition organizers the icing that comes in the stock gingerbread house kits purchased from target sets neither quickly nor strongly major frustration for the architects this meant the students had to pay close attention to sagging roofs shingled meticulously with but weighed down by cinnamon toast crunch for stone it meant having to fortify the gingerbread base a second time after the initial build was looking a little well wobbly we ve got some major structural problems major stone said as he wrestled with his construction i think it s faithful to the architecture of warren towers with these handicaps in mind bu today kindly looked the other way as stone next shifted his attention to strengthening the three towers perched atop the gingerbread base at first toothpicks were deployed to ensure that the rice krispie treat structures remained sturdy upright and plumb eventually however it was time to bring out the big guns takeout chopsticks to do the job after 90 frenetic nail biting minutes of feverish activity two very different gingerbread house concepts emerged miletello and wilson s finished gatsby mansion was festooned with gumdrop siding candy garlands along the eaves and a door made out of twizzlers in addition to the gatsby snowman and the green light at the end of the dock the student team created a stylish red 1920s automobile using oreos also from the stones treats stash for the wheels stone s gingerbread rendition of warren towers was an unmistakable replica save for the gum drop and jelly bean adornment you can do the ordinary gingerbread house or you can do something that s a monument to boston university i think it s a pretty accurate rendition stone said admiring his finished work accuracy integrity and artistic vision all wrapped in one i think that s why they should vote for me people should vote for us because we did a better job than bryan said a tongue in cheek miletello we gave the best version of what some call the greatest american novel that we could many thanks to bryan and cheryl stone for hosting and participating in this lighthearted holiday event and to hannah miletello and nina wilson for taking time away from studying to engage in some friendly holiday competition which of these two fantastical gingerbread creations is your favorite let us know in the comment section below

the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended and the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 including statements regarding our future financial and operating guidance operational and financial results such as estimates of nominal contracted payments remaining and portfolio run rate and the assumptions related to the calculation of the foregoing metrics the risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements include the availability of additional financing on acceptable terms changes in the

pursuant to ppas signed or allotted or has received the loa there is no assurance that we will be able to sign a ppa even though we have a letter of award all forward looking statements in this press release are based on information available to us as of the date hereof and we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements use of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure we present adjusted ebitda as a supplemental measure of its performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we define adjusted ebitda as loss income plus a income tax expense benefit b interest expense net c depreciation and amortization d loss gain on foreign currency exchange net e other expenses income and f impairment loss we believe adjusted ebitda is useful to investors in assessing our ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of our operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends however this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income or other measures of performance determined in accordance with u s gaap moreover adjusted ebitda as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions adjusted ebitda is also used by securities analysts lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry for example interest expense can be highly dependent on our capital structure debt levels and credit ratings therefore the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies in addition the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate as a result effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under u s gaap some of these limitations include it does not reflect cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments or foreign exchange gain loss it does not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital it does not reflect significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on outstanding debt it does not reflect payments made or future requirements for income taxes and although depreciation amortization and impairment are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced or paid in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements or payments investors are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment and the reasons we consider it appropriate for supplemental analysis for more information please see the reconciliations of net loss to adjusted ebitda in this document cash flow to equity cfe cash flows to equity is a non gaap financial measure we present cfe as a supplemental measure of our performance this measurement is not recognized in accordance with u s gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to u s gaap measures of performance the presentation of cfe should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items we believe gaap metrics such as net income loss and cash from operating activities do not provide the same level of visibility into the performance and prospects of our operating business as a result of the long term capital intensive nature of our businesses non cash depreciation and amortization cash used for debt servicing as well as investments and costs related to the growth of our business our business owns high value long lived assets capable of generating substantial cash flows to equity over time we define cfe as profit loss before tax the most comparable gaap metric adjusted for net cash provided for used in operating activities other than changes in operating assets and liabilities income and deferred taxes and amortization of hedging costs less cash paid for income taxes debt amortization maintenance capital expenditure and prepaid lease payments and employee benefits we believe that changes in operating assets and liabilities is cyclical for cash flow generation of our assets due to a high growth environment furthermore to reflect the actual cash outflows for income tax we deduct income and deferred taxes computed under us gaap presented in our consolidated financial statements and instead include the actual cash tax outflow during the period are considered as part of tax expense we believe that external consumers of our financial statements including investors and research analysts use cfe both to assess company s performance and as an indicator of its success in generating an attractive risk adjusted total return assess the value of the business and the platform this has been a widely used metric by analysts to value our business and hence we believe this will better help potential investors in analysing the cash generation from our operating assets we have disclosed cfe for our operational assets on a consolidated basis which is not our cash from operations on a consolidated basis we believe cfe supplements gaap results to provide a more complete understanding of the financial and operating performance of our businesses than would not otherwise be achieved using gaap results alone cfe should be used as a supplemental measure and not in lieu of our financial results reported under gaap we have also bifurcated the cfe into operational assets and others as defined below so that users of our financial statements are able to understand the cash generation from our operational assets we define our operational assets as the projects which had commenced operations on or before september 30 2021 the operational assets represent the mws operating as on the date we define others as i the project spv s which are under construction or under development ii corporate which includes our three mauritius entities iii other projects not covered under operational assets iv a company incorporated in the united states and v other entities under the group which are newly incorporated we define debt amortisation as the current portion of long term debt which has been repaid during the period as part of debt repayment obligations excluding the debt which has been repaid extinguished or refinanced it does not include the amortisation of debt financing costs and interest and hedge payments during the period other items from the statement of cash flows include most of the items that reconcile net loss gain and changes in operating assets and liabilities from the statement of cash flows other than deferred taxes non cash employee benefit and amortization of hedging costs azure power global limited condensed

well who are you i told you george i m your guardian angels what is it you want you want the moon just say the word and i ll throw a lasso around and pull it down frank capra never intended it for it to be a christmas movie because it was supposed to be released at the beginning of the next year and and the movie sinbad the sailor wasn t quite ready so they came to frank hyper and they said get your movie ready and so he rapidly put it together and it was released at the globe theater in new york city on december 20 so that was a little late for christmas but like i say you know they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then bombed more or less it was not a hit me have a hectic day oh yeah another big red letter day for the baileys i have vivid memories of doing that film working on the set don t remember much about off the sex um just remember getting up real early in the morning it was dark and taking busses and streetcars out to colder city uh to do a day s work um but on the set capra would you know squat down i d i tell me what he wanted me to do and do i understand it and i said yes sir and that s funny 4 5 years of age and i remember so vividly daddy kinch hey film that can evoke that kind of emotion in a lot of men means an awful lot in our hearts and really does touch our lives and i think it impacts us in a way that we want to be like georgia to learn what he learned and we look at our lives and we say oh my gosh i do have something positive here and it just turns us around every year at christmas time and some people watch it all year long because it gives us such an optimistic view of of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen advertisement two stars of it s a wonderful life look back at the christmas classic share copy link copy it was just another job for child actor karolyn grimes she was 6 and had already done four movies by the summer of 1946 when filming began on it s a wonderful life the only thing she recalls about the biggest movie of her career was being delighted to play in the snow on the set that single job would become very memorable to a lot of other people it s a wonderful life which marks its 75th anniversary this year is now a beloved holiday tradition across the globe it s a once a year pick me up for the humanity of america and the world grimes told the associated press it s a good impetus to really keep us going in a positive direction it s a wonderful life was released in late 1946 produced and directed by frank capra and starring jimmy stewart and donna reed it takes place on christmas eve in a small town the film centers on the character of george bailey played by stewart who considers suicide until his guardian angel intervenes and shows him all the people whose lives he has touched and the difference he has made in the community one memorable character is zuzu played by grimes she gets to say every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings and the petals from zuzu s rose stuffed into a pants pocket by stewart s bailey as he comforts his sickly daughter become a symbol of life if grimes is sort of fuzzy on the filming details jimmy hawkins another former child actor who played tommy in the film is the opposite he recalls as a 4 year old getting up while it was dark and taking buses and streetcars to culver city to film his scenes i have vivid memories of doing that film he says on the set capra would squat down eye to eye tell me what he wanted me to do and did i understand it i said oh yes sir grimes and hawkins are the last surviving members of the cast and have chosen to represent the film s legacy and spread its lesson of doing good we feel we re lucky to have played those parts and carry frank capra s message he s not around to do it and he gave us a great part and a lot of wonderful memories so we just naturally do it says hawkins we want to carry on that message whether it s to inmates at attica or ringing the bell at the stock exchange we talk to everybody to keep it going paramount home entertainment has released a limited edition two disc blu ray set with a colorized version of the film in high definition as well as the original digitally remastered black and white movie in high definition the set includes over 45 minutes of bonus content the movie was nominated for five oscars and has been recognized by the american film institute as one of the 100 best american films ever made the movie also earned first place for most inspirational american film of all time by the afi it gives us such an optimistic view of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen said grimes hawkins recalls capra with a strong vision for the film faith hope and life renewed the movie he made might be sentimental but on the set the director was not at all it was his movie he says people fell by the wayside because it was his vision if you didn t have his vision you weren t making his move he was very precise very nice to everybody on the set but now it s a job the film now closely associated with christmas wasn t initially intended to be released over the holidays but rko s scheduled christmas movie in 1946 sinbad the sailor wasn t ready so the studio asked capra to rush production of it s a wonderful life it was released dec 20 at the globe theatre in new york a little late for a traditional christmas rollout they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then it bombed more or

most cryptocurrencies including bitcoin etherium and dogecoin have had a rather rocky time in december with prices continuously sliding lower bitcoin prices are down almost 25 per cent since the mid november peak and a trading rooms are quite worried as the price has now moved below the 49 000 level technical charts are indicating that the slide could extend to 43 000 or even the 31 500 level from where the recent rally began in july 2021 now a decline to the july low would mean that trader wealth held in bitcoins halves from the november peak this would be catastrophic in any other asset such as stocks bonds or commodities but in crypto world it is on par for the course between december 2017 and april 2018 bitcoin prices fell 65 per cent between march and july this year too prices had declined around 50 per cent cryptocurrency investors have already made a ton of money when bitcoin price raced up from 5 000 in march 2020 to 61 000 in march 2021 anyone who already held bitcoin as on march 2020 and had the good sense to hold on to it through the ensuing frenzy would have multiplied the value of his her holding by 11 2 times no one should really be surprised at an asset that increases with such rapidity sliding equally dramatically but there are many reasons why the runaway rally in cryptocurrencies could be behind us one the us dollar is beginning to strengthen again and this is a signal that risk aversion is increasing global investors typically take money out of risky assets in such conditions and cryptocurrencies are among the riskiest assets two most of global regulators are beginning to take a closer look at the trading on crypto platforms and are in the process of framing regulations for them this is making traders nervous three global central banks are beginning to suck back the money pumped in during the pandemic everyone knows that the rally in speculative assets such as cryptos nfts spacs etc over the past year was mainly due to the surplus funds sloshing around in global markets as this surplus reduces cryptos face risk of traders fleeing the exchanges four global interest rates are going to begin moving higher soon interest rates close to zero has made traders borrow at rock bottom rates to invest in these risky assets as rates begin moving higher traders would have to sell the asset to repay their loans which become more expensive in short headwinds are increasing for the cryptocurrencies and traders seem to have sensed that already meanwhile regulators are becoming quite serious about framing laws for trading in these cryptos this week chiefs of many of the top cryptocurrency companies in the us appeared before a us congressional committee as the legislators tried to understand the beast the hearing was titled in a very correct manner digital asset and the future of finance understanding the challenges and benefits of financial innovation in the united states it needs to be noted that the us congress called them digital assets and not currencies and is handling them as a financial innovation that is what the stakeholders in both the us and india want legislators to do not quash them altogether or make them go underground but to treat them as an innovation and frame rules within which they can function the wait for indian parliament to discuss or take a decision of the cryptocurrency bill seems set to prolong for some more time as indian legislators may kick the can down the road once again there are rumours that the bill will once again be tabled in the budget session on one side it s good that indian government is not taking the path china took in banning cryptos altogether on the other hand india is losing the chance to take lead in regulating these digital asset share copy link email facebook twitter telegram linkedin whatsapp reddit

well who are you i told you george i m your guardian angels what is it you want you want the moon just say the word and i ll throw a lasso around and pull it down frank capra never intended it for it to be a christmas movie because it was supposed to be released at the beginning of the next year and and the movie sinbad the sailor wasn t quite ready so they came to frank hyper and they said get your movie ready and so he rapidly put it together and it was released at the globe theater in new york city on december 20 so that was a little late for christmas but like i say you know they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then bombed more or less it was not a hit me have a hectic day oh yeah another big red letter day for the baileys i have vivid memories of doing that film working on the set don t remember much about off the sex um just remember getting up real early in the morning it was dark and taking busses and streetcars out to colder city uh to do a day s work um but on the set capra would you know squat down i d i tell me what he wanted me to do and do i understand it and i said yes sir and that s funny 4 5 years of age and i remember so vividly daddy kinch hey film that can evoke that kind of emotion in a lot of men means an awful lot in our hearts and really does touch our lives and i think it impacts us in a way that we want to be like georgia to learn what he learned and we look at our lives and we say oh my gosh i do have something positive here and it just turns us around every year at christmas time and some people watch it all year long because it gives us such an optimistic view of of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen advertisement two stars of it s a wonderful life look back at the christmas classic share copy link copy it was just another job for child actor karolyn grimes she was 6 and had already done four movies by the summer of 1946 when filming began on it s a wonderful life the only thing she recalls about the biggest movie of her career was being delighted to play in the snow on the set that single job would become very memorable to a lot of other people it s a wonderful life which marks its 75th anniversary this year is now a beloved holiday tradition across the globe it s a once a year pick me up for the humanity of america and the world grimes told the associated press it s a good impetus to really keep us going in a positive direction it s a wonderful life was released in late 1946 produced and directed by frank capra and starring jimmy stewart and donna reed it takes place on christmas eve in a small town the film centers on the character of george bailey played by stewart who considers suicide until his guardian angel intervenes and shows him all the people whose lives he has touched and the difference he has made in the community one memorable character is zuzu played by grimes she gets to say every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings and the petals from zuzu s rose stuffed into a pants pocket by stewart s bailey as he comforts his sickly daughter become a symbol of life if grimes is sort of fuzzy on the filming details jimmy hawkins another former child actor who played tommy in the film is the opposite he recalls as a 4 year old getting up while it was dark and taking buses and streetcars to culver city to film his scenes i have vivid memories of doing that film he says on the set capra would squat down eye to eye tell me what he wanted me to do and did i understand it i said oh yes sir grimes and hawkins are the last surviving members of the cast and have chosen to represent the film s legacy and spread its lesson of doing good we feel we re lucky to have played those parts and carry frank capra s message he s not around to do it and he gave us a great part and a lot of wonderful memories so we just naturally do it says hawkins we want to carry on that message whether it s to inmates at attica or ringing the bell at the stock exchange we talk to everybody to keep it going paramount home entertainment has released a limited edition two disc blu ray set with a colorized version of the film in high definition as well as the original digitally remastered black and white movie in high definition the set includes over 45 minutes of bonus content the movie was nominated for five oscars and has been recognized by the american film institute as one of the 100 best american films ever made the movie also earned first place for most inspirational american film of all time by the afi it gives us such an optimistic view of what our lives can be and we have the power to make that we can make a difference and we can make things happen said grimes hawkins recalls capra with a strong vision for the film faith hope and life renewed the movie he made might be sentimental but on the set the director was not at all it was his movie he says people fell by the wayside because it was his vision if you didn t have his vision you weren t making his move he was very precise very nice to everybody on the set but now it s a job the film now closely associated with christmas wasn t initially intended to be released over the holidays but rko s scheduled christmas movie in 1946 sinbad the sailor wasn t ready so the studio asked capra to rush production of it s a wonderful life it was released dec 20 at the globe theatre in new york a little late for a traditional christmas rollout they did a beautiful job of getting it out there and then it bombed more or less it was not a hit says grimes but then in the early 70s it became public domain and it was on every channel every year grimes still gets letters from all over the globe and from generations of viewers i get a lot of fan mail from great britain and even the mideast and all kinds of places she says it s reaching a lot of people and i think people will want to make a difference
