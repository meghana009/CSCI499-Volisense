house speaker nancy pelosi said that she directed the house administration committee to examine various proposals to ban members of congress and top hill aides from trading individual stocks bending to growing bipartisan pressure on the issue after previously dismissing concerns about individuals trading stocks but she stopped short of throwing her full fledged support behind stock trading bans did not specify whether she would support a ban on members spouses trading stocks and said that any such bill should include new disclosure requirements on federal judges and the supreme court still it is an evolution from pelosi saying in december that members should be able to participate in the free market economy as her husband paul pelosi s millions in stock trades sparked ethics concerns a number of members of congress have introduced various pieces of legislation to ban members from trading stocks most recently republican montana sen steve daines and democratic massachusetts sen elizabeth warren on wednesday revealed a bill to do so senate majority leader chuck schumer on tuesday came out in support of a stock trading ban saying i believe in it and would like to see members come up with one bill i would like to see it done but in a press conference on wednesday pelosi said that she would like to see any proposal that comes out of the committee have certain criteria we have to tighten the fines for those who violate the stock act pelosi said calling it not sufficient to deter behavior in its current form secondly it has to be government wide the court system the third branch of government the judiciary has no reporting the supreme court has no disclosure it has no reporting of stock transactions and it makes important decisions every day pelosi said she added that when members of the executive branch divest from stocks they do not have to pay capital gains tax i do believe in the integrity of people in public service i want the public to have that understanding we have to do this to deter something that we see as a problem pelosi said but it is a confidence issue and if that s what the members want to do then that s what we will do interest in a stock trading ban for members picked up after a business insider investigation last year asserted that dozens of members had recently failed to meet those requirements and that members have been trading stocks in industries where they have oversight responsibilities republican congressional leaders are also open to banning members from trading individual stocks house minority leader kevin mccarthy is looking at possible legislative solutions to address conflict of interest in members trading stocks and ensure that members do not get special treatment according to a source close to mccarthy s thinking senate minority leader mitch mcconnell told reporters tuesday that while he hasn t thought deeply about banning members from trading stocks he will take a look at proposed legislation he added that he has all his assets in mutual funds and advises that other members do the same
updated february 9 2022 at 3 26 pm et top congressional democrats are signaling congress could vote soon on legislation to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks the move comes amid pressure from rank and file members from both parties arguing that voters overwhelmingly back the idea house speaker nancy pelosi d calif doesn t personally trade individual stocks her husband does she said in december she didn t think a ban was necessary but has reversed course as members in her caucus have pushed the issue it is a confidence issue and if that s what members want to do then that s what we will do pelosi said at her weekly press conference on wednesday she added house committees were working on a proposal and a bill could move pretty soon senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y also signaled his support for a ban i believe this is an important issue that congress should address and it s something that has clearly raised interest from both sides of the aisle over the last few weeks schumer said wednesday two house members from different parties push bill texas republican chip roy and virginia democrat abigail spanberger were elected in the same class in 2018 they didn t campaign on the same issues but they learned they shared the same alma mater and favorite basketball team the same birthday and over a beer learned there are some problems they could try to solve together the two introduced legislation in june 2020 to ban members of congress from trading individual stocks they decided to work on the issue after talking about news stories about several members of congress who were under investigation for stock transactions they made following briefings in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic before the impact on the u s economy was clear during an interview with both lawmakers roy bristled a bit at the narrative they re political polar opposites i mean we disagree on a lot but we agree on a lot too there s a number of things that we re trying to come together and sort of sit over beer literally and solve some problems ting shen for npr ting shen for npr rep roy and rep spanberger chat while walking though the longworth house office building on capitol hill there s a 10 year old law already on the books called the stock act that requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades within 45 days but spanberger says that approach doesn t work it s not just enough to know what members are buying or selling it s that they shouldn t be buying or selling she said the campaign legal center recently told npr that in the last year roughly 50 members of congress failed to disclose or filed late reports on their stock transactions roy said lawmakers have an inherent conflict of interest because they attend briefings and sit on committees that impact corporate bottom lines if you are buying calls on google how can american people have confidence that you re going to make a truly objective policy decision on the size and scope of google with respect to antitrust questions for example roy asked ting shen for npr ting shen for npr roy says lawmakers just have an inherent conflict of interest because they attend briefings and sit on committees that impact corporate bottom lines the texas republican points to his own experience he had an investment in a pipeline that ran through his district but he opposed something they were doing and was part of discussions to address it he thought maybe he should sell his shares but immediately realized any transaction would raise questions but then i called ethics and i said wait a second i m beating them up now publicly so if i unload it now it looks like i m kind of gaming it while i m trying to beat him up so i ended up kind of sitting on it which i think was actually to my financial detriment but that s neither here nor there to this point my point is we shouldn t be in that box both spanberger and roy note their bill wouldn t prevent lawmakers from investing none of this would stop you from being able to engage in free enterprise in the free market being able to continue to to hold your investments all we re saying is put it in a blind trust or be in broadly traded index funds roy said spanberger added that change should be part of the process of entering federal public service saying that we want to affirmatively ensure that the american people can have trust in us in the decisions we re making and therefore we cannot own individual stocks or we have to put it in a blind trust that to me is a choice you make when you choose to run for this office ting shen for npr ting shen for npr spanberger says the change should just be part of the process of entering federal public service focus on how ban impacts families spanberger and roy s proposal the trust in congress act would bar both lawmakers and their immediate family members from picking individual stocks it eludes me as a possibility that someone would say to the american people oh no no no no my spouse makes all his own decisions just because i m in covid briefings ignore the fact that when a pandemic started he s buying stocks and insert pharmaceutical company name right people are gonna say you re insulting my intelligence right it s bad if you do it it s bad if they do it spanberger told npr roy said if members have concerns they are open to tweaks to the legislation we can solve this problem this isn t curing cancer right i mean we can just sit down figure out a solution that we think works and then you can always amend it later and both bemoan the fact that in the current political environment there is a tendency to avoid signing onto bills without 100 agreement on every detail different proposals being debated in house and senate in the senate there are efforts to find consensus within the democratic caucus as well as with gop senators who have proposed bills according to multiple sources familiar with the talks one proposal introduced years ago by oregon sen jeff merkley d ore would ban lawmakers and senior staff from buying and selling individual stocks he s been discussing proposals with sen mitt romney r utah and informal talks have picked up in recent weeks sen jon ossoff d ga and sen mark kelly d ariz have introduced the senate companion bill to roy and spanberger s house bill sen elizabeth warren d mass and sen steve daines r mont are working on a proposal while sen ben sasse r neb has introduced a broader ethics reform bill and sen josh hawley r mo is pushing a bill with a ban on trading pelosi declined to get into the details on which proposal would make it to the house floor but said she wants to extend any reforms to the federal judiciary roy and spanberger s bill has about 45 co sponsors another bipartisan bill being pushed by rep raja krishnamoorthi d ill rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y rep matt gaetz r fla and others in the house has a similar level of support their proposal does not cover spouses and dependent children but does include a ban for senior staffers grassroots calls for change both spanberger and roy said this is one issue that voters from both parties agree on roy recalled how this topic resonates with different constituencies back home of all the issues that i talk about this one gets one of the most positive reactions across the ideological spectrum whether i m in downtown austin or in fire breathing hill country really why hasn t that already been done so does spanberger this is the one piece of legislation that people are coming up to me and saying oh my gosh i was reading about that bill that to me is really notable they say making this reform is an easy way to make absolutely clear that lawmakers make decisions without any ulterior financial motive ting shen for npr ting shen for npr spanberger shows roy a framed picture in her office both lawmakers bemoan that in the current political environment there is a tendency to avoid signing onto bills without 100 agreement on every detail it s a chance for us to say when i m working on legislation when i m taking a vote when i m in a briefing i m not thinking oh let me wonder how this could benefit me financially i m thinking about how do i serve my constituents spanberger explained people deserve to know that we are working for them first and foremost and not our own financial stock portfolios roy agreed i think this would be a very you know simple statement that you shouldn t be able to get wealthy on the back of the job you are carrying out on behalf of the people you represent one point roy and spanberger make is the process they used to develop the bill talking across the aisle and being open to changes is the same one they think needs to happen more often in washington merkley who pressed for a ban on trading when congress was debating the stock act a decade ago said in a written statement that an update to ethics laws is overdue we re seeing growing interest on both sides of the aisle in taking this issue on and i m hopeful that this is the moment in which we can finally get this issue on the floor and passed it s time to end conflicted trading once and for all copyright

terry gross host this is fresh air i m terry gross when you think of the acting technique known as the method you may think of raging bull and how robert de niro gained 60 pounds to play boxer jake lamotta in his retirement you may think of actors who stay in character even while they re not performing or as my guest isaac butler puts it we tend to think of the method as some goofy hocus pocus that actors particularly the more self important ones get up to in order to do their job or as someone he met once put it it s remembering the most traumatic thing that ever happened to you in order to make yourself cry but the method is much much more butler says in his new book the method how the 20th century learned to act he describes the history of the method from the series of techniques created in the early 1900s by the russian director konstantin stanislavski through the american adaptation created by the group theatre and the actors studio and the actors who brought those techniques to their work on stage and screen it s also the story of how acting was influenced by war social change and personal and aesthetic battles isaac butler also co wrote the book the world only spins forward the ascent of angels in america he s also a theater director teaches theater history and performance at the new school co hosts the slate podcast working about the creative process and is a cultural critic whose writing frequently appears in slate isaac butler welcome to fresh air as someone who frequently interviews actors i really enjoyed and appreciated reading your book let s start with an example that you think an example of a performance that you think embodies the method isaac butler thank you so much for having me terry you know when i think about the method i think of a performance like al pacino s in the first godfather film in that you know a lot of that role is communicated non verbally through you watching the character think the character s often feeling emotions in a very intense way but not letting them out but also allowing you to see that they are feeling them you know there s a certain amount of mystery to the character and idiosyncrasy it feels like a real person in all of their complexity not like a type or a stock role or anything like that and you know al pacino just seems really alive in the moment and really present in that role at all times so to me that s an example of the kind of performances that the method helped usher to the fore over the course of the 20th century gross i forget who it was but one of the you know method directors or a teacher said you know let someone else take the part with a lot of dialogue you take the part where you re just like thinking and reacting butler yeah absolutely that was kazan you know when he was when elia kazan briefly was trying to be a film actor you know he really learned from the other actors on set that part of what you do is you let everyone else say all the lines that the camera is can really read your mind and it can really see your thoughts on your face so part of the thing that you do is you just think and the camera will see what you re thinking gross there s different approaches to the method but one of them really emphasizes digging into your own emotional history your emotional memories to use those to get into your character and you were practicing that when you were in college and you had a role and you had been a professional child actor and you write in the introduction to your book that through this process of mining your own emotional memories you retreated too far into your personal darkness can you describe how that happened because i d really like to understand how like psychologically upsetting it can be to take this approach to plumbing your own emotional depths butler yeah absolutely you know it s funny it was over two decades ago but i still remember it really vividly the play was talk radio which is by eric bogosian and he wrote it for himself to play the lead character who s this kind of like shock jock right and over the course of the 90 minute play the actor playing that part you are chain smoking and you re talking to people who are calling in to the radio and then at the end of 90 minutes on stage you have a nervous breakdown you know live on the air that s the arc of the play and this was a college production it was student directors who you know of course didn t really know what they were doing and neither did any of the rest of us and we probably had two or three weeks of rehearsal and you know the character i was playing was older than me had a lot more life experience and they re having their nervous breakdown based on whatever is the matter with them and i the only way i knew how to find a connection to them was to go deep into the things that i thought were wrong with me and you know my own depression at being you know newly in college my own loneliness and my own feelings of inadequacy and guilt and all sorts of other things and so i really spent a lot of time thinking through those things and finding them and finding images or sensory ideas associated with them so i could kind of trigger them and so i was doing that on stage and at the same time chain smoking real cigarettes for 90 minutes and so you know i would end every performance feeling completely wrung out emotionally and physically ill simultaneously and so what i would have to do at the end of the show is i would go back to my dorm room and i would just stare at a blank wall until i kind of like my stomach settled down and i felt my humanity return and you know that show only performed three or four times and i just remember at the end of it saying to myself i am not tough enough to keep doing this again and again and again for part after part i can t do this and that was the last moment in my life that i really considered pursuing a career as an actor i very quickly switched to focusing on directing and then eventually to writing which led to the book that we re talking about today gross so is this one of the fundamental aesthetic battles in acting whether you have to kind of damage yourself in order to play a role butler certainly one of the fundamental aesthetic battles in acting is whether the actors should be on some level really experiencing what the character is experiencing while they re on stage or on screen and you know for hundreds of years the consensus was no they absolutely shouldn t do should not do that that is in poor taste you know they can t really play the part if they re doing that they can t control themselves et cetera and so forth but you know starting with konstantin stanislavski and then with the people who followed in his footsteps we as a culture changed our mind about that and we began to prize things like vulnerability and risk and on the actor s part and the sense that they are really on some level really doing what the character is doing not to such an extent that they lose all sense of themselves because that truly would be madness but that something real is at stake in those performances gross so let s talk about the roots of the method the method is an american version of the acting techniques that were codified by konstantin stanislavski the russian director who co founded the moscow art theatre in the 1890s he started codifying his approach in 1906 he called it the system can you describe some of the basic tenets of the system butler sure the system flows from a couple of really simple core ideas one of them has to do with the necessity of the actor experiencing is the word that they use experiencing is a rough translation of a russian word perezhivanie and it means just that moment where the actor is so into the imagined reality of the character that to some extent they re really feeling and experiencing what the character is going through and some of its other sort of core ideas are that the actor is their own material they re kind of both the painter and the paint that a role should be divided up into its component parts which he called bits that he was very into physical relaxation and the actor using the powers of concentration and attention to forget the audience was there and to try to kind of live again within the imagined reality of the play and of the character one of the things that he was also very interested in which would become particularly notorious in the united states was this idea of affective memory and affective memory is essentially triggering a strong emotional state that you might need to play the character through using your own memories of when you have experienced that emotion gross he also had a principle that acting should be guided by actions by things that you wanted or needed demands that you had you give the example of if you re thirsty then you want a glass of water butler yes yeah hopefully in most plays it s more high stakes than just being thirsty right but yes actually one of his ideas that goes on to be really the cornerstone of a lot of american acting and directing and script analysis is that characters are always wanting something and they re always doing something in pursuit of the thing that they want and those wants and the things they re doing there s a whole lot of different names for them the task the problem the objective the action but whatever you call it the core idea is that i as a character have something that i need something that i want and that i m going to do things which is often language is the thing that i m doing but i m going to do something to accomplish that end gross stanislavsky also emphasized the importance of rehearsals and he was really really strict about them and he d have people rehearse like over and over and over and over again until they d get angry with him butler yeah absolutely that predates the system really that comes from the very start of his career you know he was rebelling against a status quo in russia where plays weren t really rehearsed that much they were rehearsed like nine times maybe the dress rehearsal was a relatively new idea and so he was rebelling against that by saying no the whole point of rehearsal is that we re going to do this over and over again the actors and the director are going to have a unified vision of what the play is trying to do and they re all going to kind of sublimate themselves to that unified vision and we re going to do it over and over and over again until we get it right that becomes particularly extreme once he starts using his rehearsal periods to experiment with developing the system and probably the you know his production of hamlet rehearses for something like three years you know so eventually it gets really really out of control and there are times where he rehearses things for 14 months and the play is no better off than it was at the beginning so those two ideas one that predates the system and one that comes from the system kind of intersect in ways that eventually cause him a huge number of problems gross well let s take a break and then we ll talk some more if you re just joining us my guest is isaac butler author of the new book the method we ll talk more after a break this is fresh air soundbite of music gross this is fresh air let s get back to my interview with isaac butler author of the new book the method about the history of that acting technique the people who created and fought over it the actors who practiced it and how it fell out of favor so in the early 1920s stanislavsky brings his moscow art theatre to the states and it really is an amazing experience for some up and coming actors and directors can you talk a little bit about the impact of the moscow art theatre on acting in new york acting and directing in new york butler yeah i mean it s sort of difficult to oversell how important their broadway run on their u s tour was people had really never seen acting like what they saw from the moscow art theatre you know john barrymore wrote a letter to the producer that was published in the new york times saying it was the best acting ensemble he d ever seen you know people would come back night after night wrapped with attention to what they were seeing and these plays it should be said were performed in russian and most of the audience members did not speak russian so it s even coming across this language barrier and what they were particularly swept away by was that every actor in the moscow art theatre would sort of fully dedicate themselves to their characters even if those characters were supernumeraries even if those characters were you know a spear carrier that spear carrier would feel like a real human being and that had always been the moscow art theatre s approach stanislavsky is the guy who came up with the phrase there are no small parts only small actors and he really lived it in his company and so you would just see this ensemble who were all on the same page working towards the same ends and giving it their all and people were completely blown away by it and you know many of those people lee strasberg stella adler harold clurman among them would go on to become some of the foremost thinkers about acting and theater in the united states for the rest of the 20th century gross and some of the people who you just mentioned studied with maria ouspenskaya who was from the moscow art theatre but stayed in america and started teaching butler yes yes ouspenskaya and this guy richard boleslavsky were two members of the moscow art theatre who wound up staying in new york boleslavsky was actually already there because of his political beliefs and ouspenskaya also was informed while on tour that she couldn t return to moscow and so she remained in new york and boleslavsky hired her to teach at this new acting school he founded called the american lab theatre the goal of which was really to teach stanislavsky s ideas in the united states and to create a kind of mini moscow art theatre in the u s and ouspenskaya was the person who really taught the system to her american pupils and she was like stanislavsky before her famous for how harsh her critique could be in her case it had a really explicit pedagogical purpose which was that acting is very frightening you have to do a lot of scary things and so if you could kind of survive her you know you had a bulletproof vest for the rest of your career if you could really survive her you know flensing of your ego laughter in her class and she was the one who really taught these techniques that were the core of the system to people like strasberg clurman stella adler gross and if you could survive her you could survive the rejections you d be getting when you audition for a show or the bad reviews you d be getting butler yes absolutely i mean being an actor is tough it s never been the case that being an actor is an easy job you have to deal with a lot of rejection you have to deal with a lot of bad reviews you have to deal with people not treating you well i mean it s a tough life and so she thought of herself as toughening up her young charges for this difficult life they were going to have to lead gross stanislavski s theater group the moscow art theatre when they perform in new york that leads in various ways to the creation of the group theatre which was you know an early laboratory for the american version of stanislavski which is what became known as the method among the co founders were harold clurman and lee strasberg what was the group theatre and what are some of the ways that it was trying to innovate what theater was in america butler so the group theatre was an ensemble theater producing new works on broadway with a fixed acting company it was co founded by harold clurman cheryl crawford and lee strasberg and the idea was to create and discover a uniquely american voice a uniquely american way of doing theater and whose acting techniques would draw on stanislavski to create sort of the most sort of present vital living alive feeling acting possible the idea was you know that we were in the midst of the great depression the theater starts performing in 1931 we re in the midst of the great depression we re still recovering from the wreckage of world war i that america was filled with a new people and that out of this wreckage could grow a kind of utopia and the group was in some ways they were utopian dreamers and their theater company was a utopian dream and of course didn t work out that way the company lasted 10 years before going bankrupt but along the way it launched the careers of you know harold clurman prominent critic and director lee strasberg who became the most important and famous acting teacher in america of the 20th century stella adler his rival sanford meisner who s also an incredibly important acting teacher clifford odets the most important playwright of the 1930s and of course elia kazan who for a while was the most important theater director and the most important film director simultaneously and several of those people then went on after the group died to found the actors studio which became the kind of high temple of the method from then on gross the group theatre also launched the battle the aesthetic battle between lee strasberg and stella adler about how to interpret stanislavski so what was that battle about butler well part of what that battle was about was that they despised each other on a personal level and had for years so you know part of it had to do with their own personal animus i think it could have been a respectable difference of opinion otherwise laughter but stella adler was an actor in the group and lee was the director and the kind of acting guru and from the get go adler really disliked lee strasburg s emphasis on psychology and on emotion and on the actors personal experiences and using their personal experiences to realize the part she had trouble doing it she also didn t like doing it she thought that it was sick was the word that she would use many times and she was also often the lead in these plays so she s fighting with lee strasberg all the time about acting technique and then finally on a trip to europe she goes to moscow and then to paris with harold clurman who was her on again off again lover and eventually her husband in paris she actually meets stanislavski and she is trying to be kind of polite but finally she can t hold it back any longer and she says you know mr stanislavski i loved acting before i studied your system and it s ruined me and i hate it now and stanislavski says to her well perhaps you re not doing it right but either way why don t you come to my apartment tomorrow and we ll start working together and maybe i can help you and so they worked together in french and she translates a scene she was having trouble with in french and they work really hard at it and for a few weeks and then she comes back to the united states and she tells the group theatre lee has gotten stanislavski all wrong stanislavski is not about personal experience and he s not about these affective memories and he s not about using your emotions the core of the system is actually imagination the core of the system is action all those other things you and i were talking about earlier terry action the problem the objective what the character wants the system is about behavior and the system is about the circumstances in which the characters find themselves and the context in which they live and so from then on there s really this battle about you know who is really representing the truth of what stanislavski taught is it about psychology and emotion is it about imagination and behavior and i think the truth of the matter is it s kind of about both and it depends on what the specific actor needs but that fight is really fascinating and it lasts for the rest of their lives and even posthumously people are still arguing about it gross let s take another break here if you re just joining us my guest is isaac butler author of the new book the method we ll talk more after a break i m terry gross and this is fresh air soundbite of leonard bernstein s on the waterfront main title gross this is fresh air i m terry gross let s get back to my interview with isaac butler author of the new book the method about the history of that acting technique the people who created and fought over it the actors who practiced it and how it fell out of favor butler also co wrote the book the world only spins forward the ascent of angels in america he s a theater director teaches theater history and performance at the new school co hosts the slate podcast working about the creative process and is a cultural critic whose writing frequently appears in slate we were talking about the group theatre and the directors and actors that came out of it it started as a theater group in the 1930s and as you know film expanded and you know sound on film became really popular some of the actors from there and the directors too migrated to hollywood so give us an example of an actor who learned the method through the group theatre and went on to hollywood afterwards and how they had to tune up what they learned for the screen which reveals really different things than the stage does because the audience is seated at such a far distance in the theater whereas close ups enable you to see details you d miss on stage butler that s a great question and it s really important because film and television actually becomes in many ways sort of the largest vehicle for the method throughout the rest of the century and you know in some ways the most important actor to come out of the group who i maintain is actually the first method film star is a man named john garfield and john garfield quits the group over a dispute over a role in a play and he goes out west to because his wife is pregnant and they need money and you know this is what he knows how to do and he s going to make money and he lands a role in 1938 in this film called four daughters which is directed by michael curtiz and stars claude rains and is written by the guys who go on to write casablanca and he gives this unbelievable performance in this kind of nothing movie it s a very silly slight film but the performance he gives you know as soon as he walks on camera you can just tell that something is happening that acting is changing that the norms around what a character is that they re never going to be the same on some level because he s so vital and in the moment and he feels much more like a real person than everyone else but it wasn t easy for him to learn how to do that he couldn t just do a stage performance on camera if you ve ever seen someone just give sort of a stage size performance on camera it s really too much because the camera picks up so much that an audience in the theater will not see it can really see you think or people talk about it reading your mind or i think john garfield calls the camera like the great monstrous eye you know and so he really had to learn how to do much less and much less and much less and to strip away and to learn how to perform with a new kind of ease and spontaneity that the camera would kind of pick up and enjoy that was really what he had to learn to do to be a great film actor which he really was gross so what would you say was different about him and about other people who came out of the method compared to their predecessors in on screen butler yeah on screen absolutely so part of what s going on is in the 30s and 40s is you know the height of the hollywood studio system so the hollywood studios own the movie theaters their work is going to be presented in they have the actors on these incredibly detailed contracts so the actors are full time employees of the studios but the studios also kind of own them and control their lives in all these ways and the movies that they re making at this time revolve in terms of acting around type so what they would do with a new actor and new star is they would create this persona for that actor with that actor s cooperation often but not always and then on camera they are playing some variation of that type in every part so when you go to see to pick a brilliant actor from that time period when you go to see cary grant in a movie from the 40s you are not going to be convinced that cary grant is playing a real person the joy of it is watching cary grant play this kind of variation on what a cary grant part is so you know i mean you ve seen bringing up baby right gross yes butler you know an amazing film you re not saying oh cary grant s really an archaeologist right you re like isn t it hilarious to watch gross absolutely yes butler cary grant hike up his pants and go oh oh i m so flustered all the time you know and so that s i mean that stuff is amazing it just has different values starting with john garfield and then especially once people like montgomery clift and marlon brando come along instead what we start to value is versatility the actor s ability to disappear into a role the actor s ability to seem like they are really in the moment and that they are giving a truthful performance that the actor is letting us in to some private vulnerable part of them that we wouldn t normally access and that that s kind of their great gift to us as an audience and we start to value that more and more and more did they disappear into the part did we really believe it was them things like that gross i think maybe also acting becomes more american you know in a lot of like early in a lot of early films a lot of early films are set in more like upper class homes and the american sound almost british in them everything is so formal butler well in the early days of the talkies there was this assumption that audiences wanted to hear english spoke well or spoke correctly and that there was almost an edifying purpose behind it that you know we were going to have proper speech it was called proper speech which really translated into the mid atlantic accent imitating mid atlantic accent which is sort of where the person kind of talks like this you know you think of those old time movies and they re always talking like this right it s sort of english and it s sort of american and the enunciation is very clear the method of course arises out of a working class theater company most of whose members either were immigrants themselves or were the children of immigrants and so part of what they were trying to do in the group and then the actors who follow after it is talk the way real people spoke you know is to put real life on stage you know a lot of them were jews whose parents were from a shtetl and you know they had new york accents and they were going to talk like that and so in the early days of the method s emergence into film they re often getting dinged by their peers and their predecessors for not correctly speaking english and sometimes it is true that it s legitimately difficult to understand what they re saying but there s also a class component and a policing of what whiteness is that is part of this debate that are we really going to let you know this immigrant rabble these italians and jews and stuff like that come in and talk the way they talk gross let s look at marlon brando because his breakthrough roles are in a streetcar named desire and on the waterfront and you know in both of them he s working class he s not speaking with that almost british formal proper way of speaking did he consider himself a method actor because he s always held up as an example of the method butler i m so glad you asked me that because marlon brando absolutely did not consider himself a method actor most importantly because by the time he s emerging in the 50s the method is really lee strasberg they re synonymous you know and marlon brando was a discovery and protege and close friend of stella adler s it s actually stella adler who taught him how to act and he would say in interviews you know lee strasberg never taught me anything it was all stella adler and elia kazan and so you know he was very offended by what he saw as the inappropriate claiming of his work for the method at the same time his performances in those two movies are so unbelievably influential for the generations of male american actors who came afterwards that you know they establish if you want to think of the method as a style that style would absolutely not exist without marlon brando gross how would you define that style butler that s the 64 000 question right so part of that style has to do with speaking colloquially is a big part of that style a lot of it has to do with an emphasis on subtext and emphasis on what the character is not saying not allowing to be voiced on the restraint of emotion and then contrasting that kind of with huge emotional displays when necessary there s that colloquialism of speech also extends to the body and to movement it feels very much like an everyday person it often involves throwing away lines instead of making sure you can clearly understand all of them and often it is marked by and this is particularly because elia kazan was really into this it s often marked by an extensive use of props on set and the use of the actor s hands and the objects they fiddle with to reveal kind of what s going on with the character gross doesn t that eventually come to be seen as bits of busyness that you should be cutting out butler oh absolutely in fact there are reviews of kazan s later stage work on broadway where sometimes the reviewers are kind of rolling their eyes at him and it s like of course here comes kazan with all his stage business again you know it s absolutely true that as with any number of other movements in art that the ideas that seem fresh because they flow out of the i guess authentic point of view of an individual they become codified and then they become stylistic tricks and then they become cliches and that happens all over the place whether we re talking about paint dripping on canvas or you know the way marlon brando does stage business or it becomes brad pitt eating sunflower seeds in every movie or whatever gross laughter butler you know so there is a way in which these become diluted and then they can become a kind of cliche gross let s take another break here if you re just joining us my guest is isaac butler author of the new book the method we ll talk more after a break this is fresh air soundbite of alex north s stan meets blanche gross this is fresh air let s get back to my interview with isaac butler author of the new book the method about the history of that acting technique the people who created and fought over it the actors who practiced it and how it fell out of favor i want to ask you something else about brando you write about how on stage in streetcar named desire he would give like a different performance every night i mean he d say the right lines but his way of delivering them would be different and really threw off his co star jessica tandy and she just really was furious with him so do you see both sides of that butler i absolutely see both sides of that debate and she was not the only one although she was the one who called him a psychopathic bastard gross laughter butler so she definitely was the most colorful about it karl malden who worked with brando many times and i don t think they were friends but it s not like malden hated brando you know there was one point in rehearsals for streetcar when he got into a screaming match with brando because he said you know your pauses are so unpredictable i can t ever get my teeth into this scene and figure out what the rhythm is it is absolutely a professional actor s job to do their role on stage in such a way that enables the best of your colleagues you know that s absolutely part of the job and traditionally and this is still true today one of the ways you do that is to set your performance is to freeze the performance you know part of what the method and the system are trying to help you do is create the illusion of spontaneity within a fixed performance and brando did not do that brando was a kind of mercurial trickster and sometimes could be very very selfish it seems to me and so he would just do whatever he was going to do he would change the timing of lines sometimes he would actually change the lines or throw the lines away or you couldn t hear your cue cause he had mumbled it or whatever and jessica tandy as a classically trained british actor was really ticked at him about it with some justification and she didn t have a lot of allies in that fight because elia kazan and tennessee williams just couldn t get past what a brilliant job brando was doing and it wasn t only them hume cronyn her husband who advocated for her to get the part he s really the reason why she was cast as blanche in the first place hume cronyn could see that brando was sort of overpowering her all the time and so it was a really really difficult struggle for her and eventually brando tried to apologize to her and it didn t go very well and it led to this really extraordinary exchange of letters which i discuss in my book where he tries to apologize for how difficult he was to work with and she kind of gives him what for and says look if you want to be a good actor who s taken seriously and a leader of your profession for the rest of your life cause you are good enough that you could do that you need to shape up and you need to be reliable and you need to act in the author s style not yours gross let s talk about the godfather because in terms of acting techniques it s such a fascinating film it s a wonderful film in every way but let s look at the how the method figures into the godfather so you ve got de niro who studied with stella adler you ve got pacino who studied with her rival lee strasberg and then in godfather ii you ve got lee strasberg himself laughter playing hyman roth butler yes yeah gross so what do you when you look at that film what do you see in terms of conflicting styles and you know background rivalries and what were you able to learn about that from researching the book butler well you know another thing i should say is that you ve also got sanford meisner who s sort of the third rival in there as well because diane keaton and robert duvall and james caan all studied with him and so part of what i see in that actually is that because in some ways the end goal of meisner adler and strasberg is the same and it s that shared end goal with stanislavski of experiencing you know of that kind of absolute truth you can see how all these different paths can lead to a fairly similar or compatible place the acting in those movies is magnificent it is really incredible what they do as an ensemble and you also see little moments that kind of highlight what each of those teachers are best at so i think for example the sequence where al pacino is at the restaurant considering whether or not to commit murder for the first time this is about halfway through the first godfather film and he gets you know he gets the gun from the tank behind the toilet and he s going through this whole sort of tortured consideration of whether he s actually going to go through with this act and how is he going to do it but he never says that there s no lines where he says it you know it s all in his body and it s all in his face and it s almost like you can read his thoughts in the subtext of the character that is lee strasberg s techniques at its best then later in the film when diane keaton is confronting al pacino when kay is confronting michael about whether or not he had his brother in law killed and he s saying over and over and over again don t ask me about my business kay don t ask me about my business kay and they re sort of provoking each other back and forth repeating these same lines over and over and over again that to me is the amazing messiness and spontaneity that sanford meisner really taught his students and he often taught them that through an exercise that involved repeating lines back and forth to one another and then when you get to the second film and you have de niro as the young vito corleone de niro also studied with stella adler and you get this sort of heavily research driven process where he s really trying to feel not only like this character but like an italian immigrant of the early 20th century and what would that person look like how would they inhabit the space what would their accent be like how would they talk you know he has that really weird scratchy voice in that movie and all of that comes from this kind of in depth research that he would do so you really see these pupils bring the best of what those various teachers have to offer in a way that i find just totally thrilling gross i love lee strasberg s performance as hyman roth who is based on meyer lansky i love when he offers everybody tuna fish sandwiches laughter but butler laughter yes gross anyways i wonder what it was like to have him as a working actor since he was like the leading acting teacher of the 20th century butler yeah well you know it s funny because at that point he was incredibly famous as an acting teacher and he was making a lot of money as an acting teacher he did not need to go act in this movie really he didn t and he hadn t acted in decades and he had never acted on screen he was a stage actor briefly but al pacino really wanted him for that part but by the time strasberg agreed to do the movie the movie was already being shot i mean he left he flew out to be on set almost immediately after signing his contract so he did not have a lot of preparation time and one of the reasons why he wanted to do the role was that he wanted to see what it was like to apply his techniques to film and to see you know what he could learn about it in the end result what you see is this really fascinatingly strange performance in part because strasberg was in real life a fascinatingly strange person and what you also see is how much he and al pacino love each other in real life gross if you re just joining us my guest is isaac butler author of the new book the method we ll talk more after a short break this is fresh air soundbite of the city of prague philharmonic orchestra performance of mascagni s intermezzo from cavalleria rusticana gross this is fresh air let s get back to my interview with isaac butler author of the new book the method about the history of that acting technique the people who created and fought over it the actors who practiced it and how it fell out of favor so getting to another de niro role in raging bull de niro plays the boxer jake lamotta and you know later in lamotta s life after he s retired he puts on a lot of weight and de niro gained like 60 pounds for the role and you write about all the really bad health effects gaining 60 pounds in a rapid amount of time affected de niro i don t remember exactly what health problems he developed butler i mean you know when you hear oh well you know for this part you re going to have to eat anything you can get your hands on in italy and france for three months it sounds that sounds like a good gig right i mean who wouldn t want that job i get to eat my way through italy and france awesome but the end result was you know rashes on the inside of his thighs he had trouble sitting up and getting from sitting to standing he had trouble tying his shoes he had high blood pressure he started snoring he got would get fatigued more easily so that the shooting days had to be shorter i mean it had a real serious effect on him and his metabolism gross so that role had a really big effect i think a lot of actors like more and more actors started like gaining weight or losing weight or you know doing something to their body to better understand or better portray or better look like the character that they were playing and de niro isn t the only person who had some kind of physical problem as a result what impact do you think that s had i mean in the past actors didn t do that earlier in acting history butler i think acting had been building towards that in a while but also you cannot overstate the influence of raging bull it is probably the most influential male american acting performance on film after streetcar and on the waterfront right you know but part of the problem that actors steeped in the method were having on set is how do i turn it on on command right because you know like they ve got to set the lighting they got to do this they got to stand you on your mark and then suddenly someone calls action and you have to really be in character well one way to solve that problem is to never break character right one way to solve that problem is to really live as the character as much as possible that is not what strasberg taught strasberg was actually very opposed to that but particularly after raging bull because de niro wins the best actor oscar for it and from that point on de niro is sort of enshrined as our greatest living american film actor it just exerts an enormous influence not only on actors but on the pr and awards campaigns for acting gross oh yes butler and so that exerts its own influence right and so there becomes a kind of material or industrial reason why actors are doing this because then they can talk about the fact that they did it and that leads to the kind of there s a self parody kind of version of this you know we ve all watched the press junkets where someone s like oh yes then i didn t bathe for six months and i got so drunk every night i vomited on myself and so you know that s what i did to get into character and it just seems ridiculous that to me is a kind of perversion of what de niro was trying to do gross i want to end with a quote from lee strasberg that you use in the book he said the profession of acting the basic art of acting is a monstrous thing because it does ph with the same flesh and blood muscles with which you perform ordinary deeds real deeds the body with which you make real love is the same body with which you make fictitious love with someone you don t like in no other art do you have this monstrous thing that really reminds me of what a lot of actors have been telling me on our show which is that your body doesn t know the difference between acting and real life so when you put yourself through something horrible for a role your body doesn t know that you re just acting butler yes absolutely you know the body keeps the score right that s the thing we re saying more and more these days yeah your body does not know that you re acting and your body is not as separate from your psyche as we like to model it you know they re not really that separated actually part of why stanislavski had such a pioneering idea of acting is that he didn t view those two things as separate he viewed them as one interrelated mechanism and they are and as i learned in my own life experience you know the body chain smoking during talk radio was the body who felt like he was going to throw up for hours afterwards that acting is a difficult and physical art form because the actor is their own material and figuring out how you protect yourself within that figuring out how you both do the job and remain a whole healthy human being is one of the particular challenges of being an actor i was not up for it as a human being i just knew i couldn t take it and because of that perhaps i am always admiring of anyone who can do it i just think it s remarkable and you know the things that actors do so that we can be entertained or see some inner truth about our own lives i m very moved by that gross well isaac butler thank you so much for talking with us it was really really interesting i really appreciate it butler this was such a pleasure thank you so much for having me terry gross isaac butler is the author of the new book the method tomorrow we ll

this article is more than 2 years old measuring profitability by what shareholders earned return on equity is a popular measure of profitability and corporate management excellence the measure is determined by dividing the annual earnings of the firm by stockholder s equity this relates earnings generated by a company to the investment that stockholders have made and retained within the firm stockholder s equity is equal to total assets of the firm less all its debt and liabilities also known as stockowner s equity owner s equity or even simply equity it represents investors ownership interest in the company it is also known as the book value of the company warren buffett considers it a positive sign when a company is able to earn above average returns on equity buffett believes that a successful stock investment is the result first and foremost of the underlying business its value to the owner comes primarily from its ability to generate earnings at an increasing rate each year buffett examines management s use of owner s equity looking for management that has proven its ability to employ equity in new moneymaking ventures or for stock buybacks when they offer a greater return if the earnings are properly reinvested in the company earnings should rise over time and stock price valuation will also rise to reflect the increasing value of the business return on equity indicates how much the stockholders earned for their investment in the company annual net income of 100 million created on a base of 300 million in stockholder s equity is very good 100 300 0 30 or 30 however 100 million in annual net income relative to 3 billion in shareholder s equity would be considered relatively poor 100 3 000 0 03 or 3 generally the higher the return on equity the better a return on equity above 15 is good and figures above 20 are considered exceptional however it is important to compare return on equity with industrywide averages to get a true feel for the significance of a company s ratio return on equity defined return on equity can be simply stated as net income divided by common stockholder s equity however return on equity can be broken down into three components net profit margin asset turnover and financial leverage multiplying these three components together results in return on equity american association of individual investors the net profit margin net income divided by sales reflects how efficient a firm is in operations administration financing and tax management per sales dollar a rising or improving profit margin over time translates into an increase in earnings for a given level of sales asset turnover sales divided by total assets shows how well a company utilizes its asset base to produce sales poorly deployed or redundant assets result in a low asset turnover that adversely reflects return on equity and profitability multiplying profit margin and asset turnover together results in return on assets roa a firm can increase its return on assets and thereby its return on equity by increasing its profit margin or its operating efficiency as measured by its asset turnover margins are improved by lowering expenses relative to sales asset turnover can be improved by selling more goods with a given level of assets this is the reason why companies try to divest assets operations that do not generate a high degree of sales relative to the value of the assets or assets that are decreasing their sales generation when examining profit margins or asset turnover it is important to consider industry trends and compare them to how a company is doing within its industry financial leverage completes the return on equity equation financial leverage total assets divided by common stockholder s equity indicates the degree to which the firm has been financed through debt as opposed to equity sources the greater the value of this leverage ratio the greater the financial risk of the firm but also the greater the return on equity if equity is small relative to debt then earnings generated will result in a high return on equity if the firm is profitable the risk with high levels of debt is that a company will not generate enough cash flow to cover the interest payments during challenging times debt magnifies the impact of earnings on return during both good and bad years when large differences between return on assets and return on equity exist an investor should closely examine the liquidity and financial risk ratios the ideal firm would maintain a high net profit margin utilize assets efficiently and do it all with low risk as reflected by a low financial leverage the key in working with return on equity is examining and understanding the interplay between the determinates of the ratio implementing the aaii return on equity screen the primary goal of the aaii return on equity screen is to identify companies with consistently high returns on equity secondarily the approach includes characteristics to filter out firms with high levels of debt low margins and low asset turnover relative to industry medians the aaii return on equity screen has been rewarded by wall street returning 12 1 since inception in 1998 while the s p 500 index has returned 6 6 annually over the same period the approach starts by seeking out companies operating with a return on equity 1 5 times their respective industry median over the last 12 months and each of the last five fiscal years this screen helps to reveal companies whose management has consistently generated the highest profits from its equity capital the aaii return on equity strategy does not simply screen for companies with return on equity levels of 20 or higher but instead looks for ratios that are high relative to industry norms to highlight firms outperforming their peers stocks passing the return on equity screen ranked by return on equity american association of individual investors as discussed above return on equity is influenced by profitability efficiency and leverage therefore the next set of screens seek out companies outperforming their peers in these areas first the aaii return on equity approach requires that a firm s net margin net income divided by sales exceed the industry median over the last four quarters trailing 12 months net profit margin looks at bottom line profitability firms exceeding their peers are translating a higher percentage of sales into profits next the screen makes sure that the asset turnover sales divided by total assets for a firm exceeds the industry median over the last four quarters asset turnover helps to measure the efficiency of a firm s use of its asset base firms exceeding their peers are generating higher levels of sales dollars for a given level of assets the approach also specifies that when looking at the financial leverage of firms the ratio of total liabilities to total assets at the end of the most recent quarter is below the industry median a high return on equity can be attained by having a very high amount of debt and therefore a very low stockholder s equity in such a case return on equity would be high but risky financial leverage increases return but also increases risk highly leveraged firms have more volatile earnings acceptable levels of debt vary from industry to industry more stable industries such as utilities can comfortably carry more debt on their balance sheets than volatile industries such as oil and gas by comparing levels of liabilities to industry medians the aaii return on equity screen takes industry differences into account to help ensure some basic level of growth the strategy requires positive earnings and sales growth over the past 12 months it also requires that the firm s five year historical growth rates in earnings and sales exceed their respective industry medians the approach does not specifically look for high absolute levels of growth just signs that the firms are expanding faster than their peers the aaii return on equity screen also requires that a stock be listed on an exchange to help ensure trading liquidity therefore stocks that trade over the counter otc are excluded due to their special nature the screen also excludes real estate investment trusts reits closed end funds and american depositary receipts adrs _____ the stocks meeting the criteria of the approach do not represent a recommended or buy list it is important to perform due diligence if you want an edge throughout this market volatility become an aaii member

and with that i would now like to introduce rada s ceo mr dov sella to discuss to you dov sella chief executive officer thank you good day to all our participants we had a call with our investor just a few weeks ago where we talked about our unique go to market strategy we cover the status of our markets and discussed our 2022 guidance in today s call we will provide a summary for our fourth quarter and full year of 2021 and the results this reminds you of the afari forecasts ahead and reiterate our guidance for 2022 so let s start with the financial highlights we demonstrate year over year revenue growth in excess of 50 in recent years in some use well over 100 even such growth rates typically expected for successful early stage technology companies and it is unusual to say that at least for established and profitable public companies like us and even more so in the defense industry we reported the revenue of 417 million up to 54 year over year and we remind you that only two years ago in 2019 our only revenue was 44 million and it s more than a third of what we have reported today we are exceptionally proud of these results and even more so given the ongoing corona pandemic and associated work and travel restrictions the supply chain constraints and the product shortages and specifically in the us the delay in us budget for this year and the continuous resolution condition which you feel in effect our ebitda for the year was 27 3 million versus 9 7 million last year it is almost three times a year over year over year growth while revenue grew 54 ebitda grow for 482 demonstrates the operating leverage in our business model because of the investments made in the past few years in our business especially in the us on business operating expense footprint is right sized for today s revenue level and our operating expenses now grow at a much slower rate than revenue furthermore we have the manufacturing capacity for a revenue at significantly higher levels than what we are currently delivering which gives us ample room to grow and beyond that we have also built an ability to add new capacity quickly and at reasonable costs if needed in the future in terms of our balance sheet we ended the quarter with 9 779 million in our cash and we ve absolutely no debt throughout the year we have leveraged our strong cash level to increase our working capital mostly or even the refullfilling conductors to avoid any supply chain issues we are also planning to use our cash for potential m a we are looking to extend our addressable markets beyond the current estimation of the organic team of 6 billion over the next decade and hope to be able to bring you some news on this front in the future let s discuss our 2022 guidance in our annual list for few weeks ago we issued our guidance for 2022 of 140 million or presenting growth of around 20 year over year this is comprised of a number of factors and 9 million are associated with unique revenues which have a similar level to the revenues we achieved from this business over the past few years in the non us assurance flashpoint defense market we forecast over 40 million drawdowns freedom revenues during 2022 it includes also to counter uaf naturally in the united states the stabilization of the shorad and point defense market for us enables us to forecast our revenues based on the relevant line items in the us defense budget about 90 of our guidance are cooperating in the defense budget line items it gives us good visibility and we feel comfortable with our us forecast of 90 million for 2022 to that i want to add that we often receive very short timelines and urgent need look and ship delivery requirements with the whole process taking some time very few weeks this means we are also operating without the luxury of planning back plan backlog for these types of orders and it s one of the reasons we maintain a high level of inventory so we can meet this demand this type of customer of this new and growing market appreciate the top level and short term and long supply that they receive from us that they cannot typically find somewhere else and it s a key factor in us winning new businesses with new customers we note that these short term donor owned revenues that are not part of our forecast represents a further upside to our us revenue expectation for this year let s take a look at our markets and their forecast for the coming year longer term it is our goal to achieve 250 million in annual revenue within 3 to 4 years which implies an accelerated acceleration of our revenue growth in 2023 and beyond a significant driver will be the apf market which is half of a potential market and very much in the incubation stage as the snow we have currently a backlog to deliver returns to the own states and the level of about 30 million and we expect to double or even triple meet by the end of this year which means increased revenues in 2023 and beyond in the us the qualification testing of the iron fist on the bradley airfield it will take place during 2022 it s already ongoing in terms of future potential we also believe that the solution we are part of namely the iron fist is the real candidate for stryker vehicles as well and other programs such as oil free and apf or bpf advanced configuration such as maps are also include for growth potential in future use regarding the issue of flashpoint defense market in the usa a rapid growth since 2017 is mainly due to the us and coas and short market segment and today s we have delivered around 160 million of tactical radars to this is market segment in the us over half of staff in 2022 this reflects a new and emerging market for russian acquisition processes typically during joint urgent operational needs placements with relatively limited multi year of visibility we now see that they are market shifting into a phase of stable growth with multi year of planning and visibility reflected in light line items in the us defense budget as i mentioned earlier but the urgency is still very much along as we see a violation drone and cruise missile attacks in the near east in other geographies sure the important defense programs such as the us and fiji but us army i m sure that they still force a bat so conceived and others have become line items in the budget and reflect multi year acquisition plans such transition from jaunes to program of workload or otf typically take a year or more the fact that we are engaging multiple programs has ensured the sustained growth you re seeing from us in recent years which we expect to continue in the future while we are continuous resolution is still around and jaunes compensated for some of the purchasing delays in the us the recent awards of the so come seek multi year program to enoil a company which is our customer was over 1 billion dollars to them is an encouraging signal that such delays will soon be over regarding the shore of the flashpoint defense markets in the rest of the world and these markets is currently around a 25 of our total revenues and we believe that it will rise to the us levels within a very few years the near east often suffers from terrorist drones and cruise missile attacks it s been an active market for radar since 2019 and continues to hold significant growth potential for the europeans leads lay to countries typically following the doctrine of in solution of the us military and the need for shorad and point defense is becoming recognized though currently the market is incubation phase we are engaged in with quite a few prominent european weapon system providers and our radars are integrated and continuously being tested as part of the solution and we estimate that the rocket will uptick in the near future the indian market is also waking up around the need to mitigate the small uaf threats mainly and also short range air defense in view of the recent drone attacks we expect significant initial phase of counter drone solutions in this market in this year 2022 and strong growth from the region beyond that in view of the size of this market and the regulatory environment we announced a few months ago our plans to set up in indian jv with a local partner and establish local production capabilities let s summarize in our 2021 results shown rada continues to experience very strong growth also in the top line and significantly amplified on the bottom line due to our operating leverage which we are enjoying now as the discussion of our guidance in the coming budget projects indicate we expect the growth rate try to continue for the fulfillable future and finally i want to thank the all rada employees for their tremendous efforts and success in bringing these exceptional results in 2021 i d like now to hand over the discussion to avi israel our cfo avi israel chief financial officer thank you dovie hi everybody you can find our results from the press release we issued earlier today as we mentioned we are very proud of our financial performance and i will provide a short summary of the fourth quarter results in the year as a whole fourth quarter revenues were 31 8 million up 36 year over year full year 2021 revenues were 117 2 million up 54 year over year our gross margin in the quarter was 41 compared to 39 in q4 of last year for the year gross margin was 41 versus 37 in 2020 operating expenses in the quarter was 7 million compared to 6 2 million in the q4 of last year operating expenses for the year was 27 2 million compared to 22 9 million in 2020 i remind you that our current level of operating expenses for both our current and expected operations in the short and medium term so opex is expected to grow at a much slower pace than revenues operating income was 6 million in the quarter versus 2 8 million in q4 of last year for the year operating income was 20 4 million compared to 5 5 million of last year adjusted ebitda for the quarter was 8 million which is 25 of revenues up 103 versus 3 9 million over 17 of revenues in q4 of last year for 2021 adjusted ebitda was 27 3 million which was 23 of revenues up 182 compared to 9 7 million which was 15 of revenues in 2020 i would also like to summarize and point out some highlights from our balance sheet as of december 31 2021 we had 2 078 8 million in cash and absolutely zero financial debt our shareholder s equity to that 156 million financing 77 of our balance sheet and up from 72 million as of year in 2020 in summary as was mentioned and as the financial results demonstrates we continue to be very pleased with our progress that ends my summary we should now open the call for questions operator please questions answers operator thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time we will begin the question and answer session the first question is from greg konrad of jefferies please go ahead greg konrad jefferies analyst good morning good quarter i m just getting into the outlook a little bit more i mean quarter 2020 to it seems like both of as strad and point and non u s or both maybe an incremental 10 million of sales in 2022 with the non u s you know a faster growth rate can you maybe just give us an update on what you re seeing in that market around the world timing and maybe just thinking about 2022 what are the major program drivers this year dov sella chief executive officer the shorad in the us continues but the big four and probably bigger than the shorad because at least half of the program we have already delivered in 2021 but this stage of the program the bigger ones can be so conceived and abads we do have our expectations and also gbads of the marine corps all of these what we call internally the big four for us in the us with probably contribute over 60 of our revenues in 2022 and that s in the us in the other places in the world mainly the middle east india as i ve indicated these are the major geographies and the also the integration and testing efforts in europe which are starting to accumulate a bits and pieces become a some significant numbers at the end so that s the general overview of the of the shorad market greg konrad jefferies analyst and then just to follow up on the 250 million revenue target out three to four years you mean how do you think about the visibility toward that revenue number either through contact and hand or at least the programs that you re already back into universities including maybe competitive pursuits that you know aren t decided yet dov sella chief executive officer we do believe that the us market is stabilizing going off at the level of between 100 to 120 million that s the market potential basically and we see it happening we also forecast 90 million this year so that s assuming it stabilizes it over 100 million and we do believe that the rest of the world a market of shorad and point defense will climb to that level so where you live the 200 million within very few years add to that active protection which such tools will affect our top line in 2023 and onwards at the level of a few tens of millions of dollars and it will increase maybe later then you ll get the 250 within three to four years greg konrad jefferies analyst thank you and then just last one for me you provided our guidance for 22 and talked about ongoing trends of sales rising far faster than operating margins and it seems like you re ahead or you are ahead of your margin target i mean is there a way to frame kind of the opportunity in 2022 just from the ebitda margin perspective just thinking about what s implied on an operating expense growth avi israel chief financial officer i think this is our big work we have the four analysts that released their numbers for 2022 i would say that generally speaking it looks like they are pretty in line with our expectations we do not release guidance as far as ebitda s concerned but take into consideration the guidance for the revenues and assuming that we are expecting to maintain our gross profit at the level of 40 41 that s the area stabilizing our opex as i mentioned earlier and you can calculate the numbers technically but the numbers of the analysts the market consensus are pretty accurate greg konrad jefferies analyst thank you avi israel chief financial officer thank you greg operator the next question is from peter arment of baird please go ahead peter arment robert w baird and company analyst good afternoon dov and avi well just kind a certain back and can you see how average that kind of the change that in the end of this past year now 55 of the revenue in the second half of the year i guess we think about doing that we ve been having it s like the way of interactive about how should you think about kind of modeling the changes in how you re thinking about it dov sella chief executive officer well here the condition of the us budget and the cr affects our first half so we do expect that we will have a growth and maybe even quarterly and toward the end of the year which will not be we don t believe they are but you know actually that was our situation for the last few years and so maybe it s going to be similar and i think that the start will be kind of similar to the end of last year over the last two quarters but it will accelerate from there peter arment robert w baird and company analyst i think that s helpful and then it will talk a lot about your ability to stay positive like enjoyed you maybe it was just easier how you think about that dov sella chief executive officer you know even before covid we realized very early on that this is a new market if we don t produce the stock we are going to not to capitalize on the potential and actually it became our one of our competitive advantages and when covid appealed we kind of were immune then we decided to even a further enhance our inventories to over a year of supply potentially based on our production plants and again it is based on our pipeline and not on the backlog because if you understand a lot of it is the book and ship and that s where we are today it s not a tough environmental thing you see allocations all over you see prices that are changing we were immune until now and i do hope that what we did there will keep us as such a longer and long 2022 in some cases we we have to pay more and we have to reflect it to our customers but it s really in it s not overwhelming it s very in the long number peter arment robert w baird and company analyst it wasn t mean and maybe i think last time you disclosed the backlog is around 30 million are loose and plans out in 2023 major milestones we should be watching for as we speak about 42 in terms of adding that backbone dov sella chief executive officer you know we were literally probably every quarter we announced the new business that we received along the quarter and we tried to defeat it there was went which market segment and so yeah i mean they followed the backlog accumulation or the new business accumulation around aps and you will have the picture we could with the aps as opposed to the urgency of the shorad and point defense market in this business by nature is there is a long term issue and you can plan ahead here we are we are establishing backlog so every order that we receive is not there for immediate deliveries it s a split over two or three years something like that so i think if you follow our annual business announcements you would have a very good picture and we can always see can elaborate more on that whenever needed peter arment robert w baird and company analyst appreciate it congrats and well thanks dov sella chief executive officer thank you peter operator the next question is from brian kinstlinger of alliance global partners please go ahead brian kinstlinger alliance global partners analyst hi guys thanks for taking my questions you laid out the potential for short and long term even aps to some degree of course there s a finite market so as you think about m a and you thinking about complementary products to radars that can expand your market opportunity maybe talk about your m a priorities please and how advanced or any discussions you re having right now dov sella chief executive officer well we are examining several opportunities as they come already but we are certainly juggling formerly kind of formally within our company we forward look the categories are in general terms and it is a bit too early to disclose the details the categories are our technology geography a complementary a product that makes sense to us we don t want to lose our profile of a growing company technology growth company we don t want to inflate our top line just to for the sake of having bigger numbers so we are carefully examining the footprint in our strategic markets like we did in the us we planned to do in india and maybe also in europe we ll see and maybe not directly but also in the middle east we are continuously examining the technology market of radars around us and what s happening and we don t have to invent the wheel every time and maybe we can enjoy the fruits of other and join forces and these are the roughly categories the general categories that we are in these days and weeks we are translating into action plan brian kinstlinger alliance global partners analyst great and then my second question is clearly your inventory increased significantly from the end of september you talk about what this inventory level covers is it all of 2022 is it a little bit more or it s a little bit less based on your ginormous speculations thanks so much dov sella chief executive officer well our strategic decision was to have at least one full year of semi conductors based on our estimations and we continue to maintain that brian kinstlinger alliance global partners analyst great thank you dov sella chief executive officer thank you brian avi israel chief financial officer thank you brian operator the next question is from austin moeller of canaccord please go ahead austin moeller canaccord genuity analyst good morning dovie and avi dov sella chief executive officer good morning austin austin moeller canaccord genuity analyst my first question here based on the 30 million that you forecast for active protection systems in 2023 are you confident that when biden s fiscal year 23 budget comes out probably in april that will be a funding account to upgrade the bradley s of the arms dov sella chief executive officer no we are not confident we don t have a certainties unfortunately because it you know it depends on successful testing but we we are we are optimistic that once the testing is soon enough will prove successful the budgets will come austin moeller canaccord genuity analyst ok that s helpful my second question is the army expected to decide on purchasing additional shorad vehicles based on the testing that s currently going on beyond the existing 144 the first four battalions that you re already under contract for sometime this year dov sella chief executive officer the initial shorad plan of the army talked about 10 to 12 maybe 10 but then they the talks included maybe to 12 battalions altogether that s the force structure that is probably needed by the army however it s not going to be purely kinetic like what was done until now and they re directly the action will kick in their option directed energy will be completed in 2023 based on what we know again to be put on strike yes and there is an initial effort done by the rocket capabilities the branch of the army that put a few lasers on full strykers as prototype but it s going to be completed we believe that our sense of onboard sensors will stay intact that s our plan but then we are working with the potential vendors of the lasers we are working directly with the army at all to ensure that we stay there and it will be completed as i said in 2023 and maybe some more battalions kinetic battalions in the configuration that we have now will be also added austin moeller canaccord genuity analyst ok great thank you that s very helpful dov sella sure operator the next question is from nahum mushin please go ahead unknown speaker how are you doing mr sella i have a question you talked about in the past

in january we wrote about the purdue pharma mega bankruptcy a united states district court in new york vacated purdue pharma s confirmed chapter 11 plan holding it was improper for the plan to contain non consensual releases of direct claims held by third parties against non debtors the district court specifically disapproved of the releases provided to members of the sackler family who had not filed for personal bankruptcy protection you can read the full article here less than a month later a united states district court in virginia has issued a similar ruling the district court s blunt ruling held that in the fourth circuit which includes north carolina federal courts third party releases are disfavored because they can lead to abuse and should be granted cautiously and infrequently the decision came in the mahwah bergen retail group bankruptcy mahwah and several affiliates owned and operated over 2 800 retail clothing stores under the brand names ann taylor loft and lane bryant the debtors had around 1 6 billion in secured debt and 800 million in unsecured debt in chapter 11 they liquidated the business for more than 650 million then proposed a plan to pay some secured creditors and to set aside 7 25 million for pro rata payments to unsecured creditors the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan over the objections of the united states trustee the securities and exchange commission and the plaintiffs in a securities fraud case before bankruptcy a group of plaintiffs had filed a securities fraud case against the debtors their ceo and cfo and others the lawsuit alleged the defendants engaged in a deceptive false and misleading scheme to artificially inflate the price of their common stock the plaintiffs were seeking class action status when the bankruptcy stayed the case the plan contained convoluted and broad releases basically if you had any claim against any person or entity associated with the debtors you released everything if you failed to object or opt out timely in rejecting the plan the district court said that the releases closed the courthouse doors to potential plaintiffs while protecting corporate insiders the court interpreted the releases to bar the claims of hundreds of thousands of potential plaintiffs not involved in the bankruptcy shielding an incalculable number of individuals associated with the debtors for an unspecified time period stretching back forever the releases effectively killed the securities fraud lawsuit the district court acknowledged there is no absolute ban on third party releases in the fourth circuit a bankruptcy court can approve non consensual non debtor releases after it considers these factors is there an identity of interest between the debtor and the third party has the non debtor contributed substantial assets to the reorganization is the release essential to reorganization have the impacted classes overwhelmingly voted to accept the plan does the plan provide a mechanism to pay the classes affected by the release does the plan provide an opportunity for claimants who choose not to settle to recover in full but the bar is nearly insurmountable and all factors must be supported by specific detailed and exacting factual findings a key takeaway is that parties whose claims will be wiped out must receive proper notice and due process the opportunity to negotiate and some value for their release the district court found the notice process wanting the debtors sent notices and opt out forms to 300 000 potential class members and published notices in two national newspapers less than half of 1 opted out the debtors had no records of who actually received the forms the debtors argued that since parties could opt out of the proposed plan if they didn t there was implied consent to the plan the district court rejected that argument there must be actual consent not implied consent the back to back decisions in purdue pharma and mahwah highlight the contentious issues with non consensual third party releases in bankruptcy these rulings are not the final word and we will continue to monitor them on appeal

measures certain non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures are utilized by the company as measures of financial performance non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that these non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the company s business and facilitate meaningful comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods and future periods non ifrs measures presented in this earnings release include certain figures from our statement of

company s core operating results a limitation of utilizing these figures that exclude significant items is that the ifrs accounting effects of these items do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of the company s business accordingly these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing the company s financial results therefore management believes that the company s ifrs measures of financial performance and the respective non ifrs measures should be considered together non ifrs measures adjusted figures figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results financial statement items that exclude significant items are non ifrs measures to calculate

allotments and there is a shortage of available workers all of which explains why inflation has taken hold in this environment we see growth through acquisition as the most plausible outcome the other outcome will be higher pricing feeding the inflation spiral the worker shortage higher wages along with some serious productivity losses associated with new health and safety protocols supply chain bottlenecks all contribute to a period of rising costs we must adapt to these changing market conditions as we start the new year covid 19 continues to dominate the headlines and impact business

are based on our current same store population amounts may differ from those previously reported same store markets typically rental rates soften in the fourth quarter due to lower demand than in the peak months of the second and third quarters in 2021 that trend did not materialize demand remained strong throughout the fourth quarter resulting in pricing remaining stable through the end of the year as of december 31st effective asking rates were up 23 from the fourth quarter of 2020 as a result signed rates continued to be strong with new lease rates up 13 5 and renewals up 11 0 from the prior leases consistent with our expectations average daily occupancy trended upwards from 96 5 in the third quarter to 98 1 in the fourth quarter with january average daily occupancy reaching a record high of 98 4 rent collection update we measure residential rent collection as the dollar value of payments received as a percentage of all residential amounts owed in the fourth quarter we recognized 99 1 of all residential revenue owed during the quarter treating the balance of 0 9 as bad debt 3 0 of our residents have extended delinquencies much of which we expect to collect either from the residents based on their high credit scores or from rent relief programs established by the state of california 97 0 of our residents pay rent timely with bad debt under 30 basis points of revenue a level still somewhat elevated from our historical experience as of december 31 2021 our proportionate share of gross residential accounts receivable was 11 1 million after consideration of tenant security deposits and reserves for uncollectible amounts our net exposure is 0 9 million an amount expected to be collected during the first quarter of 2022 of the 11 1 million of uncollected accounts receivable 78 relates to california residents during the quarter we received 3 7 million from california s rent relief program we await the state s response to an additional 2 2 million of rent relief requests made we are working with residents to file an additional 3 9 million of claims we remain cautiously optimistic that this program will allow us to recover rents uncollected in 2020 or 2021 we expect bad debt expense to decline with the end of emergency ordinances that suspend contractual remedies for non payment of rent portfolio management and quality our portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across primarily a and b price points averaging b b in quality and is also diversified across several of the largest markets in the united states during 2021 we exited the chicago and new york markets and subsequent to year end reduced our exposure to california we added to our portfolio in florida through a 223 million acquisition and improved the quality of our washington d c portfolio through acquiring four properties whose noi growth we expect will exceed market noi growth by more than 10 during each of the next two years our 2021 portfolio management activities increased our average rents by approximately 150 per home and reduced the portfolio s average age by one year our current portfolio is of a higher quality is expected to require lower recurring capital replacement spending and has a greater allocation to states with greater economic growth and a more reliable rule of law transactions acquisitions as previously announced during the fourth quarter we acquired for 510 million a portfolio of four properties located in the washington d c area with 1 383 apartment homes 84 000 square feet of office and commercial space and two vacant land parcels suitable for development of 498 additional apartment homes valued at approximately 20 million we expect a 4 3 noi yield in 2022 this yield is anticipated to approach 6 by 2024 approximately 130 basis points greater than the properties sold to fund the acquisition adding 0 04 to ffo per share this spread is expected to increase over time as the long term irr is expected to be 9 0 a 40 increase over the long term irr of holding the properties sold dispositions during the fourth quarter we sold 15 apartment communities located in new york city and washington d c with 1 337 apartment homes for gross proceeds of 472 million net sales proceeds from these transactions were 432 million as previously announced during the quarter we formed a joint venture with an affiliate of blackstone by selling for 408 million an 80 interest in three multi family properties with 1 748 units located in virginia air is the general partner with 20 ownership and earns various fees for providing property management and corporate services after year end we sold an additional seven apartment communities located in san diego los angeles and the bay area for gross proceeds of 507 million we are under contract to sell an additional 267 million of properties located in chicago new york city and california in aggregate the 1 7 billion of property sales priced at an implied noi cap rate of 4 3 and a free cash flow cap rate of 4 0 an approximate 15 premium to their estimated 2020 fair market value pre covid balance sheet we seek to increase financial returns by using leverage with appropriate caution we limit risk through our balance sheet structure employing low leverage and primarily long dated debt we maintain financial flexibility through ample unused and available credit holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt maintaining an investment grade rating and using partners capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces

perpetual in nature however for illustrative purposes we have computed the weighted average maturity of our preferred op units assuming a 10 year maturity and preferred stock assuming it is called at the expiration of the no call period we have notes receivable from aimco with an aggregate principal amount of 534 million the notes will mature on january 31 2024 and are secured by a pool of properties owned by aimco we consider the notes a reduction of leverage as we expect proceeds to be used to repay loan amounts currently outstanding leverage reduction complete we target net leverage to adjusted ebitdare at 5 5x with a range between 5 0x and 6 0x pro forma for january sales activity net leverage to adjusted ebitdare is 5 8x pro forma for additional first quarter sales activity net leverage to adjusted ebitdare is further reduced by 0 5x of a turn to 5 3x liquidity we use our revolving credit facility for working capital and other short term purposes and to secure letters of credit at december 31 2021 our share of cash and restricted cash was 81 million and we had the capacity to borrow up to 285 million under our revolving credit facility bringing total liquidity to 366 million we manage our financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating and holding communities that are unencumbered by property debt air has been rated bbb by standard poor s as of december 31 2021 and excluding properties sold and expected to sell during the first quarter we held unencumbered communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately 8 4 billion triple the amount from december 31 2020 we anticipate seeking an investment grade credit rating from moody s in assigning ratings moody s places significant emphasis on the amount of non recourse property debt as percentage of the undepreciated book value of a company s assets pro forma for anticipated first quarter property sales we anticipate that our share of property debt will approximate moody s

even if you aren t paying attention to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you might have noticed that their value plummeted last week with the total value of the market tumbling from a high of us3 4 trillion last year to about us1 5 2 trillion in a matter of days bitcoin the most famous and largest cryptocurrency saw its value go from us69 000 95 786 to a low of about us33 000 45 811 this means if you invested in bitcoin or any cryptocurrency recently chances are you just took what experts call a bath but this isn t unusual cryptocurrencies are volatile and always have been in just the last 12 months there have been two massive slumps in the value of bitcoin this is one reason crypto enthusiasts are always telling each other to hodl hold on for dear life these dips aren t unexpected and the value usually claws back to new heights eventually with this latest volatility however some are questioning the fundamentals of crypto especially the claim that it s a good safe harbour hedge investment like gold safe harbours are supposed to be resistant to inflation and market volatility though goldbugs love gold because its value holds steady even when other markets are doing flips the same can t be said for bitcoin and the other 17 000 or so cryptocurrencies on the market where does crypto s value come from cryptocurrency is difficult to understand because it s essentially just computer code every cryptocurrency is built on what s known as a blockchain a truly nifty piece of code that tracks transactions in an incredibly secure public way this makes tampering with the transaction record almost impossible but also offers anonymity and privacy the main reason cryptocurrency has any value is because people say it does and the people saying it does are mostly the folks who have large crypto positions so they re not exactly objective bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world but it s still very difficult to buy anything using it and its volatility makes it really difficult to use as a currency the fee structures around crypto transactions are also incredibly volatile and difficult to predict which makes every move you make in the crypto world an exciting and often expensive adventure and then there s the climate impact bitcoin is designed to be limited in supply new bitcoins are mined by solving complex equations all this required was a home computer when the cryptocurrency launched in 2008 and new coins were mined pretty quickly but as more coins are minted it gets harder to mine new ones so hard in fact that bitcoin now uses up more electricity than some small countries and its power demands are only going to get worse this is not only a terrible way to produce anything the costs in terms of finances and climate impact are becoming increasingly concerning undermining faith in cryptocurrencies going forward no wonder el salvador the only country using bitcoin as legal tender contemplated building a mining operation on top of a volcano and finally many countries are poised to rain on crypto s parade russia s central bank is probably going to ban crypto china already has and in the u s the federal reserve seems ready to wade in with its own cryptocurrency but experts are divided on whether this would bolster the market or kill it entirely crypto s association with criminality both in terms of the rising scams luring naive investors to their doom and its popularity with criminal gangs who like the anonymity almost assures that at some point governments are going to start creating and enforcing a lot of regulations around them which doesn t bode well for their future growth should you invest in crypto crypto seems more and more like a massive bubble that s going to burst eventually so the fundamental advice around whether or not to invest in crypto is to regard it as a form of gambling even more so than the stock market with stocks you re always taking a chance but at least there is real definable information you can use to make decisions yes you might get the price of concentrated orange juice futures wrong and see your investments melt away but at least your guess was educated with crypto there s simply no way to predict anything there s zero data bitcoin might soar to us100 000 138 820 tomorrow or drop to us10 000 13 882 no one knows and worse there s no way to know that means you shouldn t invest any money into crypto you can t afford to lose consider the story of mark cuban billionaire and co star of shark tank he s a guy who regularly tells people what they should be doing to be successful in business and finance but he lost us200 000 277 640 trying his hand at a form of crypto investing called yield farming where you buy crypto tokens and lend them back to the platform to earn interest as he told the new york times i should have done more homework on it bottom line the crypto bubble may not burst today or tomorrow but it s too volatile to risk with your rent money

measures certain non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures are utilized by the company as measures of financial performance non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies management believes that these non ifrs measures non ifrs ratios and supplementary financial measures allow for a better evaluation of the operating performance of the company s business and facilitate meaningful comparison of results in the current period to those in prior periods and future periods non ifrs measures presented in this earnings release include certain figures from our statement of operations that are adjusted to exclude significant items although figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results a limitation of utilizing these figures that exclude significant items is that the ifrs accounting effects of these items do in fact reflect the underlying financial results of the company s business accordingly these effects should not be ignored in evaluating and analyzing the company s financial results therefore management believes that the company s ifrs measures of financial performance and the respective non ifrs measures should be considered together non ifrs measures adjusted figures figures that exclude significant items provide useful information by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core operating results financial statement items that exclude significant items are non ifrs measures to calculate these non ifrs financial statement items we exclude certain items from our financial results prepared in accordance with ifrs the items which have been excluded are referred to herein as significant items the following is a description of the composition of the non ifrs measures used in this earnings release note that some significant items excluded may not be applicable to the calculation of the non ifrs measure for each comparative period i revenue excluding significant items which is composed of revenue per ifrs less any applicable fair value adjustments on certain illiquid or restricted marketable securities as recorded for ifrs reporting purposes but which are excluded for management reporting purposes and are not used by management to assess operating performance ii expenses excluding significant items which is composed of expenses per ifrs less any applicable amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination acquisition related expense items which includes costs recognized in relation to both prospective and completed acquisitions certain incentive based costs related to the acquisitions and growth initiatives in cgwm uk costs associated with the redemption of convertible debentures costs associated with the reorganization of cgwm uk and fair value adjustments to the derivative liability component of non controlling interests in cgwm uk iii net income before taxes excluding significant items which is composed of revenue excluding significant items less expenses excluding significant items iv income taxes adjusted which is composed of income taxes per ifrs adjusted to reflect the associated tax effect of the excluded significant items v net income excluding significant items which is composed of net income

equity component of non controlling interests in cgwm uk and vii net income attributable to common shareholders excluding significant items which is composed of net income excluding significant items less non controlling interests adjusted and preferred share dividends paid on the series a and series c preferred shares a reconciliation of non ifrs measures that exclude significant items to the applicable ifrs measures from the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 can be found above in the table entitled summary of results for q3 fiscal 2022 and selected financial information excluding significant items non ifrs ratios non ifrs ratios are calculated using the non ifrs measures defined above for the periods presented herein we have used the following non ifrs ratios i total expenses excluding significant items as a percentage of revenue which is calculated by dividing expenses excluding significant items by revenue excluding significant items ii earnings per common share excluding significant items which is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders excluding significant items by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic and iii diluted earnings per common share excluding significant items which is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common shareholders excluding significant items by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted iv pre tax profit margin which is calculated by dividing net income before taxes excluding significant items by revenue excluding significant items supplementary financial measures client assets are supplementary financial measures that do not have any definitions prescribed under ifrs but do not meet the definition of a non ifrs measure or non ifrs ratio client assets which include both assets under management aum and assets under administration aua is a measure that is common to the

resulting in increased backlog of 39 7m compared to 37 3m at the end of 2020 the committed credit facility with our existing financial institution was extended to july 2026 with improved financial terms received 3 1m in canada emergency wage subsidy cews and 0 2m from the aviation manufacturing jobs protection program amjp which we used to help maintain our workforce in the face of revenue reductions due to covid 19 paycheck protection program loans of 3 0m were forgiven by the small business administration an agency of the us department of treasury which had been classified as debt at the end of 2020 controlled costs through reduced headcount of approximately 14 through the pandemic primarily through attrition and incurring less overtime awarded a contract valued at 3 7m from the united states defense logistics agency dla to provide electronic assemblies to retrofit airborne radar systems on us armed forces aircraft the work will be performed at the ftg facilities in chatsworth ca for ftg in 2021 overall sales decreased by 23 1m or 23 from 102 4m in 2020 to 79 4m in 2021 the covid 19 pandemic continued to negatively impact demand in the commercial aerospace market this was compounded by reduced shipments of simulator products which were down 9 6m in 2021 compared to 2020 and a negative currency impact of 4 0m in our fourth quarter sales were down 6 4m or 23 9 which is due to lower shipments of simulator products the circuits segment sales in 2021 were down 13 4m or 20 4 in 2021 versus 2020 all sites were lower in sales except the joint venture in china the largest decline was seen in the circuits toronto plant which is more heavily exposed to the commercial aerospace market in the fourth quarter sales in the circuits segment were 14 3m vs 14 1m in q4 2020 an increase of 1 7 the increase in underlying activity was tempered by negative movements in foreign exchange rates of approximately 6 cents or 5 for the aerospace segment sales in 2021 were down 9 6m or 26 3 compared to last year which is inclusive of reduced simulator product revenue of 9 6m all sites were lower in sales in the year in q4 2020 aerospace segment sales were down 6 6m or 52 which is also due to lower levels of simulator related shipments in q4 2021 gross margin in 2021 was 17 1m or 21 6 as compared to 26 4m or 25 8 in 2020 loss of operating leverage on lower sales and the negative fx impact reduced both the gross margin rate and absolute dollars ftg continued to qualify for wage subsidy programs offered by the canadian government through october and us government amjp program in q4 the total wage subsidy levels included in cost of sales amounted to 2 9m in 2021 as compared to 2 8m in 2020 gross margin in q4 2021 was 4 2m or 20 9 of sales as compared to 7 1m or 26 4 in q4 2020 with the decrease due to both lower sales volume and unfavorable fx wage subsidies in q4 2021 were 0 3m or 1 7 in gross margin points as compared to 1 3m or 4 8 in gross margin points in q4 2020 earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda for ftg in 2021 was 9 6m or 12 1 of sales compared to 13 4m or 13 1 of sales in 2020 lower levels of sales were partially offset by the 3 0m gain on forgiveness of the ppp loans and the 3 1m in wage subsidies in canada the following table reconciles net earnings to ebitda 2 for the year ended november 30 2021 fiscal 2021

diluted share compared to a net profit of 1 3m or 0 06 per diluted share in 2020 revenues were reduced due to the decline in the commercial aerospace market as a result of the covid 19 pandemic which reduced margins and profitability this impact was partially offset by the forgiveness of the ppp loans and the wage subsidies in canada in the fourth quarter the net loss was 0 1m compared to a net profit of 1 3m in q4 2020 the circuits segment net earnings before corporate taxes and interest and other costs was 4 9m in 2021 compared to 6 9m in 2020 the lower sales was the most significant impact on the segment profitability which was partially offset by 2 3m of ppp loan forgiveness and the wage subsidies in canada the aerospace net earnings before corporate taxes and interest and other costs in the full year was 0 8m in 2021 versus 1 5m in 2020 lower sales in 2021 were partially offset by 0 7m of ppp loan forgiveness and the wage subsidies in canada and the 1 1m asset impairment charge taken in this segment in 2020 as at november 30 2021 the corporation s net working capital was 39 7m compared to 39 4m at year end in 2020 the increase is due to a higher net cash position

updated february 9 2022 at 3 26 pm et top congressional democrats are signaling congress could vote soon on legislation to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks the move comes amid pressure from rank and file members from both parties arguing that voters overwhelmingly back the idea house speaker nancy pelosi d calif doesn t personally trade individual stocks her husband does she said in december she didn t think a ban was necessary but has reversed course as members in her caucus have pushed the issue it is a confidence issue and if that s what members want to do then that s what we will do pelosi said at her weekly press conference on wednesday she added house committees were working on a proposal and a bill could move pretty soon senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y also signaled his support for a ban i believe this is an important issue that congress should address and it s something that has clearly raised interest from both sides of the aisle over the last few weeks schumer said wednesday two house members from different parties push bill texas republican chip roy and virginia democrat abigail spanberger were elected in the same class in 2018 they didn t campaign on the same issues but they learned they shared the same alma mater and favorite basketball team the same birthday and over a beer learned there are some problems they could try to solve together the two introduced legislation in june 2020 to ban members of congress from trading individual stocks they decided to work on the issue after talking about news stories about several members of congress who were under investigation for stock transactions they made following briefings in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic before the impact on the u s economy was clear during an interview with both lawmakers roy bristled a bit at the narrative they re political polar opposites i mean we disagree on a lot but we agree on a lot too there s a number of things that we re trying to come together and sort of sit over beer literally and solve some problems ting shen for npr ting shen for npr rep roy and rep spanberger chat while walking though the longworth house office building on capitol hill there s a 10 year old law already on the books called the stock act that requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades within 45 days but spanberger says that approach doesn t work it s not just enough to know what members are buying or selling it s that they shouldn t be buying or selling she said the campaign legal center recently told npr that in the last year roughly 50 members of congress failed to disclose or filed late reports on their stock transactions roy said lawmakers have an inherent conflict of interest because they attend briefings and sit on committees that impact corporate bottom lines if you are buying calls on google how can american people have confidence that you re going to make a truly objective policy decision on the size and scope of google with respect to antitrust questions for example roy asked ting shen for npr ting shen for npr roy says lawmakers just have an inherent conflict of interest because they attend briefings and sit on committees that impact corporate bottom lines the texas republican points to his own experience he had an investment in a pipeline that ran through his district but he opposed something they were doing and was part of discussions to address it he thought maybe he should sell his shares but immediately realized any transaction would raise questions but then i called ethics and i said wait a second i m beating them up now publicly so if i unload it now it looks like i m kind of gaming it while i m trying to beat him up so i ended up kind of sitting on it which i think was actually to my financial detriment but that s neither here nor there to this point my point is we shouldn t be in that box both spanberger and roy note their bill wouldn t prevent lawmakers from investing none of this would stop you from being able to engage in free enterprise in the free market being able to continue to to hold your investments all we re saying is put it in a blind trust or be in broadly traded index funds roy said spanberger added that change should be part of the process of entering federal public service saying that we want to affirmatively ensure that the american people can have trust in us in the decisions we re making and therefore we cannot own individual stocks or we have to put it in a blind trust that to me is a choice you make when you choose to run for this office ting shen for npr ting shen for npr spanberger says the change should just be part of the process of entering federal public service focus on how ban impacts families spanberger and roy s proposal the trust in congress act would bar both lawmakers and their immediate family members from picking individual stocks it eludes me as a possibility that someone would say to the american people oh no no no no my spouse makes all his own decisions just because i m in covid briefings ignore the fact that when a pandemic started he s buying stocks and insert pharmaceutical company name right people are gonna say you re insulting my intelligence right it s bad if you do it it s bad if they do it spanberger told npr roy said if members have concerns they are open to tweaks to the legislation we can solve this problem this isn t curing cancer right i mean we can just sit down figure out a solution that we think works and then you can always amend it later and both bemoan the fact that in the current political environment there is a tendency to avoid signing onto bills without 100 agreement on every detail different proposals being debated in house and senate in the senate there are efforts to find consensus within the democratic caucus as well as with gop senators who have proposed bills according to multiple sources familiar with the talks one proposal introduced years ago by oregon sen jeff merkley d ore would ban lawmakers and senior staff from buying and selling individual stocks he s been discussing proposals with sen mitt romney r utah and informal talks have picked up in recent weeks sen jon ossoff d ga and sen mark kelly d ariz have introduced the senate companion bill to roy and spanberger s house bill sen elizabeth warren d mass and sen steve daines r mont are working on a proposal while sen ben sasse r neb has introduced a broader ethics reform bill and sen josh hawley r mo is pushing a bill with a ban on trading pelosi declined to get into the details on which proposal would make it to the house floor but said she wants to extend any reforms to the federal judiciary roy and spanberger s bill has about 45 co sponsors another bipartisan bill being pushed by rep raja krishnamoorthi d ill rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y rep matt gaetz r fla and others in the house has a similar level of support their proposal does not cover spouses and dependent children but does include a ban for senior staffers grassroots calls for change both spanberger and roy said this is one issue that voters from both parties agree on roy recalled how this topic resonates with different constituencies back home of all the issues that i talk about this one gets one of the most positive reactions across the ideological spectrum whether i m in downtown austin or in fire breathing hill country really why hasn t that already been done so does spanberger this is the one piece of legislation that people are coming up to me and saying oh my gosh i was reading about that bill that to me is really notable they say making this reform is an easy way to make absolutely clear that lawmakers make decisions without any ulterior financial motive ting shen for npr ting shen for npr spanberger shows roy a framed picture in her office both lawmakers bemoan that in the current political environment there is a tendency to avoid signing onto bills without 100 agreement on every detail it s a chance for us to say when i m working on legislation when i m taking a vote when i m in a briefing i m not thinking oh let me wonder how this could benefit me financially i m thinking about how do i serve my constituents spanberger explained people deserve to know that we are working for them first and foremost and not our own financial stock portfolios roy agreed i think this would be a very you know simple statement that you shouldn t be able to get wealthy on the back of the job you are carrying out on behalf of the people you represent one point roy and spanberger make is the process they used to develop the bill talking across the aisle and being open to changes is the same one they think needs to happen more often in washington merkley who pressed for a ban on trading when congress was debating the stock act a decade ago said in a written statement that an update to ethics laws is overdue we re seeing growing interest on both sides of

democratic leaders in congress on wednesday indicated they ll support stronger restrictions on stock trading for members of congress including banning the practice entirely there s already a groundswell of support from democrats and republicans on both sides of the capitol for stronger restrictions on their financial portfolios it s a rare point of bipartisan agreement for two parties finding less common ground with each passing day senate majority leader chuck schumer referred to stock trading as an important issue that congress should address and has asked democratic senators to come up with a bill to consider and he is encouraging them to work with republican counterparts in the house speaker nancy pelosi has charged the house administration committee with writing new rules but she also has some changes she wants to see made we have to tighten the fines on those who violate the stock act she said referring to 2012 bill that banned members from trading in the financial markets based on nonpublic information they were able to access because of their elected office it s obviously not sufficient to deter behavior pelosi also reiterated wednesday that she wants to see financial disclosure requirements extend to the judicial branch including the supreme court which is not subject to the same financial disclosures required of members of the legislative and executive branches of government the supreme court has no disclosure it has no reporting of stock transactions and it makes important decisions every day she said pelosi has grown more receptive to congressional action on stock trading as more lawmakers have expressed support for stricter rules a few weeks ago she was skeptical to give a blanket attitude of we can t do this and we can t do that because we can t be trusted i just don t buy into that she said however she added but if members want to do that i m okay with it proposals to limit or ban stock trading have garnered the support of members across the ideological spectrum from progressive michigan democrat rashida tlaib to conservative florida republican matt gaetz both signed a letter to house leadership last month urging them to consider legislation that would bar members from owning or trading individual stocks there is no reason that members of congress need to be allowed to trade stocks when we should be focused on doing our jobs and serving our constituents the letter read perhaps this means some of our colleagues will miss out on lucrative investment opportunities we don t care we came to congress to serve our country not turn a quick buck there are already multiple legislative proposals in both chambers for leadership to consider the ban conflicted trading act would prohibit lawmakers and senior staff from owning or trading individual stocks as well as serving on corporate boards that proposal comes from a bipartisan group in the house representatives raja krishnamoorthi alexandria ocasio cortez joe neguse matt gaetz and michael cloud as well as democratic senators jeff merkley rafael warnock and sherrod brown another unlikely bipartisan pair in the house virginia democrat abigail spanberger and texas republican chip roy have introduced the trust in congress act that would require members of congress as well as their spouses and children to put certain investment assets into a blind trust while they re legislating in washington democratic senators jon ossoff and mark kelly introduced a companion bill the ban congressional stock trading act in the senate congress formally banned trading stock based on nonpublic information with the 2012 stock act the bill came on the heels of a 60 minutes report which illustrated how members who were considered exempt from insider trading laws had grown richer while in office through means that while legal seemed at odds with their power as lawmakers but an investigation by insider last year found more than 200 examples of lawmakers and senior capitol hill staff failing to report their stock trades under the timeframe required by the law and no public records of whether they ever paid the penalties required for tardy filing late filings draw a fine of 200 for the first offense with higher fines for repeat offenses at least one new proposal would raise these fines senators elizabeth warren and steve daines struck an agreement on a bill to ban stock ownership and trading among members of congress with a 50 000 fine for each violation no one in this country should ever have to wonder what motivates a lawmaker is that what that lawmaker believes is in the best interest of the american people or in the best interest of the lawmaker himself or herself that shouldn t be an issue warren said multiple senators came under investigation by the justice department when they or their spouses bought and sold stocks at the start of the covid 19 pandemic as lawmakers were beginning to receive briefings about the new virus all were ultimately cleared including north carolina senator richard burr who stepped down from his position as the top republican on the senate intelligence committee following an fbi investigation into trades he and his wife made ranging from 600 000 to 1 7 million but while momentum is growing for a change in the rules there are still some lawmakers who question whether new regulations are really necessary there s already plenty of laws in place for insider trading and it s a felony for goodness sakes said representative ed perlmutter a democrat who said he owns stocks he inherited from his father when he died three years ago to do a kind of across the board ban on stock trading seems a little bit over the top to me but he said he s willing to listen to the arguments from his colleagues for their new laws congressman glenn grothman a republican said members should buy mutual funds or index funds so they can t be accused of trading in a particular stock that s what i do just put your money in the standard and poor s 500 index fund or the american funds growth fund and that way there are no problems he said nikole killion ellis kim and alan he contributed to this report

three revolutionary cycles our beat here at the daily reckoning is money but a lot of what we write about isn t directly related to money it s really about people in our business we try to think of the relationship we create with you the actual person who opened this email mostly because we re looking for solutions to complex questions just like you are you can t write about economics every day or you ll go crazy explained our friend and mentor bill bonner one time you can t write about investing every day or your readers will go crazy you have to write about something that is richer fuller and actually more important what s richer fuller and actually more important is the totality of the human drama good and bad human relationships and passion those are the subjects that propel us forward all great drama is derived from the passions of men and women and how they interact with one another fear greed mob mentality and insanity are just a few of the very interesting human emotions the study of economics is essentially an exploration of human passion writ large across history it s inexact it s frustrating but it s endlessly fascinating and i love to explore it with the brightest minds i know of much more than markets alone the wiggin sessions is an interview series i ve been conducting for about two years now i ve spoken with over 70 of the financial world s sharpest most independent financial thinkers people like bill bonner jim rickards and george gilder to name some let s just say you re not going to find jim cramer on the wiggin sessions but it s more than just markets and economics we explore history philosophy science politics ugh pop culture and how they all interrelate but it all ultimately comes down to you and your money how to protect it and how to grow it i m proud to say the wiggin sessions have provided viewers with deep insights and in depth strategies that take them beyond the conventional financial wisdom that just doesn t work it can be a lonely business our quest to find you the most powerful insights often takes us out to the far end of the bell curve the land of fat tails and black swans scientists who ve studied probabilities and plotted them on a chart typically find a bell curve distribution in which the most likely events bunch up in the middle of the curve but a funny thing happens out at the ends of the curve where the rare events are registered scientists have found small bumps and bulges explains the aforementioned bill bonner things that were not expected to happen very often actually happened more than they thought hundred year floods for example happened every 88 years one in a million shots hit their mark every 700 000 or so statisticians refer to these odd bulges on the extremities of bell shaped curves as fat tails instead of tailing off as they are supposed to the rare events seem to swell up where you don t expect them our mission is to anticipate these fat tail events or what many call black swan events while the mainstream media sit in the middle of the bell curve where it s nice and safe we could do that too we d probably take a lot less grief if we did but why would you bother with us if we just played it safe like the mainstream more predictable than you think how many mainstream sources anticipated the great financial crisis of 2008 hint not many but bill bonner and jim rickards did how many in the mainstream predicted the 2016 election of donald trump or brexit same answer but jim rickards predicted them both the thing is fat tail events may be more predictable than you think not perfectly that s not possible even with perfect information but to a reasonable very helpful degree but you need to know how to go about it as the highly successful investor and entrepreneur mark moss told me in the wiggin sessions about our current situation it s definitely not the world that we ve left behind and while all of this seems very random like this is a black swan event it s not this is actually very predictable we could tell from history that we knew we would end up here and when you understand that it makes it clear where we re going and when you understand those things then you understand how to navigate that with your money you ll understand the areas you ll want to be invested in and not be invested in will you survive the great reset mark has fixed flipped and developed over 25 million in real estate invested in private business gold mines oil fields and new technologies and he s accomplished all this through three different bear market cycles so he knows what he s doing now mark s passion is helping others prepare for the great reset so they can thrive when most can only hope to survive maybe you ve heard of the great reset it s basically build back better on a global scale elites would be in charge transforming society in their technocratic vision you d be just a cog in a vast globalist machine if i told you what their plans are for this mark says you would think i m crazy and you d want to lock me up sounds scary change is happening fast more than most people realize and according to mark it s not just about the pandemic obviously anybody that s halfway paying attention understands that tensions are high across the world there s talk in the united states about another civil war or a national divorce we have protests happening in every country of the world and it s not because of the pandemic this is a key piece most people think around the world they re pushing back on mandates and lockdowns they are but before the pandemic there were 10 countries with over 1 million people each in the streets protesting so it was already happening they re still in the streets protesting just on a different subject but the key piece is that the entire world is pushing back again it s not just a black swan event the three revolutionary cycles converging at once what s going on mark says there are three revolutionary cycles that are converging right now unfortunately he believes they ll slaughter the underprepared when they collide what are these converging cycles three different cycles are all converging right now one is what i call psc which is political social and cultural this is a political cycle which is part of human nature then we have technological cycles and revolutions finally we have financial cycles and revolutions mark s main thesis is that you can t just consider these cycles in isolation most people make that mistake or just don t have the vision to see the bigger picture but you need to in order to understand where we re going the reason why it s important to look at all three of these converging factors is because like any financial indicator one is not conclusive you need to look for multiple indicators that are all showing the same thing most people just look at financial cycles and say well we re at the end of a long term credit cycle interest rates are at zero what s going to happen next is the dollar going to remain the reserve currency or whatever but they re only looking at one piece of the puzzle you need to understand the other two pieces to really understand how we got here where we are now and most importantly where we go from here that s what we all want to know where do we go from here and when do we leave i m going to show you that all this change is going to happen in this decade mark warns it s not far off tomorrow in the wiggin sessions mark will share his explosive answers with you you ll learn all about these revolutionary cycles and how to prepare for them i strongly urge you to tune in i m not exaggerating when i say your future and the future of your kids could depend on it i m confident what you learn will help you make more money have peace of mind and give you a deeper understanding of the financial markets and the global economy i hope to see you tomorrow regards addison wiggin for the daily reckoning

ceo albert bourla says final sales for covid 19 antiviral paxlovid could be way bigger than forecasts source aljazeera pfizer inc said on tuesday it expects 2022 sales of its covid 19 vaccine and antiviral pill to top 54bn but that fell short of lofty wall street estimates and its shares were off about 3 percent still chief executive albert bourla said final sales for its oral covid 19 antiviral paxlovid could be way bigger than what pfizer has forecast since its current outlook only included contracts that have been or are close to being signed pfizer currently expects 22bn in 2022 sales of the treatment compared with wall street estimates of 22 88bn clearly this is only a fraction of the 120 million treatments that we are right now preparing to manufacture this year bourla told analysts on a conference call the company is selling 20 million courses of paxlovid to the united states at about 530 a course but bourla said that was a special price because of the size of the order the price for most high income countries he said would be more or less in line with the price of merck co s rival treatment molnupiravir which the us government bought for about 700 a course pfizer executives said the company is in active discussions with more than 100 countries about paxlovid and has the capacity to top 120 million courses if needed for the covid 19 vaccine pfizer developed with germany s biontech se the us drugmaker cautioned that final sales for the year may not top its current forecast of 32bn a 13 percent decline from 2021 levels improved version of paxlovid last year the company increased its covid vaccine sales forecast several times as it signed more supply deals around the world analysts have forecast sales of 33 79bn for the vaccine in 2022 according to refinitiv data overall pfizer expects 2022 sales of 98bn to 102bn also below estimates of 105 48bn looking forward is not as good as looking back for pfizer now and that is why the stock price is down on a somewhat decent report said dennis dick a proprietary trader at bright trading llc going forward acquisitions are obviously very much in the cards said aamir malik pfizer s chief business innovation officer some investors have been looking for pfizer to use its huge cash infusion from covid products on deals to drive future growth pfizer said it had begun working on a next generation version of paxlovid which is authorized to treat high risk covid 19 patients shortly after the onset of symptoms paxlovid performed significantly better in its clinical trials than merck s rival pill with about 90 percent efficacy versus 30 percent but pfizer may still need an improved version of paxlovid according to davinderpreet mangat senior analyst at informa pharma intelligence the door is slightly open still for covid antivirals mangat said drugs from other companies may be able to surpass paxlovid similar to how paxlovid surpassed merck s drug

updated february 9 2022 at 3 26 pm et top congressional democrats are signaling congress could vote soon on legislation to ban lawmakers from trading individual stocks the move comes amid pressure from rank and file members from both parties arguing that voters overwhelmingly back the idea house speaker nancy pelosi d calif doesn t personally trade individual stocks her husband does she said in december she didn t think a ban was necessary but has reversed course as members in her caucus have pushed the issue it is a confidence issue and if that s what members want to do then that s what we will do pelosi said at her weekly press conference on wednesday she added house committees were working on a proposal and a bill could move pretty soon senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y also signaled his support for a ban i believe this is an important issue that congress should address and it s something that has clearly raised interest from both sides of the aisle over the last few weeks schumer said wednesday two house members from different parties push bill texas republican chip roy and virginia democrat abigail spanberger were elected in the same class in 2018 they didn t campaign on the same issues but they learned they shared the same alma mater and favorite basketball team the same birthday and over a beer learned there are some problems they could try to solve together the two introduced legislation in june 2020 to ban members of congress from trading individual stocks they decided to work on the issue after talking about news stories about several members of congress who were under investigation for stock transactions they made following briefings in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic before the impact on the u s economy was clear during an interview with both lawmakers roy bristled a bit at the narrative they re political polar opposites i mean we disagree on a lot but we agree on a lot too there s a number of things that we re trying to come together and sort of sit over beer literally and solve some problems ting shen for npr ting shen for npr rep roy and rep spanberger chat while walking though the longworth house office building on capitol hill there s a 10 year old law already on the books called the stock act that requires lawmakers to disclose stock trades within 45 days but spanberger says that approach doesn t work it s not just enough to know what members are buying or selling it s that they shouldn t be buying or selling she said the campaign legal center recently told npr that in the last year roughly 50 members of congress failed to disclose or filed late reports on their stock transactions roy said lawmakers have an inherent conflict of interest because they attend briefings and sit on committees that impact corporate bottom lines if you are buying calls on google how can american people have confidence that you re going to make a truly objective policy decision on the size and scope of google with respect to antitrust questions for example roy asked ting shen for npr ting shen for npr roy says lawmakers just have an inherent conflict of interest because they attend briefings and sit on committees that impact corporate bottom lines the texas republican points to his own experience he had an investment in a pipeline that ran through his district but he opposed something they were doing and was part of discussions to address it he thought maybe he should sell his shares but immediately realized any transaction would raise questions but then i called ethics and i said wait a second i m beating them up now publicly so if i unload it now it looks like i m kind of gaming it while i m trying to beat him up so i ended up kind of sitting on it which i think was actually to my financial detriment but that s neither here nor there to this point my point is we shouldn t be in that box both spanberger and roy note their bill wouldn t prevent lawmakers from investing none of this would stop you from being able to engage in free enterprise in the free market being able to continue to to hold your investments all we re saying is put it in a blind trust or be in broadly traded index funds roy said spanberger added that change should be part of the process of entering federal public service saying that we want to affirmatively ensure that the american people can have trust in us in the decisions we re making and therefore we cannot own individual stocks or we have to put it in a blind trust that to me is a choice you make when you choose to run for this office ting shen for npr ting shen for npr spanberger says the change should just be part of the process of entering federal public service focus on how ban impacts families spanberger and roy s proposal the trust in congress act would bar both lawmakers and their immediate family members from picking individual stocks it eludes me as a possibility that someone would say to the american people oh no no no no my spouse makes all his own decisions just because i m in covid briefings ignore the fact that when a pandemic started he s buying stocks and insert pharmaceutical company name right people are gonna say you re insulting my intelligence right it s bad if you do it it s bad if they do it spanberger told npr roy said if members have concerns they are open to tweaks to the legislation we can solve this problem this isn t curing cancer right i mean we can just sit down figure out a solution that we think works and then you can always amend it later and both bemoan the fact that in the current political environment there is a tendency to avoid signing onto bills without 100 agreement on every detail different proposals being debated in house and senate in the senate there are efforts to find consensus within the democratic caucus as well as with gop senators who have proposed bills according to multiple sources familiar with the talks one proposal introduced years ago by oregon sen jeff merkley d ore would ban lawmakers and senior staff from buying and selling individual stocks he s been discussing proposals with sen mitt romney r utah and informal talks have picked up in recent weeks sen jon ossoff d ga and sen mark kelly d ariz have introduced the senate companion bill to roy and spanberger s house bill sen elizabeth warren d mass and sen steve daines r mont are working on a proposal while sen ben sasse r neb has introduced a broader ethics reform bill and sen josh hawley r mo is pushing a bill with a ban on trading pelosi declined to get into the details on which proposal would make it to the house floor but said she wants to extend any reforms to the federal judiciary roy and spanberger s bill has about 45 co sponsors another bipartisan bill being pushed by rep raja krishnamoorthi d ill rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y rep matt gaetz r fla and others in the house has a similar level of support their proposal does not cover spouses and dependent children but does include a ban for senior staffers grassroots calls for change both spanberger and roy said this is one issue that voters from both parties agree on roy recalled how this topic resonates with different constituencies back home of all the issues that i talk about this one gets one of the most positive reactions across the ideological spectrum whether i m in downtown austin or in fire breathing hill country really why hasn t that already been done so does spanberger this is the one piece of legislation that people are coming up to me and saying oh my gosh i was reading about that bill that to me is really notable they say making this reform is an easy way to make absolutely clear that lawmakers make decisions without any ulterior financial motive ting shen for npr ting shen for npr spanberger shows roy a framed picture in her office both lawmakers bemoan that in the current political environment there is a tendency to avoid signing onto bills without 100 agreement on every detail it s a chance for us to say when i m working on legislation when i m taking a vote when i m in a briefing i m not thinking oh let me wonder how this could benefit me financially i m thinking about how do i serve my constituents spanberger explained people deserve to know that we are working for them first and foremost and not our own financial stock portfolios roy agreed i think this would be a very you know simple statement that you shouldn t be able to get wealthy on the back of the job you are carrying out on behalf of the people you represent one point roy and spanberger make is the process they used to develop the bill talking across the aisle and being open to changes is the same one they think needs to happen more often in washington merkley who pressed for a ban on trading when congress was debating the stock act a decade ago said in a written statement that an update to ethics laws is overdue we re seeing growing interest on both sides of

children and young adults in the us lost approximately 1 2 million years of life due to unintentional drug overdoses over a five year period according to a recent research letter published in jama oxycontin pills are arranged for a photo at a pharmacy in montpelier vt on tuesday feb 19 2013 ap photo toby talbot the ohio state researchers found that approximately 3 300 adolescents ages 10 19 years old died of an unintentional drug overdose between 2015 and 2019 representing about 187 078 years of life lost nearly 22 000 young people those aged 19 24 years old died from an unintentional overdose over the same time period all told young people saw 1 227 223 58 years of life lost males collectively lost more years of life than females the researchers said these figures are a staggering illustration of the devastation the drug epidemic has wrought on society and in particular on a whole generation of young people what potential scientific artistic or cultural achievements were also lost with the one million years of life taken from this generation these figures are all the more alarming considering that there has been a sharp rise in overdose deaths since the end of the study in 2019 which coincides with the start of the covid 19 pandemic drug overdose deaths in the us rose nearly 30 percent in 2020 resulting in a total of 93 000 deaths according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the figures translate to an average of more than 250 overdose deaths each day or roughly 11 lives lost every hour the rise in deaths from 2019 to 2020 marked the largest single year increase of overdose deaths on record eclipsing previous years by thousands the increase equates to 21 000 more deaths in 2020 than in 2019 prior to 2020 the largest year to year increase was 11 000 in 2016 a figure which stunned experts at the time and is just barely over half of the increase in 2020 provisional data from cdc s national center for health statistics indicate that 2021 will set a new record according to the preliminary data there were an estimated 100 306 drug overdose deaths in the united states during the 12 month period ending in april 2021 the figure represents an increase of 28 5 percent from the 78 056 deaths during the same period the year before to put these figures in historical context according to the cdc there were about 9 000 overdose deaths in 1988 around the height of the crack epidemic all 50 states and the district of columbia reported a spike or increase in overdose numbers during the covid 19 pandemic west virginia continues to be the epicenter of the crisis with the highest rate of overdose deaths in the country however urban areas have overtaken rural areas for age adjusted death rates the number of 45 64 year old non hispanic black people in urban areas dying from synthetic opioid overdose has been rising swiftly according to the latest data the sheer scale of death from drug overdoses in the heart of world capitalism is among the starkest indications of a profound sickness in american society drug abuse and overdoses and other deaths of despair are symptoms of a society in deep crisis consider the following overdose deaths combined with covid 19 deaths have driven down life expectancy to such an extent that the year 2020 officially registered the largest drop since 1943 during world war ii mortality rates for young adults aged 25 to 34 have skyrocketed in the last decade reaching levels not seen since 1953 behind each one of the tragic deaths there is a family friends teachers and others whose lives are forever changed after losing a loved one the political establishment democrat and republican alike have no solution to this crisis in fact the crisis itself is a direct product of their policies which have for decades starved social services driven down wages for workers crushed any movement of working class opposition to austerity measures and further lined the pockets of the richest layers of society for the ruling class economic health is consistently raised above human life nowhere is this phenomenon more clearly illustrated than in the covid 19 pandemic at the present daily death rate of 2 700 it will take just over 30 more days for the united states to register a million dead in response to this incredible figure the new york times published only a tiny blurb at the bottom of its front page entitled 900 000 dead but many americans move on for the biden administration the financial corporate elite and their media apologists the pandemic is over at the behest of the white house federal and state governments are ending restrictions on the spread of the disease and winding up systematic reporting on cases hospitalizations and deaths throughout the pandemic governments around the world responded to the unprecedented public health emergency by pumping trillions of dollars into stock markets big banks and corporations to prop up world capitalism in order to pay back this money workers were forced into plants factories and other workplaces where covid easily spreads to continue production and guarantee corporate profits as a result of these policies inequality has reached new heights throughout the world a new billionaire has been created every 26 hours since the pandemic began the world s 10 richest individuals have doubled their fortunes while over 160 million people are projected to have been pushed into poverty meanwhile an estimated 17 million people have died from covid 19 worldwide workers and youth will remember the years 2020 and 2021 as years of great suffering during which they lost a loved one struggled to provide for their families or wondered about what sort of future they might look forward to under such dire circumstances over the last two years the callous and indifferent attitude of the ruling class to workers has been more starkly exposed than at any time in recent history the devastating revelations about drug overdoses in the us underscore the complete inability of the capitalist system in the country where the financial aristocracy has amassed historic levels of wealth to put those resources to use in dealing with an acute social crisis the necessary resources doctors nurses counselors drug treatment programs anti overdose drugs like narcan should be made freely available through a massive social mobilization that would cost only a fraction of what the pentagon spends each year on the military however the mobilization of the necessary resources is impossible under a political system dominated by two right wing capitalist parties that do the bidding of wall street the measures required to confront the drug crisis in the us cannot be carried out without a frontal attack by the working class on the wealth of the corporate and financial elite and its stranglehold on the entire economic and political system

evolution petroleum nyse american epm evolution or the company today announced financial and operating highlights for its fiscal 2022 second quarter ended december 31 2021 evolution also declared an increased quarterly dividend for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 payable march 31 2022 key q2 fiscal 2022 and recent highlights generated net income of 6 8 million 0 20 per diluted share in the

from 8 5 million in the prior quarter declared increased quarterly dividend of 0 10 per share payable on march 31 2022 produced 4 957 net barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd during the current quarter compared to 5 843 net boepd in the prior quarter impacting the current quarter was a downward adjustment of approximately 400 net boepd due to production mix adjustments in the current and prior quarter by the operator in the barnett shale to reject ethane and capitalize on higher natural gas prices thereby improving cash flow generation grew cash balance to 13 6 million a 71 increase over prior quarter and maintained a strong balance sheet with no net debt 2 as of december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 continued to fund all operations development capital expenditures and cash dividends out of operating cash flow paid 33 rd consecutive quarterly cash dividend of 0 075 per common share and consecutive quarterly cash dividend of 0 075 per common share and recently announced two strategic transactions for the acquisition of non operated assets in north dakota and wyoming further supporting evolution s strategy to add accretive assets to its portfolio that drive increased visibility for expected cash flow generation and shareholder returns for the next decade 1 adjusted ebitda is adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization and is a non gaap financial measure see non gaap information section later in this release for more information including reconciliations to the most comparable gaap measures 2 net debt represents the company s outstanding debt of 4 0 million less cash and cash equivalents balance of 13 6 million as of december 31 2021 we are very pleased that the strategic plan of increasing our size and scale through prudent acquisitions is starting to pay off our success has enabled our board to raise the dividend once again to 0 10 share returning the reward to our shareholders to what they had become accustomed to prior to the pandemic jason brown president and chief executive officer commented our second quarter of fiscal 2022 results represented another period of solid free cash flow generation we continue to benefit from a higher commodity pricing environment which is driving increased field activity from our operators and we look forward to supporting them as they identify high rate of return workover and development opportunities we have seen our net income adjusted ebitda and cash balance all increase quarter over quarter and we remain focused on providing a consistent and meaningful quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders mr brown concluded further supporting our focus on free cash flow generation and providing a meaningful cash return to our shareholders we recently announced two strategic acquisitions that will allow evolution to generate additional free cash flow these new assets provide operational and geographic diversity while adding optionality to invest in organically maintain and grow production through low risk development drilling with our operating partners over the last two years evolution has increased both production and reserves by over 400 in short we believe these recent transactions are truly transformative and provide enhanced dividend support for our shareholders over the next decade we look forward to pursuing additional targeted accretive opportunities that can benefit our shareholders over the near and long term financial and operational results for the quarter ended december 31 2021 evolution reported total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 of 22 3 million which was an 18 increase from the prior quarter oil revenue increased to 10 6 million from the prior quarter due to a 12 increase in sales volumes and a 6 increase in realized commodity price natural gas liquids ngls revenue decreased 43 to 2 6 million primarily due to the aforementioned production mix adjustments by the operator in the barnett shale the result was a change in estimate to reflect ethane rejection by the operator that reduced ngl revenue by 1 1 million and related volumes by 88 thousand barrels excluding these adjustments the realized ngl price for the three months ended december 31 2021 would have been 41 25 per bbl ethane rejection in the barnett shale is primarily a financial decision to capture the most favorable field level economics that result in higher natural gas volumes and lower ngl volumes while maximizing overall cash flow natural gas revenue was 9 2 million which was a 68 increase from the prior quarter driving the sequential increase were 23 higher sales volumes primarily due to the decision of the operator of the barnett shale assets to forgo production of ethane to capitalize on the 36 higher realized price of natural gas from the prior period total production for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 4 957 boepd including 1 636 barrels per day bopd of oil 18 boepd of ngls and 19 816 thousand cubic feet per day mcfpd of natural gas primarily driving the increase in oil production from 1 456 bopd in the prior quarter was the receipt of 1 1 million of past royalties that accumulated over a period of approximately three years associated with overriding royalty interests owned in two wells located in the giddings field in burleson county texas this was offset by a decrease in natural gas liquids sales due to changes in estimates related to prior periods due to ethane rejection in the barnett shale aimed at maximizing cash flow generation from that production lease operating costs increased to 10 7 million from 8 6 million in the prior quarter contributing to the increase was 1 0 million in higher co 2 costs at delhi compared to the prior quarter primarily due to a suspension of co 2 purchases from july 15 2021 to august 20 2021 in order to perform preventative maintenance on the co 2 purchase pipeline in addition oil prices increased from the prior quarter leading to an increase in co 2 cost per mcf as the co 2 purchase price is based on oil price the 1 1 million increase in other lease operating costs was primarily a result of increased production and ad valorem taxes due to higher commodity prices change in estimates in the barnett shale electrical costs at hamilton dome following injection well activation and costs associated with repairs at the ngl plant in delhi total lease operating expense for the current quarter was 23 40 per boe compared with 16 05 per boe in the prior quarter depletion depreciation and amortization dd a expense decreased 20 to 1 2 million quarter over quarter on a per boe basis the company s dd a rate decreased to 2 45 from 2 65 in the prior quarter primarily due to the full cost ceiling test impairment recorded during the prior fiscal year and the barnett shale acquisition which lowered the overall amortizable base on a per unit basis the company s general and administrative g a expenses decreased 6 to 1 8 million for the current quarter from 1 9 million in the prior quarter the decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and benefits costs which were partially offset by an approximate 0 1 million increase in non cash stock based compensation net income for the current quarter grew 31 to 6 8 million or 0 20 per diluted share from 5 2 million or 0 16 per diluted share in the prior quarter adjusted ebitda increased 20 to 10 2 million for the current quarter from 8 5 million in the prior quarter on a per boe basis adjusted ebitda increased 41 from 15 84 per boe in the prior quarter to 22 32 per boe for the current quarter operations update net production at delhi in the current quarter was 108 245 boe an 8 decrease compared to 118 228 boe in the prior quarter oil production continues to be negatively affected by the nine month suspension of co 2 purchases during 2020 due to repairs of the third party owned and operated purchase supply line that lowered reservoir pressure co 2 purchases increased to 100 000 mcfpd in the current quarter assisting in arresting the decline and restoring some of the reservoir pressure previously lost however reservoir pressure has yet to reach previous levels which is projected to increase oil production during the current quarter oil production was further impacted by planned and unplanned compressor maintenance in november and december that temporarily reduced daily production current quarter ngl production volumes were down approximately 30 from the prior quarter due to downtime at the ngl plant in october to replace a turbine and cold inlet temperatures at the ngl plant that reduced flow rates the average oil price per barrel realized by evolution at the delhi field during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 was 75 37 compared to 68 88 during the prior quarter an increase of 9 the average realized ngl price per barrel was 44 23 compared to 39 08 during the prior quarter an increase of 13 hamilton dome production volumes increased 2 to 38 021 barrels in the current quarter compared to 37 145 barrels in the prior quarter primarily due to the restoration of previously shut in wells and strategic adjustments to water injection locations and volumes most projects in the field remain focused on maintenance or restoring shut in production as appropriate based on commodity prices the average oil price per barrel realized by evolution at hamilton dome during the current quarter was 64 59 compared to 59 21 during the prior quarter an increase of 9 production from the field is transported by pipeline to customers and is priced on the western canadian select wcs index which generally trades at a discount to west texas intermediate wti evolution receives a bonus to the wcs index net production of the barnett shale assets was 285 761 boe for the current quarter versus 382 115 boe in the prior quarter as previously discussed production from the barnett shale was impacted by the operator s financial decision to maximize overall field cash flow this resulted in production mix adjustments due to rejecting ethane from the natural gas production in order to capitalize on higher natural gas prices and drive increased total cash flow in the prior and current quarters which resulted in a change in estimate in the current quarter the average natural gas price per mcf realized by evolution at barnett shale during the current quarter was 5 05 compared to 3 70 during the prior quarter an increase of 36 balance sheet capital spending and liquidity at december 31 2021 cash and cash equivalents totaled 13 6 million and evolution had 4 0 million of debt outstanding under its revolving credit facility during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 the company fully funded operations capital expenditures and cash dividends through cash generated from operations and its working capital position and expects the same for the remainder of fiscal 2022 for the three months ended

donald trump has racked up a lot of achievements a noxious and omnipresent brand name a presidency that saw an out of control pandemic kill hundreds of thousands of people and a record setting two impeachment attempts now he s seeking the ultimate feather in his cap which is to become one of the nation s leading tech founders his new trump technology and management group has a lot of plans they include killing off facebook and twitter with right wing free speech social media network truth social rubbing netflix s nose in a slate of anti woke programming and building a tech stack to rival the likes of amazon and google if the ex president wants to get there he ll need to take some advice from his predecessors like amazon s jeff bezos facebook s mark zuckerberg theranos s elizabeth holmes or that guy who sold a machine that squeezed juice bags here are some life lessons from the greats because no matter how good you are there s always something new to learn about sleazing your way to the top build buzz with transparently unrealistic promises and shameless hubris this guy knows how it s done photo michael kovac getty images for wework getty images every burgeoning tech executive knows that in today s attention economy the only way to get anywhere is to issue wild promises of market disruption and subsequent domination whether it s strong arming the movie industry into submission gouging home prices across the country completely reinventing the entire construction supply chain promising every cop in the country a pretext for racial profiling or just pretending real estate is now tech it doesn t matter go big or go home for example trump could promise that the american people are sick of left wing tech totalitarianism and a massive silent majority is ready to flock en masse to a censorship free alternative maybe he could even claim that not only will his new social network be the internet s premiere destination for truth but tmtg will also conquer streaming radio and cloud computing if he wanted to really sell this whole thing trump could claim that his tech stack will create a non cancelable internet stuff your pockets with investor capital is a special purpose acquisition company the shady financial vehicle for you photo spencer platt getty images pulling off this revolutionary paradigm shift in the target market will obviously require a lot of money huge disgusting piles of money raised from panglossian venture capitalists preferably via some kind of shady funding mechanism fortunately for the ex president there s already the perfect thing for this a special purpose acquisition company spac which is a shell corporation formed for the specific purpose of acquiring another company and rushing it a stock listing with minimal regulatory scrutiny of course it d be best if this trump spac had a vague at best business plan relying mostly on artificial buzz and the promise of quick profits perhaps trump could even rely on his most spineless supporters to throw their cash at tmtg stock real tech heads call these supporters the bag holders if that doesn t pan out maybe some kind of cryptocurrency vehicle like an initial coin offering or non fungible token sale rush your product design go on reach into the theranos machine it doesn t normally jab screenshot the inventor out for blood in silicon valley hbo disruptors need to move fast which means getting products out the door before you ve fully thought through things like whether they work or will result in unintended long term consequences every corner not cut is a minute wasted and every minute wasted is a drop of blood that won t get sort of tested trump could consider for example building his new social media site using open source software in violation of its licensing requirements maybe tmtg could also be really vague as to what its policies on content moderation will look like beyond some kind of catch all term like family friendly or maybe just contract the job out to robots just some helpful hints what s the worst that could happen you know use bullshit metrics it only goes up photo johannes eisele afp getty images everyone loves numbers that only go up and never down which is why creative accounting is just good business sense for example facebook needed publishers to pivot to video so it dangled cooked video metrics in front of their faces other tricks pioneered by tech firms like uber include only reporting financials deliberately adjusted to obscure how much money is going down the drain for a while truth social competitor gettr inflated follower counts by adding users twitter followings to the number displayed on user profiles we have yet to see exactly how tmtg could most effectively cook the books to claim it s the leading social network but in the short term maybe trump could just take credit for any stumbles by his competitors like facebook it s an idea abuse a contract workforce it s not exploitation it s fuelling small business innovation photo artur widak nurphoto via getty images getty images employees are expensive and irritating they never stop whining about things like salary or benefits and they have this annoying tendency to unionize fortunately the savvy tech ceo knows exactly how to subcontract out core functions and bust unions ensuring they can underpay and ignore labour conditions for huge segments of their workforce this is to say that to become a tech magnate trump would ideally have a long and unquestionable history of backstabbing or stiffing virtually every single person who has ever worked for him deny deny deny issue a non apology do nothing to fix the issue repeat when things go wrong and they will that s just the price of progress but that doesn t mean that you have to actually take responsibility for it the modern tech ceo has their firm on a war footing against the press ready to deny any and all unflattering coverage as false exaggerated or just mischaracterizing what s actually going on when the heat gets too much bring in the crisis pr firms and memorise the phrase we know we have work to do then and this is the really important part don t do that work the ex president may thus need to shift his rhetorical and management style to become completely hostile to any and all criticism insulate yourself from your enemies by building a cult of personality and an army of sycophants that viciously attack perceived opponents why insist this is actually a good thing when thousands of angry guys can do it for you photo frederic j brown afp via getty images getty images nothing enhances a brand s perception and value like cultivating an image of oneself as an almighty irreplaceable ubermensch with unrivalled vision and a mission far grander than mere business just ask the late steve jobs elon musk or a certain saudi prince any tech ceo worth their salt has a keyboard army ready to go whether it s to harass and harangue critics talk up their every move as a bold and game changing endeavour or simply rally the wagons at the mere hint someone else could do the job we re uh sure that mr trump has some thoughts on this matter sit back and enjoy your inflated value artist s rendition illustration bryan menegus gizmodo when it s all said and done a tech ceo gotta have hobbies trump clearly has to catch up his rivals are busy owning obnoxious watercraft killing goats cheating on their spouses golfing and hanging out with jeffrey epstein as far as we know he s only at four out of five here so there s room for improvement mr trump sir you gotta hold the captive bolt pistol this way

update february 16 2022 while 59 of independent shareholders supported the green century proposal calling on tyson to reduce its use of plastic packaging the resolution was ultimately shot down by tyson family shareholders though not surprising the outcome is another indication of the company s antagonism to serious sustainability actions ucs will continue to press tyson foods to improve its record on farmland sustainability worker justice and farmer fairness this week the nation s largest meat and poultry company will hold its annual shareholder meeting on a secure zoom call from arkansas tyson foods investors will vote on a modest proposal to improve sustainability in tyson s operations by studying the amount of plastic packaging the company uses that proposal will almost certainly be voted down at the same time a new union of concerned scientists analysis has concluded that the company could and should do much more to reduce its harmful impacts on our air water and land big chicken big polluter tyson s tendency to cheat farmers and to exploit and endanger workers has prompted considerable scrutiny and rightfully so but the meat and poultry giant also has a massive environmental impact to understand why first you need to appreciate just how big tyson foods and its supply chain are according to the company s website tyson produces 20 percent of all us beef pork and chicken to produce and sell that much meat tyson slaughters and processes truly unimaginable numbers of animals based on tyson s reported weekly production capacities and utilization rates we estimated that the company processed approximately 6 million head of cattle 22 million hogs and nearly 2 billion chickens in 2020 the 123 processing plants that do this dirty work produce and discharge a lot of waste a 2016 study analyzed publicly available toxic discharge data from the us environmental protection agency and named tyson the second biggest polluter of us waterways from 2010 to 2014 the study found that tyson and its subsidiaries processing plants dumped more than 104 million pounds of pollutants into waterways during that period and multiple states have sued tyson in recent years for spills or improper discharge of animal waste and other pollutants these include alabama where an estimated 220 000 gallon spill caused one of the largest fish kills in the state s history in 2019 a case tyson settled in 2021 for 3 million tyson also settled another pollution case with the state of missouri and paid a 2 million fine for a second clean water act violation in that state oklahoma has been waiting 16 years to collect damages and injunctive relief for hundreds of tons of stored and disposed poultry waste within the state s watersheds a case popularly and sadly known as the bus loads of lawyers case but spills and illegal discharges from tyson processing plants are just the tip of the iceberg there is another ongoing and completely unregulated source of pollution for which the company is ultimately accountable tyson s massive grain supply chain remember those billions of animals tyson processes every year while they re living they have to eat and what they eat primarily is vast quantities of corn and soybeans corn is the most widely used feed grain but livestock and poultry eat a lot of soybeans too more than 70 percent of all soybeans grown in the united states growing feed for tyson s supply chain takes a great deal of farmland we estimated the acreage used for all this corn and soy and it s big as in up to 10 million acres big while we can t say for sure we can assume that grain production on those 10 million acres uses prevailing farming practices that a contribute to soil erosion and fertilizer runoff causing coastal dead zones b release heat trapping gases that drive climate change and c leave farmland and surrounding communities vulnerable to extreme weather in short those 10 million acres can cause substantial environmental damage tyson keeps punting on sustainability though our estimate of tyson s 10 million acre farmland footprint is new the issue of its impact on farming practices and water pollution has been brought to the company s attention many times again and again in 2017 2018 and 2019 investor groups brought these concerns to tyson but each time shareholders voted the resolutions down in 2018 the company trumpeted a commitment to shift 2 million acres of cropland just 20 percent of its total footprint to more sustainable practices by 2020 but it hasn t followed through as of 2021 the company had enrolled a mere fraction of this acreage into a pilot program and it is unclear how sustainable the management of that fraction really is meanwhile the company has punted the original 2 million acre commitment to 2025 because covid it says instead of taking sustainability seriously in 2019 tyson hired a chief sustainability officer his name is john r tyson the founder s great grandson for failing to meet the company s feed sustainability goal he was paid a cool 13 7 million in total compensation in fiscal year 2021 i wonder how much they ll pay him to not study plastic use this year i can say that because ahead of this year s annual meeting tyson executives have already officially urged shareholders to reject the plastic resolution just like those earlier water pollution proposals the plastic resolution will go down in flames because that s what the tyson family wants you see the founder s descendants have a lock on shareholder voting through a system known as a dual class stock structure essentially tyson issues two different classes of shares with one class having more voting power and earning better dividends than the other members of the tyson family own the better class a shares the dual class system was challenged by investor groups in 2020 and 2021 but surprise surprise the family voted down such a change at this week s annual meeting shareholders no doubt will hear about how the company s first quarter profits nearly doubled while they vote to approve sky high executive compensation for another year last year according to the meeting s proxy statement the top three execs pulled in a total of 37 2 million including a 6 million severance for the ceo who left abruptly mid year regulators must curb tyson s power if you re wondering how tyson has amassed the power to enrich itself while making so many things worse the answer is unchecked consolidation our 2021 report tyson spells trouble for arkansas highlighted how the company has used mergers and acquisitions to dominate the poultry market in its home state controlling activity up and down the chicken supply chain that includes milling grain for feed in 2018 tyson produced around 10 million metric tons of feed in a total of 32 feed mills throughout north america enough to make it the ninth largest feed producer in the world lax enforcement of antitrust laws over decades has allowed tyson foods to grow to a size and power that is bad for everyone else its massive farm footprint and outsize environmental impact are just one indication that the company is too big it is time for regulators to rein it in my colleague and economist rebecca boehm made a case recently in tyson s hometown newspaper for bold policy action to curb its power and that of other big processors and to restore competition to the meat and poultry industry earlier this year the us department of agriculture usda announced an unprecedented 1 billion in investments to spur competition and just last week the usda and the department of justice launched a portal through which farmers can file antitrust complaints and there is more the biden administration can do including prosecuting antitrust actions more aggressively and creating new rules to keep the tysons of the world in check tell them to do it take action today
with inflation raging it s public enemy number one in all the polls with a heavy dose of consumer pain when buying groceries or gasoline or home heating fuel you would think president biden would appoint people to the federal reserve that would understand the importance of curbing inflation think ronald reagan and paul volker 40 years ago but no once again biden has gone big woke big woke means green new deal climate is an existential threat big woke means equity diversification and gender and racial disparities remember last spring harvard economist larry summers said that he feared a whole new generation of central bankers who are much more interested in climate risk and woke social theories than fighting inflation he was right rep jamie raskin slapped with ethics complaint over failure to report wife s huge stock payout one of joe biden s fed nominations sarah bloom raskin was on record wanting the fed to exclude fossil fuel companies from their emergency lending programs during the height of the pandemic she said the fed is ignoring clear warning signs about the economic repercussions of the impending climate crisis by taking action that will lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions at a time when even in the short term fossil fuels are a terrible investment elsewhere she has repeatedly said the fed should allocate capital away from fossil fuel companies but the fed is not in the business of credit allocation nor does its congressional mandate on stable prices and low unemployment include climate change ms raskin has her own radical agenda by the way if the federal reserve supervised banks to stop lending to oil and gas and coal companies energy prices would go up even more because drilling production and investment would drop even more than they have already oil is back at 90 a barrel gasoline at the pump is 3 47 40 above a year ago in other words contrary to the fed s mission and ignoring the current high inflation reality raskin s radical left woke attack on fossil fuels would raise inflation substantially more and this view should disqualify her just saying then she s also got an ethics problem with her lobbying the federal reserve for a fintech company called reserve trust she did this lobbying after leaving the federal reserve and then leaving the obama treasury and coveted fed privileges that no other fintech company has every gotten she also made a million and a half bucks on stock options from that company and failed to report it on time sarah bloom raskin grilled over controversial climate views during fiery confirmation hearing we will talk more about this with our lead guest sen pat toomey ranking member on the banking committee there s another awokening from biden for a fed board position professor lisa cook from michigan state is another radical left winger i will quote economist john cochrane from the hoover institution who scanned her publications and said you will find essentially nothing related to monetary policy monetary effects on employment interest rates inflation financial regulation or other traditional fed topics cochrane also points out that ms cook s most cited paper is trade credit and bank finance financing small firms in russia how good is that shades of omarova and moscow state university here s another one ms cook has called for replacing the unemployment rate as a key fed metric with a mandate for the black unemployment rate in other words throw away 88 of the available info on the labor market this is nowhere near the mainstream of macroeconomic thinking by the way cook hates donald trump despite the fact that under mr trump s policies came the lowest black unemployment rate in the history of that statistic yup but that didn t stop her from calling him a fascist and saying his administration has led america down the path to genocide similar to the holocaust click here to get the fox news app she believes america is racist she supported bailing out rioters she s called nascar folks uneducated rednecks and also favors slavery reparations now it s a free country and i respect ms cook s freedom to say all these things even though i find her views to be hideous and anti american but did the bidens have to appoint her to the federal reserve board our nation s central bank which controls the money supply and inflation and is a huge influence on the u s and world economy really this is the best they could find oh my goodness this article is adapted from larry kudlow s opening commentary on the february 9 2022 edition of kudlow

sara nelson the voice of the small business owner courtesy of the nelson campaign today at long last seattle s most marginalized group the business community got to share its untold stories the seattle city council hosted the safe space during its economic development technology city light committee meeting this committee does not deal with public safety but committee chair councilmember sara nelson welcomed the small biz community to air its grievances one public commenter called this out asking the committee to stay in its lane similar to the argument nelson used when she refused to vote on yesterday s starbucks resolution but this is a pet issue for nelson who as a co owner of fremont brewing is the only small business owner on the council her office says she has formally stepped away from all involvement with fremont brewing though she remains a co owner nelson cited loss of business and tax revenue as why this issue is on topic for the committee and it was a big day for seattle is dying stans komo ran a story yesterday in anticipation of today s committee meeting public comment was what you would expect basically business owners are scared homeless people are to blame some called for more social services most did not i love a good vent sesh as much as the next gal but proposed legislation was not the focus of this public comment period which is sorta the idea of public comment so why are we talking about this during the meat of the meeting the biz community recommended more emphasis patrols and more city funds for storefront damage councilmember debora juarez seemed down with more police presence which seems to be the city s direction anyway i wrote about it check it out before any of you losers call me a cunt let me say that some small business owners have very legitimate concerns i would not want to get my windows smashed either that is not fun and is probably very expensive one small business owner presented the other side of this very old story during the public comment vent sesh a pull quote i m calling to say the city should not be responding to systemic inequality and the lack of housing in our city by criminalizing acts of survival and blaming individuals in crisis recidivism is nearly guaranteed when people are forced into the criminal legal system and are later released into unchanged or worsened economic situations to prevent harm this committee should focus on equitable community led investments and not on notions of increased policing which only operates by threatening or perpetrating violence you should center the injustices that low income residents often face such as wage theft and work on getting people s basic needs met in the meantime i would rather a person steal what is necessary to stabilize themselves and let business owners pull themselves up by their bootstraps we should not base city policies on the hand selected few business owners impressions and opinions i do not like that public dollars are being spent on this discussion today which will inevitably prioritize the profits of capital owners who have a seat at the table betty davis has died betty davis a trailblazer of funk died but her impact on music and fashion will survive well beyond her 77 years r i p to the legendary betty davis pic twitter com hu4cekxybx 𝙱𝚎𝚌𝚌𝚊 mjfinesselover february 9 2022 please don t fuck this up we ve been through it with false hope of the supposed end to the pandemic i most certainly do not want to get anyone s hopes up or assert that the pandemic the impact of which will surpass any end date we slap on it is somehow over but health experts have at least some good news another report this one from the ap announced that covid cases are falling throughout the state that s great and i ll also remind you of this quote from the president of the washington state hospital association who said that just because we are doing better does not mean this thing is over we really don t want people to rip off their masks or go to big parties quite yet covid activity remains a threat basically don t do this despite this clear message that covid 19 is not over the pressure continues for governor jay inslee king inslee as some call him to roll back mask mandates this komo poll says it is time do you think washington should ease mask mandates komo news komonews february 8 2022 he ll get to it one day today inslee lifted an outdoor mask mandate i forgot that was a thing and announced that he will probably announce details about mask mandates next week the seattle times has the story fuck them kids state superintendent chris reykdal is over the mask mandate more mask mayhem leaders across the country are ending mask mandates so some areas will see more bare faces and i know that people make this out to be an individual freedom thing but the consensus among doctors has been that you masking up protects others so like that whole your freedom ends at the tip of your nose sorta works here anyway here s an article about how much protection you have when you re the only one in a mask nancy caves well folks house speaker nancy pelosi gave the thumbs up on a plan to ban members of congress from trading stock after months of resisting found this fun stock tracker if you re curious as to why she was holding out in memory of a past version of the central district seattle artist jite agbro

the way things are going these days dr melinda burrell long time democratic activist and researcher and greg schumacher retired army major general and chairman fauquier county republican committee aren t supposed to be able to have civil conversations it s inconceivable that we and our spouses could actually be friends but converse we do and friends we are how did we achieve this mutual respect and friendship despite being on opposite sides of the political spectrum this presidents day as we honor the founders of this great nation that has brought more freedom and opportunity for more people from diverse backgrounds than any other in history in a context where many are working to divide us and denigrate america we want to share some thoughts and behaviors that worked for us we don t presume to have all of the answers but humbly assert that unless more americans are willing to work to achieve more mutual respect and unity around at least a common vision of america our future is grim how have we been able to converse we started off with common ground because a mutual friend introduced us our first conversation revealed more shared interests the strong belief that americans need to learn to talk across all our divides that turned into a mutual goal of having those full honest conversations ourselves commitment to this goal of dialogue itself is important sometimes the other person has shocked us greg was surprised to learn mindy attended blm rallies and found them peaceful at times joyful mindy was surprised to learn that greg had planned to go to the jan 6 rally which he felt did not incite a storming of the capitol but because our goal is relationship and conversation rather than rejecting the other person because of what they believe we ve paused reflected and asked questions rather than leap to conclusions it s hard we ve needed to remind ourselves of what we re trying to accomplish together and why it s helped to deliberately work to get to know each other we talk about our lives from vacation plans to family health crises recently we met with our spouses this added another dimension to our relationship and new common ground our spouses are gardeners and all four of us are thinking about life transitions in conversing we both are respectful of the other we try to listen be open minded and candid personal stories seem to help mindy was impressed when greg spoke about his dinners with african american colleagues to discuss nuanced rather than knee jerk approaches to racial reconciliation greg was likewise impressed when mindy described lifestyle changes she and her husband have made to reduce their carbon footprint in the belief that climate change is caused by human action rather than a natural cycle both of us respect that the other is doing the work not just talking both of us were surprised to learn things about the other that countered stereotypes we re still working towards the real prize of conversation key actions and policies on which we agree we ll start by trying to agree on the desired end states then think backwards together about how to get there this takes time energy and thought not always easy to summon it s a matter of will and commitment to an extended process it helps to add humor we laughed about disagreeing even over phrases in this piece but we celebrate the fact that we wrote it and that you re reading it please join us greg schumacher is a retired army major general and chairman of the republican committee of fauquier county melinda burrell phd syndicated by peacevoice is a humanitarian aid worker who studies polarization and trains on the neuroscience of communication she is on the board of the national association for community mediation which offers resources on cross divide dialogue
the powder river near arvada the sheridan community land trust explore history program in collaboration with the hub on smith held its february program at the wyo on feb 8th carrie edinger historical program manager said that the move to the wyo was made due to the popularity of the programs saying that they were outgrowing the hub dining room edinger presented this month s program titled the history of water in semi arid southeast sheridan county edinger introduced her program this way edinger added that by the late 1800s the native american s began to feel the impact of the westward expansion during the california gold rush many travelers came across wyoming and competed with the native americans for the natural resources this caused many tensions between the two groups on september 8 1851 the us commissioner of indian affairs arranged a huge gathering at fort laramie to assign territories for each tribe to help maintain the peace and give each tribe their own hunting grounds this treaty called the horse creek treaty was moved from fort laramie to the mouth of horses creek 30 miles away as there was not enough pasture for all the various tribes horses indian lands bordered by creeks the treaty used the existing rivers as borders for the 38 million acres of lands reserved for the tribes the power river became the boundary between the lakota and the crow the power river the yellowstone twenty five yard creek and the mussel shell river formed some of the boundaries the crow s name was in a reference to one time when a war party got caught in a snowstorm near power river and some froze to death in the mid 1800s the white settlers in wyoming territory claimed the water on a first come first serve basis and the territorial government began to write down the people s claims on the water but that didn t stop people from arguing over the water and the disputes went to the courts in 1888 elwood mead was hired as the wyoming territorial engineer he came from indiana where the problem was often too much water unlike wyoming where there was seldom enough he worked for a time on the front range in colorado researching the water right problems there when he came to wyoming he had to figure out which claims were recorded in the wyoming books he came up with the idea that no one could claim water without a permit they set up a board to listen to disputes rather than the courts the water laws were voted into the wyoming constitution in 1890 edinger also spoke about the pratt and ferris cattle company who were instrumental in establishing some of the early irrigation ditches in southeastern sheridan county in 1884 at first pratt and ferris were a freighting company and in 1879 the company went into the cattle ranching business in the clearmont ucross area along clear creek one of the pratt and ferries businesses was furnishing beef to the forts and the indian agencies lake desmet some of the partners in the pratt and ferris company were james h pratt cornelius ferris and marshall field who later started fields department store in chicago levi leiter who was a well known rancher in the clearmont area was field s senior partner in the dry goods store in 1865 leiter later sold out his share to field but it was through this connection that leiter came to invest in the pratt and ferris cattle company in 1898 pratt and leiter bought out rest of investors these men were american entrepreneurs of the era and field was one of the richest men in chicago and the united states edginger talks about the irrigation project that leiter started in the clear creek valley in 1897 and 1898 leiter attempted to corner the wheat market and was briefly the largest individual holder of wheat in the history of the grain trade action taken against him by his competitors and they broke his corner on that market at one time the leiter estate ran from the johnson county line near ucross east to leiter the estate installed the concrete grain elevators along highway 14 16 in 1904 when lz leiter died and the value of the estate was between 50 and 100 million dollars leiter s children brought a lawsuit against the estate and the litigation eventually lasted eight years and cost millions of dollars joseph leiter lz s son continued be a part of the clear creek valley working on irrigation and farming instead of stock growing one of the crops that was raised for years in the valley was sugar beets edinger explained many volga german families emigrated from russia where catherine the great had invited then to the volga river to farm during the 1760s in the late 1800s many immigrated to america where they retained their german language and customs many of these farmers settled along the clear creek valley and began to grow sugar beets edinger added that the planting thinning and harvesting the beets required a lot of manual labor she also said that during the world wars many of the german farmers faced prejudice from the other residents in the area edinger s program demonstrated how water from the native american s river boundaries to water rights and irrigation projects has affected the history and landscapes of sheridan county

nasdaq 100 outlook u s stocks rally on wednesday as risk appetite continues to improve on wall street the nasdaq 100 soars 2 1 but falls short of recapturing decisively its 200 day simple moving average while sentiment appears to be improving the situation could change quickly if u s inflation data for january surprises to the upside and shows renewed momentum in consumer prices trade smarter sign up for the dailyfx newsletter receive timely and compelling market commentary from the dailyfx team subscribe to newsletter most recent 3 key tips to building your confidence as a trader u s stocks powered higher on wednesday amid a respite in the treasury market and improved sentiment as quarterly earnings continued to signal strength in corporate america despite several challenges including elevated price pressures and cooling economic activity at the closing bell the s p 500 rallied 1 45 to 4 587 posting its biggest daily gain of the month and coming within a whisker of fibonacci resistance in the 4 590 area buoyed by a strong rally in meta platforms and nvidia corporation shares which jumped more than5 during the trading session meanwhile the nasdaq 100 surged 2 1 15 056 as traders remained intent on buying the january dip in the technology space on fomo mentality although it also helped that the u s 10 year rate failed to make further progress towards the 2 00 mark risk appetite is recovering and the vix s performance is testament to that improvement late last month the fear index briefly spiked to 39 its highest reading in 16 months but has since reversed lower to trade near the 20 00 psychological level a sign that investors are becoming a less anxious about deploying more capital into equities although bullish sentiment appears on the rise after the brutal and perhaps overdone sell off earlier this year the situation could change in the blink of an eye if treasury yields make another violent run to the upside recommended by diego colman get your free equities forecast get my guide the mood could change on thursday if the latest inflation data shows newfound momentum and more deterioration in the underlying trend there is no doubt that investors know that the direction of travel is towards more restrictive monetary policy but a further acceleration in consumer prices could force the central bank to be more aggressive in its efforts to dial back stimulus most traders believe the fed will begin raising borrowing costs at its march meeting lifting the benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 0 25 0 50 but a segment of the market is betting on a 50 bp hike with the probability of that outcome at 27 according to the cme s fedwatch tool there is room for expectations to firm and that could occur if january cpi tops forecasts and rises well above the 7 3 y y projected by analysts the headline figure is certainly useful and often more scrutinized by the media but traders should pay more attention to the core indicator as it provides the most insight into the underlying trend dynamics that said core inflation is seen climbing 5 9 y y from 5 5 y y in december reaching what would be its fastest pace since 1982 an upside surprise in inflation will likely push government yields higher especially at the short end of the curve weighing on sentiment and prompting traders to position for a steeper tightening cycle this could trigger a sell off in risk assets withtechnology and growth stocks being the most vulnerable due to their expensive valuations and the nature of their cash flows long duration for this reason the nasdaq 100 is in a somewhat precarious position and susceptible to a sharp pullback as we move through the latter part of the week while the bearish thesis is compelling it is important to analyze what could happen if price pressures in the u s economy begin to ease unexpectedly should the inflation profile improve there will be less urgency for the central bank to withdraw accommodation forcefully and assertively for the rest of the year a situation that could pave the way for a powerful rally on wall street under this scenario stocks could gain across the board but beaten down names in the tech and growth universe could have greater upside potential given how much they have fallen in recent months recommended by diego colman get your free top trading opportunities forecast get my guide nasdaq 100 technical analysis the nasdaq 100 has staged a powerful rally since its january low rebounding almost 10 in less than 10 days the tech index however hasn t reclaimed its 200 day simple moving average a sign that the underlying bias remains slightly bearish on that note if sellers resurface and take control of the market the first technical floor to consider appears in the 14 450 area though a move below that area could spark a furious sell off and push the price towards trendline support near 13 900 on the flip side if the nasdaq 100 manages to climb above its 200 day sma sentiment could improve further attracting new buyers and propelling the index towards fibonacci resistance at 15 255 if this barrier is taken out the 15 616 area would become the immediate upside
