blood of horseshoe crabs is a critical component of tests to ensure injectable medications such as coronavirus vaccines aren t contaminated to obtain it harvesters bring many thousands of the creatures to laboratories to be bled each year and then return them to the sea a practice that has drawn criticism from conservationists because some don t survive the process the blood which is blue due to its copper content is coveted for proteins used to create the lal test a process used to screen medical products for bacteria synthetic alternatives aren t widely accepted by the health care industry and haven t been approved federally leaving the crabs as the only domestic source of this key ingredient many of these crabs are harvested along the coast of south carolina where gov henry mcmaster promoted the niche industry as key to the development of a domestic medical supply chain while also noting that environmental concerns should be explored we don t want to have to depend on foreign countries for a lot of reasons including national security so it s good to see this company thriving in the united states mcmaster told the associated press this month during a visit to charles river laboratories at its charleston facilities to which ap was granted rare access we want to do everything we can to onshore all of these critical operations horseshoe crabs aquatic arthropods shaped like helmets with long tails are more akin to scorpions than crabs and are older than dinosaurs they ve been scurrying along the brackish floors of coastal waters for hundreds of millions of years their eggs are considered a primary fat source for more than a dozen species of migratory shore birds according to south carolina s department of natural resources their value to avoiding infection emerged after scientists researching their immune response injected bacteria into horseshoe crabs in the 1950s they ultimately developed the lal test and the technique has been used since the 1970s to keep medical materials and supplies free of bacteria their biomedical use has been on the rise with 464 482 crabs brought to biomedical facilities in 2018 according to the atlantic states marine fisheries commission in south carolina that s done only by charles river a massachusetts based company that tests 55 of world s injectables and medical devices like iv bags dialysis solutions and even surgical cleaning wipes according to company officials we are almost the last line of defense before these drugs leave the manufacturing area and make it to a patient senior vice president foster jordan told mcmaster if it touches your blood it s been tested by lal and more than likely it s been tested by us south carolina gov henry mcmaster holds a model of a horseshoe crab whose blood is a vital component in the contamination testing of injectable medicines including the coronavirus vaccines at charles river labs on friday aug 6 2021 in charleston s c photo meg kinnard associated press charles river employs local fishermen to harvest the crabs by hand a process governed by wildlife officials that can only happen during a small annual window when the creatures come ashore to spawn contractors bring them to the company s bleeding facilities then return them to the waters from which they came during a year jordan said his harvesters can bring in 100 000 to 150 000 horseshoe crabs and still can t satisfy the growing demand we need more though jordan told mcmaster adding that his company is working with the state to open up more harvesting areas the population s steady we need access to more beaches to get more crabs a house of cards the practice is not without its critics some of whom have argued that bleeding the crabs and hauling them back and forth is harmful according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 10 to 15 of harvested crabs die during the process the international union for conservation of nature listed the species overall as vulnerable noting decreasing numbers as of a 2016 assessment the atlantic states marine fisheries commission listed 2019 stock as good in the southeast but poor in areas around new york conservationists sued last year accusing the u s fish and wildlife service of shirking its duty to protect areas including south carolina s cape romain national wildlife refuge by allowing horseshoe crab harvesting they argued that taking out the crabs affects other species in the protected area a federal judge temporarily halted the harvest but was reversed following charles river s appeal the environmental groups asked to withdraw their complaint this month after federal officials imposed a permitting process for any commercial activity in the refuge including horseshoe harvesting beginning aug 15 even if such permits are denied jordan told mcmaster that only 20 of its harvest came from the refuge with most coming from further down the south carolina coast there is a synthetic alternative to the horseshoe crab blood but it hasn t been widely accepted in the u s and meanwhile charles river s international competitors are making synthetics and also pressing for u s food and drug administration approval which jordan said could hamper domestic efforts like his own my mission is to make sure that any competitor that comes into the united states from china or any of these other producers has to go through the same regulatory process that we had to go through to make sure that it s safe jordan said if all these synthetics start coming in from other countries we re going to lose the protection that we ve had for all these years and the safety and the control of the drug supply we want to have as much stuff made here as we can mcmaster said in response as for the environmental concerns the governor said maintaining a healthy balance between scientific demands and the state s ecosystems which bolster a significant portion of south carolina s tourism economy is paramount it s like a house of cards you pull out one part and the rest of it will fall mcmaster said so i think we have to be very careful and be sure that any company any business any activity whether it s commercial or otherwise meets whatever requirements are there to protect the species birds horseshoe crabs any sort of life

it s more about what isn t happening in the sector than what actually occurred what happened most publicly traded weed companies saw their share prices wilt this week among the more significant decliners were charlotte s web holdings cwbhf 2 40 and organigram ogi 2 42 both of which fell by around 20 across the five day stretch up and comers flora growth flgc 4 65 and im cannabis imcc 3 27 took even harder hits with both declining at a roughly 26 clip so what there weren t any all encompassing and powerful negative developments in marijuana rather last week seemed to be more of a no news is bad news situation in the world s potentially most important weed market earlier this year it seemed that great progress was being made on the u s legalization decriminalization front several states flipped the switch on either medical or recreational cannabis and a new decriminalization bill was introduced in the senate but almost no legislative progress has been made since then and the clock is ticking for the cannabis sector many weed companies are continuing to burn cash time isn t on their side and they could really use the boost that greater cannabis law liberalization will bring now what other factors are affecting this particular set of stocks at the end of last week charlotte s web was hit by a recommendation downgrade from piper sandler from overweight read buy to neutral flora growth meanwhile posted half year results which showed encouraging growth yet revealed the company was well in the red on the bottom line all in all though this week appeared to prove that the cannabis industry s fortunes are still firmly tied to marijuana legalization or the lack thereof
optimism is waning for now for this real estate brokerage technologist what happened shares of tech enhanced real estate brokerage firm redfin rdfn 0 50 fell 11 over the last five trading days ended friday aug 20 the trend builds on losses the stock has been experiencing since the second quarter 2021 earnings report earlier in the month in total redfin is now down some 31 in 2021 so what the real estate disruptor has one of the most well rounded technology stacks addressing multiple needs of home sellers buyers and renters the company has been doing just fine financially this year as americans have been moving to new homes en masse during the pandemic revenue through the first half of 2021 is up 83 to 740 million driven both by a hot housing market marked by bidding wars over a tight supply of available homes as well as a big rebound in activity compared to the brief freeze caused by the initial pandemic lockdown last spring there are two likely reasons redfin stock is falling anyways first shares are simply cooling off after the massive 225 gain they notched last year as it and many other high growth tech stocks took flight sometimes a reversion back to reality can take awhile and second there are signs that the housing market is set for a slowdown redfin itself has been reporting a decrease in bidding wars home price growth may start to ease and a persistent shortage of homes means many buyers simply have nothing to shop for which for a brokerage means no commission earned now what for redfin the housing market getting doused with some cool water wouldn t be the end of the world it s far more than just a brokerage these days especially after the acquisition of rentpath rentals will continuously be added to redfin s leading real estate listing site this year and next as the rentpath assets are gradually integrated into operations plus redfin is also a story of expanding market share of the real estate industry and at just 1 18 of u s market share in q2 2021 based on value of homes sold there s still plenty of room for redfin to grow as it extends its services into new cities and metropolitan areas in spite of the signs of slowdown management forecast revenue to jump at least 124 year over year in q3 shares now trade for four times trailing 12 month revenue and 14 5 times trailing 12 month gross profit perhaps a long term value if this company can continue its steady pace of growth
ammon inside cast iron on 17th customers will find it s never the same seven days a week the menu is constantly evolving and changing but the one constant is its ridiculously mind blowing food unlike anything you ve tried before according to cast iron on 17th s facebook page the restaurant s social media pages describe the restaurant as a redneck fancy french influenced steakhouse cast iron on 17th opened during the covid 19 pandemic purchased by josh swain and trevor noles in the fall of 2020 the investment was a risky bet however with the help of chef justin wheeler and server steve sloan noles says they were able to pull it off it s eclectic and fun we wanted to bring that back into the community after everyone being stuck at home with nothing to do during the pandemic we wanted to bring back the fun atmosphere noles says the operating owner says one of their dishes made it on the front cover of the july edition of the idaho falls magazine the dish called end of summer citrus salmon has fresh salmon steak encrusted with a citrus zest thyme and shaved horseradish root breading pan seared to a golden brown and served with a handmade fresh citrus hollandaise we won best new restaurant it s been one dish that we ve had since we first opened up back in december the crust on that salmon is actually a citrus crust with panko and fresh zested lemons and limes and orange the fish is an atlantic sockeye that we get from orca bay the risotto that is on the bottom is a mediterranean risotto the rice had been cooked in our own house made vegetable stock he said cast iron on 17th end of summer citrus salmon andrea olson eastidahonews com noles explained their french onion soup is another hit it has slowly sweated down onions inside a homemade au jus with a homemade beef stock that reduces for about four or five days we do it with pepper and red wine so it s sweet and peppery at the same time we top it with a bread crumb that we actually crust in house so it should be melted and delicious at the same time he said cast iron on 17th french onion soup andrea olson eastidahonews com all of the dishes are fresh made in house and are cooked over a long period of time with fresh ingredients another dish called the new york strip with black garlic compound butter is a must so it s a black garlic and it s a type of fermentation of garlic and it takes about six to seven weeks to do in the dehydrator so it s something that we just finished and is now turned into compound butter and melted on top of the steak noles explained noles says they also offer wine from a variety of places for unique desserts cast iron on 17th also offers a baklava cheesecake in the crust it s a baklava crust that we ve actually soaked inside of an orange so it s kind of citrusy and you can t really feel it but it s there and then the cream cheese on top is the actual cheesecake itself it s different traditionally it s done with the graham cracker crumb instead we use phyllo dough do the whole layering with the butter and then soak it after it s baked in orange it s really good we also use a walnut and pistachio crust inside of it it s kind of a hidden flavor noles said cast iron on 17th baklava cheesecake andrea olson eastidahonews com noles loves cast iron on 17th he helps cook the food and says it s a passion of his that he owes to his aunt he grew up in idaho falls and watched his aunt cook food i owe it to her that i got the drive and education to start out cooking he said cast iron on 17th has another fascinating detail specific to the restaurant that most people won t find anywhere else even the dishes you get the forks to the cups everything is just different he explained the cutlery does not match the chairs and tables don t match even the plates and cups don t match all of it is different and styled to look like the customer is in an antique shop noles says if customers like something inside the restaurant whether it s a cup a chair a plate they can ask to buy it customers can even get a plate signed by the chef or the whole crew there is also a dress code no neckties if you come in wearing a tie if you got a tie that you don t like you can bring it in and we will ask you if it s okay if we can cut it off you get to sign it date it and then you get to become part of the restaurant we have ties all over the place in our restaurant hung up stapled to the walls we encourage top hats and bowties why not it s something different and fun you don t have to wear dress shirts or dress clothes you can come in casual it s fine casual how we like to explain it is fine dining with a redneck flare he said since the restaurant is upper class and different it s slightly more expensive due to the food being fresh and taking days to prepare food can range anywhere from 8 to 30 to 80 depending on what you d like to try cast iron on 17th is located at 3520 e 17th st ammon id 83406 the restaurant is open tuesday sunday on tuesdays wednesdays thursdays and sundays they are open from 4 p m to 9 p m on fridays and saturdays they are open from 12 p m to 9 30 p m click here to view their facebook page and like it

realreal real 1 61 have all issued second quarter reports in this episode of marketfoolery host chris hill welcomes motley fool analyst maria gallagher maria analyzes the reports and shares why she

newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and planet fitness wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 this video was recorded on august 10 2021 chris hill it s tuesday august 10th welcome to marketfoolery i m chris hill with me today maria gallagher thanks for being here maria gallagher thanks so much for having me hill we ve got a trio of the second quarter earnings reports and we re going to start with chegg good results from chegg this is the online education company profits and revenue came in higher than expected they also raised guidance for the full fiscal year and shares up around 5 this seems like the right response for the stock when chegg s putting up these numbers and raising their guidance gallagher yeah chegg s actually been a pretty fascinating story to follow it was founded in 2005 it was initially your place to go to for textbook purchases and rentals it was more of a capital intensive and low margin business but then when amazon invaded that textbook category it began to expand its service offerings in 2015 it shifted that strategy away from the textbook business to the higher margin learning category it made a number of acquisitions starting with easybib in 2016 most recently thinkful in 2019 to expand their service offerings i think that chegg is this really interesting example of a turnaround like you said last quarter revenue was up 30 there are a total of 6 6 million chegg services subscribers which is 67 up year over year there are about 19 million chegg platform unique visitors in an average month and 87 of students have heard of a chegg service it has so many offerings it s really shifted its strategy in the past five to 10 years i think it s been really fascinating to watch and it s really going to continue to do well as we see a lot more people who are taking classes in addition to working or trying to shift career paths this is a really useful tool for them hill yes i was talking the other day with jason moser and we talked about how some companies can expand their optionality and others don t and chegg has done a great job of that this is just a sample size of one household but my younger daughter is starting her first year of college this fall my older daughter is turning her last year of college this fall the two of them were talking recently just the older one sharing her experience and everything from the basic things of roommates and just social life on campus when they started talking about classes and textbooks not that i was eavesdropping but the word chegg just came up repeatedly in that conversation the stat you mentioned of 87 of students who have ever heard of chegg that s certainly been my experience as well gallagher yeah chegg study has 66 million step by step solutions about 60 million experts answered questions and answers and six million textbook solutions for really most classes you could be in if you have a textbook i remember when i was in college i used it with my textbook in one of my math classes that i had a hard time with and it was really helpful with those step by step solutions i think that it s just proving to be a helpful addition to a lot of people s needs in education hill i like to think that if chegg were around when i was in college i would ve been a better student but i m not sure that s necessarily the case let s move on to planet fitness i don t have a great sense of this business and their stock i take a little bit of comfort in the fact that wall street appears to be agreeing with me because the stock is basically flat today revenue looks pretty good for planet fitness they were a little lower on profits but this is a quarter where gyms were reopening some memberships were going back up maybe that s a silver lining but now you think about the next three to six months i have a hard time imagining that there s going to be a lot more reopening of gyms and a lot more gym memberships being added but what stands out to you when you look at this quarter and when you think about this business gallagher planet fitness is interesting because it is a franchise business model they have a couple of different revenue streams they have their corporate owned stores they have their franchise stores and then they have the equipment segment if you are a planet fitness franchisee you are required to reup your equipment every five to seven years that s an additional revenue stream for them it s an interesting and a little bit different business model in the past quarter they added 700 000 new members the past six months have been consecutive months of net member growth their total membership is more than 14 8 million and over 98 of their stores are open globally now and so more than 13 million people remained members of planet fitness during the pandemic what s also interesting is that they did shift to a lot of digital strategy they had an app that they tried to really focus on they had a lot of workouts on facebook live and they partnered with a lot of different athletes and different celebrities from the biggest loser actually last month they hired sheryl kaplan as the first ever chief digital officer i think that they are planning at least for a continuation of utilization and i guess we can say an omnichannel experience for fitness you have your app and you can work out at home and you can pay a little bit less for that or you can go into your membership and you can go into the gym you have all of these different offerings whatever your comfort level is with the gym you feel comforted by the planet fitness brand they re still only about halfway to their long term target of 4 000 locations it ll be interesting to see how that can expand in the next couple of years hill it seems like a smart move because certainly there are plenty of people who look at the upfront cost of a peloton any of these in home equipment devices and then services and not everyone can afford those things for planet fitness to say we think there s a market for people who don t want to pay thousands of dollars for a stationary bike we re going to go after it it seems like a smart move you look at the stock it s back where it was in january of 2020 and the previous few years before that was a pretty steady upward trend i still come back to where i started with planet fitness which is like i have no idea where this is going over the next six months gallagher what s interesting it s a totally different business model to peloton but just in terms of the market that it s serving people who are buying pelotons are more likely to be people who are interested in fitness who have already done fitness who already like soulcycle they re people who will spend up or go to boutique fitness classes as opposed to planet fitness is really looking for about 80 of the american population who do not have gym memberships it s supposed to be this non intimidating environment where you come in there s free pizza there s free tootsie rolls it s really more geared toward people who are getting into fitness because they have to because it s good for you they ll go on the treadmill for 20 minutes and then they ll go home it s not really people who are fitness fanatics which is really a much smaller segment of the population that i think peloton and some of those more expensive high end offerings are really geared to a much smaller adjustable market whereas planet fitness really has in my opinion a much bigger market which is just people who workout because it s good for you but they re not that excited about working out and they don t want to spend a lot of money to do it hill the tootsie rolls just cracks me up gallagher i like pizza hill i don t want to assign any malintent but there is a version of that where there s just diabolical thinking at work from some executive at planet fitness we don t want them getting too healthy we don t want them to lose too much weight give them a little candy on the way out the door gallagher i think they re just trying to make people feel ok to say you re doing your best that s what i think you go to planet fitness because you re doing your best it doesn t have to be a crazy workout to just feel a little bit better about yourself hill that s a much more optimistic way to do that thank you for bringing that i mentioned last week it s august people schedules get a little wonky in august this is going to be a short week for us at marketfoolery we re going to be back on monday but in the meantime you can check out industry focus motley fool answers rule breaker investing with david gardner hey check out motley fool money this weekend for an interview that maria did on the topic of investing mindset it is a great interview that s coming on friday well done thank you for doing that gallagher oh thank you hill let s wrap up with the realreal it is a tough day for shareholders of the realreal this is the online consignment business the stock dropped more than 17 this morning after they lost more money than expected revenue was lower than expected if there is a silver lining for the realreal they appear to be doing a good job with getting repeat buyers gallagher yeah i actually really like the realreal what i really admire about them is they really carved out this niche within resale resale is the fastest growing portion of online commerce about 72 of consumers say they ll change their consumption habits in order to minimize impact on the environment you have more interest from gen z and millennials on the resale environment resale s growing fast and that has a lot of competition but then within the resale market the realreal has really carved out a niche for specifically luxury it s higher orders loyal customers and it s vital that they be trusted in their authentication process they have a super high take rate of 34 5 they have 730 000 active buyers and an average order value of about 520 like you said 84 5 of orders are repeat customers so that s what the high value loyal customers additionally this past quarter they opened an authentication center in arizona which is prioritizing this element of their brand to make that more and more pivotal because that is really what differentiates them is that authentication process i really liked seeing that they re focusing on that it was not the best quarter of all time but i do still really like the long term tailwinds and the way that they ve really come back pretty strong in the pandemic they are opening new stores that are gaining more attraction and they re continuing to have high net promoter scores and getting those buyers to spend more and more each time they go on the platform hill the trends that you mentioned in terms of buyers who are looking to minimize the impact on the environment this being the fastest growing segment within the industry do you look at this drop today i mean 17 do you look at this and say this is a buying opportunity for people who believe in this longer term trend gallagher i think so i own the realreal i have owned it for a while it s been quite volatile i think a lot of people don t quite know what to do with it they don t know the long term staying power there have been some problems with their authentication process in the past which is why i like them emphasizing that yeah i think that their long term trajectory is really strong and they ve carved out a really interesting niche within the resale market hill just to put some numbers around the volatility this company has been public for about two years depending on what they were looking at in the last two years it s been as low as 6 it s been as high as 30 it s currently around the 13 5 range after the drop today last question and then i ll let you go this is a 1 billion company they ve got trends on their side they ve gotten margins on their side do you think five years from now this is a stand alone business because this does seem like a business with enough going right for it both in terms of their operations and the overall trend that a larger e commerce player could come in and make them a large offer and they become part of someone else s universe gallagher yeah i think that s a fair guess because you see even trends like etsy recently bought depop which is in the resale market you see a lot of these bigger companies starting to pay attention to this segment of the market the realreal has a very strong brand name associated with it it has really loyal customers it has that very distinct niche within luxury resale i think if i was a bigger company even if i was etsy i would start looking at it and thinking oh wow this is an interesting thing that if you re going to buy it or build it i think this would be something you could buy because it takes a long time to build that customer base and that customer trust hill i know i said one last question but one more based on what you just said it also sounds like that the branding of the realreal is strong enough that if they were to get acquired it would be a mistake let s say it s etsy it would be a mistake for etsy to rebrand it as etsy fashion or etsy luxury just keep it as it is gallagher absolutely yeah hill maria gallagher great talking to you thanks so much for being here gallagher thanks

toronto north american stock markets rebounded friday after a difficult week though the price of oil continued its slide on concerns over the covid 19 delta variant canada s main stock index ended a streak of six straight sessions of losses friday the s p tsx composite index was up 123 66 points at 20 339 02 u s markets also ticked up friday in new york the dow jones industrial average was up 225 96 points at 35 120 08 the s p 500 index was up 35 87 points at 4 441 67 while the nasdaq composite was up 172 87 points at 14 714 66 the improving sentiment was largely due to comments made friday by dallas federal reserve president robert kaplan said manulife investment management chief investment strategist philip peturrson kaplan s comments suggesting he may not be as eager as he once was to see the u s central bank begin scaling back its bond buying program were seen as good news by the equity markets peturrson said the expected tapering of pandemic emergency relief programs by the u s federal reserve had been making investors jittery all week peturrson said largely the week was driven by uncertainty peturrson said uncertainty around the direction of economic strength uncertainty around the potential for taper and today we had a bit more clarity however while stock indexes improved friday oil continued its slide falling to its lowest level since may the october crude oil contract was down us 1 36 at us 62 14 per barrel oil is extremely vulnerable to negative headlines about covid 19 as public health lockdowns anywhere on the globe have a significant impact on fuel demand while oil had risen to a seven year high in july as countries loosened public health restrictions this week s news about surging cases of the delta variant in north america and around the world is dragging it down again peturrson said energy had a great run from the start of the year up until really a couple of weeks ago he said now we re just seeing a bit of a correction the september natural gas contract was up two cents at us 3 85 per mmbtu the december gold contract was up 90 cents at us 1 784 00 an ounce and the september copper contract was up almost 10 cents at us 4 14 a pound peturrson said while weaker than expected economic data this week such as sluggish retail sales figures out of the u s are having an impact on markets it doesn t mean the economy is heading back to 2020 conditions it just means the pace of recovery is slowing right now he said i don t think that means this is it for either the commodities rally or the equity rally peturrson said i think we can see both continue we just have to get past this latest bump in the road this report by the canadian press was first published aug 20 2021
psychedelic wellness is that a thing now what happened i have to admit when i took a look at the declining share prices of marijuana stocks earlier this week and concluded investors in the cannabis sector might be getting worried about the implications of a new bill that would legalize psychedelic drugs in california i half thought i was seeing things jumping at shadows but the evidence really does seem to be adding up toward the conclusion that psychedelics may be following the same path to legalization that marijuana blazed before them investors don t seem to know precisely what to make of this development however in friday trading for example we saw shares of aurora cannabis acb 1 44 close up 3 7 while cannabis stocks like charlotte s web cwbhf 2 40 and green thumb industries gtbif 2 97 headed in the other direction down 2 9 and 3 8 respectively so what all of this happened of course on a pretty slow news day for the marijuana sector but a busy one for psychedelics first and foremost cannabis news source marijuanamoment com spent friday following up on its california story with a new piece describing how portland activists are also pushing to decriminalize psychedelics cultivation gifting and community ceremonies already oregon voters have voted to legalize psilocybin therapy in ballot initiatives but this still leaves some risk of criminalization reports marijuana moment to remedy that residents of portland are urging their local government representatives to pass a law specifically authorizing possession and use of psychedelics and according to the website similar movements are afoot in michigan massachusetts and yes california too hopping aboard this already moving train on thursday stock market news site thefly com interviewed matt stang the ceo of psychedelic wellness company delic holdings stang argued that psychedelic drugs have a role to play to help peoples mental wellness and extolled the huge opportunity for medicinal psychedelics in the course of the interview he also pointed out delic s role in all of this and how it is working really hard to get insurance coverage of psychedelic drugs now what now how does all the above explain the divergent reactions among marijuana stock prices today honestly i m at a loss to explain why aurora cannabis stock is up on today s news the reactions of investors in charlotte s web on the other hand and in green thumb industries are a bit more logical and along the lines of how many investors reacted to the earlier news of california s moves to legalize psychedelics simply put at the same time as marijuana investors are on the cusp of seeing their product legalized at the federal level so that companies and investors in those companies can more easily profit from it we now see the emergence of psychedelic drugs as a potential rival for consumers dollars psychedelics may not be nearly as far along as cannabis on the path to legalization but they do appear to be heading in the same direction i have to imagine that when marijuana investors first set out on this journey this was not the outcome they expected
manhattan cn markets were able to recover some of what they lost during the midweek selloff amid the august doldrums on wall street as investors are almost assured of tapering soon by the federal reserve by the closing of trading on friday the dow jones industrial average had gained 224 points but it was still down nearly 397 points for the week the s p 500 gained 35 points to finish out the week down 27 points while the nasdaq increased 172 on friday but declined 108 for the week on tuesday the markets snapped a five day winning streak and dropped sharply though they recovered somewhat before the closing bell for the day the dow had shed nearly 300 points with the s p 500 and nasdaq seeing similar falls wednesday saw an even greater drop for the dow which lost 383 points the sell off was likely due to the reported drop in retail sales last month with the u s census bureau showing a 1 1 decline in retail sales in july once again auto sales helped lead the drop showing nearly a 4 month over month drop due to the increase in new vehicle prices other areas that saw notable drops in retail spending were sporting goods which fell 1 9 and the 2 6 decrease in clothing the 1 1 month over month fall in retail sales in july could be a sign that the rapid spread of the delta coronavirus variant is convincing some consumers to stay away from public spaces again and is consistent with real consumption growth slowing sharply in the third quarter wrote andrew hunter senior economist at capital economics but hunter also pointed to the 1 7 increase in spending at bars and restaurants and the 3 1 decrease in online sales saying these make it hard to blame the pandemic for shooing people out of the marketplace either way recent data suggest that the spread of the delta variant has driven a renewed plunge in consumer confidence in early august suggesting that retail spending will remain under pressure he wrote overall retail sales are well above what they were during summer 2020 with auto sales up 35 7 year over year the 70 increase in clothing sales and the 30 5 increase in restaurants and bars others say the fall on tuesday and wednesday is part of the typical turbulent august bottom line attendance is light due to the summer holiday volumes are thin and this market remains complacent and vulnerable due to air pockets wrote tom essaye of the sevens report and while that might continue for a few days nothing that s happened makes us suddenly more cautious near term while the news about booster shots being required to combat the delta variant is not good essaye said he also noted that corporate earnings remain solid and expects that investors decisions have already baked in the growing consensus that the federal reserve will begin tapering its bond buying programs later this year according to minutes from the last federal open markets committee meeting last month released this week members are still debating when to start tapering with hawks wanting to do it yesterday and doves eyeing early 2022 while most members believed the fed could begin tapering this year some members stated employment has not yet hit the central bank s employment goals looking ahead according to those minutes most participants noted that provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as they anticipated they judged that it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year because they saw the committee s substantial further progress criterion as satisfied with respect to the price stability goal and as close to being satisfied with respect to the maximum employment goal if current numbers continue the fed may soon hit its goal unemployment claims dipped below 350 000 during the week ending august 14 showing that fewer claims are being filed the numbers elicited a celebratory tweet from president biden who wrote the data reflects the important progress we re making in our economic recovery on friday the u s bureau of labor statistics also reported that unemployment rates were lower in july among 17 states and stable in 33 states with the 5 4 national unemployment rate now half a percentage point lower than june the highest unemployment rate is in nevada which is at 7 7 though it is closely followed by california new mexico and new york nebraska and utah have the lowest rate at 2 3 and 2 6 respectively investors now await the central bank s annual jackson hole symposium next week though some still hold it will be largely a nonevent kevin wong a market analyst at cmc markets wrote that the central bank has well telegraphed its intentions to prepare markets noting the u s treasuries market remains virtually unchanged the last few days while equities have slid the last so called taper tantrum in may 2013 wong wrote was due to then fed chair ben bernanke unexpectedly announcing during a congressional hearing that the central bank would be backing out of markets investors fled on the surprise news and the fed took notice given such adverse and violent reactions seen in the financial markets the fed has learned a lesson not to make or avoid any unexpected announcements on its asset purchase program he wrote adding that a parade of fed officials over the last two months have set the stage for tapering in late 2021 or early 2022 follow nick rummell on twitter

on saturday the first cruise ship will depart from carnival cruise lines long beach terminal marking the return of voyages to the city s harbor after 17 months cruise passengers returning to the city bring with them millions of dollars in economic and fiscal impacts from spending on hotel nights meals and visits to local attractions before and after they embark on carnivals ships the first ship to sail from long beach will be the panorama a 4 008 passenger vessel set to depart on a seven day cruise down the mexican riviera with weekly sailings starting this saturday for its first voyage the ship will be sailing at 75 capacity according to carnival cruise lines chief communications officer chris chiames who said the company expects that number to increase in the coming months there s a very strong demand for the return of cruising chiames said following over 10 billion in losses as a result of a no sail order issued by the centers for disease control in 2020 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus carnival has steadily clawed back bookings and revenues since the beginning of the year in the first quarter bookings were up 90 compared to the last quarter of 2020 before increasing another 45 over the last three months the panorama will be carnival cruise lines eighth ship in a fleet of 24 vessels to return to service following sailings from miami orlando and galveston texas carnival is expecting half of its fleet to return to service by the end of september according to chiames but has not yet announced a return date for its two remaining ships to be homeported in long beach the carnival miracle and radiance ships will be departing from long beach for the first time once sailings commence replacing the significantly smaller inspiration and imagination the new ships have the capacity to bring 1 000 more passengers to long beach that means more patrons for local businesses who serve cruise passengers before they board cruise ships and upon their return allison lesser director of sales and marketing at hotel maya which is located just a half mile away from the cruise terminal on pier h said that while the hotel doesn t specifically track bookings by cruise passengers on a regular basis cruise business has traditionally been a nice base of business for hotel maya now that the cruises are ramping up again starting with panorama this weekend we are looking forward to building back that same base of business lesser said in an email for this upcoming weekend the hotel has received a couple dozen bookings associated with carnival s associated voyage according to lesser tranh ninh owner of the 123 pho restaurant on third street and the promenade in downtown long beach said he d been monitoring the return of cruises to florida to gauge when cruises might come back to long beach as well both on ship staff and cruise passengers created significant revenue for his business before the pandemic shut down cruises in march of last year they d come in with their suitcases ninh said they d be shopping for their next trip and they d come in and eat while he said the amount of revenue associated specifically with cruises was hard to quantify ninh estimates that crew members and passengers brought in an additional 1 000 per week for his restaurant a recent economic impact study by the port of long beach estimated that the 670 000 passengers that came to the city to board carnival s ships in 2017 spent 124 million on local goods and services including meals and lodging with cruises returning after a 17 month hiatus the cruise terminal will also begin creating passenger fee revenues again those fees 4 30 per passenger go into a historic preservation fund that was supposed to be used by former operator urban commons to pay for repairs to the adjacent queen mary urban commons filed for bankruptcy protection this spring and the city has since taken over the lease to the ship which needs millions in repairs before it can reopen the city also took out 23 million in bonds to pay for immediate repairs to the ship in 2016 which was an advance of sorts on passenger fee revenue in a written statement long beach economic development director john keisler said this is a critical source of revenue for the city and it will be used to pay the bonds restarting cruises at the long beach cruise terminal is good for both the city and for the future of the queen mary he said it s not immediately clear how the city plans to pay for repairs to the ship which operates as a hotel and attraction an inspection report in april determined the ship would need at least 23 million in repairs to remain viable in the next two years but for the first time since the pandemic began the city will be getting some revenue from the cruise terminal operations which are a critical tourist draw interest in cruises is picking up with bookings for 2021 and 2022 on track to surpass pre pandemic volumes according to chiames but emergent variants of the coronavirus most recently the delta variant have raised concerns among potential passengers and investors alike after plummeting to 13 17 per share in march of last year carnival corporation s stock had recently made gains again as cruise operations resumed across the country in early june share prices had returned to the 30 range which while still significantly lower than pre pandemic share prices signaled that investors were once again feeling confident in the company s future since then share prices have resumed a downward trend two of the company s three ships to sail from long beach the miracle and the panorama are currently in the cdc s orange and yellow tiers respectively meaning that the agency is monitoring the status of infections and potential infections on board chiames said the company s safety protocols are its best weapon against concerns from passengers and regulators which in turn impact investor confidence we ve built a platform of protocols that are designed to flex up he said of the cruise line s ability to respond to new health and safety related challenges

a train with railcars assembled by china railway rolling stock corp sifang america inc during an in service test run in chicago the u s on may 6 xinhua america s greatest existential threat today is not china it is making china into americaâ s existential threat the war of words launched by the u s over the coronavirus is a sad commentary on the lack of necessary cooperation not to mention a lack of compassion initially for the severity of the epidemic in china in the early months the escalating hostility toward china now so evident in washington will all but ensure a competitive rather than any collaborative search for vital solutions the result will be wasted resources duplicative research insufficient financing and the undermining of international dissemination of advanced green technologies and this is only to note the consequences for coping with just one of humanity s looming crises yet amid all this washington has been gearing up for a full society mobilization against china the looming new superpower that threatens america in u s national security discussions today as well as in congressional and media debates the depiction of china as a frightening new superpower is in reality a reflection of what has so often happened in the past a projection onto china of the dark underside of what american globalism has long been about in the current fear provoking projection china would like the u s be everywhere and into everything its economic might will lead to a domineering chinese centric world order its military might would extend worldwide its drones would be everywhere its ethos would threaten alternatives of all sorts all over the globe but this is a fantasy however useful for those lining up in washington today for greater defense spending and those urging escalating military maneuvers against china china unlike the u s will not have 800 overseas military bases be invading and overthrowing numerous governments or committing regime change actions throughout a large part of the planet as the u s has done for decades why because china is not the u s and the world is not what it was when u s power sought to fashion an american centric world after 1945 the world today is a very different place end of u s centrality the world china entered as it embarked on its great reforms since the late 1970s coincided with a fundamental restructuring of the capitalist world as the u s sought to reconstitute and transform the operations of its global centrality after the viet nam war the u s was at home in a bipolar world its global preeminence was augmented and ideologically sustained by it chinaâ s rise is a â riseâ in a multi polar world a very different world from the one in which the u s envisioned a worldwide american centric ordering of global capitalism amid a bipolar struggle in the immediate post world war ii decades today with china having become the worldâ s largest exporter a financial powerhouse and global investor and a main trading power for a large number of nations throughout the world its example of successful development and ways of governing itself allows for a greater range of alternatives for nations long locked into the embrace of the west the westâ s comprehensive global dominance and its american centric moment are slowly coming to a close as the non western world comes more to the fore washington is finding it has less control less influence in such a world whereas china may prove to be far more at home in it itâ s not that its immediate power is less but its capacity to use it effectively and to control others has changed what washingtonâ s preoccupation with china today significantly does is to filter these global changes through its depictions of a rising china rather than seeing chinaâ s emergence as a part of this rising world as a consequence china becomes the problem not more fundamentally the changing world the u s finds itself in even if china someday becomes the greatest power on the planet as it well might this is not about the country somehow coming to dominate a growing number of determined independent nations and creating a chinese centric world along the lines of a declining american centric pattern indeed chinaâ s belt and road initiative americaâ s attacks on it to the contrary holds promise of being a dynamic step toward furthering a multi polar order not a new form of neo colonialism laying the foundations for an interlocked pan eurasian economic cooperation zone that promises however arduous the challenges to further transform existing global economic and political dynamics new realities what washington still refuses to accept as it has for seven decades is that neither it nor any other power can dominate the world single handedly not only is this about elemental realities of the limits of geopolitical power it entails as well an acceptance that countries have to find their own ways to develop that no all embracing one model exists and as chinaâ s own quest to find viable and effective ways to develop shows what brought china success came to be seen by washington as clashing with its pre eminence and â rules â this globalist policy and the fervent conviction that the centrality of american power is indispensable for world order and the proper â rules basedâ functioning of the global economic system regrettably remains as strong as ever in president joe bidenâ s administration as before it continues to profoundly distort the ability of washingtonâ s national security managers to accurately accept the world as it is today and chinaâ s place in it it motivates washington to see aggressive drives that are in reality often reactive defensive efforts to protect or project quite legitimate rights and more this globalist strategizing repeatedly injects itself into a host of issues a wiser course would have sought to avoid such as the extension of nato to the east or the intricate and extensive involvement of the u s in disputes over the south china sea and various islands rather than discussing the merits of the specific issues washington often weaves them into a complex interactive dynamic of analysis and conviction so that the global big picture overrides specific issues making them all the harder to either resolve or in the u s context to intelligently debate almost every time washingtonâ s credibility is invoked youâ ll find this â big pictureâ descending into each specific issue in ways to muddy the waters so much so that every time american credibility is invoked almost all sensible thinking and strategizing come to a screeching halt the dangers in continuing down this road are obvious in washingtonâ s world an accurate image of china cannot easily emerge and the reasons are analogous to why the u s refuses to accept a multi polar world chinaâ s independence and the efforts of other nations in the south to find their own independent ways strenuous as they may be ultimately are not compatible with washingtonâ s intensely ideological american centric globalism in the end a view of china as part of an emerging multi polar world and not simply as an emerging superpower confronting washington provides a far more accurate context for understanding what has for so long been grossly distorted by americaâ s global agenda in the future there will be no superpower in the american model the needed changes may be coming but washington continues to fiercely resist them it would rather focus on china than the realities of the world it now confronts this

financial measure to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap this non gaap financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to gaap measures such as net loss income or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with gaap rather the company presents this measure as supplemental information because it believes it provides meaningful additional information about the company s performance for the following reasons 1 this measure allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management as management uses this measure to assess the company s operating performance and for financial and operational decision making 2 this measure excludes the impact of items management believes are not directly attributable to the company s core operating performance and may obscure trends in the business and 3 this measure may be used by institutional investors and the analyst community to help analyze the company s business the company s non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate

washington d c some flights by chinese airlines will be limited to 40 percent passenger capacity for four weeks announced the u s transportation department on wednesday after the chinese government imposed similar limits on four american airlines on 6th august china told united airlines it will impose limits after five passengers traveling from san francisco to shanghai allegedly tested positive for covid 19 on 21st july carriers have no means of independently verifying positive test results alleged by chinese authorities and there is no way to establish where or when a traveler may have contracted the virus the transportation department responded united airlines said it was pleased to see this action by the department in pursuit of fairness in this important market meanwhile the chinese embassy in washington declined to comment chinese authorities gave united airlines three options cancel two san francisco to shanghai flights operate two without passengers or operate four flights with a 40 percent passenger capacity limit the limits were subsequently imposed on four united flights from san francisco to shanghai beginning 11th august china s circuit breaker policy violates its air services agreement and places undue culpability on carriers noted the u s government the biden administration said it will impose identical limits on four flights over four weeks affecting air china china eastern airlines china southern airlines and xiamen airlines the limits come as many chinese students are due to travel to the u s for the start of fall classes in april the government eased restrictions on chinese students effective on 1st august in june 2020 the u s threatened to ban chinese passenger flights after beijing did not immediately agree to accept flights by american airlines u s airlines had voluntarily stopped flying to china after the start of the coronavirus pandemic
a train with railcars assembled by china railway rolling stock corp sifang america inc during an in service test run in chicago the u s on may 6 xinhua america s greatest existential threat today is not china it is making china into americaâ s existential threat the war of words launched by the u s over the coronavirus is a sad commentary on the lack of necessary cooperation not to mention a lack of compassion initially for the severity of the epidemic in china in the early months the escalating hostility toward china now so evident in washington will all but ensure a competitive rather than any collaborative search for vital solutions the result will be wasted resources duplicative research insufficient financing and the undermining of international dissemination of advanced green technologies and this is only to note the consequences for coping with just one of humanity s looming crises yet amid all this washington has been gearing up for a full society mobilization against china the looming new superpower that threatens america in u s national security discussions today as well as in congressional and media debates the depiction of china as a frightening new superpower is in reality a reflection of what has so often happened in the past a projection onto china of the dark underside of what american globalism has long been about in the current fear provoking projection china would like the u s be everywhere and into everything its economic might will lead to a domineering chinese centric world order its military might would extend worldwide its drones would be everywhere its ethos would threaten alternatives of all sorts all over the globe but this is a fantasy however useful for those lining up in washington today for greater defense spending and those urging escalating military maneuvers against china china unlike the u s will not have 800 overseas military bases be invading and overthrowing numerous governments or committing regime change actions throughout a large part of the planet as the u s has done for decades why because china is not the u s and the world is not what it was when u s power sought to fashion an american centric world after 1945 the world today is a very different place end of u s centrality the world china entered as it embarked on its great reforms since the late 1970s coincided with a fundamental restructuring of the capitalist world as the u s sought to reconstitute and transform the operations of its global centrality after the viet nam war the u s was at home in a bipolar world its global preeminence was augmented and ideologically sustained by it chinaâ s rise is a â riseâ in a multi polar world a very different world from the one in which the u s envisioned a worldwide american centric ordering of global capitalism amid a bipolar struggle in the immediate post world war ii decades today with china having become the worldâ s largest exporter a financial powerhouse and global investor and a main trading power for a large number of nations throughout the world its example of successful development and ways of governing itself allows for a greater range of alternatives for nations long locked into the embrace of the west the westâ s comprehensive global dominance and its american centric moment are slowly coming to a close as the non western world comes more to the fore washington is finding it has less control less influence in such a world whereas china may prove to be far more at home in it itâ s not that its immediate power is less but its capacity to use it effectively and to control others has changed what washingtonâ s preoccupation with china today significantly does is to filter these global changes through its depictions of a rising china rather than seeing chinaâ s emergence as a part of this rising world as a consequence china becomes the problem not more fundamentally the changing world the u s finds itself in even if china someday becomes the greatest power on the planet as it well might this is not about the country somehow coming to dominate a growing number of determined independent nations and creating a chinese centric world along the lines of a declining american centric pattern indeed chinaâ s belt and road initiative americaâ s attacks on it to the contrary holds promise of being a dynamic step toward furthering a multi polar order not a new form of neo colonialism laying the foundations for an interlocked pan eurasian economic cooperation zone that promises however arduous the challenges to further transform existing global economic and political dynamics new realities what washington still refuses to accept as it has for seven decades is that neither it nor any other power can dominate the world single handedly not only is this about elemental realities of the limits of geopolitical power it entails as well an acceptance that countries have to find their own ways to develop that no all embracing one model exists and as chinaâ s own quest to find viable and effective ways to develop shows what brought china success came to be seen by washington as clashing with its pre eminence and â rules â this globalist policy and the fervent conviction that the centrality of american power is indispensable for world order and the proper â rules basedâ functioning of the global economic system regrettably remains as strong as ever in president joe bidenâ s administration as before it continues to profoundly distort the ability of washingtonâ s national security managers to accurately accept the world as it is today and chinaâ s place in it it motivates washington to see aggressive drives that are in reality often reactive defensive efforts to protect or project quite legitimate rights and more this globalist strategizing repeatedly injects itself into a host of issues a wiser course would have sought to avoid such as the extension of nato to the east or the intricate and extensive involvement of the u s in disputes over the south china sea and various islands rather than discussing the merits of the specific issues washington often weaves them into a complex interactive dynamic of analysis and conviction so that the global big picture overrides specific issues making them all the harder to either resolve or in the u s context to intelligently debate almost every time washingtonâ s credibility is invoked youâ ll find this â big pictureâ descending into each specific issue in ways to muddy the waters so much so that every time american credibility is invoked almost all sensible thinking and strategizing come to a screeching halt the dangers in continuing down this road are obvious in washingtonâ s world an accurate image of china cannot easily emerge and the reasons are analogous to why the u s refuses to accept a multi polar world chinaâ s independence and the efforts of other nations in the south to find their own independent ways strenuous as they may be ultimately are not compatible with washingtonâ s intensely ideological american centric globalism in the end a view of china as part of an emerging multi polar world and not simply as an emerging superpower confronting washington provides a far more accurate context for understanding what has for so long been grossly distorted by americaâ s global agenda in the future there will be no superpower in the american model the needed changes may be coming but washington continues to fiercely resist them it would rather focus on china than the realities of the world it now confronts this

water was so high it had to be a boat they couldn t get to me otherwise i can t open some of the bottom drawers from the i guess the wood expanded and that s it and it smells now and i don t know why should open the windows more that s the waterline yeah look at that it s a it s just a devastating situation for people i mean and you don t get any helpful insurance company because they told us they don t cover it if it come if water comes from the outside well what do you cover i want to know see i have my amazing employees in here cleaning up oh my brother came racing over here had the park about half a mile away he got to the building had to wade through the water kind of like half swam here and then when he got here our freezers have been lifted up inside throwing throwing on its back one freezer was lifted and on it upside down against the back door so he couldn t even get in he just started sending pictures to us and then i raised over here my dad raised over here my older brother came and we kind of looked at all the damage and said well this isn t good so we might as well start cleaning up the other side yeah advertisement cleanup begins in soggy northeast as henri plods back to sea share copy link copy residents across the waterlogged northeast began clearing mud and tearing out sodden carpets monday after deluges dropped by tropical storm henri whose remnants threatened further flooding in new england as the system made a slow trek back to the sea the smell of sewage filled the air as residents of rossmoor a retirement community in central new jersey s monroe township returned to soaked homes and ruined possessions after henri turned their streets into rivers roseann and john kiernan said they d have to likely toss their appliances tear up walls and carpets and replace their car after their house filled with nearly 2 feet of water on sunday this is what we were left with nothing nothing lamented roseann kiernan they told us that everything has to go a few miles away from monroe the whirring of portable pumps split the air on the main street in jamesburg another hard hit new jersey community luke becker who operates the four boys ice cream stand along with his three brothers one of six the family owns said nearly 4 feet of water rushed into the shop dislodging a tall cooler and leaving 3 inches of mud behind we were initially hoping to be back open by labor day but now it looks like we ve got to go through all the plumbing and rip out a ton of electrical because we don t know how much of that was affected he said right now there s really no timetable new jersey gov phil murphy toured the storm ravaged towns monday which remained under a flood warning until midnight henri spared coastal areas of new york and new england major damage when its center made landfall sunday in rhode island but its size and slow speed led to deluges in areas from maine to pennsylvania on monday henri s remnants now considered a post tropical cyclone were moving eastward over new england at a leisurely 9 mph but were expected to accelerate later prompting flood watches or warnings across swaths of the northeast in the catskills region of new york hunter town supervisor daryl legg believed his mountain community which was devastated by tropical storm irene in 2011 would be able to weather the slow moving storm i think we escaped any kind of danger so far only because of the length of time it took for the storm to move through he said this has been a 24 hour period so it s not really the same storm thank goodness but downpours flooding and even tornadoes were still possible in new england where officials fretted that just a few more inches would be a back breaker following a summer of record rainfall the ground is so saturated with water that every inch of rain creates immediate floods and flash floods connecticut gov ned lamont said monday after seeing damage in the community of canterbury where nearly every home lost power sunday amid heavy winds no deaths have been attributed to henri but thousands remained without power across the region as crews scrambled to remove toppled trees and power lines through

firefighters said they helped evacuate 18 homes and made several rescues after henri dumped about 5 inches of rain it was a tragedy that this happened because the people who live here are people who can ill afford to live anywhere else said landry a 72 year old retiree whose second floor home was spared in central new jersey dolores hebert was still shaken monday after being ferried to safety by boat with her dog and cat as 8 inches of rain fell and water surged through the streets in rossmoor i was sleeping and when i woke up it was up to my knees the 76 year old said as she stood by a front

between 1966 and 1970 the igbos of nigeria were at the receiving end of one of the most heinous man s inhumanity to man in human history apart from hitler s second world war of 1939 to 1945 no war has claimed as much casualty as the biafra civil war since the history of man the war that was estimated to have claimed about five million lives had the igbos as recipients of more than 80 of the casualty figure wars had been fought before and after the nigeria biafra civil war both locally and internationally but why the biafra war will continue to dominate discourse is the manner which the war was prosecuted and the policies initiated by the nigeria state during and after the war to keep the igbos perpetually defeated and never to rise again to challenge or assert their right and how the igbos refused to be crushed rather they bounced back with pomp and pageantry to become the envy of their supposed conquerors thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe the war was waged at all fronts with an evil intent to annihilate and subjugate the igbos to nothing while yakubu gowon a northern army general was leading the onslaught with the most sophisticated lethal military hardware from soviet russia and great britain from the front awolowo a leader of the yorubas and federal minister of finance and vice chairman of the federal executive military council was using hunger through his economic blockade as weapon to finish off whatever that is remaining of the igbos that could not die by the bombs and bullets awolowo at the behest of his principal gowon introduced economic blockade against the igbos and justified it as a veritable instrument of warfare after 3 years of resistance three years of dearth 3 years of death 3 years of kwashiorkor scenery three years of mixture of joy of freedom from oppression and unprovoked mayhem by strange people and pang of hunger and wide scale dearth the igbos could not stomach to carry on the war of freedom and they yielded their leader general ojukwu left the scene having exhausted all resources available at his disposal both human and material the war was over at least from the point of shooting and killing by soldiers as the economic aspect of the war led by awolowo aimed at crippling the igbo s entrepreneurial domineering spirit still continued till date the economic war has been more like a baton in a relay race in which one administration hands over the baton of harsh economic measures against the igbos to another administration whether it is a civilian or military to continue the state policies of exclusion and divide and rule as much as many people have tried to justified the pogrom against the igbos that resulted to the war as a reaction to the nzeogwu s coup that claimed the lives of sardauna of sokoto tafawa balewa akintola and many more and ended the first the balewa azikiwe regime but the truth remains that the war was borne out of envy aimed at crushing the igbos and relegate them to the background of activities in nigeria where they will only be taking orders and not issuing gowon admitted this in an interview in january 2020 that the fear of domination is what caused the war at the beginning of the war awolowo being the federal minister of finance changed the country s currency this change of currency was targeted to frustrate the igbos from using the little money at their disposal to access forex for either weapon or food from international community in an interview after the war ojukwu admitted that two things that defeated biafra during the war one was the currency change the other was hunger occasioned by the draconian economic blockade imposed on the east by gowon and awolowo at the end of war in 1970 awolowo announced that every igbo man with identifiable account deposit in any nigeria bank prior to the outbreak of hostility would be issued 20 in exchange of whatever amount they had in their accounts prior to the war this simply implies that the igbos came out of the war to be integrated into nigeria with nothing to compete with but they carried on with resilience that saw them through the war era by 1972 yakubu gowon and awolowo initiated and carried out a national indigenization policy this was a program in which foreign company operating in nigeria were mandated through the policy of the state to sell certain percentages of their company s worth to nigerians recall the igbos just came out of the war two years earlier and had no means to participate in the indigenization program the northerners especially the hausa fulani stock due to their deficiency in education and conservative mindset could not participate in the program as much awolowo rallied every yoruba man to key into the program the campaign was massive in the west they were sensitized in churches mosques and market places they had the means and their leader was the initiator and head of the indigenization program this is how the yorubas bought 80 of the corporate organizations in nigeria meant for all nigerians there was a lore in the 1970 s 1980 s and early 2000 s that there are two powers in nigeria the political power and economic powers and that while the hausa fulani controls the polical power the yoruba controls the economic power by implications the igbos controls nothing the igbo however carried on with the struggle of survival they were in every hamlet in all rural villages in nigeria scavenging for survival in the farm market cottage industries and any field humans can find existence possible those of them with the enough fund traveled abroad to continue the struggle of survival going back to school was not practically possible since survival is the first law of nature the east central state had the least number of children in school there was a massive unplanned unsolicited unprecedented mentorship program in igbo land then tagged onye aghala nwanne ya which translates let no one leaves his brother behind as the name implies they developed love for themselves and became more united they would mentor themselves on different lines of business and trades those of them that were well established would go to the villages in igbo land negotiate with the parents and guidance of unemployed youths and out of school children to groom and mentor them for a specified number of years usually 6 or 7 years at the end of which they establish them to start their own those apprentices of 70 s are the ubas ibetos innocenes and many more captains of industries in igbo land today this is the secret of how the igbos regained their number one position and dominated every sector of business trade industry and transportation in nigeria till date fast forward to 2008 the global economic meltdown came and badly affected the macro economy of the world such that many corporations went bankrupt those that survived could not pay their shareholders the mouthwatering dividends they used to this is how the yorubas lost their grip on the economic power the global economy power pendulum swings to the micro sector that is dominated by the igbos in nigeria the chinese and the americans at the global stage from 2008 and 2020 the igbos have staged a dramatic comeback to be a race of firsts in every sector the education they couldn t acquire in the 70 s their children are setting the pace now from 2008 till date the south east have the highest number of children in primary and post primary school level the highest number of university applicants and highest number of graduates in 2002 audu ogbeh the then national chairman of pdp in a lecture to the northern elders forum in highlighting the pace the igbos have set in education and why the north need to brace up to bridge the gap or be slaves to the more educated igbos forever said that statistics from j a m b office shows that university applicants from imo state alone is more than fifty percent of the applicants of the 19 northern states put together just last year the nysc director general said that fifty five percent of serving youth corps members nationwide were from the south east zone alone this is an eloquent testimony that education is expensive and only the rich can afford it onitsha in anambra state has the highest concentration of high rise buildings in nigeria nnewi is a town built from the scratch in to an industrial hub by her indigenes without any government s fund today nnewi boasts of big industrial concerns as chikason group ogbuawa ibeto group of companies innocene curtix electrical and many more too numerous to mention according to forbes s magazine anambra state has the highest number of millionaires in nigeria and the southeast has the least poverty rate in the country today igbo land is the most evenly developed in nigeria of all lands

kuala lumpur malaysia hearing the voice of her dead grandmother inside her head is the icing on a cake of problems for malaysian zillennial jessamyn theo ah ma has come back from the afterlife to nudge jess into helping the black water sister a resentful chinese goddess just as the us born malaysian chinese jess moves with her parents to their native penang island in northwestern malaysia the fact that jess is jobless and that they are all living off the generosity of relatives she barely knows does not make adapting to the new and more conservative asian society any easier especially when she has yet to come out as a lesbian the premise of black water sister the latest novel from award winning london based and petaling jaya born writer zen cho makes for a groundbreaking cocktail of fantasy and urban realism set in contemporary penang an unusual setting for malaysian works of fiction in english which are most often set in the country s past zen cho is something of a rarity a marvellous teller of stories who manages to combine an understanding of southeast asian culture and language malaysia particularly with an appreciation of the modern 21st century concerns of science fiction and fantasy jonathan strahan an award winning australian editor and publisher of science fiction fantasy and horror at tor com and the landmark american fantastic fiction magazine locus told al jazeera her most recent novel black water sister is perhaps the best example of this a queer young woman returns from living in the us with her parents to try to navigate the space between being a malaysian who grew up in san francisco and is now trying to be part of the world she left behind it s fascinating because we see the genuine tensions between two cultures approaching the same issue in different ways both shown respectfully and thoughtfully and in a very human way a world in transition cho who divides her time between writing fiction and practising as a lawyer in the united kingdom has already won a number of awards including a prestigious hugo for her work and was a 2013 finalist in the astounding award for best new writer of science fiction and fantasy her books have been translated into languages including french spanish chinese and japanese she says her main inspiration for black water sister was investigating the syncretic chinese religious tradition in which she grew up which combines gods and influences from buddhism taoism and folk beliefs my family moved to america when i was a small child returning to malaysia after a year or so and initially we lived in penang cho told al jazeera about her choice of location i m just really attached to penang it s one of my favourite places in the world for all its history it s a very modern city and so many of the contradictions of modern life are laid bare there my parents were quite superstitious so they never explained too much about what it was all about when we visited temples and paid our respects for fear of running afoul of some taboo or other she said it was only when cho came across the work of anthropologist jean debernardi as an adult that she was finally able to put the beliefs of her childhood in context debernardi visited penang in the 1980s to undertake research into chinese popular religion and spirit mediumship and her books especially the way that lives in the heart 2011 are so rich and fascinating once i read them i knew i d write a novel about this topic cho said having fast developing penang as its main setting black water sister inevitably deals with themes of transition and change after being awarded a joint unesco world heritage listing with the southern malaysian city of melaka in 2008 penang s main city of george town started gentrifying to meet the needs of an ever increasing number of visitors and was preparing to welcome eight million tourists when covid 19 brought the industry to a sudden halt the emphasis on commercial development however was to the detriment of the very same living heritage that convinced unesco to declare the city a unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in east and southeast asia in the first place it s almost impossible to think of penang without thinking about gentrification so that s one of the themes that found its way into the book said cho who believes that time necessarily changes things penang has soul but equally if traditions don t survive it s often partly because they no longer serve the evolving needs of the community a place like penang is not a museum it s a place where people live so it s going to change because people don t stay the same three generations nothing exemplifies how penang s traditions have changed over time better than black water sister s trinity of female characters like a time travelling russian doll jess s mind simultaneously contains her own present but also the recent and more ancient past of her grandmother and the angry goddess her grandma adores one of black water sister s major themes is that who you are depends on where and when you are cho said to al jazeera jess already knows this as an immigrant a returnee a closeted lesbian ah ma and the black water sister serve to illustrate that theme from what the reader learns about ah ma she is no less clever or determined than jess but her life was completely different because she was born at a time and into a culture in which women were not valued so she s illiterate she was married off young to an abusive man she had to do these shitty jobs to survive said cho the black water sister represents an even worse paradigm in time it was her society s cruelty and indifference to women that killed her jess contends with the burden of these women s trauma but though they have supernatural powers she has resources and capabilities they lack because as a 21st century woman born to parents who thought it was important that she be safe and happy and educated she has privileges the other two lacked said cho one of jess s privileges is also being able to come to terms with her nonconformist sexuality in the united states rather than in majority muslim and more conservative malaysia in the real world talk of strengthening penalties against lgbtq malaysians earlier this year underscored the state s continued hostility towards anyone outside the mainstream at the end of june a government task force proposed amendments to sharia islamic law in response to social media posts celebrating pride month so that users could be targeted for allegedly insulting islam by promoting the lgbtq lifestyle but in cho s fictional world unconventional lgbtq characters are the norm she wrote people of colour and homosexual protagonists in both her two successful historical fantasy novels set in regency london sorcerer to the crown 2015 and the true queen 2019 and also in her wuxia novella the order of the pure moon reflected in water 2020 wuxia is a type of chinese historical fiction focused on the adventures of martial artists aside from being marginalised and rendered vulnerable lgbtiq malaysians also find themselves minoritised said joseph n goh a senior lecturer in gender studies at monash university kuala lumpur and author of books such as becoming a malaysian trans man gender society body and faith 2020 they are spoken at and spoken for they are never treated as equal conversation partners and their stories are hardly ever told any written work about lgbtiq malaysians that is holistic affirming and celebratory is always welcome in terms of this peculiar choice of characters cho believes that diversity is a fact of life and that the reason why some types of people are more commonly seen in the literature and media distributed worldwide is a result of power imbalances with deep historical roots but it s not inherently more natural to write a story about a straight white man than about a straight black man or a queer asian woman said cho i think that the united states and the uk s publishing is growing more aware of the importance of inclusivity though it has a long way to go when asked if publishing black water sister in malaysia could have proved more challenging cho says that almost no local publishers release english language novels i suppose if i had nonetheless managed to find a local publisher or self published the book some bookshops might then have refused to stock it cho said to al jazeera she remembers that a major malaysian bookshop chain refused to stock a local anthology containing one of her short stories because it featured lesbians if the book had become popular despite that it might have attracted enough mainstream attention to get censored or pulled off the shelves by the authorities but when you write in english in malaysia you re already limiting yourself to a niche audience so you can fly under the radar somewhat it s not like having a queer friendly plotline in a prime time malay drama she said cho who also edited a malaysian anthology of english language fiction titled cyberpunk malaysia 2015 believes that the current malaysian english writing scene is cut out from our history because influential early works by malaysian authors like lloyd fernando and k s maniam are relatively inaccessible compared with the widely available imported classics of international anglo american literature but the scene is growing and the prospects are good said cho what i d like to see is more authors based in malaysia and more non chinese authors getting published internationally
as farmers settled in for the winter late last fall agrometeorologists were already looking ahead with worry to the 2021 growing season after a pair of dry years the typical fall recharge of ground moisture had failed to materialize and they realized that the stage was being set for a major challenge the following year the late fall is the period when we typically expect the soil moisture to recharge timi ojo agriculture meteorology specialist for manitoba agriculture and resource development told the co operator recently it s the period when we don t have plants growing in the field and the soil is absorbing precipitation advertisement read also bottle buildings to classic spires historical churches a trip back in local history visits to old churches can provide an intriguing day trip for anyone interested in local history and spring is a that period and the winter snowpack and associated spring run off is critical for crops in manitoba because even in the best years moisture is almost always a key factor in limiting yield ojo said even in a normal year the amount of precipitation we receive in the growing season isn t enough to meet crop water demand he said wheat and canola for example typically have a two to four inch crop water deficit that s a universal truth for many things that are dependent on precipitation in the province and it makes a drought like the one we re currently experiencing a damaging event with long lasting impact widespread effects this year s drought is particularly devastating because it s both prolonged and acute according to trevor hadwen an agroclimate specialist with agriculture and agri food canada in regina there s been a generally dry cycle for the past several years he explained and that s been aggravated by the extremely hot and extremely dry conditions this growing season which added what s known as a flash drought into the equation essentially what we have right now is a drought within a drought hadwen said it s created a situation so bad that it s been drawing comparisons to some of the worst droughts that the region has ever seen years like 1936 1961 and 1988 those are fair albeit imperfect comparisons hadwen says but unlike some of the more recent droughts like 1988 this one is made worse by its widespread effects in 1988 the drought affected alberta saskatchewan and parts of manitoba hadwen said today the effects are much more widespread everything basically from northwestern ontario to tofino on the western coast of vancouver island is in drought he said that makes it much more difficult to manage the effects of the drought in 1988 for example producers didn t have to go too far afield to find feed sources or places where they could ship their livestock to graze but today those options simply don t exist there are other sources out there but they won t be easy to source the canadian federation of agriculture for example is trying to organize hay shipments from the maritimes where abundant production exists and hadwen personally remembers hay shipments coming in from as far afield as texas during other very dry years advertisement it s not unprecedented but it s certainly not normal hadwen said it s very costly and the work to get it here is immense hadwen says there have been some unprecedented moves that have been made this year that lend some insight into the scope of the challenge for example the federal tax deferral program was triggered in june this year for much of manitoba months ahead of when a decision might have ordinarily been expected long shadow another reason this is a drought that will be remembered it its long lasting impacts advertisement it s fuelled an epic forest fire season that s blanketed much of western canada in smoke for weeks on end rivers and streams have run dry and soil moisture levels have fallen season after season as lack of rainfall crop water demands and evapotranspiration have taken their inevitable toll ojo says that here in manitoba that s been an established pattern since the 2017 growing season for much of the province 2016 was the last year they ve seen a great dump of precipitation of the type of slow and steady accumulation that can recharge soil moisture the 2017 season was ok great even in parts of the province but that s because it was relying on the moisture reserve from 2016 he said in every year since then we have seen the soil continue to dry down in every successive year advertisement as this pressure has built so have the effects of the drought hadwen noted that typically a drought is something that s seen as an agricultural problem here in canada but this year the effects are being seen far and wide and well past the farm gate trees are dying back in farm shelterbelts and urban boulevards alike drinking water sources are under pressure in many areas backcountry camping has been banned in manitoba and fire bans blanket most of the province a manitoba ski hill holiday mountain near la riviere even cancelled its upcoming season citing lack of water to create artificial snow that might not seem like much but to me it was really telling as to how severe this drought is hadwen said ordinarily there would be plenty of opportunity to get enough precipitation in the fall but they ve looked at the situation and come to the realization there s no reasonable expectation they will get enough water cattle producers are probably the group that will feel the effects for the longest in the agriculture sector once the costs are all totalled advertisement for example producers are seeing long lasting impacts on their grazing land many of them are diverse polycultures and during drought times some plant species all but disappear and won t magically reappear after a bit of rain for those lands there will be a five year window where there are different plant population progressions before it becomes as productive as it was before the drought hadwen said things take time to recover advertisement then there s the cost of the management decisions livestock operators are forced to make faced with little feed and scant water supplies they re being forced to cull and liquidate herds cutting into their prime breeding stock see story on page 6 when the drought does break those producers will face the unenviable and no doubt expensive task of rebuilding their genetics slow recovery just as the drought took time to build the recovery from it won t be an overnight event advertisement ojo was at the glenlea research station south of winnipeg earlier this summer he noted deep cracking going down at least 2 1 2 feet that sort of moisture deficit will take more than a rain here and there to recover from he said what s needed is the sort of deep soaking rains that seem to have become rarer in recent years the sort of rain we had in the last few days that creates something called preferential flow in heavy clay soils ojo said speaking august 11 following about an inch of rain over the previous two days it s filling the holes that are made by the cracks but at the end of the day you re not going to have uniform soaking what we need are three four even five days of very good soaking precipitation that will fill the cracks help the clay to swell again having as much rain but over a shorter period wouldn t help as much that sort of rain will fall ojo said but it s impossible to say when only that the weather will eventually slip into a wetter cycle once again at some point we ll get through this cycle and be back to normal and even excess moisture ojo said it always goes in a cycle but even when the rain does return western canada will be left with the lingering effects to work through hadwen says public attention tends to move on quickly after the drought and he s already been fielding questions about whether the drought is over because of that recent rainfall it isn t even when we get back to normal moisture and erase that water deficit the effects will linger he said trees still died and won t grow back overnight pastures are still damaged herd genetics will be gone and the cattle sector will need to build up herds again the impacts will be long lasting from this drought for more content related to drought management visit the dry times where you can find a collection of stories from our family of publications

by martin armstrong it is time to pull the kids out of any college that is demanding vaccines and imposing punitive fines this demonstrates that such universities and private schools are incompetent of teaching when all they do is promote the narrative without any original thought nearly 50 of those in hospitals have already been vaccinated and are typically overweight or have diabetes students at connecticut s quinnipiac university are to be fined up to 2 275 and lose internet access if they fail to comply with the university s covid 19 vaccination policies quinnipiac university is known as a left wing private liberal arts college in new haven it is obviously teaching only propaganda if we look at their policy of vaccines for a disease that has a lethal aspect of less than 1 the most important thing any university can teach is how to think this is what is seriously missing from education moreover it is rare outside of law or medicine that anyone ever does what they went to school for even john maynard keynes did not have a degree in economics so what is the point of spending all this money on degrees that end up worthless anyway in the last lion about churchill written by william manchester we find a passage that is on point regarding the problem we face with formal education clearly there was something odd here winston davidson had conceded was the ablest boy in his form he was in fact remarkable his grasp of history was outstanding yet he was considered a hopeless pupil it occurred to no one that the fault might lie not in the boy but in the school samuel butler defined genius as a supreme capacity for getting its possessors into trouble of all kinds and it is ironic that geniuses are likeliest to be misunderstood in classrooms studies at the university of chicago and the university of minnesota have found that teachers smile on children with high iqs and frown upon those with creative minds intelligent but uncreative students accept conformity never rebel and complete their assignments with dispatch and to perfection the creative child on the other hand is manipulative imaginative and intuitive he is likely to harass the teacher he is regarded as wild naughty silly undependable lacking in seriousness or even promise his behavior is dis tracting he doesn t seem to be trying he gives unique answers to banal questions touching off laughter among the other children e paul torrance of minnesota found that 70 percent of pupils rated high in creativ ity were rejected by teachers picking a special class for the intellectually gifted the goertzels concluded that a stanford study of genius under which teachers selected bright children would have excluded churchill edison picasso and mark twain id p 158 159 our children are being taught propaganda i have told the story of how my school required me to read galbraith s great crash only when i bought a copy of herbert hoover s memoirs in an antique book store in london did i realize that everything i was taught in economics and history class was outright wrong and to a large extent socialist propaganda hoover had all the letters between heads of state going back and forth because in 1931 there was a sovereign debt crisis with most countries permanently defaulting on their national debts you can buy many of the bonds on ebay nowhere in class or in galbraith s great crash was there ever a single word about how governments defaulted and that is what made the great depression so great you can take the stock market down 70 but you will not create depression as we have witnessed every time since but wipe out the bond market where capital at least 10 1 v equities and the economy cannot be sustained but to teach that simple fact in school means that government was the culprit not corporations and the rich in fact when the senate subpoenaed all the high flying rich dudes in the stock market back in 1930 none of them were short and all lost money see greatest bull

collision with the american federation of teachers aft and the cdc the emails exposed how the bureaucracy of this teachers union was lobbying the cdc to roll back its school reopening guidelines so they did not have to go back to work they insisted that the cdc add language recommending that schools continue to provide telework and virtual teaching opportunities rather than classrooms the aft also requested that the cdc add a coronavirus variant closing metric that would revise the cdc s greenlight for in person instruction at any level of community transmission the teachers union wanted to transform education to virtual teaching insisting that the cdc reinstate lockdown measures in the event of any new coronavirus variants welcome to the real corruption behind the curtain we have quinnipiac university threatening a virtual 10 surcharge as a claimed fine if not vaccinated and cutting off of all virtual access if not vaccinated it is time to look closely at the schools and withdraw children from these schools that are only teaching half truths and propaganda what other teachers said about their students einstein munich schoolmaster wrote in albert einstein s school

this was up to here yesterday they re taking out the refrigerator they picked up the fluids a nightmare this is a total nightmare what happened was about 20 after five we um my little dog she was crying i bent down to pick her up and she was saturated by a little about 20 after six we had water over our kneecaps it was awful i woke up in the morning and the water was up to my ankles and through the whole house and as time went on it got up to my knees so i didn t know what to do i panicked we saw the boats outside the boat came and got me my dog my cat and uh put a vest on me the water was so high it had to be a boat they couldn t get to me otherwise i can t open some of the bottom drawers from the i guess the wood expanded and that s it and it smells now and i don t know why should open the windows more that s the waterline yeah look at that it s a it s just a devastating situation for people i mean and you don t get any helpful insurance company because they told us they don t cover it if it come if water comes from the outside well what do you cover i want to know see i have my amazing employees in here cleaning up oh my brother came racing over here had the park about half a mile away he got to the building had to wade through the water kind of like half swam here and then when he got here our freezers have been lifted up inside throwing throwing on its back one freezer was lifted and on it upside down against the back door so he couldn t even get in he just started sending pictures to us and then i raised over here my dad raised over here my older brother came and we kind of looked at all the damage and said well this isn t good so we might as well start cleaning up the other side yeah advertisement cleanup begins in soggy northeast as henri plods back to sea share copy link copy residents across the waterlogged northeast began clearing mud and tearing out sodden carpets monday after deluges dropped by tropical storm henri whose remnants threatened further flooding in new england as the system made a slow trek back to the sea the smell of sewage filled the air as residents of rossmoor a retirement community in central new jersey s monroe township returned to soaked homes and ruined possessions after henri turned their streets into rivers roseann and john kiernan said they d have to likely toss their appliances tear up walls and carpets and replace their car after their house filled with nearly 2 feet of water on sunday this is what we were left with nothing nothing lamented roseann kiernan they told us that everything has to go a few miles away from monroe the whirring of portable pumps split the air on the main street in jamesburg another hard hit new jersey community luke becker who operates the four boys ice cream stand along with his three brothers one of six the family owns said nearly 4 feet of water rushed into the shop dislodging a tall cooler and leaving 3 inches of mud behind we were initially hoping to be back open by labor day but now it looks like we ve got to go through all the plumbing and rip out a ton of electrical because we don t know how much of that was affected he said right now there s really no timetable new jersey gov phil murphy toured the storm ravaged towns monday which remained under a flood warning until midnight henri spared coastal areas of new york and new england major damage when its center made landfall sunday in rhode island but its size and slow speed led to deluges in areas from maine to pennsylvania on monday henri s remnants now considered a post tropical cyclone were moving eastward over new england at a leisurely 9 mph but were expected to accelerate later prompting flood watches or warnings across swaths of the northeast in the catskills region of new york hunter town supervisor daryl legg believed his mountain community which was devastated by tropical storm irene in 2011 would be able to weather the slow moving storm i think we escaped any kind of danger so far only because of the length of time it took for the storm to move through he said this has been a 24 hour period so it s not really the same storm thank goodness but downpours flooding and even tornadoes were still possible in new england where officials fretted that just a few more inches would be a back breaker following a summer of record rainfall the ground is so saturated with water that every inch of rain creates immediate floods and flash floods connecticut gov ned lamont said monday after seeing damage in the community of canterbury where nearly every home lost power sunday amid heavy winds no deaths have been attributed to henri but thousands remained without power across the region as crews scrambled to remove toppled trees and power lines through monday president joe biden has declared disasters in massachusetts rhode island vermont and connecticut opening the purse strings for federal recovery aid to those states annette landry a resident of manchester connecticut a hartford suburb some 40 miles inland hoped monday s rains wouldn t be a repeat of the deluge that left three units in her condo complex under a few inches of water sunday firefighters said they helped evacuate 18 homes and made several rescues after henri dumped about 5 inches of rain it was a tragedy that this happened because the people who live here are people who can ill afford to live anywhere else said landry a 72 year old retiree whose second floor home was spared in central new jersey dolores hebert was still shaken monday after being ferried to safety by boat with her dog and cat as 8 inches of rain fell and water surged through the streets in rossmoor i was sleeping and when i woke up it was up to my knees the 76 year old said as she stood by a front door bearing 18 inch high watermarks i didn t know what to do i panicked ___associated press writers dave collins in hartford connecticut michael hill in albany and philip marcelo in boston

positive for the genetics expected to indicate responsiveness to ad04 our confidence in the market potential of ad04 is bolstered by this apparent confirmation of the percentage of the population with the target genetics we estimate the market potential for ad04 to be in excess of 36 billion in the u s alone and we are evaluating marketing and distribution channel partners in the united states and abroad mr stilley continued due to increased demand for entry into the study near the end of our trial recruitment period we still have additional patients that have been genetically screened as positive for enrollment in the study but have not yet been enrolled in onward with this opportunity to rapidly enroll additional patients to increase the statistical power of the trial and we have

the u s district court for the northern district of california applying california law has held that under a duty to defend policy an insurer was required to pay defense costs incurred in a lawsuit where the lawsuit contained both covered and uncovered claims stem inc v scottsdale ins co 2021 wl 3271265 n d cal july 30 2021 the insured a technology company sought coverage under its directors and officers policy for a shareholder lawsuit 2017 lawsuit based on a 2013 stock financing round 2013 stock financing and a 2017 loan to the company by a member of the board of directors 2017 loan the court concluded that the interrelated wrongful act exclusion barred coverage for the 2013 stock financing claim but that coverage was available for the 2017 loan claim because it did not relate back to an earlier dispute the insured then moved for partial summary judgment on the measure of damages the insured argued that pursuant to the insurer s duty to defend the insurer was required to cover all defense costs incurred in the 2017 lawsuit even though the lawsuit contained both covered and uncovered claims the insurer argued that the court should apply the policy s allocation provision to cover only defense costs related to the 2017 loan the court held that the insurer was required to cover defense costs incurred for the entire 2017 lawsuit the court reasoned that even if an allocation provision applies where there is a duty to defend in the instant matter there was not undeniable evidence of the allocability of specific expenses because the 2017 awsuit is ongoing and the insured had taken steps to defend against the for which the insurer s proposed allocation does not account
capitol region radar speaking at a center for strategic and international studies on aug 17 commander of norad and u s northern command gen glen vanherck explained an unfunded priorities list request aids in domain awareness the command s fiscal year 2022 unfunded priorities list requested 27 million to start a national capital region cruise missile radar system vanherck said it is tied to improved domain awareness that radar would give us in the national capital region domain awareness today is challenged by cruise missiles which have very low radar cross sections that fly about 500 mph and 500 feet or below that challenge is to the existing systems that we have not only in the national capital region but across canada and north america vanherck said he characterized this potential project as providing a proof of concept that can be useful in continuity of government nuclear response and other strategic decision making options ngi vanherck also said his top priority is maintaining the schedule for the next generation interceptor ngi set to improve upon the ground based midcourse defense gmd systems missile interceptors i am concerned that we must develop and field it on time it s currently on track for 2028 the department with the missile defense agency has established a contract mechanism that will reward the timing of the fielding of the ngi and the capability and so that s good that s my top priority to make sure i can address the capability and capacity of advancing threats form places like north korea slep while waiting for ngi to develop and come online vanherck said the currently underway gmd service life extension program slep on existing ground based interceptors gbi is crucial in the interim slep is the first time the missile defense agency has really pulled out ground based interceptors out of the ground and done an end to end test of the system where they look at each and every component he said that will give dod crucial reliability data where we can now predict future reliability vanherck argued that potentially gives him the ability to change shot doctrine possibly extending the utility of the current set of gbis

plods back to sea share copy link copy residents across the waterlogged northeast began clearing mud and tearing out sodden carpets monday after deluges dropped by tropical storm henri whose remnants threatened further flooding in new england as the system made a slow trek back to the sea the smell of sewage filled the air as residents of rossmoor a retirement community in central new jersey s monroe township returned to soaked homes and ruined possessions after henri turned their streets into rivers roseann and john kiernan said they d have to likely toss their appliances tear up walls and carpets and replace their car after their house filled with nearly 2 feet of water on sunday this is what we were left with nothing nothing lamented roseann kiernan they told us that everything has to go a few miles away from monroe the whirring of portable pumps split the air on the main street in jamesburg another hard hit new jersey community luke becker who operates the four boys ice cream stand along with his three brothers one of six the family owns said nearly 4 feet of water rushed into the shop dislodging a tall cooler and leaving 3 inches of mud behind we were initially hoping to be back open by labor day but now it looks like we ve got to go through all the plumbing and rip out a ton of electrical because we don t know how much of that was affected he said right now there s really no timetable new jersey gov phil murphy toured the storm ravaged towns monday which remained under a flood warning until midnight henri spared coastal areas of new york and new england major damage when its center made landfall sunday in rhode island but its size and slow speed led to deluges in areas from maine to pennsylvania on monday henri s remnants now considered a post tropical cyclone were moving eastward over new england at a leisurely 9 mph but were expected to accelerate later prompting flood watches or warnings across swaths of the northeast in the catskills region of new york hunter town supervisor daryl legg believed his mountain community which was devastated by tropical storm irene in 2011 would be able to weather the slow moving storm i think we escaped any kind of danger so far only because of the length of time it took for the storm to move through he said this has been a 24 hour period so it s not really the same storm thank goodness but downpours flooding and even tornadoes were still possible in new england where officials fretted that just a few more inches would be a back breaker following a summer of record rainfall the ground is so saturated with water that every inch of rain creates immediate floods and flash floods connecticut gov ned lamont said monday after seeing damage in the community of canterbury where nearly every home lost power sunday amid heavy winds no deaths have been attributed to henri but thousands remained without power across the region as crews scrambled to remove toppled trees and power lines through

manchester connecticut a hartford suburb some 40 miles inland hoped monday s rains wouldn t be a repeat of the deluge that left three units in her condo complex under a few inches of water sunday firefighters said they helped evacuate 18 homes and made several rescues after henri dumped about 5 inches of rain it was a tragedy that this happened because the people who live here are people who can ill afford to live anywhere else said landry a 72 year old retiree whose second floor home was spared in central new jersey dolores hebert was still shaken monday after being ferried to safety by boat with her dog and cat as 8 inches of rain fell and water surged through the streets in rossmoor i was sleeping and when i woke up it was up to my knees the 76 year old said as she stood by a front
