singapore three months after cambodia rolled out covid 19 vaccines just 11 percent of its population had received at least one dose while in far wealthier japan it took two weeks longer to reach that level however both countries now boast vaccination rates that are among the best in the world they are both asia pacific nations that started their immunization campaigns slowly but have since overtaken the u s and many european countries in vaccinating their public asian nations with high vaccination rates include both developed and developing countries with some having larger populations and others with smaller but all have experience with infectious diseases such as sars and with vaccine procurement programs due to low initial infection rates most asian countries began vaccinating their citizens relatively late as well as suffered from initial supply issues additionally many of their peoples were initially skeptical about being vaccinated but soaring death rates in the u s the uk and india helped persuade even skeptics to receive shots cambodia was one of the earliest countries in the region to start its vaccination program on 10th february but it is now 78 percent fully vaccinated compared to 58 percent in the us it is also now offering booster shots and looking to vaccinate 3 and 4 year olds early in the pandemic many asian countries imposed strict lockdowns and travel restrictions that prevented major surges but as vaccines were widely rolled out elsewhere those low rates gave many people the impression that becoming vaccinated was not urgent but cases surged when the highly contagious delta variant ravaged asia some countries such as malaysia prioritized the vaccination of even the hardest to reach groups we made the vaccine accessible to all with no questions asked said professor sazaly abu bakar director of the tropical infectious diseases and research education center as quoted by abc news the country now has 76 percent of its population fully vaccinated currently a handful of asia pacific countries including australia china japan and bhutan have vaccinated more than 70 percent of their populations or are close to doing so while singapore has fully vaccinated 92 percent of its people however some countries are struggling in their vaccination efforts such as india which has fully vaccinated only 29 percent of its population of nearly 1 4 billion indonesia has also struggled due to the challenge of conducting its vaccination campaign across the thousands of islands making up its archipelago

but are unlikely to eliminate their benefit according to dr ashish jha dean of brown university s school of public health there are a series of mutations in key regions that may impact effectiveness of our vaccines tweeted jha on friday render vaccines useless no super unlikely moderna s strategy involves three options for boosting covid 19 vaccination should omicron prove problematic for current vaccines the three options according to a friday release from the company a higher dose booster shots currently being studied that are designed to anticipate mutations such as those that have emerged in the omicron variant and an omicron specific booster which is already in the works andy slavitt who previously served as president joe biden s white house senior adviser for covid response said in a

federal health regulators say an experimental covid 19 pill from merck is effective against the virus but they will seek input from outside experts on risks of birth defects and other potential problems during pregnancy the food and drug administration posted its analysis of the pill ahead of a public meeting next week where academic and other experts will weigh in on its safety and effectiveness the agency isn t required to follow the group s advice the fda scientists said their review identified several potential risks including possible toxicity and birth defects given those risks the fda will ask its advisers whether the drug should never be given during pregnancy or whether it could be made available in certain cases under that scenario the fda said the drug would carry warnings about risks during pregnancy but doctors would still have the option to prescribe it in certain cases where its benefits could outweigh its risks for patients given the safety concerns fda said merck agreed the drug would not be used in children additionally the fda flagged a concern that merck s drug led to small changes in the coronavirus signature spike protein which it uses to penetrate human cells theoretically fda cautioned those changes could lead to dangerous new variants regulators also noted that merck collected far less safety data overall on its drug than was gathered for other covid 19 therapies fda will ask its independent advisers to discuss all those issues and then vote on whether the drug s overall benefits outweigh its risks the associated press

curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings we will require anyone who enters the uk to take a pcr test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self isolate until they have a negative result johnson told a news conference people who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of omicron would have to self isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings johnson said adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks the health ministry in the german state of bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant the two people entered germany at munich airport on november 24 before germany designated south africa as a virus variant area and were now isolating said the ministry indicating without stating explicitly that the people had traveled from south africa dutch test for new variant after finding 61 covid cases among south africa passengers in italy the national health institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in milan in a person coming from mozambique czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in namibia omicron dubbed a variant of concern by the world health organization is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe covid 19 compared to other strains england s chief medical officer chris witty said at the same news conference as johnson that there was still much uncertainty around omicron but there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant the variant was first discovered in south africa and had also since been detected in belgium botswana israel and hong kong flights to amsterdam dutch test for new variant after finding 61 covid cases among south africa passengers dutch authorities said that 61 out of about 600 people who arrived in amsterdam on two flights friday from south africa had tested positive for the coronavirus health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant one passenger who arrived friday from south africa dutch photographer paula zimmerman said she tested negative but was anxious for the days to come i ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days it s a little scary the idea that you ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive she said financial markets plunged on friday especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector as investors worried the variant could cause another surge in the pandemic oil prices tumbled by about 10 a barrel it could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant s mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it south african scientists brace for wave propelled by omicron travel curbs although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop omicron from circulating globally many countries around the world including the united states brazil canada and european union nations announced travel bans or restrictions friday on southern africa the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc and state department added saturday to washington s previously announced travel restrictions advising against travel to eight southern african countries omicron us restrictions also saturday australia said it would ban non citizens who have been in nine southern african countries from entering and will require supervised 14 day quarantines for australian citizens returning from there japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more african countries after imposing curbs friday on travel from south africa botswana eswatini zimbabwe namibia and lesotho britain also said it was expanding its red list to put travel curbs on more southern africa countries while south korea sri lanka thailand oman kuwait and hungary announced travel restrictions on southern african nations south africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy the foreign ministry said on saturday adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider explainer how worried should we be about omicron variant omicron has emerged as many countries in europe are already battling a surge in covid 19 infections and some have re introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread austria and slovakia have entered lockdowns vaccinations the new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the world s population is vaccinated even as many developed countries are giving third dose boosters less than 7 of people in low income countries have received their first covid 19 shot according to medical and human rights groups seth berkley ceo of the gavi vaccine alliance that with the who co leads the covax initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants while we still need to know more about omicron we do know that as long as large portions of the world s population are unvaccinated variants will continue to appear and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged he said in a statement to reuters we will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world s population not just the wealthy parts
menafn asia times new york shanghai s new data exchange began trading on november 26 in what might be one of the transformational events of the fourth industrial revolution initial data offerings include 20 products from china eastern airlines cosco shipping china mobile insight and other chinese firms according to the exchange s website the creation of capital markets in the west made it possible to mobilize the savings of the middle class to build the canals and railways that supported the first industrial revolution the 4th industrial revolution is being driven by data the emergence of an efficient market in data has implications as profound as the founding of the amsterdam stock exchange in 1601 the funding of america s public debt in 1790 or the financing of the debt of the napoleonic wars china s emphasis on data as a factor of production breaks not only with marxist economic theory but also with the classical english economics that marx adapted from the standpoint of economic theory it is perhaps the most anti communist innovation of the past century and all the more remarkable as a programmatic statement of the chinese communist party value maximization by making the collection and sale of data transparent the shanghai exchange allows companies that collect data to maximize the values of their businesses while permitting purchasers to use the data to raise the productivity of their businesses the object is to put data into the hands of entrepreneurs who can use it most efficiently just as western stock and bond markets allocated savings to the businesses that could earn the highest risk adjusted returns if artificial intelligence ai is the engine of the 4th industrial revolution data is its fuel hundreds of millions of digitized medical histories and dna scans make it possible for ai driven research to invent new pharmaceuticals at fractional cost compared with the old trial and error methods smart cities can match every passenger and package to a conveyance and 5g communications make it possible for autonomous vehicles to bob and weave through traffic smart logistics can move goods through automated ports onto self driving trucks and to robotic warehouses where embedded chips direct every item in trade to its destination the possibilities are endless and a few of them especially in port automation are at advanced stages of implementation in china but the challenges to harvesting value from data are more complex than digging coal or pumping oil there is an enormous market for data in the west but it rests on questionable and possibly illegal data harvesting by tech giants which deliberately occult the kind of data they gather from customers and an even dodgier network of data brokers big tech ceos twitter s jack dorsey facebook s mark zuckerberg google s sundar pichai image youtube the regulatory environment for data is almost nonexistent that could change unpredictably and drastically for example a washington post study detected 5 400 app trackers siphoning data from iphones strategy business com reported in 2019 that about 3 7 zettabytes of data generated by people an average of about 117 gigabytes of data per internet user are stored per year about 25 of that is stored by google by far the largest percentage of user data stored by any single company and another 1 by facebook by 2025 average data generation per person is expected to reach almost 300 gigabytes data brokerage revenue in the west exceeds 200 billion a year much of that personal and private data hackers created a phony linkedin profile and obtained complete internet search histories for 3 million germans apple and google covertly harvest user data and hackers have penetrated their software to steal even more china s initiative is the world s first attempt to trade data under established regulations with transparent transactions if it succeeds its contribution to economic efficiency will be comparable to the creation of well regulated capital markets in the west data as 4th production factor data in china s view comprise a factor of production on par with land labor and capital the national bureau of asian research wrote in august 2021 in 2020 the chinese communist party ccp central committee and state council added data to land labor capital and technology as a new factor of production in its field based allocation system and mechanism this elevation of data the article says is indicative of a vision for a future economy where data drives development indeed according to the chinese academy of information and communications technology a key distinction between data and the traditional production factors is in the multiplier effect that data can amplify other factors of production such as labor and capital and produce even more significant economic gains china has natural advantages over the west in data gathering especially in critical fields such as health where western privacy laws inhibit the collection of individual medical records american health providers are so shy of possible legal consequences that they refuse to store data even when patients give explicit consent as the national bureau of asian research study reports economists figured out in the 18th century that capital along with land and labor was a decisive factor in production in contrast to the french physiocrats who insisted that all wealth came from land anglophone historians attribute the three factor concept to adam smith before industrialists invested in steam engines and power looms the concept of capital as a factor of production was nebulous most industry was handwork until capital investment multiplied the power of labor some 20th century economists add entrepreneurship as a fourth factor of production following frank knight s 1921 observation that entrepreneurs reward for accepting uncertainty differs fundamentally from rent of land or return to capital orderly markets in the factors of production are key to economic efficiency as peruvian economist hernando de soto wrote in 1986 the absence of clear land titles is a huge obstacle to the economic development of latin america regulation of public offerings by the us securities and exchange commission and similar government entities in the west is key to public confidence in markets for risk capital what alexander hamilton called a well funded public debt was the foundation for america s enormous growth during the 19th century and the system of government debt established in the wake of the napoleonic wars supported europe s industrial revolution that is why the shanghai data exchange may have such importance as data take a place beside land labor capital and entrepreneurship as a factor of production efficient markets in data will play a role as fundamental as markets in capital and land photo china daily meanwhile in the us big tech control of data in the united states is less a help than a hindrance to productivity according to a recent congressional study as i reported in a 2021 essay in american affairs the us congressional subcommittee on antitrust wrote in 2020 to put it simply companies that once were scrappy underdog startups that challenged the status quo have become the kinds of monopolies we last saw in the era of oil barons and railroad tycoons although these firms have delivered clear benefits to society the dominance of amazon apple facebook and google has come at a price these firms wield their dominance in ways that erode entrepreneurship degrade americans privacy online and undermine the vibrancy of the free and diverse press the result is less innovation fewer choices for consumers and a weakened democracy china s regime of data regulation and public data markets is an attempt to avoid the american productivity sinkhole created by the tech monopolies the lobbying power of the large us tech companies has effectively stalled attempts to regulate them control of data gives china a power lever against western efforts to restrict china s access to western technology with time and effort any technology can be reproduced but the west for now cannot match china s data resources
like like love haha wow sad angry 2 thyblackman com the makeup of the united states population has changed over the centuries and will continue to do so but a three way ethnic component was involved in the original basic ingredients of the formative american nation white englishmen black africans and red indians the fact that nineteenth century immigration added millions of white europeans who were not of prime english stock does not essentially alter the qualities of the original ethnic triad these three peoples engaged in a bewilderingly complex series of interactions ranging from close cooperation to bitter conflict in a roiling tapestry that gradually overspread the continent a frontier people said pres woodrow wilson is so far the central and determining fact of our national history the westerner has been the type and master of our american life at first the frontier began just beyond the stockades of the initial european settlements but it moved relentlessly westward until the entire midsection of north america was brought under their purview the story is customarily told in two separate sagas cowboys and indians masters and slaves not so fast says loren katz the two tales are really one as he carefully documents in his 1986 volume black indians a hidden heritage black indians as european settlements inched west black white and native americans fleeing forced labor within their confines melted into the interior and mixed with those native americans just beyond the frontier front tier of the unstoppable westward expansion with few weapons these alliances in the woods challenged the footholds europeans built in the western hemisphere using guerilla tactics that would become famous in china and viet nam in our own century red and black people defeated superior numbers and better equipped foreign armies this they managed while moving their families out of harm s way these dark liberators often proved that european rule in the americas amounted to a thin coat of white paint over a seething dark empire before the declaration of independence eloquently argued for a peoples revolution against unjust authority thousands of dark skinned americans had been fighting tyrants and slavehunters on two continents to counteract these powerful alliances europeans played skillfully on racial differences and ethnic rivalries they kept the pot of animosity boiling whites turned indians into slavehunters and slaveowners and africans into indian fighters light skinned africans were pitted against dark skinned free against enslaved black indians against pure africans or pure indians the european penetration of the americas led to widespread conflict amongst overlapping groups colonists fought the colonizing powers the colonizing powers fought each other colonizers fought natives natives fought each other africans joined native americans africans fought native americans etc native americans africans european colonists and the colonial powers squared off amongst each other in multifarious shifting alliances over the course of hundreds of years the action centered around the settlements of runaways on the frontier referred to as maroon communities the anthropologists call them tri racial isolates that is isolated pockets of population with white black and native american heritage e franklin frazier refers to them as people of indeterminate race note the negative connotations in western movies of half breeds and renegades reflecting how they were perceived by the european settlers they however saw themselves as freedom fighters from the time of columbus the gravest threat to european domination of the western hemisphere came from outlaw communities of former slaves these maroon colonies as they were called were considered a knife poised at the throat of the slave system some fearful europeans saw them as a sword pressed against the entire colonial system in the americas men and women who lived in them saw their settlements as the fulfillment of an american dream a sheltered home in freedom they were a place for families to educate their young develop their agriculture and trade practice religion justice and government essentially the process was analogous to the roman pacification of northern europe under the caesars just beyond the steadily expanding area of roman control were bands of warriors and their families that the romans clashed traded and intermarried with and the further out towards the frontier one went the less italian and the more indigenous looking did the roman soldiers officials and citizens become a frontier is porous on one side people move freely in and out of the hinterland and on the other in and out of the settled area the frontiersmen scouts and pathfinders universally depicted in hollywood movies as white were more often than not of mixed race like john baptist point du sable whose trading post became the city of chicago or james beckwourth who found the path through the sierra madre mountains that bears his name and facilitated the california gold rush in the 1951 movie tomahawk he is played by a white actor the searchers the iconic john ford film starring john wayne about a man who spent years searching for his neice who had been kidnapped by native americans is based on the real life adventures of a black man brit johnson the rodeo arts were largely developed by bill pickett a man of mixed race who was the mentor of tom mix and will rogers who both went on to major hollywood careers this writer distinctly recalls as a youth watching sidney poitier play a cowboy in the 1966 motion picture duel at diablo and thinking that this was a hollywood invention while just the opposite was true buried in the bitter waters oklahoma before becoming a state encompassed much of the region known as indian territory a western reserve set aside for the native americans of the southeast the endpoint of the infamous trail of tears it contained more than 30 black towns the most famous of which was the greenwood section of tulsa so successful it was dubbed black wall street in 1921 it was burned to the ground by jealous whites in a pogrom that included explosive devices dropped from airplanes until recently this horror was completely absent from school curricula even in tulsa elliott jaspin in buried in the bitter waters the hidden history of america s racial cleansing documents this episode and hundreds of others leave now or die from the heart of the midwest to the deep south from the mountains of north carolina to the texas frontier words like these have echoed through more than a century of american history the call heralded not a tornado or a hurricane but a very unnatural disaster a manmade wave of racial cleansing that purged black populations from counties across the nation many of the african americans in oklahoma had come as members of the native american nations forcibly sent there in the decade between the american revolution and the civil war black indian societies were reported in new jersey new york delaware maryland virginia north carolina south carolina connecticut tennessee and massachusetts some managed to live as maroons distant from a white society they rejected i t had become clear to any who cared to look that native americans east of the mississippi had become a biracial people with a sprinkling of white blood the longest war in american history was the conflict with the seminole indians of florida which sputtered off and on from 1816 1858 the history books give scant notice to the fact that many of the seminoles were black however general jessup at the time remarked throughout my operations i found the negroes the most active and determined warriors and during the conferences with the indian chief i ascertained that they exercised an often controlling influence over them this you may be assured is a negro not an indian war about a quarter of the population of california under the spanish was black the city of los angeles was founded in 1781 by forty four people of whom only two were europeans and the rest african indian or a mixture of the three races blacks originally owned beverly hills and the san fernando valley in 1790 a black man was the mayor of los angeles staff writer arthur lewin this talented author has just published a new

i ll raise 100m to help kids succeed philanthropist peter lampl tells me my money how he rose from a council house to living next to donald trump the charity donor started off life on a council estate in yorkshire he made his money running a new york corporate buy out firm in the 1990s the best financial year of his life was 1992 when he out earned mick jagger he now runs sutton trust which helps kids from low income families succeed the best money decision that philanthropist peter lampl ever made was to fund the campaign to ban handguns in the wake of the dunblane massacre in 1996 lampl 74 founder of social mobility charity the sutton trust told donna ferguson that he has donated more than 50million to charity and hopes to raise twice that amount to support the poorest children hit hardest by the pandemic what did your parents teach you about money my parents taught me the value of hard work and how that leads to money my father was a jewish refugee who fled from vienna to escape the nazis he arrived in england barely speaking english he took jobs as a farm labourer and car mechanic then he went to night school and qualified as a professional engineer my mother a german immigrant worked as a doctor s receptionist she supported the family while my father studied money was tight we lived in a council estate in yorkshire we always lived within our means but there wasn t much left for luxuries eventually my father got a new job we moved to cheltenham and became a middle class family i ve done well in life but i had great parents who were hardworking and ambitious for me and i think that s important probably the key people in anybody s life is their parents have you ever struggled to make ends meet no i wouldn t say that because i have always been able to pay my bills but in the 1980s i came close to bankruptcy i was living in new york and had founded a business we would buy underperforming companies turn them around and then once they were established take them public or sell them on we had a nice office in manhattan but i didn t manage to achieve anything in the first two years i didn t close one deal it got to the point i couldn t sleep at night i was worried my company would end up in tatters it was scary i almost went under but at the last minute i managed to close a deal and that s how i made my first million how did you turn your fortunes around i heard about a small company for sale on the west coast i met the chairman of the large business that owned it he took me to his house on lake washington where the very rich live today bill gates and jeff bezos there was a windsurfer on the beach and a thunderstorm was brewing so i casually said to the chairman wouldn t it be great to go out he replied you wouldn t go out in this would you i said sure i would having a go at windsurfing helped philanthropist peter lampl to make his first million he then gave me some bathing trunks that were three sizes too big i put them on and got on the board it was a battle between keeping my shorts on and the sail upright i had to spread my legs as far as i could to stay upright when i came back in the chairman thought what i d done was great i got changed we went into a room and shook hands on a deal and with that i was off to the races what he didn t know and what i kept quiet about was that i had previously competed in the world windsurfing championships what was the best year of your financial life it was 1992 i earned 35million that year which would be the equivalent of 75million today i believe i out earned mick jagger and probably elton john to boot in total between 1987 and 1997 i earned more than 200million a lot of money the most expensive thing you bought for fun in the 1990s i treated myself to a pair of chichester blue aston martin convertibles i had one in london and one in new york each cost 130 000 the equivalent of around 275 000 today i think it is the most self indulgent thing i ve ever done i ve sold them since they were beautiful to drive but they drank so much petrol i had to stop all the time to fill them up the best money decision you have made after the dunblane massacre there was a move to ban handguns funding that campaign was my best money decision it had a huge impact handguns were banned after dunblane i got involved because i d lived in america for 20 years so i was sensitive to gun culture which was moving in the wrong direction in this country neighbour peter lampl has a four bedroom house in palm beach next door to donald trump s mar a lago do you save in a pension or invest in the stock market i don t need a pension i invest through professional managers but i d rather not say how much i have invested it s fair to say that it s millions of pounds also i stick to ethical funds do you own any property yes a six bedroom house in surrey which i paid several million pounds for nine years ago i also have a four bedroom house in palm beach next door to mar a lago which is owned by donald trump he s right at the end of our garden so there goes the neighbourhood what is the one luxury you treat yourself to membership of two golf clubs i don t pay any attention to how much they cost but it is several thousand pounds a year if you were chancellor what would you do i would simplify the tax treatment of charitable donations gift aid is too complicated the charity recipient gets part of the tax break and so does the donor in america it s straightforward the donor gets the tax break so if you give a thousand dollars that money is deducted from your income for tax purposes that incentivises donations and i think that s one of the reasons why americans give more money to charity than we do if i were chancellor i would do the same here do you donate money to charity yes i am an entrepreneurial philanthropist i don t just give a charity a gift and walk away i stick around and bring all the skills i can muster to make that money work so everything i get involved with i stay on top of making sure it works well i founded sutton trust because when i came back from the states things had changed here opportunities for bright kids from low and middle income backgrounds had got much worse and social mobility had declined i set up the charity to do something about that i ve donated more than 50million and helped some 50 000 kids of course we can t help every child but we help as many as we can why is social mobility so important to you i came from a council estate and then went to oxford and london business school and made my way in the world i think everyone deserves the same opportunity to succeed in life my philosophy is that people can surprise you so you ve got to give them a chance and that s what i do i give kids a chance to surprise us what is your number one financial priority the pandemic has been terrible for the poorest the gap between poor and well off kids has widened which means there s more work to do on social mobility so my number one financial priority is to raise 100million as an endowment for sutton trust so we can continue the work we ve been doing i will put some money in but we re looking to get other philanthropists trusts foundations and companies to contribute as well
is your green fund really any different to one without the trendy label top experts warn they can be almost identical and demand a crackdown investors are keen to buy into funds with an ethical or sustainable bent experts claim fund managers are taking shortcuts in order to meet this demand this they say has led to some potentially less ethical funds being mis labelled city regulator is urged to act fast to avoid a major mis selling scandal leading investment experts are calling for the country s financial regulator to act swiftly to stop the mis labelling of green investment funds by some of the world s biggest asset managers they believe that investors voracious appetite for funds with an ethical esg environmental social and governance sustainable or sri socially responsible investing bent is resulting in some managers taking shortcuts in order to jump on the bandwagon some they claim are badging funds as sri or esg focused when actually the underlying investments are little different from similar mainstream funds that they manage going green investment experts believe that investors voracious appetite is resulting in some managers taking shortcuts in order to jump on the bandwagon catherine howarth chief executive of responsible investment campaign group shareaction says the mislabelling of such funds is a worrying problem she told wealth too many investment managers have hurriedly attached green labels to funds that are anything but green friendly it s wrong plain and simple people want to buy these funds and they should get what they think they are buying howarth welcomes the recent decision of the city s regulator the financial conduct authority to start to look at ways in which investors can make more informed esg investment decisions but she believes regulatory intervention to stop widespread fund mis labelling cannot come soon enough unless it acts soon the regulator could be overseeing a major mis selling scandal she says the fca says it is confident it can come up with its new proposals by spring next year this week a disclosure and labels advisory group put together and overseen by the regulator will meet for the first time to look at how esg fund labelling can be improved the blatant greenwashing occurring in the investment funds industry with no checks or action by the regulator is scandalous and makes a mockery of green investing investment manager alan miller widely respected investment manager alan miller co founder of wealth manager scm direct is not impressed he has long called for the regulator to act to stop the mis selling of esg funds he says while the fca launches yet more consultations more discussion groups and review papers more and more innocent investors looking to do good as well as take responsibility for their future financial health are being mis sold esg investment funds the blatant greenwashing occurring in the investment funds industry with no checks or action by the regulator is scandalous and makes a mockery of green investing greenwashing comes in many forms but in terms of fund management it is when investment managers badge funds as green when the underlying investments are not as green as they claim academic work published earlier this year by edhc business school highlighted the portfolio greenwashing that miller refers to as a problem investment managers may claim that their funds produce a positive impact on the environment it said when in fact they are not managed in a manner that is consistent with promoting such an impact analysis by scm direct s alan miller suggests that in some cases the portfolios of sustainable funds and mainstream funds run by the same company are similar last week miller conducted research for wealth into the credentials of some funds that claim to take into account sustainability esg and impact factors in the construction of their portfolios to put it mildly the results make for interesting reading some funds he believes pay mere lip service to the green issues they promote in their literature his starting point was to look at the 343 odd sterling denominated funds that are classified by scrutineer morningstar as having a sustainable investment focus and are available to uk investors morningstar leads the way in rating funds on sustainable issues awarding the most compliant a maximum five stars miller then compared the portfolios of individual sustainable funds against those of similar funds run by the same investment company but which are not badged as green in some instances the portfolio differences are minimal throwing into doubt the veracity of the sustainable label one such case involves investment giant vanguard only last week shareaction s howarth said vanguard was a really poor performer when it came to responsible investing vanguard runs the 389million fund sri european stock its investment objective is to mirror the performance of the ftse developed europe index an index comprising 614 listed european companies the fund does this while excluding companies in the index which do not meet socially responsible criteria these are defined by vanguard as companies that are or have engaged in activities that result in serious violations of the united nations global compact a non binding un code which companies worldwide are encouraged to adhere to on issues such as labour rights and the environment vanguard also says it will avoid companies that derive revenues from the production of controversial weapons such as cluster munitions landmines biochemical and nuclear weapons and those involved in the manufacture and distribution of tobacco products alongside this fund vanguard also runs ftse developed europe which simply tracks the performance of the same index but all sri considerations are ignored for all of vanguard s bluster about the socially responsible approach of the sri european stock its portfolio is little different to that of ftse developed europe just 25 of 614 companies have been screened out because they do not meet its socially responsible criteria and that still leaves a plethora of stocks in the sri european stock fund that most investors would expect to be routinely excluded from green ethical funds for example drinks companies the likes of heineken and carlsberg gaming businesses entain and evolution mining giants rio tinto and anglo american and oil producers such as bp and shell it even includes building supplies company kingspan criticised in the grenfell tower inquiry there are a range of businesses in vanguard s sri european stock fund that might be considered unethical including those selling alcoholic drinks furthermore for all of its talk about excluding companies that fall foul of the un global compact code it has adopted a hitand miss approach according to msci only one of the four ungc violation stocks in ftse developed europe are excluded from sri european stock and only one of the four very severe controversies stocks other funds says miller seem to have been misclassified by morningstar as sustainable investments when they are clearly not for example the lyxor msci emerging markets fund explicitly states in its prospectus that sustainability will not be a consideration because its objective is to track the msci emerging markets index meanwhile the 7billion royal london uk core equity tilt fund says it seeks to reduce the carbon intensity of its portfolio by between 10 and 30 per cent but msci says it scores little better on this measure than a uk index tracking fund the fund has 9 per cent of its portfolio in oil stocks vanguard said its european sri stock fund had been created in response to demand from clients wishing to screen out certain activities such as breaches of the un global compact and tobacco it added whichever way investors wish to express their esg preferences we will treat investors fairly and give them the best chance of investment success scm direct s miller believes urgent action is required to ensure investors are no longer mis sold esg funds the fca he says should force funds to publish full details of their holdings so people can see what is in the fund not just what the label or categorisation says he adds this level of transparency has been available to us investors for all funds since 2004 yet 17 years later uk investors are still being treated with contempt through dodgy and deceptive esg products

amir peay had high hopes when he salvaged the abandoned 140 year old james e pepper distillery near the heart of lexington kentucky after years of planning and renovations it was finally ready to produce whiskey on site in 2017 but peay s hopes were dashed a few months later as the european union imposed tariffs on american whiskey we thought we could really grow our business over there says peay that is of course until june of 2018 when out of the blue american whiskey got dragged into a trade war but now peay and whiskey distillers across the u s are raising their glasses and setting their sights once again on europe the u s and european union announced a trade agreement last month that effectively lifts the 25 percent tariffs on american whiskey come january the tariffs which had been levied as part of a growing trade dispute between the trump administration and the e u over steel and aluminum also targeted american exports such as motorcycles and denim and stymied international growth for the burgeoning american whiskey industry jeff dean npr jeff dean npr the james e pepper distillery jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch walks through the distillery europe is a major importer of american spirits yet distillers saw a 53 decline in american whiskey exports to the u k and a 37 decline to the e u while the tariffs were in place resulting in over 300 million in lost revenue according to the distilled spirits council then covid 19 exacerbated the pain of small distillers as they were forced to close their doors to tours and tastings and bars and restaurants shut down in the beginning when the pandemic hit you know myself and us as a company we were really really nervous and scared says peay adding that bars and restaurants made up nearly half of his business at the time jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch inspects the mash jeff dean npr jeff dean npr master distiller aaron schorsch weighs containers of rye the distillery pivoted to retail sales and with more people drinking at home throughout the pandemic the company sold a record number of cases of whiskey in 2020 peay says we had very strong domestic growth says peay but it made us change how we wanted to allocate stock to europe and it altered what was going to be our growth trajectory in europe jeff dean npr jeff dean npr rye is transferred from a silo into storage containers it could be hard for smaller craft distillers to reclaim the space they lost on european store shelves when the tariffs were imposed now that distributors have adjusted their purchasing strategies once you re off the shelves it s like 300 times harder to get back on says sonat birnecker hart president of koval distillery in chicago illinois jeff dean npr jeff dean npr distillery employee cody giles left uses a forklift to pick up a container of malt jeff dean npr jeff dean npr bottles sit on bottling line at the james e pepper distillery hart says koval decided to keep its prices steady essentially eating the excess cost of the tariffs in order to maintain existing relationships we had to show them that we were in it for the long term says hart so when the biden administration announced that it had come to an agreement with the e u to lift the tariffs hart saw reason to celebrate we took out the bourbon cocktails to toast that the tariffs had gone away says hart that being said you know there s still work to be done jeff dean npr jeff dean npr boxes are stacked at the james e pepper distillery jeff dean npr jeff dean npr travis kitchens pours a tasting flight at the james e pepper distillery especially when it comes to britain the u k is no longer part of the e u thanks to brexit and has yet to remove its tariffs on american whiskey yet amir peay in lexington is optimistic a deal will be struck and demand for u s whiskey will increase it s not a light switch we can t just flick it and immediately just let s go back to what we had he says i m not sure about 2022 but i am confident that 2023 and beyond it s a very bright future for american whiskey in europe copyright 2023 npr to see more visit
as the world waits to find out how dangerous the super mutated covid variant omicron might be three more european nations confirmed cases of the virus on saturday and dutch authorities revealed that 61 people arriving on two flights from south africa have tested positive for covid german authorities confirmed two cases of the variant cnn reported saturday the two positive individuals were identified in munich and had just arrived on a nov 24 flight from cape town south africa fifty other passengers from the same flight remain quarantined according to cnn the u k said it detected its first two cases on saturday both linked to recent travel from southern africa and in italy a case of the variant was detected in milan in a person who had recently traveled from mozambique reuters reported health authorities in australia and the czech republic are also examining possible cases of the variant in people who had recently spent time in namibia and other unspecified southern african nations although the united states has not yet confirmed any cases of the omicron variant dr anthony fauci said on saturday that he wouldn t be surprised if the variant was already circulating in the country we have not detected it yet he told weekend today but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility and you re already having travel related cases that they ve noted in israel and belgium and other places when you have a virus like this it almost invariably is ultimately going to go essentially all over dutch authorities said saturday that 61 people arriving on two klm flights from south africa where the strain has been spreading have tested positive it s not known whether the passengers were infected with omicron or an earlier version of the coronavirus but the discovery underscores the possibility that the new variant has already gone global previously cases had been identified only in south africa botswana hong kong and belgium all of them travelers from countries in southern african the emergence of omicron caused an international freakout with the u s the u k and other nations banning travel from south africa and its neighbors and the stock market taking its worst plunge of the year it seems to spread rapidly president joe biden said in announcing the travel restrictions i ve decided that we re going to be cautious but the south african government hit back on saturday complaining that the country was being punished with travel bans rather than lauded for its quick work in detecting the variant excellent science should be applauded and not punished the country s foreign ministry said in a statement adding that bans were akin to punishing south africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker the head of the south african medical association dr angelique coetzee told the bbc that the cases found so far in south africa did not appear to be severe the patients are mostly complaining about a sore body and tiredness extreme tiredness and we see it in the younger generation it s not the older people we re not talking about patients that might go straight to a hospital and be admitted coetzee was quoted saying only about 24 percent of the population is fully vaccinated in south africa nevertheless the positive tests from the two klm flights that landed at amsterdam s schiphol airport dramatically illustrated the potential threat health experts believe omicron is behind south africa s recent covid surge and 10 percent of those on the jets were infected those fliers are now in quarantine but the specter of other infected travelers slipping through testing protocols and going on to their destinations undetected looms large while there have been plenty of covid variants identified including the delta strain that sparked this year s deadly surge omicron is of particular concern because it has more than 30 mutations to the spike protein that allows the virus to bind to human cells public health officials are trying to determine if that makes it more transmissible even in the vaccinated and whether it causes more severe illness or carries a higher risk of death with so little known many scientists are warning people to be cautious but not to panic at least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new variant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed professor andrew pollard director of the oxford vaccine group told the bbc
covid variant spreads to more countries as world on alert a sign reading stay safe in regent street in london friday nov 26 2021 a slew of nations moved to stop air travel from southern africa on friday and stocks plunged in asia and europe in reaction to news of a new potentially more transmissible covid 19 variant ap photo alberto pezzali london ap the new potentially more contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus popped up in more european countries on saturday just days after being identified in south africa leaving governments around the world scrambling to stop the spread the u k on saturday tightened its rules on mask wearing and on testing of international arrivals after finding two cases new cases were confirmed saturday in germany and italy with belgium israel and hong kong also reporting that the variant has been found in travelers in the u s dr anthony fauci the government s top infectious diseases expert said he would not be surprised if the omicron variant was already in the united states too we have not detected it yet but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility it almost invariably is ultimately going to go essentially all over fauci said on nbc television because of fears that the new variant has the potential to be more resistant to the protection offered by vaccines there are growing concerns around the world that the pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions will persist for far longer than hoped nearly two years since the start of the pandemic that has claimed more than 5 million lives around the world countries are on high alert many have already imposed travel restrictions on flights from southern africa as they seek to buy time to assess whether the omicron variant is more transmissible than the current dominant delta variant in britain prime minister boris johnson said it was necessary to take targeted and precautionary measures after two people tested positive for the new variant in england right now this is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new variant and to maximize our defenses he told a news conference among the measures announced johnson said anyone arriving in england must take a pcr test for covid 19 on the second day after their arrival and self isolate until they provide a negative test and if someone tests positive for the omicron variant then he said their close contacts will have to self isolate for 10 days regardless of their vaccination status currently close contacts are exempt from quarantine rules if they are fully vaccinated he also said mask wearing in shops and on public transport will be required and said the independent group of scientists that advises the british government on the rollout of coronavirus vaccines has been asked to accelerate the vaccination program this could involve widening the booster program to younger age groups reducing the time period between a second dose and a booster and allowing older children to get a second dose from today we re going to boost the booster campaign he said britain s department of health said the two cases found in the u k were linked and involved travel from southern africa one of the two new cases was in the southeastern english town of brentwood while the other was in the central city of nottingham the two confirmed cases are self isolating with their households while contact tracing and targeted testing takes place the british government also added four more countries angola malawi mozambique and zambia onto the country s travel red list from sunday six others botswana eswatini formerly swaziland lesotho namibia south africa and zimbabwe were added friday that means anyone permitted to arrive from those destinations will have to quarantine many countries have slapped restrictions on various southern african countries over the past couple of days including australia brazil canada the european union iran japan thailand and the united states in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new variant this goes against the advice of the world health organization which has warned against any overreaction before the variant was thoroughly studied despite the banning of flights there are mounting concerns that the variant has already been widely seeded around the world italy and germany were the latest to report confirmed cases of the omicron variant an italian who had traveled to mozambique on business landed in rome on nov 11 and returned to his home near naples he and five family members including two school age children have since tested positive the italian news agency lapresse said all are isolating in the naples suburb of caserta in good condition with light symptoms the variant was confirmed by sacco hospital in milan and italy s national health institute said the man had received two doses of the vaccine italy s health ministry is urging all regions to increase its tracing of the virus and sequencing to detect cases of the new variant first identified in south africa in germany the max von pettenkofer institute a munich based microbiology center said the omicron variant was confirmed in two travelers who arrived on a flight from south africa on nov 24 the head of the institute oliver keppler said that genome sequencing has yet to be completed but it is proven without doubt that it is this variant german news agency dpa reported the dutch public health institute said the omicron variant was probably found in a number of the tested persons who were isolated after arriving friday in amsterdam on two flights from south africa the institute said in a statement that further sequencing analysis is underway to determine for sure that it is the new variant the results were expected sunday a total of 61 people were tested israel said it detected the new strain in a traveler who had returned from malawi and was tracing 800 travelers who returned recently from southern african countries and australia said early sunday its scientists were working to determine whether two people who tested positive for covid after arriving from southern africa are infected with the omicron variant the variant s swift spread among young people in south africa has alarmed health professionals even though there was no immediate indication whether the variant causes more severe disease a number of pharmaceutical firms including astrazeneca moderna novavax and pfizer said they have plans in place to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of omicron pfizer and its partner biontech said they expect to be able to tweak their vaccine in around 100 days professor andrew pollard the director of the oxford vaccine group which developed the astrazeneca vaccine expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the omicron variant noting that most of the mutations appear to be in similar regions as those in other variants at least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new variant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed he told bbc radio some experts said the variant s emergence illustrated how rich countries hoarding of vaccines threatens to prolong the pandemic fewer than 6 of people in africa have been fully immunized against covid 19 and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose those conditions can speed up spread of the virus offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous variant one of the key factors to emergence of variants may well be low vaccination rates in parts of the world and the who warning that none of us is safe until all of us are safe and should be heeded said peter openshaw a professor of experimental medicine at imperial college london u s secretary of state antony blinken spoke saturday with his south african counterpart naledi pandor and they stressed the importance of working together to help african nations vaccinate their populations the state department said in a statement it said blinken praised south africa s scientists for quickly identifying the omicron variant and the government for its transparency in sharing this information which should serve as a model for the world
there were 20 873 first and second vaccine doses administered yesterday made up 6 378 first doses and 14 495 second doses to date 92 of eligible people in new zealand have had their first dose and 85

pharmacies for help getting your my vaccine pass omicron variant health officials continue to assess the latest international information on the new b 1 1529 variant which the world health organization has named omicron as a precaution and based on advice from the director general of health the government yesterday added nine countries in southern africa to the very high risk countries list placing additional restrictions on travel into new zealand knowledge about this emerging variant is in its infancy and we are closely watching and monitoring evidence and countries responses vaccine producing companies will now start assessing any impact the strain will have on vaccine efficacy however our advice to public remains that vaccines are the number one protection against covid 19 including against the delta variant responsible for our current outbreak there is no change to the advice on booster vaccines which is for people over 18 to get their booster dose at least six months after their second dose anyone who is due a booster shot which become available to a wider group of people from monday is encouraged to book using bookmyvaccine there s no need to rush to get the booster the science shows fully vaccinated people remain really well protected from infection and from being seriously ill if they do get covid 19 there is plenty of existing stock of the pfizer vaccine in new zealand now and on order for everyone who needs a booster shot over coming months we will advise on any potential impacts for new zealand noting that we remain in a good position to minimise the impact of any new variants with isolation and routine testing of international arrivals covid 19 vaccine update total first and second vaccines administered to date percentage of eligible

london nov 28 britain germany and italy detected cases of the new omicron coronavirus variant yesterday and british prime minister boris johnson announced new steps to contain the virus while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern africa advertisement the discovery of the variant has sparked global concern a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell off on financial markets on friday as investors worried that omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two year pandemic israel said it would ban the entry of all foreigners into the country and reintroduce counter terrorism phone tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant the two linked cases of omicron detected in britain were connected to travel to southern africa british health minister sajid javid said advertisement johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings we will require anyone who enters the uk to take a pcr test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self isolate until they have a negative result johnson told a news conference people who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of omicron would have to self isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten the rules on wearing face coverings johnson said adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks advertisement the health ministry in the german state of bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant the two people entered germany at munich airport on nov 24 before germany designated south africa as a virus variant area and were now isolating said the ministry indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from south africa in italy the national health institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in milan in a person coming from mozambique czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in namibia omicron dubbed a variant of concern by the world health organization is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe covid 19 compared to other strains england s chief medical officer chris witty said at the same news conference as johnson that there was still much uncertainty around omicron but there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant the variant was first discovered in south africa and had also since been detected in belgium botswana israel and hong kong flights to amsterdam dutch authorities said 61 of around 600 people who arrived in amsterdam on two flights from south africa on friday had tested positive for the coronavirus health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant one passenger who arrived from south africa on friday dutch photographer paula zimmerman said she tested negative but was anxious for the days to come i ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days it s a little scary the idea that you ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive she said financial markets plunged on friday especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector oil prices tumbled by about us 10 a barrel it could take weeks for scientists to understand fully the variant s mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it travel curbs although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop omicron from circulating globally many countries around the world including the united states brazil canada and european union nations announced travel bans or restrictions on southern africa on friday the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and state department added on saturday to washington s previously announced travel restrictions advising against travel to eight southern african countries us vice president kamala harris told reporters on saturday that the administration will take it one step at a time when asked about additional travel restrictions for now we ve done what we think is necessary harris said also on saturday australia said it would ban non citizens who have been in nine southern african countries from entering and will require supervised 14 day quarantines for australian citizens returning from there japan and britain said they were extending travel curbs to more african countries while south korea sri lanka thailand oman kuwait and hungary announced new travel restrictions south africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy the foreign ministry said on saturday adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider omicron has emerged as many countries in europe are already battling a surge in covid 19 infections and some have re introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread austria and slovakia have entered lockdowns vaccinations the new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the world s population is vaccinated even as many developed countries are giving third dose boosters less than 7 per cent of people in low income countries have received their first covid 19 shot according to medical and human rights groups seth berkley ceo of the gavi vaccine alliance that with the who co leads the covax initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants while we still need to know more about omicron we do know that as long as large portions of the world s population are unvaccinated variants will continue to appear and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged he said in a statement to reuters we will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world s population not just the wealthy parts reuters

singapore three months after cambodia rolled out covid 19 vaccines just 11 percent of its population had received at least one dose while in far wealthier japan it took two weeks longer to reach that level however both countries now boast vaccination rates that are among the best in the world they are both asia pacific nations that started their immunization campaigns slowly but have since overtaken the u s and many european countries in vaccinating their public asian nations with high vaccination rates include both developed and developing countries with some having larger populations and others with smaller but all have experience with infectious diseases such as sars and with vaccine procurement programs due to low initial infection rates most asian countries began vaccinating their citizens relatively late as well as suffered from initial supply issues additionally many of their peoples were initially skeptical about being vaccinated but soaring death rates in the u s the uk and india helped persuade even skeptics to receive shots cambodia was one of the earliest countries in the region to start its vaccination program on 10th february but it is now 78 percent fully vaccinated compared to 58 percent in the us it is also now offering booster shots and looking to vaccinate 3 and 4 year olds early in the pandemic many asian countries imposed strict lockdowns and travel restrictions that prevented major surges but as vaccines were widely rolled out elsewhere those low rates gave many people the impression that becoming vaccinated was not urgent but cases surged when the highly contagious delta variant ravaged asia some countries such as malaysia prioritized the vaccination of even the hardest to reach groups we made the vaccine accessible to all with no questions asked said professor sazaly abu bakar director of the tropical infectious diseases and research education center as quoted by abc news the country now has 76 percent of its population fully vaccinated currently a handful of asia pacific countries including australia china japan and bhutan have vaccinated more than 70 percent of their populations or are close to doing so while singapore has fully vaccinated 92 percent of its people however some countries are struggling in their vaccination efforts such as india which has fully vaccinated only 29 percent of its population of nearly 1 4 billion indonesia has also struggled due to the challenge of conducting its vaccination campaign across the thousands of islands making up its archipelago

reading time 5 minutes britain germany and italy detected cases of the new omicron coronavirus variant on saturday and british prime minister boris johnson announced new steps to contain the virus while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern africa the discovery of the variant has sparked global concern a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell off on financial markets on friday as investors worried that omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two year pandemic the two linked cases of the new variant detected in britain were connected to travel to southern africa british health minister sajid javid said speaking later johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings we will require anyone who enters the uk to take a pcr test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self isolate until they have a negative result johnson told a news conference people who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of omicron would have to self isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings johnson said adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks the health ministry in the german state of bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant the two people entered germany at munich airport on nov 24 before germany designated south africa as a virus variant area and were now isolating said the ministry indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from south africa in italy the national health institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in milan in a person coming from mozambique czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in namibia omicron dubbed a variant of concern by the world health organization is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe covid 19 compared to other strains england s chief medical officer chris witty said at the same news conference as johnson that there was still much uncertainty around omicron but there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant the variant was first discovered in south africa and had also since been detected in belgium botswana israel and hong kong flights to amsterdam dutch authorities said that 61 out of around 600 people who arrived in amsterdam on two flights from south africa on friday had tested positive for the coronavirus health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant one passenger who arrived from south africa on friday dutch photographer paula zimmerman said she tested negative but was anxious for the days to come i ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days it s a little scary the idea that you ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive she said financial markets plunged on friday especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector as investors worried the variant could cause another surge in the pandemic oil prices tumbled by about 10 a barrel it could take weeks for scientists to fully understand the variant s mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it travel curbs although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop omicron from circulating globally many countries around the world including the united states brazil canada and european union nations announced travel bans or restrictions on southern africa on friday the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc and state department added on saturday to washington s previously announced travel restrictions advising against travel to eight southern african countries also on saturday australia said it would ban non citizens who have been in nine southern african countries from entering and will require supervised 14 day quarantines for australian citizens returning from there japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more african countries after imposing curbs on travel from south africa botswana eswatini zimbabwe namibia and lesotho on friday britain also said it was expanding its red list to put travel curbs on more southern africa countries while south korea sri lanka thailand oman kuwait and hungary announced travel restrictions on southern african nations south africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy the foreign ministry said on saturday adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider omicron has emerged as many countries in europe are already battling a surge in covid 19 infections and some have re introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread austria and slovakia have entered lockdowns vaccinations the new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the world s population is vaccinated even as many developed countries are giving third dose boosters less than 7 of people in low income countries have received their first covid 19 shot according to medical and human rights groups seth berkley ceo of the gavi vaccine alliance that with the who co leads the covax initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants while we still need to know more about omicron we do know that as long as large portions of the world s population are unvaccinated variants will continue to appear and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged he said in a statement to reuters we will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world s population not just the wealthy parts british prime minister boris johnson addresses media on omicron variant

a covid 19 variant spreading in south africa was dubbed omicron and classified a variant of concern by the world health organization on friday as the u s and other nations reacted to the newly discovered variant with travel restrictions experts with the world health organization met friday to assess the variant which appears to have a high number of mutations in the virus spike protein

coinciding with the detection of the variant according to a friday statement from the who the first omicron case was reported to the agency from south africa on nov 24 and the number of cases of the variant are increasing in almost all south african provinces the who said while omicron is now in the same category as the delta variant the extent of the public health threat the new variant will pose is unclear the beta variant was classified a variant of concern but did not spread as far as initially expected the who urged countries to increase surveillance of omicron cases and genome sequencing efforts to better understand its potential impact biden said the emergence of omicron emphasizes the importance of vaccinations and urged americans to get their booster shots as soon as possible the new variant has also been found in botswana and hong kong in travelers from south africa according to joe phaahla the nation s health minister phaahla said the variant has seen rapid

reduce the effectiveness of current vaccines but moderna has already announced a three point strategy to combat the new variant omicron s mutations could possibly reduce current vaccines effectiveness but are unlikely to eliminate their benefit according to dr ashish jha dean of brown university s school of public health there are a series of mutations in key regions that may impact effectiveness of our vaccines tweeted jha on friday render vaccines useless no super unlikely moderna s strategy involves three options for boosting covid 19 vaccination should omicron prove problematic for current vaccines the three options according to a friday release from the company a higher dose booster shots currently being studied that are designed to anticipate mutations such as those that have emerged in the omicron variant and an omicron specific booster which is already in the works andy slavitt who previously served as president joe biden s white house senior adviser for covid response said in a tweet that both moderna and pfizer biontech have estimated a vaccine to combat a new variant could be developed in about 3 months with some regulatory and logistical hurtles to follow if we start in early december new vaccines could be available by summer in much of the world slavitt tweeted multiple media organizations on friday reported pfizer biontech is studying the new variant and expects data within weeks if warranted a targeted vaccine could be developed within 6 weeks and ship within 100 days the reports say johnson johnson is also testing its current vaccine against omicron according to cnbc it s coming new york braces for omicron hospitals already strained new york gov kathy hochul on friday announced an executive order intended to boost hospital capacity and address staffing shortages a move that comes amid growing concerns about hospital beds and staffing hospitalizations have already risen sharply recently in much of the state and could soar higher if omicron proves to be as highly transmissible as some fear the variant has not yet been detected in new york it s coming hochul said in a statement friday her order allows the state health department to limit non essential surgeries if needed to ensure capacity the governor said the order also will allow the state to acquire critical supplies more quickly hospitals in other areas of the country are already stretched thin amid a spike in cases on wednesday the federal government said it would send 44 military medical staffers to michigan to help beleaguered hospitals treat covid 19 patients amid a fourth surge that is the worst in the country facing hospitals filling up with covid patients needing lengthy stays massachusetts gov charlie baker said tuesday any hospital or hospital system facing limited capacity to care for patients will be required to reduce non essential non urgent scheduled procedures beginning monday the associated press fda merck covid pill effective experts will review safety federal health regulators say an experimental covid 19 pill from merck is effective against the virus but they will seek input from outside experts on risks of birth defects and other potential problems during pregnancy the food and drug administration posted its analysis of the pill ahead of a public meeting next week where academic and other experts will weigh in on its safety and effectiveness the agency isn t required to follow the group s advice the fda scientists said their review identified several potential risks including possible toxicity and birth defects given those risks the fda will ask its advisers whether the drug should never be given during pregnancy or whether it could be made available in certain cases under that scenario the fda said the drug would carry warnings about risks during pregnancy but doctors would still have the option to prescribe it in certain cases where its benefits could outweigh its risks for patients given the safety concerns fda said merck agreed the drug would not be used in children additionally the fda flagged a concern that merck s drug led to small changes in the coronavirus signature spike protein which it uses to penetrate human cells theoretically fda cautioned those changes could lead to dangerous new variants regulators also noted that merck collected far less safety data overall on its drug than was gathered for other covid 19 therapies fda will ask its independent advisers to discuss all those issues and then vote on whether the drug s overall benefits outweigh its risks the associated press

a newly identified coronavirus variant that has sparked global restrictions on travel and shaken financial markets could make the critical holiday season even more perilous in california and across the nation even before the omicron variant was discovered health officials were warning of a winter wave of covid 19 as society regroups for holiday events and travel and cold weather keeps more people indoors while it s not clear how dangerous the new variant is it s adding urgency to efforts to get more people vaccinated and to get booster shots for those with waning immunity and to follow masking and other safety rules experts say the new variant adds another reminder that there are more new variants out there that are potentially incubating said dr eric topol director of the scripps research translational institute in la jolla so if anything the silver lining of omicron is it s a wakeup call for all those people thinking we re at the end of this no we re not not by any stretch unfortunately advertisement while no cases of the omicron variant have been detected in the united states many experts say it may already be here given the country s lack of systematic genomic sequencing that would flag it the variant first identified in south africa amid a spike in infections there has more mutations than any scientists have seen including some that may make the virus more resistant to immunity generated from previous infections or vaccines but much isn t known including whether the variant is more transmissible results in more severe illness or reduces the efficacy of vaccines we are in a constant battle with this virus said dr kirsten bibbins domingo chair of uc san francisco s department of epidemiology and biostatistics we have to always be vigilant and we neither have to overreact to this or assume that there is no threat at all california will go into december in better shape than many other states new coronavirus cases in california have decreased slightly in recent weeks after ticking upward in late october but there continue to be hot spots in california where the delta variant s impact on hospitals remains high in the central valley some hospitals are overwhelmed with covid 19 patients nearly 64 of californians are fully vaccinated according to the times vaccine tracker but that figure is too low to curb an expected fifth surge of covid 19 this winter there has been an uptick in demand for shots among 5 to 11 year olds and interest in booster shots is rising but authorities are concerned about lackluster rates of vaccination among young adults the specter of a potentially dangerous new variant comes as many report an overwhelming sense of pandemic fatigue as the health crisis approaches its third year advertisement the world health organization on friday named the new variant omicron and quickly classified it as a variant of concern the news prompted multiple countries including the u s to restrict travel from south africa and other african nations the u s travel restrictions take effect monday it clearly has been around for weeks it has been moving silently it takes a while for these kinds of things to come to your attention said dr robert schooley professor of infectious diseases at the uc san diego school of medicine still he said it is difficult to predict when the variant might pop up in california one of the things that makes it hard is that we may have seen it first in south africa because they have a more sophisticated system of tracking variants he said there is no evidence that the variant arose there he added it could have started anywhere with a connection to that nation while restricting travel could have benefits it s unlikely to prevent the variant from spreading he said it will give us more time to understand its properties to convince people who haven t been vaccinated that they have a moment to jump on things but it is not going to prevent it from becoming global he said we live in a global world the variant has about 50 mutations topol said of those 30 are in the spike protein which is targeted by vaccines and some monoclonal antibody therapies according to dr robert kim farley an epidemiologist and infectious diseases expert at the ucla fielding school of public health advertisement so the concern is will this variant have some ability to work around if you will our vaccines and some of our therapies kim farley said early observations suggest that could be the case with breakthrough infections reported in vaccinated people topol said we know breakthroughs are occurring and they have so far occurred with multiple vaccines he said that is in and of itself concerning and looking at the structure of the virus it could have the potential to basically override our immune response initial data suggest that the variant causes mild illness based on many of the cases followed in south africa topol said that would make sense from an evolutionary point of view as it s advantageous for a virus to become more infectious but less virulent kim farley said if a virus becomes so severe that it s killing most people then it will not travel much because it needs people that can transmit to others he said so in a sense the virus is seeking to increase transmissibility and usually to actually decrease its severity but although scientists can make educated guesses about how the variant behaves based on its genetic structure and initial reports more testing and observation is needed advertisement at the moment all of these questions really are still up in the air as to the answers and so that s why there s so much intense scrutiny going on in south africa and countries in southern africa as well as now the fact that it has been seen most recently in the u k the czech republic and belgium kim farley said and so the guard is up everywhere now to be looking for this new variant because no doubt it will be found in other places the variant has also been found in travelers to israel and hong kong germany and italy reported cases saturday afternoon when it comes to dealing with omicron california is well positioned compared to much of the country because elected officials have largely been in agreement with public health experts on imposing control methods like vaccination and masking requirements kim farley said even if the variant were to spread and generate a surge in hospital patients here the healthcare system has had plenty of practice in weathering these types of spikes that picture may be somewhat more complicated in the central valley where officials are already expecting a difficult winter due to relatively low vaccination rates california s statewide rate of full vaccination is slightly higher than the u s average which the centers for disease control and prevention estimates to be 60 but the rate remains well suboptimal topol said we need 90 of people at least who are vaccinated or have had a recent covid infection confirmed and we re not even close he said adding that this leaves millions of californians who need to gain immunity we are very vulnerable here and it can change quickly once it gets going it becomes exponential we ve seen this repeatedly and we haven t learned that lesson yet advertisement he urged people to take extra precautions during holiday gatherings including testing attendees and hosting events outdoors or if indoors with open windows and air filtration devices bibbins domingo added that common sense tactics include wearing a mask and evaluating whether to enter riskier travel situations scientists should also increase the frequency of deep analysis of the results of covid tests she said when you go to get a pcr test for example right now your pcr test is just telling you whether the swab you gave has the virus present or not she said but we can take that same swab and go right down to the pieces of dna that allow you to characterize that virus down to its molecular level now that scientists in south africa have raised the red flag about omicron those in the u s will likely carry out that more rigorous research with greater frequency bibbins domingo said the most important thing people can do is get vaccinated and get booster shots when they re eligible because even if the variant does render vaccines less effective they offer some protection and remain the best tool to fight the disease kim farley said it s anticipated that manufacturers will be able to rapidly adjust the formulations of vaccines to account for the variant if needed similar to how the flu shot is adjusted each year he added advertisement more than anything he said the emergence of the variant has shined a harsh light on exactly what will be needed to bring the pandemic under control global solidarity we really should think of the world as one human body he said and if we have a sore on our foot the brain cannot say i don t have to worry about it it s only the foot because ultimately that sore could become infected and the whole body dies times staff writer luke money contributed to this report

cnn by betsy klein cnn president joe biden and first lady jill biden descended on the island of nantucket this week looking to preserve the sense of normalcy that the nation was so looking forward to over this holiday season the president and first lady brought a brood of children grandchildren and their significant others to their island thanksgiving getaway along with the secret service apparatus small flock of staff and gaggle of reporters that travels with the president looking to send a signal to the rest of the country that it was time to return to traditions that had been skipped in 2020 they went through their thanksgiving routine they had their feast with family on thursday before walking through nantucket on friday dining at a local restaurant and shopping at stores they have visited for decades before attending the lighting of the town s christmas tree the president tweeted in support of small businesses and restaurants friday making good on his pledge to shop small during that afternoon stroll but as has happened so often in the past year and a half the pandemic is never far away for the president as he like other americans woke up to new worries over a concerning variant of the coronavirus spreading abroad as the bidens smiled through their thanksgiving traditions the harsh reality of covid 19 s unpredictability interrupted the celebrations on black friday reports of the new omicron variant of the virus b 1 1 529 discovered in south africa prompted fresh concerns among scientists and the biden administration as south african officials briefed the world health organization on friday a new wave of travel restrictions were imposed abroad as countries like the united kingdom germany and japan moved unusually quickly to set new travel bans for south africa and other countries in the region stock markets in the us and abroad fell sharply friday on the news with the dow jones industrial average logging its worst day since october 2020 as investors reacted to the new uncertainty of the virus s trajectory on friday afternoon the president announced new travel restrictions on south africa and seven other african nations a move that he said was meant to be cautious over a new big concern the stock slide reports of cases of the new variant showing up in additional nations around the world and travel restrictions on affected nations brought back echoes of the pandemic s early days rather than the optimistic view the administration has sought to project in the last several weeks the news from southern africa turned biden s annual trek to nantucket from a signal of better days to come into a message that the nation s new normal can be preserved at least for now biden and his team view effectively tackling the pandemic as the only way for the economy to improve and for the president to recover his political fortunes questions are now circulating about how the administration will handle the new variant and its economic havoc as federal health officials like dr anthony fauci warn that there is much to learn about how it spreads and how vaccines can fight it the continued economic fallout from the pandemic still far from over this holiday week was clear both on wall street and in the seaside town where the bidens broke bread conversations with local business owners and workers across nantucket underlined the growing economic disparities between the summer season residents and many of the islanders who live here year round that gap has been exacerbated by the pandemic and resulting inflation supply chain issues labor shortages and a lack of affordable housing richard vargas a manager at murray s beverage store on the town s main street told cnn that the labor shortages mean he is seeing businesses having trouble being able to gain enough people out here for work people wanting to go to work and getting the supplies to be able to provide a service for everybody around the island there are a lot of hardworking people here he said many of whom he explained hold at least two jobs to pay rising housing rental costs and to buy food vargas who holds a second job at fedex said a scarcity of j 1 visas for people coming to the us seasonally to work has also made it hard to recruit workers we know there s a lot of people that wanted to come back this year that couldn t because they couldn t get a visa it s just absolute craziness like all the stores along here any of the businesses over here they say the same thing they could not get enough help vargas said biden is staying at the home of billionaire philanthropist david rubenstein a sprawling waterfront compound but on an island often described as elite tony or posh the economic concerns affecting the nation are acutely felt among those who keep the place running the landscapers the servers the cooks the hotel housekeepers the shop employees despite continued prosperity for the very rich there is a growing year round population living at or below the median income level and a severe shortage of year round affordable rental housing according to the nantucket food fuel rental assistance program food insecurity is on the rise with the greater boston food bank identifying nantucket county as one of four counties in massachusetts that have seen their projected food insecurity rates increase by over 70 0 in the past year per the town s nantucket cottage hospital and the labor shortage extends to teachers police officers and first responders with the nantucket current reporting in august that a staff exodus from the nantucket department of public works had crippled its workforce concerns about the gap between rich and poor on the island were echoed by local business owners at the nantucket chamber of commerce s business after hours happy hour wednesday evening with one attendee describing the different nantucket economies of the rich and privileged and of those supporting their lifestyles it s no secret that presidential vacations historically do not reflect the experiences of ordinary americans from president donald trump s frequent mar a lago escapes in palm beach florida to president barack obama s summer vacation in nearby martha s vineyard they ve often been aware of the political dangers in selecting tony locations in 1995 president bill clinton s political adviser conducted a poll to determine a voter approved vacation spot for the clintons settling on grand teton national park but for the bidens the trip this year is meant to be a symbol to the country that americans can enjoy the holiday traditions that the coronavirus kept them from experiencing last year the bidens have been spending thanksgiving on nantucket for 46 years it was the spot the president spent his first thanksgiving with jill biden and the place where his late son beau and son hunter encouraged him to run for president in 2016 this year the blessings of thanksgiving are especially meaningful the president said in a video message released thursday the first lady added after being apart last year we have a new appreciation for those little moments we can t plan or replicate the cnn wire 2021

london britain germany and italy detected cases of the new omicron coronavirus variant yesterday and british prime minister boris johnson announced new steps to contain the virus while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern africa the discovery of the variant has sparked global concern a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell off on financial markets on friday as investors worried that omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two year pandemic israel said it would ban the entry of all foreigners into the country and reintroduce counter terrorism phone tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant the two linked cases of omicron detected in britain were connected to travel to southern africa british health minister sajid javid said johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings â we will require anyone who enters the uk to take a pcr test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self isolate until they have a negative result â johnson told a news conference people who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of omicron would have to self isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten the rules on wearing face coverings johnson said adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks the health ministry in the german state of bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant the two people entered germany at munich airport on nov 24 before germany designated south africa as a virus variant area and were now isolating said the ministry indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from south africa in italy the national health institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in milan in a person coming from mozambique czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in namibia omicron dubbed a â variant of concernâ by the world health organization is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe covid 19 compared to other strains englandâ s chief medical officer chris witty said at the same news conference as johnson that there was still much uncertainty around omicron but â there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variantâ the variant was first discovered in south africa and had also since been detected in belgium botswana israel and hong kong flights to amsterdam dutch authorities said 61 of around 600 people who arrived in amsterdam on two flights from south africa on friday had tested positive for the coronavirus health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant one passenger who arrived from south africa on friday dutch photographer paula zimmerman said she tested negative but was anxious for the days to come â iâ ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days itâ s a little scary the idea that youâ ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive â she said financial markets plunged on friday especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector oil prices tumbled by about us 10 a barrel it could take weeks for scientists to understand fully the variantâ s mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it travel curbs although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop omicron from circulating globally many countries around the world â including the united states brazil canada and european union nations â announced travel bans or restrictions on southern africa on friday the us centers for disease control and prevention cdc and state department added on saturday to washingtonâ s previously announced travel restrictions advising against travel to eight southern african countries us vice president kamala harris told reporters on saturday that the administration will take it â one step at a time â when asked about additional travel restrictions â for now weâ ve done what we think is necessary â harris said also on saturday australia said it would ban non citizens who have been in nine southern african countries from entering and will require supervised 14 day quarantines for australian citizens returning from there japan and britain said they were extending travel curbs to more african countries while south korea sri lanka thailand oman kuwait and hungary announced new travel restrictions south africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy the foreign ministry said on saturday adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider omicron has emerged as many countries in europe are already battling a surge in covid 19 infections and some have re introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread austria and slovakia have entered lockdowns vaccinations the new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the worldâ s population is vaccinated even as many developed countries are giving third dose boosters less than 7 per cent of people in low income countries have received their first covid 19 shot according to medical and human rights groups seth berkley ceo of the gavi vaccine alliance that with the who co leads the covax initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants â while we still need to know more about omicron we do know that as long as large portions of the worldâ s population are unvaccinated variants will continue to appear and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged â he said in a statement to reuters â we will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the worldâ s population not just the wealthy parts â â reuters
covid variant spreads to more countries as world on alert alberto pezzali associated press london the new potentially more contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus popped up in more european countries on saturday just days after being identified in south africa leaving governments around the world scrambling to stop the spread the u k on saturday tightened its rules on mask wearing and on testing of international arrivals after finding two cases new cases were confirmed saturday in germany and italy with belgium israel and hong kong also reporting that the variant has been found in travelers because of fears that the new variant has the potential to be more resistant to the protection offered by vaccines there are growing concerns around the world that the pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions will persist for far longer than hoped nearly two years since the start of the pandemic that has claimed more than 5 million lives around the world countries are on high alert many have already imposed travel restrictions on flights from southern africa as they seek to buy time to assess whether the omicron variant is more transmissible than the current dominant delta variant in britain prime minister boris johnson said it was necessary to take targeted and precautionary measures after two people tested positive for the new variant in england right now this is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new variant and to maximize our defenses he told a news conference among the measures announced johnson said anyone arriving in england must take a pcr test for covid 19 on the second day after their arrival and self isolate until they provide a negative test and if someone tests positive for the omicron variant then he said their close contacts will have to self isolate for 10 days regardless of their vaccination status currently close contacts are exempt from quarantine rules if they are fully vaccinated he also said mask wearing in shops and on public transport will be required and said the independent group of scientists that advises the british government on the rollout of coronavirus vaccines has been asked to accelerate the vaccination program this could involve widening the booster program to younger age groups reducing the time period between a second dose and a booster and allowing older children to get a second dose from today we re going to boost the booster campaign he said britain s department of health said the two cases found in the u k were linked and involved travel from southern africa one of the two new cases was in the southeastern english town of brentwood while the other was in the central city of nottingham the two confirmed cases are self isolating with their households while contact tracing and targeted testing takes place the british government also added four more countries angola malawi mozambique and zambia onto the country s travel red list from sunday six others botswana eswatini formerly swaziland lesotho namibia south africa and zimbabwe were added friday that means anyone permitted to arrive from those destinations will have to quarantine many countries have slapped restrictions on various southern african countries over the past couple of days including australia brazil canada the european union iran japan thailand and the united states in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new variant this goes against the advice of the world health organization which has warned against any overreaction before the variant was thoroughly studied despite the banning of flights there are mounting concerns that the variant has already been widely seeded around the world italy and germany were the latest to report confirmed cases of the omicron variant an italian who had traveled to mozambique on business landed in rome on nov 11 and returned to his home near naples he and five family members including two school age children have since tested positive the italian news agency lapresse said all are isolating in the naples suburb of caserta in good condition with light symptoms the variant was confirmed by sacco hospital in milan and italy s national health institute said the man had received two doses of the vaccine italy s health ministry is urging all regions to increase its tracing of the virus and sequencing to detect cases of the new variant first identified in south africa in germany the max von pettenkofer institute a munich based microbiology center said the omicron variant was confirmed in two travelers who arrived on a flight from south africa on nov 24 the head of the institute oliver keppler said that genome sequencing has yet to be completed but it is proven without doubt that it is this variant german news agency dpa reported the dutch public health institute said the omicron variant was probably found in a number of the tested persons who were isolated after arriving friday in amsterdam on two flights from south africa the institute said in a statement that further sequencing analysis is underway to determine for sure that it is the new variant the results were expected sunday a total of 61 people were tested israel said it detected the new strain in a traveler who had returned from malawi and was tracing 800 travelers who returned recently from southern african countries the variant s swift spread among young people in south africa has alarmed health professionals even though there was no immediate indication whether the variant causes more severe disease a number of pharmaceutical firms including astrazeneca moderna novavax and pfizer said they have plans in place to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of omicron pfizer and its partner biontech said they expect to be able to tweak their vaccine in around 100 days professor andrew pollard the director of the oxford vaccine group which developed the astrazeneca vaccine expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the omicron variant noting that most of the mutations appear to be in similar regions as those in other variants at least from a speculative point of view we have some optimism that the vaccine should still work against a new variant for serious disease but really we need to wait several weeks to have that confirmed he told bbc radio some experts said the variant s emergence illustrated how rich countries hoarding of vaccines threatens to prolong the pandemic fewer than 6 of people in africa have been fully immunized against covid 19 and millions of health workers and vulnerable populations have yet to receive a single dose those conditions can speed up spread of the virus offering more opportunities for it to evolve into a dangerous variant one of the key factors to emergence of variants may well be low vaccination rates in parts of the world and the who warning that none of us is safe until all of us are safe and should be heeded said peter openshaw a professor of experimental medicine at imperial college london
quick take the omicron variant first identified in south africa has more mutations than any scientists have seen including some that could make it less susceptible to immunity generated from previous infections or vaccines a newly identified coronavirus variant that has sparked global restrictions on travel and shaken financial markets could make the critical holiday season even more perilous in california and across the nation even before the omicron variant was discovered health officials were warning of a winter wave of covid 19 as society regroups for holiday events and travel and cold weather keep more people inside while it s not clear how dangerous the new variant is it s adding urgency to efforts to get more people vaccinated and to get booster shots for those with waning immunity and to follow masking and other safety rules experts say the new variant adds another reminder that there are more new variants out there that are potentially incubating said dr eric topol director of the scripps research translational institute in la jolla so if anything the silver lining of omicron is it s a wake up call for all those people thinking we re at the end of this no we re not not by any stretch unfortunately while no cases of the omicron variant have been detected in the united states many experts say it might already be here given the country s lack of systematic genomic sequencing that would flag it the variant first identified in south africa amid a spike in infections there has more mutations than any scientists have seen including some that could make the virus more resistant to immunity generated from previous infections or vaccines but much isn t known including whether the variant is more transmissible results in more severe illness or reduces the efficacy of vaccines we are in a constant battle with this virus said dr kirsten bibbins domingo chair of uc san francisco s department of epidemiology and biostatistics we have to always be vigilant and we neither have to overreact to this or assume that there is no threat at all california will go into december in better shape than many other states new coronavirus cases in california have decreased slightly in recent weeks after ticking upward in late october but there continue to be hot spots in california where the delta variant s impact on hospitals remains high in the central valley some hospitals are overwhelmed by covid 19 patients nearly 64 of californians are fully vaccinated according to the times vaccine tracker but that figure is too low to curb an expected fifth surge of covid 19 this winter that figure is slightly higher in santa cruz county at 67 5 fully vaccinated per county data there has been an uptick in demand for shots among 5 to 11 year olds and interest in booster shots is rising but authorities are concerned about lackluster rates of vaccination among young adults the specter of a potentially dangerous new variant comes as many report an overwhelming sense of pandemic fatigue as the health crisis approaches its third year the world health organization on friday named the new variant omicron and quickly classified it as a variant of concern the news prompted multiple countries including the u s to restrict travel from south africa and other african nations the u s travel restrictions take effect monday it clearly has been around for weeks it has been moving silently it takes a while for these kinds of things to come to your attention said dr robert schooley professor of infectious diseases at the uc san diego school of medicine still he said it is difficult to predict when the variant might pop up in california one of the things that makes it hard is that we may have seen it first in south africa because they have a more sophisticated system of tracking variants he said there is no evidence that the variant arose there he added it could have started anywhere with a connection to that nation while restricting travel could have benefits it s unlikely to prevent the variant from spreading he said it will give us more time to understand its properties to convince people who haven t been vaccinated that they have a moment to jump on things but it is not going to prevent it from becoming global he said we live in a global world the variant has about 50 mutations topol said of those 30 are in the spike protein which is targeted by vaccines and some monoclonal antibody therapies according to dr robert kim farley an epidemiologist and infectious diseases expert at the ucla fielding school of public health so the concern is will this variant have some ability to work around if you will our vaccines and some of our therapies kim farley said early observations suggest that could be the case with breakthrough infections reported in vaccinated people topol said we know breakthroughs are occurring and they have so far occurred with multiple vaccines he said that is in and of itself concerning and looking at the structure of the virus it could have the potential to basically override our immune response initial data suggest that the variant causes mild illness based on many of the cases followed in south africa topol said that would make sense from an evolutionary point of view as it s advantageous for a virus to become more infectious but less virulent kim farley said if a virus becomes so severe that it s killing most people then it will not travel much because it needs people that can transmit to others he said so in a sense the virus is seeking to increase transmissibility and usually to actually decrease its severity but although scientists can make educated guesses about how the variant behaves based on its genetic structure and initial reports more testing and observation is needed at the moment all of these questions really are still up in the air as to the answers and so that s why there s so much intense scrutiny going on in south africa and countries in southern africa as well as now the fact that it has been seen most recently in the u k the czech republic and belgium kim farley said and so the guard is up everywhere now to be looking for this new variant because no doubt it will be found in other places the variant has also been found in travelers to israel and hong kong germany and italy reported cases saturday afternoon when it comes to dealing with omicron california is well positioned compared to much of the country because elected officials have largely been in agreement with public health experts on imposing control methods like vaccination and masking requirements kim farley said even if the variant were to spread and generate a surge in hospital patients here the healthcare system has had plenty of practice in weathering these types of spikes that picture could be somewhat more complicated in the central valley where officials are already expecting a difficult winter due to relatively low vaccination rates california s statewide rate of full vaccination is slightly higher than the u s average which the centers for disease control and prevention estimates to be 60 but the rate remains well suboptimal topol said we need 90 of people at least who are vaccinated or have had a recent covid infection confirmed and we re not even close he said adding that this leaves millions of californians who need to gain immunity we are very vulnerable here and it can change quickly once it gets going it becomes exponential we ve seen this repeatedly and we haven t learned that lesson yet he urged people to take extra precautions during holiday gatherings including testing attendees and hosting events outdoors or if indoors with open windows and air filtration devices bibbins domingo added that common sense tactics include wearing a mask and evaluating whether to enter riskier travel situations scientists should also increase the frequency of deep analysis of the results of covid tests she said when you go to get a pcr test for example right now your pcr test is just telling you whether the swab you gave has the virus present or not she said but we can take that same swab and go right down to the pieces of dna that allow you to characterize that virus down to its molecular level now that scientists in south africa have raised the red flag about omicron those in the u s will likely carry out that more rigorous research with greater frequency bibbins domingo said the most important thing people can do is get vaccinated and get booster shots when they re eligible because even if the variant does render vaccines less effective they offer some protection and remain the best tool to fight the disease kim farley said it s anticipated that manufacturers will be able to rapidly adjust the formulations of vaccines to account for the variant if needed similar to how the flu shot is adjusted each year he added more than anything he said the emergence of the variant has shined a harsh light on exactly what will be needed to bring the pandemic under control global solidarity we really should think of the world as one human body he said and if we have a sore on our foot the brain cannot say i don t have to worry about it it s only the foot because ultimately that sore could become infected and the whole body dies times staff writer luke money contributed to this report this

contrastingly in the united states black friday traditionally marks the friday after thanksgiving a national holiday whereas in the uk black friday is start of the christmas shopping season giving people the chance to get fantastic gifts at low prices recently people all over the world have gone crazy for the cheap prices leading to impulsive buys and new clothes ready to be tossed away after the first wear over the years people have gathered that the earliest use of the phrase black friday can date back to around 1869 in which the price of gold plummeted resulting in a crash in the market leaving behind lasting effects on the us economy but the first use of the phrase as we recognise it can be said to be around the 1950 s by traffic police in philadelphia when describing the traffic jams in retail stores currently we continue to use black friday to describe the frantic shopping holiday that people prepare for up to numerous days beforehand while on the surface black friday may seem like an enjoyable experience it also has its downsides it is an excellent opportunity to not only help stimulate the economy moreover it allows shops to sell excess stock furthermore due to black friday being a suitable time for people to buy christmas gifts for each other it has become a family tradition and the perfect way to spend time with loved ones all while venturing out for great deals nonetheless it is also the perfect time for people to make impulse decisions such as buying items they wouldn t have otherwise or accidents injuries and fights to occur in shops over attractive deals a 2019 report from the green alliance charity found that 80 per cent of everything bought during the black friday bonanza ends up getting thrown away shortly after purchase both positive and negative effects of black friday are evident we should be mindful of them every time this time of year comes around and not be influenced to make impulse purchases on the basis of a great deal would you say black friday sales are worth it

singapore three months after cambodia rolled out covid 19 vaccines just 11 percent of its population had received at least one dose while in far wealthier japan it took two weeks longer to reach that level however both countries now boast vaccination rates that are among the best in the world they are both asia pacific nations that started their immunization campaigns slowly but have since overtaken the u s and many european countries in vaccinating their public asian nations with high vaccination rates include both developed and developing countries with some having larger populations and others with smaller but all have experience with infectious diseases such as sars and with vaccine procurement programs due to low initial infection rates most asian countries began vaccinating their citizens relatively late as well as suffered from initial supply issues additionally many of their peoples were initially skeptical about being vaccinated but soaring death rates in the u s the uk and india helped persuade even skeptics to receive shots cambodia was one of the earliest countries in the region to start its vaccination program on 10th february but it is now 78 percent fully vaccinated compared to 58 percent in the us it is also now offering booster shots and looking to vaccinate 3 and 4 year olds early in the pandemic many asian countries imposed strict lockdowns and travel restrictions that prevented major surges but as vaccines were widely rolled out elsewhere those low rates gave many people the impression that becoming vaccinated was not urgent but cases surged when the highly contagious delta variant ravaged asia some countries such as malaysia prioritized the vaccination of even the hardest to reach groups we made the vaccine accessible to all with no questions asked said professor sazaly abu bakar director of the tropical infectious diseases and research education center as quoted by abc news the country now has 76 percent of its population fully vaccinated currently a handful of asia pacific countries including australia china japan and bhutan have vaccinated more than 70 percent of their populations or are close to doing so while singapore has fully vaccinated 92 percent of its people however some countries are struggling in their vaccination efforts such as india which has fully vaccinated only 29 percent of its population of nearly 1 4 billion indonesia has also struggled due to the challenge of conducting its vaccination campaign across the thousands of islands making up its archipelago
dr peter hotez has an extensive resume centered around vaccine development he is the founding dean of the national school of tropical medicine and professor of pediatrics and molecular virology microbiology at baylor college of medicine he is also director of the texas children s hospital center for vaccine development and texas children s hospital endowed chair in tropical pediatrics and university professor of biology at baylor university in houston he s been in the forefront since the coronavirus pandemic began doing interviews and offering his professional opinion even to the white house during the previous administration of the omicron variant he is cautioning that we do not push the panic button advertisement that is noteworthy coming from hotez he is frequently on television on national broadcasts and on local houston stations and i ve described his brand of opinions as doom and gloom and i ve noted that his political leanings sometimes rise to the surface hotez says that more data is needed at this time transmissibility is king in determining if omicron will impact the globe the way previous variants alpha and delta did if you haven t read allahpundit s post from yesterday with similar advice and lots of data to back it up go do that now hotez notes that what he s looking for is the level of transmissibility before we press the panic button i think there s a few things to consider hotez said during an appearance on msnbc yes it does have some immune escape properties or at least it looks like it might but that s not what s associated with high transmissibility we ve had other immune escape variants before that have not really taken off that s what i m looking out for the level of transmissibility during the interview with msnbc hotez said that the virus is already likely in the u s hotez told msnbc he believes the virus has already arrived in the u s and will be identified soon i think we should assume that it s likely in the u s by now since we tend to underperform in our ability to pick up various viral genomes he said advertisement many thanks chrisjansing for hosting me this am re new variant from southern africa things we still don t know how much of the rise in cases is truly due to the new variant vs others is it more transmissible than delta based on alpha and delta in some ways pic twitter com uk6hagsokb prof peter hotez md phd peterhotez november 26 2021 a panel at the world health organization classified the omicron variant as highly transmissible hotez is probably right that the variant is already here given the mobility of travelers especially during the holiday season some countries are acting swiftly and putting a ban on travelers from south africa where the variant originates the world is reacting faster now than in previous outbreaks financial markets plunged friday financial markets plunged on friday especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector as investors worried the variant could cause another surge in the pandemic oil prices tumbled by about 10 a barrel the dow jones industrial average dji closed down 2 5 its worst day since late october 2020 and european stocks stoxx had their worst day in 17 months two cases of the new omicron coronavirus variant were detected in great britain on saturday both were connected to travel to southern africa according to health minister sajid javid advertisement the health ministry said two individuals and all members of their households were being re tested and told to self isolate while further testing and contact tracing was done britain also said it was expanding its red list to put travel curbs on more southern africa countries while south korea sri lanka thailand oman and hungary also announced travel restrictions on southern african nations officials in the western german state of hesse said the omicron variant has probably arrived in germany after mutations were found in a passenger arriving from south africa czech health authorities said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in namibia australia and japan are the latest countries to announce travel bans today effective monday the u s will ban travelers from south africa botswana zimbabwe namibia lesotho eswatini mozambique and malawi slow joe doesn t want to move too quickly i ve decided we re going to be cautious biden said to reporters friday following the announcement of the travel restrictions we don t know a lot about the variant except it is a great concern seems to spread rapidly he said remember when trump imposed a travel ban the obama biden travel ban and biden clutched his pearls and accused trump of xenophobia and fear mongering good times advertisement we are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus biden tweeted as a presidential candidate last year the day after trump imposed travel restrictions from china into the united states in response to the spread of the coronavirus we need to lead the way with science not donald trump s record of hysteria xenophobia and fear mongering he is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency we are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus we need to lead the way with science not donald trump s record of hysteria xenophobia and fear mongering he is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency joe biden joebiden february 1 2020 biden ran on eliminating the coronavirus pandemic yet despite the availability of vaccines and therapies and other developments in the treatment of the virus it remains with us he should have known better during the campaign but he went ahead and made an outlandish promise to end the pandemic just to own trump or something the coronavirus will continue to mutate and it will remain with us just as other viruses do we have to learn to live with it and go about our lives juvenile name calling over travel bans that are meant to protect americans from the spread of an easily transmittable virus is not a sign of leadership the omicron variant probably won t be the last of the variants to be discovered

lisbon portugal ap portugal s new law on working from home makes the european union country sound like a workers paradise companies can t attempt to contact their staff outside working hours they must help staff pay for their home gas electric and internet bills bosses are forbidden from using digital software to track what their teleworkers are doing there s just one problem the law might not work critics say the new rules are half baked short on detail and unfeasible and they may even backfire by making companies reluctant to allow working from home at all the law is badly written and doesn t meet anybody s needs says josé pedro anacoreta an employment attorney at plmj one of portugal s main law firms it s no good for anyone it doesn t make any sense in many places around the world the covid 19 pandemic has accelerated a prior trend toward the digitalization of work and more flexible work arrangements amid such a sudden and massive shift in the employment landscape governments are scrambling to accommodate working from home in their employment laws those efforts are largely still in their infancy many europeans have stopped going into the office regularly since march last year to help curb the spread of covid 19 in europe unlike in the united states worker protections are widely regarded as cherished entitlements laying off a staff member for instance can entail substantial severance pay without a promised european commission directive on how to legally frame the shift to more extensive working from home governments legislative responses have been patchy and piecemeal during the pandemic some countries have recommended teleworking others like portugal have demanded it most eu countries have specific legislation on teleworking though with different approaches and others are considering it through amendments extensions or conventions as home working grew in recent years workers right to disconnect allowing staff to ignore work matters outside formal working hours was adopted before the pandemic in countries such as germany france italy spain and belgium it is now becoming the standard but portugal is taking that concept a step further by flipping the onus onto companies the employer has a duty to refrain from contacting the employee outside working hours except in situations of force majeure meaning an unanticipated or uncontrollable event states the new law also parents or caregivers with children up to eight years old have the right to work from home if they choose as long as the type of work they do is compatible with teleworking fines for companies breaking the law go up to almost 10 000 euros 11 200 for each infringement the portuguese rules are meant to address the downside of what has become known as wfh the technology that enables working from home has also opened the door to abuses such as drawn out workdays as staff remain reachable outside their normal eight hour shift the consequences may include attrition between work and private life and a sense of isolation but the new law has met with skepticism from those it is intended to protect andreia sampaio a 37 year old who works in communications in lisbon the portuguese capital agrees with the law s purpose but thinks it is too general and will be very hard to enforce we have to have common sense she says adding that she doesn t mind being contacted out of hours if it s an urgent matter we have to judge each case by its merits and she reckons authorities will mostly only act on employees complaints but people will fear losing their job if they do prompted by the pandemic but designed to apply in the future irrespective of covid related measures the law could come into force as soon as dec 1 it is largely the brainchild of the center left socialist party which has governed portugal since 2015 ahead of an election for a new government on jan 30 it is keen to burnish its progressive credentials and hoist a banner about workers rights nevertheless practical questions abound must staff be taken off company email lists when their shift finishes and then put back on when they start work again what about europeans who work in financial markets and need to know what s going on in say hong kong and have colleagues working in different time zones what if an industrial machine that can t be stopped requires the attention of an engineer who s off who is it that can t contact the employee the department supervisor the company ceo what constitutes contact a phone call a text message an email the devil is always in the details but also in the implementation says jon messenger a specialist on working conditions at the international labor organization a united nations agency based in geneva the portuguese business confederation the country s largest grouping of companies wasn t involved in drawing up the new law and thinks it is full of holes teleworking rules need to be flexible tailored to each sector and negotiated between employers and staff says luís henrique of the confederation s legal department we re treating situations that are completely different as if they were all the same that s not realistic henrique said the law can t be one size fits all policing and enforcing the new rules may also be challenging in what is one of the eu s economically poorest countries in portugal which is notorious for red tape and slow justice as well as poorly resourced public services how long will a complaint take to filter through the system and achieve a result across europe over the past decade the number of labor inspections has collapsed according to data analyzed by the brussels based european trade union confederation which represents 45 million members in 39 european countries the country with the biggest drop in the number of inspections since 2010 portugal with 55 fewer checks up to 2018 ambitious progressive laws run up against the reality that ways of policing them aren t in place yet said henrique of portugal

washington d c to encourage a drop in sky high gasoline prices president biden said the department of energy will release 50 million barrels of oil held in the u s strategic petroleum reserve the move aims to relieve the burden on americans who are paying more for gasoline than they have in years the white house said 32 million barrels of the overall 50 million will be released but eventually replenished in the reserve over the next few years while the remaining 18 million barrels are part of a sale authorized by congress biden has tried to pressure the 14 opec member countries and russia to pump more supply into the global market but this has had minimal effect his administration also partly blamed higher prices on the effects of the economic recovery from the covid 19 pandemic and blamed energy companies for alleged anti competitive behavior last week biden asked the federal trade commission to investigate whether illegal conduct is increasing prices there is mounting evidence that the declines in oil prices are not translating into lower prices at the pump the white house said according to us data americans paid an average 3 29 per gallon in october the highest price since september 2014 as we come out of an unprecedented global economic shutdown oil supply has not kept up with demand forcing working families and businesses to pay the price energy secretary jennifer granholm said as quoted by fox news as of 19th november the u s strategic reserve contained 604 5 million barrels according to the department of energy in 2020 the u s consumed some 18 19 million barrels of petroleum per day on average or a total of about 6 66 billion barrels of petroleum the lowest annual consumption since 1995

botswana zimbabwe namibia lesotho eswatini mozambique and malawi biden took the action after the world health organization who designated the new variant b 1 1 529 a variant of concern and dubbed it omicron in his announcement biden said he had two important messages for the american people for those fully vaccinated get a booster shot as soon as you are eligible and for those not yet fully vaccinated get vaccinated today what is omicron omicron is the fifth who designated variant of concern it was first detected in recent weeks in south africa which has seen an exponential rise in covid 19 cases there are about 30 mutations on the virus spike protein and scientists worry that some of them could make the virus easier to transmit but scientists do not yet know whether omicron is in fact more transmissible or dangerous worries about the new variant sent financial markets reeling friday and pushed the price of oil down by 10 a barrel the who said understanding the variant could take weeks and cautioned against travel restrictions its director of emergencies mike ryan urged no knee jerk responses ryan s advice went unheeded as travel restrictions were immediately reinstated in places including britain the european union canada and the u s other countries such as india japan israel turkey switzerland and the united arab emirates enacted some form of travel curbs reuters reported some epidemiologists warned that they were likely too late omicron has already been found in belgium botswana israel and hong kong dozens of passengers disembarking in the netherlands from flights from south africa initially tested positive for the coronavirus travelers with a positive test result will be placed in isolation at a hotel at or near schiphol dutch health authorities said in a statement of the positive test results we are researching as quickly as possible whether they are the new variant of concern travel restrictions and quarantine requirements in switzerland in reaction to omicron have caused the world trade organization to postpone its biennial meeting originally set to begin tuesday one of the main agenda items for the gathering was improving the availability of covid 19 vaccines several of the ministers and delegates would not be able to attend the meeting because of the restrictions director general ngozi okonjo iweala said this has not been an easy recommendation to make she said but as director general my priority is the health and safety of all mc12 participants ministers delegates and civil society but some authorities have held out hope that early detection of the new variant coupled with the new restrictions could have a bigger impact than the initial response to delta variant jeffrey barrett director of covid 19 genetics at the wellcome sanger institute in hinxton england told the associated press with delta it took many many weeks into india s terrible wave before it became clear what was going on and delta had already seeded itself in many places in the world and it was too late to do anything about it he said we may be at an earlier point with this new variant so there may still be time to do something about it the south african government has called the travel restrictions rushed and raised concerns about the impact on business the ceo of south africa s inbound tourism association david frost says the effects will be devastating on the sector we got off the red list in october and it was sorely needed we ve been shut down for over 18 months frost said you know the industry really is on its knees the impact of this is absolutely dire to livelihoods to families south african tourism minister lindiwe sisulu told the new york times that her country is feeling punished for the omicron research its scientists have done dr michelle groome head of the division of public health surveillance and response at south africa s national institute for communicable diseases said social distancing and mask use could help combat the virus but she questioned the efficacy of travel bans we haven t been able to contain the spread initially of the original virus and all subsequent variants have spread globally you know groome said i think there s limited value in terms of these restrictions instead she said vaccinating more of the population would help prevent the most severe cases and deaths low vaccination rates roughly 35 of the south africa s adult population is vaccinated a figure far below targets of 70 figures are even lower across much of the african continent experts have warned vaccine inequality would create a breeding ground for virus mutations astrid haas is an independent urban economist in kampala uganda in europe now and in north america in particular they re talking about booster shots and third vaccines whereas we know now from the who that less than 10 of african countries are going to even meet their vaccine target for this year just a very sad manifestation of the global vaccine inequity she said in the absence of vaccinations lockdowns may be on the horizon some information for this report came from the associated press and reuters

what is clear though is that financial markets are not priced for a sisyphean cycle of torment where big pharma calls upon itself to retool vaccines in the months ahead and the rollout starts all over again there are too many unknowns are governments prepared to invoke lockdowns in the intervening period if so what is the societal reaction function are global travel restrictions reimposed does vaccine hesitancy morph into vaccine antipathy does another variant of concern arrive is the lack of vaccine equity ever addressed a tipping point for markets a tipping point for markets will be if the world health organisation redesignates omicron as a variant of high consequence this is formally a variant for which current vaccines do not offer protection we are not suggesting this will happen but it is not a headline that you want to be on the wrong side of advertisement where we do have conviction is in expecting many more countries beyond continental africa to report cases of omicron in the weeks ahead the variant has at least a 2½ week start on its identification and in that period the case growth in the gauteng province in south africa has been significant this observation was made by the who in referring to the growth advantage of omicron border restrictions won t work note as well that or tambo international airport in johannesburg is not just the busiest airport in south africa but in all of africa there have been about 400 outbound flights beyond continental africa over the past month flights within africa have been extensive as well and obviously there are other transit points including cape town international airport in this context the efficacy of targeted border restrictions including here in australia is already in question financial markets have seen this movie before advertisement where we have less conviction is vaccine evasion and reinfection risk there have already been breakthrough cases such as in hong kong and the mutations of the virus spike protein are raising concerns with experts similarly the who flagged that preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection this is particularly relevant for a country like south africa where seroprevalence studies suggest natural immunity may be around 60 per cent of the population this compares with low vaccine rates of closer to 25 per cent of the population in both these areas more data and testing is required and some luck as well an additional area of uncertainty is severity of illness again here more time will be needed particularly as local media reports suggest that many of the cases in gauteng are in younger age cohorts this makes it difficult to rely upon local hospitalisation and fatality rates as a guide though it may be encouraging that there are no signs yet that either of these metrics are higher in gauteng than at the national level in sum financial markets are in for a challenging period the downside risk scenario is multi faceted and difficult to dimension but it is unlikely to be truncated by constructive news flow in the short term a sustained period of heightened market volatility characterised by deteriorating liquidity conditions is the more likely outcome

britain germany and italy detected cases of the new omicron coronavirus variant on saturday and british prime minister boris johnson announced new steps to contain the virus while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern africa the discovery of the variant has sparked global concern a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell off on financial markets on friday as investors worried that omicron could stall a global recovery from the nearly two year pandemic israel said it would ban the entry of all foreigners into the country and reintroduce counter terrorism phone tracking technology to contain the spread of the variant the two linked cases of omicron detected in britain were connected to travel to southern africa british health minister sajid javid said johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings we will require anyone who enters the uk to take a pcr test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self isolate until they have a negative result johnson told a news conference people who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of omicron would have to self isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten the rules on wearing face coverings johnson said adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks the health ministry in the german state of bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant the two people entered germany at munich airport on nov 24 before germany designated south africa as a virus variant area and were now isolating said the ministry indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from south africa in italy the national health institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in milan in a person coming from mozambique czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in namibia omicron dubbed a variant of concern by the world health organization is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe covid 19 compared to other strains england s chief medical officer chris witty said at the same news conference as johnson that there was still much uncertainty around omicron but there is a reasonable chance that at least there will be some degree of vaccine escape with this variant the variant was first discovered in south africa and had also since been detected in belgium botswana israel and hong kong flights to amsterdam dutch authorities said 61 of around 600 people who arrived in amsterdam on two flights from south africa on friday had tested positive for the coronavirus health authorities were carrying out further tests to see if those cases involved the new variant one passenger who arrived from south africa on friday dutch photographer paula zimmerman said she tested negative but was anxious for the days to come i ve been told that they expect that a lot more people will test positive after five days it s a little scary the idea that you ve been in a plane with a lot of people who tested positive she said financial markets plunged on friday especially stocks of airlines and others in the travel sector oil prices tumbled by about 10 a barrel it could take weeks for scientists to understand fully the variant s mutations and whether existing vaccines and treatments are effective against it travel curbs although epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop omicron from circulating globally many countries around the world including the united states brazil canada and european union nations announced travel bans or restrictions on southern africa on friday the u s centers for disease control and prevention cdc and state department added on saturday to washington s previously announced travel restrictions advising against travel to eight southern african countries u s vice president kamala harris told reporters on saturday that the administration will take it one step at a time when asked about additional travel restrictions for now we ve done what we think is necessary harris said also on saturday australia said it would ban non citizens who have been in nine southern african countries from entering and will require supervised 14 day quarantines for australian citizens returning from there japan and britain said they were extending travel curbs to more african countries while south korea sri lanka thailand oman kuwait and hungary announced new travel restrictions south africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy the foreign ministry said on saturday adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider omicron has emerged as many countries in europe are already battling a surge in covid 19 infections and some have re introduced restrictions on social activity to try to stop the spread austria and slovakia have entered lockdowns vaccinations the new variant has also thrown a spotlight on disparities in how far the world s population is vaccinated even as many developed countries are giving third dose boosters less than 7 of people in low income countries have received their first covid 19 shot according to medical and human rights groups seth berkley ceo of the gavi vaccine alliance that with the who co leads the covax initiative to push for equitable distribution of vaccines said this was essential to ward off the emergence of more coronavirus variants while we still need to know more about omicron we do know that as long as large portions of the world s population are unvaccinated variants will continue to appear and the pandemic will continue to be prolonged he said in a statement to reuters we will only prevent variants from emerging if we are able to protect all of the world s population not just the wealthy parts

local employees say this is the busiest holiday season they ve seen in durango shoppers turned out for small business saturday along main avenue according to several local shop owners who said this is the busiest season they ve seen lee pillaro who has worked at duranglers flies and supplies for five years said this late fall or early winter season has been the busiest for business that he s experienced pillaro said black friday was one of the busiest days in the last three months since the regular summer tourism season started to wane he said business started off somewhat slow on saturday but before noon a steady stream of people had started to filter into the fly fishing shop at 923 main ave business typically slows down near the start of winter and doesn t usually pick up again until around april pillaro said but not this year there s still a lot of people coming in supporting local businesses getting out there and still fishing still buying stuff he said he said that at this time last year they only had two people staffing the store but on saturday there were four employees on the shop floor because business has been booming people they ve got time they want to be outside pillaro said i can t tell you over this summer and last summer how many people have come in and said hey i ve been wanting to get into fly fishing for 10 years and i never had the time and now i do even though the fishing store has experienced better business than usual for this time of year duranglers flies and supplies would be having triple the business as normal if it weren t for supply chain backlogs pillaro said in our industry pretty much everything is made domestically or produced in china he said everything from china is backed up in shipping and everything from domestic production had to shut down for a long time there at the start of covid the simple economic principles of supply and demand seem to be in play across outdoor industries at least from pillaro s perspective while they fishing rod producers were not producing anything demand skyrocketed he said the companies that we deal with they re doing everything that they can to be able to get us what we need to sell to people pillaro said that not a day goes by when people visit the shop looking to buy something they ve been yearning for only to learn that the shop doesn t have the item in stock even though duranglers normally would it s hard he said normally we can special order stuff and have it in a week or two but with so much of the production backed off everywhere and like i said that s across the outdoor industry not just fly fishing it s just hard to even special order anything for people pillaro said if he were to submit a custom order on saturday the item might not arrive until march he described the situation as a double edged sword on one end business is good for this time of year but on the other end custom orders and supply chain issues are challenging to handle personally knowing and working with our reps here and talking to actual people from these companies that supply us they re doing everything they can just to even that out that supply and demand he said but it might take till next summer at durango t shirt co 816 main ave shaina atcitty who s worked for the clothing retailer for about six years said this is the busiest year she s encountered she said she isn t exactly sure why turnout this holiday season is above average she speculated that it might have to do with people finally getting outside after being cooped up at home away from covid 19 or perhaps the weather has been warmer and more inviting than usual for late november but she said it s pretty normal for families to travel to durango for the holidays and maybe 2021 is simply proving to be an exceptional year for that sort of activity mostly they re all visiting from out of state usually from texas or california she said we get people from all over atcitty said she expects the better than usual seasonal business to keep up until the new year at least and although durango hasn t received much snow this fall as of saturday atcitty said she hopes that changes because snow is good for business with skiers hopefully we get snow because that s when everyone comes in for skiing and all that she said but i think it business will be consistently like this karen dabaghian and david downing who are relatively new to the durango area enjoyed some casual shopping on saturday dabaghian said she enjoys seeing people out and about and looking at the work of local artisans that is hosted at local stores such as urban market where she had just made a purchase that artisanship seems like it s kind of a lost art or a disappearing art she said i just bought this really cool platter from here urban but it s from a local artisan which i just think is so cool earlier on saturday dabaghian had visited animas chocolate coffee co before dropping by maria s bookshop her next destinations were two clothing boutiques farther along main avenue she said she was trying to get some christmas gift shopping out of the way so that she has time to mail them ahead of dec 25 i m shopping for kids friends folks from afar she said i m trying to get it done so i can get it in the mail i don t know how long things are going to take dabaghian said she s thinking ahead in terms of shipping gifts this year more than in previous years downing said his saturday shopping spree was nice because shops weren t too crowded and contained a nice selection of items it s been good no complaints he said he said he accomplished some of his holiday shopping online through amazon prime all he had to do is make sure they were scheduled for delivery within a reasonable time frame dabaghian and downing agreed they prefer browsing the local stores over trudging through large malls it s nice not having to go to a crazy suburban mall downing said dabaghian agreed i don t miss the malls at all she said this is just way more fun it s great to be outside i m definitely coming out for the noel nite dabaghian said she loves the idea of shopping local even if that appears to be more difficult i think it s hard to do it s getting harder to support local businesses she said you have to make it intentional cburney durangoherald com
portugal s new law on working from home makes the european union country sound like a workers paradise companies can t attempt to contact their staff outside working hours they must help staff pay for their home gas electric and internet bills bosses are forbidden from using digital software to track what their teleworkers are doing there s just one problem the law might not work critics say the new rules are half baked short on detail and unfeasible and they may backfire by making companies reluctant to allow working from home at all in many places around the world the covid 19 pandemic accelerated a trend toward the digitalization of work and more flexible work arrangements amid such a sudden and massive shift in the employment landscape governments are scrambling to accommodate working from home in their employment laws those efforts are largely still in their infancy many europeans stopped going into the office regularly in march 2020 to help curb the spread of covid 19 in europe unlike in the united states worker protections are widely regarded as entitlements laying off a staff member for instance can entail substantial severance pay without a promised european commission directive on how to legally frame the shift to more extensive working from home governments legislative responses have been patchy and piecemeal during the pandemic some countries have recommended teleworking others like portugal have demanded it most eu countries have specific legislation on teleworking though with different approaches and others are considering it through amendments extensions or conventions as home working grew in recent years workers right to disconnect allowing staff to ignore work matters outside formal working hours was adopted before the pandemic in countries such as germany france italy spain and belgium it is now becoming the standard but portugal is putting the onus on companies the employer has a duty to refrain from contacting the employee outside working hours except in situations of force majeure meaning an unanticipated or uncontrollable event the new law says also parents or caregivers with children up to 8 years old have the right to work from home if they choose as long as the type of work they do is compatible with teleworking fines for companies breaking the law go up to almost 10 000 euros 11 200 for each infringement the portuguese rules are meant to address the downside of what has become known as wfh the technology that enables working from home has also opened the door to abuses such as drawn out workdays as staff remain reachable outside their normal eight hour shift the consequences may include attrition between work and private life and a sense of isolation but the new law has met with skepticism from those it is intended to protect andreia sampaio 37 works in communications in lisbon the portuguese capital she agrees with the law s purpose but thinks it is too general and will be very hard to enforce we have to have common sense she said adding that she doesn t mind being contacted out of hours if it s an urgent matter we have to judge each case by its merits prompted by the pandemic but designed to apply in the post pandemic future the law could come into force as soon as dec 1 it is largely the brainchild of the center left socialist party which has governed portugal since 2015 ahead of an election for a new government on jan 30 it is keen to burnish its progressive credentials and hoist a banner about workers rights nevertheless practical questions abound must staff be taken off company email lists when their shift finishes and then put back on when they start work again what about europeans who work in financial markets and need to know what s going on in say hong kong and have colleagues working in different time zones what if an industrial machine that can t be stopped requires the attention of an engineer who s off who is it that can t contact the employee the department supervisor the company ceo what constitutes contact a phone call a text message an email the devil is always in the details but also in the implementation said jon messenger a specialist on working conditions at the international labor organization a united nations agency based in geneva the portuguese business confederation the country s largest grouping of companies wasn t involved in drawing up the new law and thinks it is full of holes teleworking rules need to be flexible tailored to each sector and negotiated between employers and staff says luís henrique of the confederation s legal department we re treating situations that are completely different as if they were all the same that s not realistic henrique said the law can t be one size fits all policing and enforcing the new rules may also be challenging in what is one of the eu s economically poorest countries in portugal which is notorious for red tape and slow justice and poorly resourced public services how long will it take to resolve a complaint across europe over the past decade the number of labor inspections has collapsed according to data analyzed by the brussels based european trade union confederation which represents 45 million members in 39 european countries the country with the biggest drop in the number of inspections since 2010 portugal with 55 fewer checks up to 2018 ambitious progressive laws run up against the reality that ways of policing them aren t in place yet said henrique of portugal s business confederation

population is vaccinated although many developed countries are providing third dose promoters less than 7 of people in low income countries have received the first shot of covid 19 according to medical and human rights groups seth berkley co director of the gavi vaccine alliance which co leads the covax initiative with the who said it was essential to promote the correct distribution of vaccines so that more variants of the coronavirus could emerge although we need to know more about omicron we know that while large parts of the world s population are unvaccinated the variant will continue to appear and the pandemic will continue to spread he told reuters we will prevent the emergence of variants only if we are able to protect the entire population of the world not just the rich parts
a newly identified coronavirus variant that has sparked global restrictions on travel and shaken financial markets could make the critical holiday season even more perilous in california and across the nation even before the omicron variant was discovered health officials were warning of a winter wave of covid 19 as society regroups for holiday events and travel and cold weather keeps more people indoors while it s not clear how dangerous the new variant is it s adding urgency to efforts to get more people vaccinated and to get booster shots for those with waning immunity and to follow masking and other safety rules experts say advertisement the new variant adds another reminder that there are more new variants out there that are potentially incubating said dr eric topol director of the scripps research translational institute in la jolla so if anything the silver lining of omicron is it s a wakeup call for all those people thinking we re at the end of this no we re not not by any stretch unfortunately while no cases of the omicron variant have been detected in the united states many experts say it may already be here given the country s lack of systematic genomic sequencing that would flag it the variant first identified in south africa amid a spike in infections there has more mutations than any scientists have seen including some that may make the virus more resistant to immunity generated from previous infections or vaccines but much isn t known including whether the variant is more transmissible results in more severe illness or reduces the efficacy of vaccines advertisement we are in a constant battle with this virus said dr kirsten bibbins domingo chair of uc san francisco s department of epidemiology and biostatistics we have to always be vigilant and we neither have to overreact to this or assume that there is no threat at all california will go into december in better shape than many other states new coronavirus cases in california have decreased slightly in recent weeks after ticking upward in late october but there continue to be hot spots in california where the delta variant s impact on hospitals remains high in the central valley some hospitals are overwhelmed with covid 19 patients nearly 64 of californians are fully vaccinated according to the times vaccine tracker but that figure is too low to curb an expected fifth surge of covid 19 this winter there has been an uptick in demand for shots among 5 to 11 year olds and interest in booster shots is rising but authorities are concerned about lackluster rates of vaccination among young adults advertisement the specter of a potentially dangerous new variant comes as many report an overwhelming sense of pandemic fatigue as the health crisis approaches its third year the world health organization on friday named the new variant omicron and quickly classified it as a variant of concern the news prompted multiple countries including the u s to restrict travel from south africa and other african nations the u s travel restrictions take effect monday it clearly has been around for weeks it has been moving silently it takes a while for these kinds of things to come to your attention said dr robert schooley professor of infectious diseases at the uc san diego school of medicine advertisement still he said it is difficult to predict when the variant might pop up in california one of the things that makes it hard is that we may have seen it first in south africa because they have a more sophisticated system of tracking variants he said there is no evidence that the variant arose there he added it could have started anywhere with a connection to that nation while restricting travel could have benefits it s unlikely to prevent the variant from spreading he said advertisement it will give us more time to understand its properties to convince people who haven t been vaccinated that they have a moment to jump on things but it is not going to prevent it from becoming global he said we live in a global world the variant has about 50 mutations topol said of those 30 are in the spike protein which is targeted by vaccines and some monoclonal antibody therapies according to dr robert kim farley an epidemiologist and infectious diseases expert at the ucla fielding school of public health so the concern is will this variant have some ability to work around if you will our vaccines and some of our therapies kim farley said advertisement early observations suggest that could be the case with breakthrough infections reported in vaccinated people topol said we know breakthroughs are occurring and they have so far occurred with multiple vaccines he said that is in and of itself concerning and looking at the structure of the virus it could have the potential to basically override our immune response initial data suggest that the variant causes mild illness based on many of the cases followed in south africa topol said that would make sense from an evolutionary point of view as it s advantageous for a virus to become more infectious but less virulent kim farley said advertisement if a virus becomes so severe that it s killing most people then it will not travel much because it needs people that can transmit to others he said so in a sense the virus is seeking to increase transmissibility and usually to actually decrease its severity but although scientists can make educated guesses about how the variant behaves based on its genetic structure and initial reports more testing and observation is needed at the moment all of these questions really are still up in the air as to the answers and so that s why there s so much intense scrutiny going on in south africa and countries in southern africa as well as now the fact that it has been seen most recently in the u k the czech republic and belgium kim farley said and so the guard is up everywhere now to be looking for this new variant because no doubt it will be found in other places advertisement the variant has also been found in travelers to israel and hong kong germany and italy reported cases saturday afternoon when it comes to dealing with omicron california is well positioned compared to much of the country because elected officials have largely been in agreement with public health experts on imposing control methods like vaccination and masking requirements kim farley said even if the variant were to spread and generate a surge in hospital patients here the healthcare system has had plenty of practice in weathering these types of spikes that picture may be somewhat more complicated in the central valley where officials are already expecting a difficult winter due to relatively low vaccination rates advertisement california s statewide rate of full vaccination is slightly higher than the u s average which the centers for disease control and prevention estimates to be 60 but the rate remains well suboptimal topol said we need 90 of people at least who are vaccinated or have had a recent covid infection confirmed and we re not even close he said adding that this leaves millions of californians who need to gain immunity we are very vulnerable here and it can change quickly once it gets going it becomes exponential we ve seen this repeatedly and we haven t learned that lesson yet he urged people to take extra precautions during holiday gatherings including testing attendees and hosting events outdoors or if indoors with open windows and air filtration devices advertisement bibbins domingo added that common sense tactics include wearing a mask and evaluating whether to enter riskier travel situations scientists should also increase the frequency of deep analysis of the results of covid tests she said when you go to get a pcr test for example right now your pcr test is just telling you whether the swab you gave has the virus present or not she said but we can take that same swab and go right down to the pieces of dna that allow you to characterize that virus down to its molecular level advertisement now that scientists in south africa have raised the red flag about omicron those in the u s will likely carry out that more rigorous research with greater frequency bibbins domingo said the most important thing people can do is get vaccinated and get booster shots when they re eligible because even if the variant does render vaccines less effective they offer some protection and remain the best tool to fight the disease kim farley said it s anticipated that manufacturers will be able to rapidly adjust the formulations of vaccines to account for the variant if needed similar to how the flu shot is adjusted each year he added more than anything he said the emergence of the variant has shined a harsh light on exactly what will be needed to bring the pandemic under control global solidarity advertisement we really should think of the world as one human body he said and if we have a sore on our foot the brain cannot say i don t have to worry about it it s only the foot because ultimately that sore could become infected and the whole body dies times staff writer luke money

washington d c to encourage a drop in sky high gasoline prices president biden said the department of energy will release 50 million barrels of oil held in the u s strategic petroleum reserve the move aims to relieve the burden on americans who are paying more for gasoline than they have in years the white house said 32 million barrels of the overall 50 million will be released but eventually replenished in the reserve over the next few years while the remaining 18 million barrels are part of a sale authorized by congress biden has tried to pressure the 14 opec member countries and russia to pump more supply into the global market but this has had minimal effect his administration also partly blamed higher prices on the effects of the economic recovery from the covid 19 pandemic and blamed energy companies for alleged anti competitive behavior last week biden asked the federal trade commission to investigate whether illegal conduct is increasing prices there is mounting evidence that the declines in oil prices are not translating into lower prices at the pump the white house said according to us data americans paid an average 3 29 per gallon in october the highest price since september 2014 as we come out of an unprecedented global economic shutdown oil supply has not kept up with demand forcing working families and businesses to pay the price energy secretary jennifer granholm said as quoted by fox news as of 19th november the u s strategic reserve contained 604 5 million barrels according to the department of energy in 2020 the u s consumed some 18 19 million barrels of petroleum per day on average or a total of about 6 66 billion barrels of petroleum the lowest annual consumption since 1995

the world health organization classified b 1 1 529 as a variant of concern on monday morning austria s near 9 million residents woke to life in lockdown days later a new covid 19 variant set off alarm bells across the world europe and the u s slapped a travel ban on countries in southern africa and health officials raced to get ahead of a new threat it was the week the coronavirus reminded the world that the pandemic is far from over delivering a combination punch of escalating infections restrictions and a new mutation the developments marking a setback in the battle against the disease and a dent to the economic recovery slammed equities and oil prices governments went to the tried and tested virus fighting tools in their playbook as cases in europe spiked germany tightened restrictions for the unvaccinated france toughened rules on mask wearing and health passes and austria closed businesses from hotels to gyms belgium ordered nightclubs to close and banned the public from indoor sporting events the u k ruled out tightening pandemic rules but was quick to halt flights from six countries once news of the variant b 1 1 529 emerged the european union proposed the same measure as several of its member states went ahead and restricted travel for london it was a case of once bitten having learned the price of dithering when it was slow to react to the delta variant which has half as many mutations as b 1 1 529 travel bans may be unpopular in some quarters but it s easier than hitting a weary public at home with lockdowns and other curbs on socializing there s a sense that this script has become depressingly familiar after almost two years but that familiarity also leavens the sense of panic that s greeted the arrival of previous variants across europe peoples reaction to the recent news was far more muted than in the early months of the disease a shift from fear even panic to resignation this is the covid world the foreseeable future will bring rises and falls in infections variants intensive care needs and deaths as well as the accompanying litany of measures from masks to tests partial or full lockdowns travel limits and booster vaccines in italy for example the first european country to impose a nationwide lockdown in early 2020 gone are the days when people disinfected the supermarket shopping before it entered their homes and the daily toll of cases and fatalities monopolized attention back then italians watched aghast as army trucks were called into the northern town of bergamo to ferry coffins away because the crematorium could no longer cope a few days ago even as the country s daily infections were rising at the fastest pace in six months the mood was far different at a bar in a trendy area near rome s main railway station a group of locals celebrated a 50th birthday with freshly baked pizza and wine no one wore masks as the party goers milled about only a couple of the guests remarked afterward that staff had failed to check vaccination certificates as required by law as long as there are no further government directives related to the new variant people will keep on living their lives as usual said simone schnall professor of experimental social psychology at the university of cambridge there s currently a mix of emotions that also includes frustration or anger many people just won t be able to stomach the prospect of yet another largely compromised christmas biontech se which has developed one of the most widely used covid vaccines with pfizer inc offered another reason to not panic it expects data on how the variant interacts with its shot within two weeks a new version could be ready in 100 days and more protection against the disease is coming at some point in the form of anti viral pills covid moved into the human population through a biological accident said sarah pitt a virologist at the university of brighton i don t think we should be trying to live with it or accept that it will become endemic i think we should be trying to eliminate it as far as that is feasible in an interconnected world if the vaccines still offer a chance of that it wasn t what markets heard on friday they reacted to the variant body blow with a sell off european stocks fell the most since june 2020 the dow jones dropped more than 1 000 points at one stage and oil tumbled through 70 a barrel in new york for the first time since september u s treasuries jumped sending yields down the most in a year for aviation and other travel dependent segments the spread of a new variant threatens a return to

omicron is the fifth who designated variant of concern it was first detected in recent weeks in south africa which has seen an exponential rise in covid 19 cases there are about 30 mutations on the virus spike protein and scientists worry that some of them could make the virus easier to transmit but scientists do not yet know whether omicron is in fact more transmissible or dangerous worries about the new variant sent financial markets reeling friday and pushed the price of oil down by 10 a barrel the who said understanding the variant could take weeks and cautioned against travel restrictions its director of emergencies mike ryan urged no knee jerk responses ryan s advice went unheeded as travel restrictions were immediately reinstated in places including britain the european union canada and the us other countries such as india japan israel turkey switzerland and the united arab emirates enacted some form of travel curbs reuters reported some epidemiologists warned that they were likely too late omicron has already been found in belgium botswana israel and hong kong dozens of passengers disembarking in the netherlands from flights from south africa initially tested positive for the coronavirus travelers with a positive test result will be placed in isolation at a hotel at or near schiphol dutch health authorities said in a statement of the positive test results we are researching as quickly as possible whether they are the new variant of concern travel restrictions and quarantine requirements in switzerland in reaction to omicron have caused the world trade organization to postpone its biennial meeting originally set to begin tuesday one of the main agenda items for the gathering was improving the availability of covid 19 vaccines several of the ministers and delegates would not be able to attend the meeting because of the restrictions director general ngozi okonjo iweala said this has not been an easy recommendation to make she said but as director general my priority is the health and safety of all mc12 participants ministers delegates and civil society but some authorities have held out hope that early detection of the new variant coupled with the new restrictions could have a bigger impact than the initial response to delta variant jeffrey barrett director of covid 19 genetics at the wellcome sanger institute in hinxton england told the associated press with delta it took many many weeks into india s terrible wave before it became clear what was going on and delta had already seeded itself in many places in the world and it was too late to do anything about it he said we may be at an earlier point with this new variant so there may still be time to do something about it the south african government has called the travel restrictions rushed and raised concerns about the impact on business the ceo of south africa s inbound tourism association david frost says the effects will be devastating on the sector we got off the red list in october and it was sorely needed we ve been shut down for over 18 months frost said you know the industry really is on its knees the impact of this is absolutely dire to livelihoods to families south african tourism minister lindiwe sisulu told the new york times that her country is feeling punished for the omicron research its scientists have done dr michelle groome head of the division of public health surveillance and response at south africa s national institute for communicable diseases said social distancing and mask use could help combat the virus but she questioned the efficacy of travel bans we haven t been able to contain the spread initially of the original virus and all subsequent variants have spread globally you know groome said i think there s limited value in terms of these restrictions instead she said vaccinating more of the population would help prevent the most severe cases and deaths low vaccination rates roughly 35 per cent of the south africa s adult population is vaccinated a figure far below targets of 70 per cent figures are even lower across much of the african continent experts have warned vaccine inequality would create a breeding ground for virus mutations astrid haas is an independent urban economist in kampala uganda in europe now and in north america in particular they re talking about booster shots and third vaccines whereas we know now from the who that less than 10 per cent of african countries are going to even meet their vaccine target for this year just a very sad manifestation of the global vaccine inequity she said in the absence of vaccinations lockdowns may be on the horizon
washington cnn the us and its allies restart iran nuclear talks on monday unsure how tehran s new government will approach negotiations not optimistic about the prospects ahead and emphasizing that if diplomacy fails the us is prepared to use other options the parties to the joint comprehensive plan of action will reconvene in vienna after almost six months to discuss a mutual return to the deal by both the us and iran but the hiatus has given time for new obstacles to take root on friday iran announced yet more advances in its uranium enrichment which reduces the amount of time tehran would need to develop a nuclear weapon if it chooses to an announcement clearly meant to give iran leverage when it arrives in vienna for talks other parties to the agreement including germany the uk britain france china and russia are coming into the talks calling for negotiations to pick up where they left off european sources tell cnn they expect the iranians to treat the meeting as round one us officials have expressed similar concerns the recently elected hardline government in tehran will send a new set of negotiators to vienna who have been emphasizing the need for complete us sanctions relief not compliance with the deal while us officials have said they have absolutely no plans to offer iran incentives to talk the time to choose is short and senior us officials have repeatedly warned that if advances in iran s nuclear program and enrichment capability continue unabated they could render the benefits of the jcpoa moot a development that would force the us to pursue other options we are still hopeful that diplomacy can find a way brett mcgurk the national security council s coordinator for the middle east and north africa told the manama dialogue organized by the international institute for strategic studies but if it cannot find a way we are prepared to use other options there is no question we are not going to allow iran to get a nuclear weapon period mcgurk said and when it came to military force for behavior change that is a pretty fuzzy objective for a military force when it comes to military force to prevent a country from obtaining a nuclear weapon that is a very achievable objective us special envoy for iran rob malley said in a tweet after a november 18 meeting with middle eastern allies and european parties to the deal that iran could choose one of two paths continued nuclear escalation crisis or mutual return to the jcpoa creating opportunities for regional economic diplomatic ties time to choose is short malley wrote sources familiar with preparations for the talks say that the parties were closely watching international atomic energy agency director rafael grossi s visit to tehran last week seeing it as an indication of iran s approach to the talks in vienna those sources said grossi told the iaea board afterward that the talks were inconclusive one of the contentious issues remaining is that iran is refusing inspectors from the iaea monitoring access to the karaj centrifuge production facility which reports suggest has resumed operations this is seriously affecting the ability to restore continuity of knowledge at the workshop which has been widely recognized as essential in relation to a return to the jcpoa grossi told a board of governors meeting on wednesday the arms control association noted that iran s refusal to allow the iaea to install new cameras or confirm that production hasn t restarted could undermine attempts to revitalize the jcpoa and its strict verification regime if it isn t possibly to fully complete records of iran s nuclear program tehran s refusal to grant access to karaj also drives speculation and concern about what exactly iran is doing the aca said no choice on thursday the us mission to international organizations in vienna told the iaea meeting that if iran s non cooperation is not immediately remedied especially the restoration of continuity of knowledge at karaj the board will have no choice but to reconvene in extraordinary session before the end of this year in order to address the crisis meanwhile on friday iran announced its stock of 60 enriched uranium has grown to 66 pounds 30 kilograms and its amount of 20 enriched uranium had also increased both levels are much closer to weapons grade uranium which is enriched above 90 according to the arms control association enriching uranium to 20 constitutes about 90 percent of the necessary work to enrich to weapons grade as iran s stockpiles grow the aca says its breakout time or the time it would take to produce enough uranium enriched to weapons grade for one bomb decreases the aca estimates that iran s current breakout time is likely about one month down from 12 months when the jcpoa was fully implemented enrichment was limited under the jcpoa which the us left unilaterally in may 2018 under former president donald trump iran restarted enrichment last year to pressure the us to ease sanctions a very uncertain proposition state department spokesman ned price reflected the ambiguity surrounding the resumed talks on november 22 calling the mutual return to compliance with the jcpoa a very uncertain proposition the next day price told reporters in washington that it is our hope that the new government in iran shows up in vienna and shows up in vienna ready to negotiate in good faith to build on the progress that had been achieved in the previous six rounds of negotiations but he added that the us has been very clear that we are not prepared to take unilateral steps solely for the benefit of greasing the wheel to get the talks going again former president donald trump pulled the us from the deal in 2018 sources familiar with the preparations for the talks have told cnn that the us and its allies are not at a point where they would begin offering iran confidence building measures but one official said there is a possibility the us and its allies could employ them down the road as a result incentives for iran won t be discussed at this week s meetings in vienna where the us and allies will be focused on simply taking the temperature and seeking to advance from where they left off months ago us and european sources explained plan b everyone involved in the talks is mindful of the ticking clock the sources told cnn that there s still time to reach a deal but it would likely run out by the end of next year for now they said there is no hard and fast plan b yet critics of the deal say that the biden administration has sacrificed leverage by easing pressure on iran while it builds up its nuclear program the biden administration s iran policy is failing and without a significant course correction that policy will either result in iranian nuclear weapons or in a war to stop that development said mark dubowitz the ceo of foundation for defense of democracies dubowitz argued that the administration s approach will allow iran to rebuild toward a lethal end state of with pathways to nuclear weapons and a robust nuclear infrastructure israel is going to have no choice but to use military force to stop iran s nuclear weapons before tehran reaches this lethal end state dubowitz said israeli prime minister naftali bennett has been making clear that israel will be prepared to act if necessary addressing delegates at a security conference near tel aviv on tuesday bennett said that if there is a return to the jcpoa israel obviously is not a party to the agreement and is not obligated by it bennett complained that after the nuclear deal was signed in 2015 the state of israel simply went to sleep we were occupied with other things we will learn from this mistake we will maintain our freedom of action he said western officials have tried to argue to the israelis that attacks on israel s nuclear program are not very useful when the overall goal is to come up with a comprehensive solution and especially when the iranians have sped up their capability to rebuild after attacks sources familiar with the iran talks have told cnn western officials have also raised the danger of iran responding with kinetic action but sources familiar with the talks say israeli officials still seem to think that it is still an effective tool to show their capabilities asked about those warnings price said that at the end of the day the united states and israel we share a common objective here and that is to see to it that iran is verifiably and permanently prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon and we continue to believe that diplomacy in coordination with our allies and partners and that of course includes israel is the best path to achieve that goal we ve also been very clear that this is not a process that can go on indefinitely and if the iranians through their actions or through their inactions demonstrate or suggest that they lack that good faith that they lack that clarity of purpose we ll have to turn to other means price said tuesday we have a variety of other means we re discussing those with our allies and partners diplomatic flurry in recent weeks us officials have conducted a flurry of diplomacy with regional powers and other parties to the deal working to forge a united front president joe biden met with european partners to discuss iran during the june g7 meetings in the uk in recent weeks secretary of state antony blinken has also conferred with european allies as well as china and russia on iran and malley recently met with gulf countries israeli officials and european partners in the jcpoa i think the iranians believe they have some eastward option with russia and china in which they can circumvent the pressure of sanctions mcgurk said on sunday and that is just wrong and so i think we are approaching the talks at the end of november as a pretty united front with the p5 1
inflation is soaring businesses are struggling to hire and president joe biden s poll numbers have been in free fall the white house sees a common culprit for it all covid 19 biden s team views the pandemic as the root cause of both the nation s malaise and his own political woes finally controlling covid 19 the white house believes is the skeleton key to rejuvenating the country and reviving biden s own standing but the coronavirus challenge has proved to be vexing for the white house with last summer s premature claims of victory swamped by the more transmissible delta variant millions of americans going unvaccinated and lingering economic effects from the pandemic s darkest days all of that as yet another variant of the virus omicron emerged overseas it is worrying public health officials leading to new travel bans and panicking markets as scientists race to understand how dangerous it may be although the economy has actually been coming back there are multiple signs that covid 19 will leave its scars even if the pandemic fades for now in the administration s view an intransigent minority that is resisting vaccination is spoiling the recovery for the rest of the country forcing masks on the vaccinated and contributing to lingering anxiousness everywhere you look related denver revives mask mandate other cities relax rules amid rising covid 19 cases asked why americans aren t getting the message that the economy is improving white house press secretary jen psaki said this past week we re still in the middle of fighting a pandemic and people are sick and tired of that we are too the state of affairs she said affects everything from how people feel about sending their kids out the door to the price for a gallon of gas the administration views vaccination mandates as critical not only to preventing avoidable illness and death but to safeguarding the economic recovery and salvaging biden s political position we have the tools to accelerate the path out of this pandemic widely available white house covid 19 coordinator jeff zients told a coronavirus briefing while he ruled out large scale lockdowns like the united states experienced in 2020 and like those popping up again across europe zients renewed the administration s appeals for more americans to get their shots but on friday the discovery of the new variant in southern africa had much of the world acting to shut down travel from the region and contain a threat that the world health organization suggested could be worse than the ravaging waves from delta related omicron variant emerges in more countries as world on high alert inside the white house and among allies of the president there has been frustration for weeks over the slow government action to approve booster shots for all adults the regulatory process they fear contributed to misinformation and confusion around the boosters and means the nation isn t optimally protected for the holiday season biden on friday appealed for unvaccinated americans to be responsible and get the shot and for those eligible for a booster to get that too that is the minimum that everyone should be doing we always talk about whether this is about freedom but i think it s a patriotic responsibility to do that still for all the hand wringing over biden s sagging standing with americans democrats say a turnaround may be within reach from trump to biden people have gone from feeling like it s mourning again in america to feeling on the cusp of morning again in america said party strategist jesse ferguson getting past the pandemic unlocks the door for the economy for our way of life and for people feeling less divided he added to biden s critics though it s a stretch to blame all the nation s problems on covid 19 or to think that containing the virus will solve them senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky in fact puts the blame for high prices on biden s big pandemic relief package saying recently there is no question what is keeping working americans awake at night inflation the runaway prices and unpredictability that democrats policies have fueled the lingering effects of the virus have taken a toll on the president s approval ratings even if his handling of the virus has been seen as a relative strength in an october ap norc poll 54 of americans said they approved of biden s job on the pandemic that was somewhat higher than his approval rating overall and much higher than approval on his handling of the economy at 48 and 41 respectively as recently as july 66 had approved of biden on covid 19 and 59 approved of his job performance overall in last month s poll only about one third of americans said the nation was heading in the right direction down from about half in late february views of the economy have dimmed as well with only about one third saying conditions are good compared with close to half in september related biden to release 50m barrels of oil from strategic petroleum reserve to lower prices to the white house fixing blame on the pandemic is emerging as a modern version of the old it s the economy stupid mantra from the bill clinton years when psaki was pressed on what the administration was doing to contain higher prices she replied we know what the root causes of those are right global supply chain issues the best thing we can do as the government is to get the pandemic under control that s what the president s number one focus is the same message ripples throughout the administration as long as the pandemic continues there will be pandemic driven shortages which is why the best way to fix that is to end the pandemic transportation secretary pete buttigieg said recently stressing the need for vaccination energy secretary jennifer granholm speaking about the administration s response to spiking gasoline prices said getting people vaccinated was the ultimate answer economists largely endorse the sentiment but caution that the solution is not simple the root of the problems in the economy is the virus said harvard economist james stock and the best way to minimize the spread of the virus is to increase vaccinations it s the number one economic policy in my mind but with experts predicting that covid 19 is becoming endemic stock said you ve got to be realistic that it s not going to go away even if the virus fades economists warn there will be harmful lingering effects goldman sachs noted in a recent analysis that roughly half of the 5 million people who have left the labor force since the pandemic have retired making it harder for businesses to regain lost jobs work by stanford university economist nicholas bloom and others indicates that companies expect more people to keep working from home and shopping online a problem for local retailers that depend on office workers to buy lunch and people to return to stores just 5 of americans total work days were at home pre pandemic a figure that is now 25 according to bloom more than three quarters of workers surveyed by his colleagues and him would prefer to have at least one day a week working from home and nearly one third would rather work from home for all five days this could make it harder for employers to evaluate their workers and efficiently use office space the administration is also dealing with a global economy so solving pandemic issues at home has its limits coronavirus outbreaks in asia shut down computer chip plants worsening the shortage of semiconductors one sign that vaccination worldwide could be as critical as the administration s domestic efforts one of the rationales for biden s infrastructure spending to strengthen the supply chain is to minimize the damage from these shutdowns if a factory in malaysia shuts down due to a covid outbreak which they have it causes a ripple effect that can slow down auto manufacturing in detroit biden said in one recent speech why they can t get the computer chips they need ___ associated press writers josh boak and hannah fingerhut contributed to this report

across the state consulted he was chairman of the state commission on uniform laws from 1902 until 1907 pollard began his public career when he won a seat to the virginia constitutional convention of 1901 1902 as the second youngest delegate he proposed that the word christian be removed from the constitution s preamble a proposition that while defeated provoked controversy he also voted against the suffrage provision that would disfranchise a large segment of the black vote which was the primary reason for the convention as well as much of the white vote through a poll tax and other schemes

in 1926 began consulting pollard on tax questions although skeptical of byrd s credentials the ever independent pollard was won over by the governor s progressive agenda to reorganize state government and the tax system he advised the reorganization effort and campaigned energetically for the amendments that would implement the changes the relationship with byrd was cemented by pollard s work in the 1928 presidential campaign where pollard encountered his old nemesis james cannon now a methodist bishop who was supporting the republican candidate for u s president herbert hoover in his effort to advance prohibition and regain political prominence in virginia cannon apparently offered pollard his support in the governor s race the following year if he would shift his support to hoover from the democratic candidate al smith who opposed prohibition fearful of cannon s threat to byrd s programs and angry over the religious attacks against the catholic smith pollard remained loyal to the party and campaigned unsuccessfully for smith s election
