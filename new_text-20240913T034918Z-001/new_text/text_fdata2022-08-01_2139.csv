san francisco california a u s federal judge has ruled that ride sharing company uber has not violated a federal law protecting people with disabilities even though it does not offer wheelchair accessible vehicles in every market it serves san francisco federal court chief judge richard seeborg ruled against two plaintiffs from new orleans and one from jackson mississippi who use electric wheelchairs and argued that uber s failure to provide rides in their home cities violated the americans with disabilities act seeborg said it was unreasonable to require the san francisco based company to accommodate the plaintiffs because of the cost but he rejected uber s claim that it was excused because it had done more than its fair share in other cities uber estimated the bare minimum annual costs to team up with commercial providers of wheelchair accessible vehicles was 800 000 in new orleans or about 400 per ride and 550 000 in jackson mississippi or about 1 000 per ride even if the money was spent wheelchair users would likely face significant wait times as well as gaps of eight to 14 hours a day when no rides would be available seeborg said while ruling against plaintiffs scott crawford from jackson and stephan namisnak and francis falls from new orleans usin a statement uber said we welcome the outcome and are proud of our efforts to improve accessibility for all users from 2018 to 2020 uber said it spent more than 150 million to provide wheelchair accessible vehicles in new york los angeles chicago houston phoenix philadelphia austin san francisco washington boston and portland oregon according to court papers
herald reporter demand for the new zimbabwean gold coins has been overwhelming and banks have been inundated by their corporate and individual customers seeking a legal and sensible way of preserving value the reserve bank of zimbabwe introduced the coins a week ago to help cushion corporates and individuals from the negative impact of declining cash values and mop up large sums of zimbabwe dollars sloshing around in some bank accounts of corporates and wealthy individuals in an interview with zimpapers radio bankers association of zimbabwe president mr fanwell mutogo said banks were now seeking to replenish their stocks of gold coins following a huge demand that saw them exhaust their initial allocations the demand for the gold coins has been overwhelming both from individuals and corporates although the ratio is in favour of corporates most banks are now in the process of ordering more coins from the reserve bank of zimbabwe to replenish their stocks he said the gold coins each holding one troy ounce of gold are minted at the fidelity gold refineries and are being sold through normal banking channels and reserve bank agencies the price is the price of a troy ounce of gold plus a 10 percent minting charge in an interview with the sunday mail rbz monetary policy committee member mr percy gwanyanya concurred with mr mutogo on the demand and noted that even those that were critical of the policy of selling bullion coins were anxious to be considered he said the whole idea of the gold coins is to provide a viable alternative to the united states dollar as a store of value that is necessary to deal with inflation and currency depreciation which were being driven by the high demand for the us dollar the auction system has mainly been catering for the constituency that is in international trade said mr gwanyanya he said there are some people or institutions with huge sums of local currency on hand and they need to be catered for by having access to facilities that enable them to store value and protect them against exchange rate changes that same process also returns those huge sums in unused local currency back to the reserve bank instead of having it in the hands of black market dealers where it would be used for manipulation many were breaking the law by going to the black market to buy us dollars to stash away in safes and trunks but now they can legally buy the coins instead and their purchases take the local currency used to buy the coins out of circulation with inflation in the united states at almost 10 percent the coins are likely to appreciate against the us dollar in the medium term at least mr gwanyanya said the common question that might be asked by many people relates to the high cost of gold coin that is linked initially to the value of one ounce something that might create an impression that they were not accessible to everyone in the economy so if one ounce is going for us 1 800 plus how many of us can afford the gold coins here is the answer gold coins are a policy instrument that the reserve bank of zimbabwe is using to mop up excess liquidity given the structure of the economy where liquidity is in the hands of a few contractors institutional investors and pension funds there is need to mop up that liquidity from these institutions so initially they are the target although there are no restrictions to anyone those that have significant local currency balances but it is a starting point said mr gwanyanya although some are saying there will be arbitrage but we cannot just sit and watch because we are afraid he said because confidence levels are very low there is a need for an instrument that is very attractive for it to be subscribed to and that was the gold coins a lot of the arbitrage risks were diminished when the reserve bank forced banks to investigate loan applications fully and shoved up the minimum interest rate to 200 percent this makes it both difficult and very expensive for anyone to borrow money to buy coins with loans being the main source of arbitrage funds but those with accounts holding unborrowed funds it is easy to buy from their banks we must understand what we call the transition mechanism this is whereby there is a gold rush from those with zimbabwean dollars as you have started to see even those who initially complained now want to be considered and have access to the gold coins said mr gwanyanya members of the public spoken to welcomed the introduction of the gold coins from what we have been told and what we have read it seems to be a good idea our concern is how as ordinary persons we can have access to them said ms shylet muradzikwa of glen view a vendor in harare s central business district ms nosta machemedze said the central bank should raise public awareness in rural communities while a lot has been said about gold coins in the mainstream media a lot needs to be done in the rural areas and other remote areas who might not have access to newspapers or television and such other medium of communication said ms machemedze mr pedzisai muraga a retired civil servant concurred saying taking the information to the rural areas was consistent with president mnangagwa s policy of leaving no one and no place behind in terms of development this can be achieved through educating community leaders such as traditional leaders and councillors so the message can be taken by local members of parliament but there is a need to ensure that the objective of the gold coins is better understood he said other countries that have minted gold coins usually major gold producers although britain imports gold to mint its version started with the one ounce coin usually massing a bit more since the gold is alloyed a bit to make it harder but with the gold content still one ounce then smaller coins were minted later on to allow ordinary people to have a stake in gold
opportunity often comes disguised in the form of misfortune or temporary defeat napoleon hill is it weird that the best investment of all time is now practically universally ignored a single dollar invested into tobacco companies at the turn of the 20th century would be worth over 7 million today an annual compound return of over 14 percent for over a century nothing else comes close but now with the rising influence of esg the amount of available capital willing to invest in the industry continues to shrink and major financial institutions controlling trillions of dollars are leading the revolt with new mandates to avoid sin stocks they ve sold billions of dollars worth of related equities driving prices down to significantly lower multiples along with abysmally low investor interest and sentiment the public is very aware of the health consequences of combustible products and governments have sprung into action with heavyhanded regulation headlines and pundits continually tout that the tobacco industry is doomed are they correct i don t think so and i believe there is compelling data that explains why in this article i aim to clear up a few things are cigarettes a thing of the past the new generation of nicotine products the great re nicotinization stakeholder perspectives future growth and profitability let s dive in this post is public want to help support invariant please share it with a few friends or on your favorite social platform share are cigarettes a thing of the past cigarettes are cheap easy to make high margin reliable have a large total addressable market and create loyal repeat buyers they re nearly a perfect product but there is an obvious flaw the well known health consequences of using combustible products aren t just bad for users for producers there s a clear downside in the fact that the most ardent customers on average live shorter lives and thus can t keep purchasing the product so are cigarettes going away no cigarettes will be a thing of the past but not yet volumes aren t falling as fast as people think retail sales do not capture illicit trade nor do they cover locally manufactured or nonmachine manufactured products such as bidis beedis india and papirosy russia these numbers are for 2017 2020 and fluctuations are to be expected for example covid lockdowns bolstered volumes for many countries despite having experienced more substantial decreases prior while other countries experience accelerated declines also the first half of 2022 has been notably impactful for volumes in the u s one of the most lucrative individual countries with total volumes estimated to have dropped 7 5 year over year thought to be primarily caused by higher gas prices leading to fewer purchasing trips but even volume declines haven t been disastrous price hikes have largely offset cigarette volume declines allowing ongoing often growing profitability i believe major operators will continue to produce impressive returns from their cigarette brands but eventually that parade will come to an end with that said this is only part of the big picture the new generation of nicotine products over the last decade we ve seen rrps reduced risk products such as ends electronic nicotine delivery systems vapes heated tobacco products htp also known as hnb or heat not burn and tobacco free nicotine pouches tfnp also known as monp modern oral nicotine pouches enter the market ends are noncombustible battery operated devices that heat a nicotine liquid the base of which is normally propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin to produce an aerosol which is then inhaled htps are battery powered systems that produce nicotine containing emissions by heating tobacco critically htps heat but do not burn tobacco which is cited to expose users to fewer harmful and potentially harmful constituents hphcs when compared to cigarettes tfnps are small oral pouches normally made of plant based fibers and contain tobacco free nicotine water and flavorings unlike traditional dip oral nicotine pouches do not require the user to spit nor do they appear to stain teeth or have a scent meaning they can be used completely discretely while research is never ending much of the scientific community and many governments are largely in agreement that these products are substantially safer than combustible products like cigarettes murkett r rugh m ding b 2020 september 16 nicotine products relative risk assessment a systematic review and meta analysis the great re nicotinization someone beat me to the punch in coining the phrase re nicotinization but i am happy to embrace it i first heard the term here the thought process is simple and works along the lines of humans historically embrace substances to enhance alter how they think and feel awareness of the negative health consequences of smoking paired with certain regulations is reducing smoking rates what would happen if people could easily access nicotine while avoiding many of the health concerns as well as social stigma if you conclude nicotine usage would increase you are correct looking at the above global data two things should stand out while volumes of legacy products like cigarettes and smokeless tobacco chew snuff etc are shrinking volumes of all other nicotine products are growing at varying degrees every nicotine product segment has been growing in total retail value that s astounding but it s worth digging deeper here s a regional breakdown with regions segmented based on the who classifications eoy 2020 key markets western pacific china japan the philippines south korea australia key markets south east asia indonesia india thailand bangladesh key markets eastern mediterranean egypt saudi arabia iraq key markets africa algeria nigeria south africa ethiopia kenya key markets europe russia germany france italy spain the united kingdom turkey key markets americas usa brazil argentina canada mexico there are a few things to note the china national tobacco corporation cntc is the world s largest producer of cigarettes and predominantly serves the massive chinese domestic market china is also a disproportional driver of cigar demand and cntc is responsible for selling nearly half of all cigarettes in the world but is a state majority owned entity the americas and europe account for the highest value share in almost all categories africa has a total population similar to the americas and europe but is by far the smallest region in terms of overall retail value equating to just 1 3 of total retail sales value the data above includes factors such as the 2019 vaping ban in india as well as the south african 5 month total ban on tobacco product sales that occurred in 2020 during covid lockdowns snus an oral tobacco product has been around for centuries on a relative basis research suggests it is less harmful than even htps but is grouped into smokeless tobacco which includes other higher risk legacy products also remember as previously noted overall retail sales data do not capture illicit trade or include locally manufactured nonmachine manufactured products such as bidis beedis india or papirosy russia though oddly this data does include factory made hand rolled kreteks which are a major product category in indonesia with all that considered there s something exciting in the above data that is harder to see until it s revisualized look below at the recent growth rates for heated tobacco products htp and tobacco free nicotine pouches tfnp granted htps and tfnps are still relatively nascent so this growth is coming off small bases with that said the future runway appears enormous and critically major producers have spent years optimizing these new products scaling production working with regulators and going through the painstaking logistical hoops of mapping distribution getting retailers onboard and raising consumer awareness but it s all starting to come together for additional context see the below chart htps have almost zero presence outside of europe and the western pacific tfnps have no presence outside of the americas and europe and vaping is similar so not only are these products growing quickly off of small bases the majority of the world is a nearly untapped market retail value in current nominal terms fixed 2020 exchange rates usd stakeholder perspectives let s briefly step back into history and remember how unstoppable nicotine has been as i stated in previous writing in early seventeenth century russia smoking tobacco was banned because smoke was associated with evil spirits as a result if you were caught smoking you d experience a lovely punishment such as having your nostrils torn open lips cut off or a usually fatal flogging russia was not alone in its efforts executions were a common punishment in the ottoman empire and china as well and persia going for style points would pour molten lead down offenders throats japan more humanely would simply imprison smokers and confiscate all of their belongings if monarchs and dictators using the threat of death could not stop tobacco usage what would make the progressive democracies and republics of today fair any better simply put there is no way to put the genie back in the bottle this is not to say that we should not regulate tobacco and nicotine or that all historical regulation has been right or wrong rather it seems most practical to cheer for regulation that further thwarts underage access and usage of tobacco and nicotine while at the same time providing ample information resources and options for adult consumers to make informed choices governments have largely shifted from prohibitionist tactics to health education and taxation methods to curb usage in the process they ve inadvertently become addicted to the excise tax revenue that tobacco provides with that in mind let s think about the primary stakeholders here consumers governments producer companies everyone is likely to align consumers should be able to access safer nicotine in various rrp forms as awareness of these products spread they gain social acceptance governments around the world are beginning to adopt harm reduction strategies working to shift smokers to rrps although there are notable exceptions to this such as india banning all vaping in 2019 and the u s fda which claims to be focused on harm reduction but has recently taken actions that would likely push people back to cigarettes to incentivize smokers to switch to rrps governments are likely to overall tax such products at lower rates than cigarettes to ensure safety and efficacy governments create steep regulatory hurdles for new nicotine products costing significant time and money which limits new entrants into the space a lack of significant competition paired with the differential between excise taxes on combustible products and rrps can make rrps cheaper for consumers and also potentially more profitable for producers substituting cigarettes for effective rrps should lead to longer healthier lives for users and will ultimately increase clv these points are exceedingly simple which means that some government ineptitude will probably find ways to muck it up even currently the world health organization seems to be on board with thwarting the proliferation of rrps stating that new products such as htps should be taxed in line with legacy combustible products despite rrps being an incredibly effective way to curb cigarette consumption though it s worth remembering any adverse policy targeting rrps will likely reduce decelerations in cigarette volumes that type of protective insulation is partly the driving force behind my altria thesis future growth and profitability overall trends have been minimally impacted since the referenced 2017 2020 global data concerning category growth rates was published last year however there are some additional considerations to weigh to name a just few changes in currency exchange rates regulatory changes regarding product allowance production and importation in various jurisdictions excise tax modifications covid reopening income disparities across the world impact consumers ability to purchase different products different cultures may be more less receptive to new products attempting to factor in these considerations is difficult using global data softening continued cigarette pricing power and modeling persistent but decelerating growth across high growth rrp categories results in something that looks like this the above charts showcase total retail value maintaining a 2 75 cagr throughout 2031 and notably a 13 13 cagr for rrps during that same period but these charts only convey retail value not profitability profitability as mentioned prior should steadily increase as rrps take a greater share and are likely to be taxed at lower rates relative to cigarettes this is especially true because of something else none of these charts fully capture again improved relative health should meaningfully increase clv if and when overall cigarette profitability begins to decline rrps will persist as a value creating engine for the industry i d prefer to avoid trying to get clever but in an effort to reasonably estimate category growth from an investor s perspective it may make sense to look at global data with the western pacific region excluded this removes china a market that is largely dominated by a state majority owned company as well as japan in which htp already has 30 share this approach isn t meant to pinpoint and predict the future but rather to present a hopefully more conservative estimation for the rest of the world the chart below is exactly this and reflects obvious lower volumes and different growth dynamics including a more substantial deceleration in cigarette volumes however one aspect is still the same the retail value across all segments has been steadily increasing from an investment perspective it would also make sense to attempt isolating and excluding russian volumes if you believe major tobacco companies will follow through with divesting their interests in the country and finally it makes sense to mention the major nicotine companies of the world china national tobacco corp british american tobacco plc philip

some places do power rankings here at cageside we do a stock report in this weekly series we identify three superstars or groups of superstars who are on their way up and three that are moving in the opposite direction after a busy week that was capped off with summerslam 2022 a lot of fortunes were changed with that in mind let s see whose stock increased the most this week stock up 3 drew mcintyre drew mcintyre defeated sheamus in an irish donnybrook on smackdown and will now challenge roman reigns for the wwe universal championship at next month s clash at the castle in cardiff wales with an expected capacity in the range of 70 000 fans it will be the highest attended wwe show of the year which might make this the appropriate stage for roman reigns to finally drop the title drew will be booked as a very serious threat to the tribal chief stock up 2 logan paul logan paul did the impossible and got himself cheered in a victory at summerslam 2022 the youtube star wowed the audience with his tremendous performance in the match highlighted by an insane frog splash through a table on the outside of the ring how can anybody boo that i recently used the term train wreck to describe the concept of logan paul as a babyface but he s quickly making a fool out of me and all the other doubters it turns out that logan paul is a good pro wrestler and he s capable of winning an audience over with his impressive skills in the ring stock up 1 raw women s division a big splash was made at summerslam when bayley finally returned to wwe and she brought io shirai iyo sky and dakota kai along with her becky lynch turned babyface in the same angle setting up a future conflict pitting bayley sky kai against lynch bianca belair when you add asuka alexa bliss and rhea ripley to the mix the raw women s division suddenly looks like the best thing going in wwe exciting times are ahead and i m definitely drinking the triple h kool aid on this one now let s see whose stock decreased the most this week stock down 3 street profits at summerslam the street profits once again failed to win the wwe tag team titles from the usos this time there was no foul play or controversial referee call that made the difference jimmy and jey uso were simply the better team montez ford and angelo dawkins should be dropping out of the title picture from here stock down 2 liv morgan summerslam was an important night for liv morgan to erase any doubts about the legitimacy of her current reign as smackdown women s champion given the fluky nature of the way she won the title earlier this month via money in the bank cash in unfortunately for liv her rematch with ronda rousey at summerslam proved that liv is an undeserving champion ronda kicked her ass the entire match and then liv tapped out the only reason liv is still the champ right now is because the referee blew the call and the commentary team made sure to point this out this finish was wwe s attempt to solve the problem of finding a way to keep the title on liv while still protecting rousey and setting her up for a heel turn those goals were accomplished but now liv s credibility as champion is damaged stock down 1 theory ever since he won the money in the bank contract earlier this month theory has been on the losing side of all eight television and ppv matches that he has competed in his status as a total geek was reiterated at summerslam he never posed much of a threat in a quick loss against united states champion bob lashley he later tried to cash in his money in the bank contract but it never happened because brock lesnar took this chump out with an immediate f5 some folks have argued that the constant losses and beatings don t hurt theory s stock because it s fitting for a cowardly heel to lose fair fights only to steal the title some time down the line the problem with this argument in theory s case is that he s been booked as a guy who doesn t belong in the same ring with the top stars in the company it s gotten to the point where if he were to cash in that briefcase right now and steal the wwe universal championship away from a compromised roman reigns the title would immediately lose a lot of its value being in the hands of this mid card dweeb there you have it cagesiders whose stock do you think changed the most this week

beirut parts of beirut s grain silos collapsed on sunday just days before the second anniversary of a catastrophic explosion at the lebanese capital s port that ravaged the stores and parts of the city also on sunday us envoy amos hochstein arrived in beirut to push talks to resolve a bitter maritime border dispute between lebanon and israel over mediterranean waters with offshore gas fields afp correspondents said a cloud of dust covered beirut s port while local media reported that two towers fell in the heavily damaged silos northern section where a fire has been burning for more than two weeks footage of the incident showed part of the silo crumbling and a large cloud billowing up after debris hit the ground us envoy arrives to push talks between lebanon and israel over maritime border dispute the structure had absorbed much of the impact of the devastating explosion on august 4 2020 at beirut s port that killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6 500 the silos shielded large swaths of the city s west from the devastating effects of the blast which was caused by haphazardly stored ammonium nitrate fertiliser catching fire sunday s partial collapse came around two weeks after a fire erupted in the port s northern silos due to the fermentation of remaining grain stocks along with soaring summer temperatures according to authorities lebanon s caretaker prime minister this week warned they could fall the northern group of silos are now in danger of falling najib mikati said on wednesday in a statement which added that the silos still contained thousands of tonnes of wheat and corn he told the army to be prepared and warned workers civil defence members and firefighters to keep a safe distance from the site once boasting a capacity of more than 100 000 tonnes an imposing 48 metre high remnant of the silos has become emblematic of the catastrophic port blast the lebanese investigation into the blast has faced systematic and blatant political obstruction from day one authorities were unable to unload around 3 000 tonnes of wheat and corn stuck in the silos because doing so might accelerate their collapse this week s statement said the environment and health ministries advised the public to evacuate the port area and use masks in the vicinity of the silos in case they collapsed maritime border dispute hochstein met with lebanon s energy minister walid fayad on sunday and was scheduled to meet with president michel aoun and prime minister najib mikati the following day reaching a resolution is both necessary and possible but can only be done through negotiations and diplomacy the us state department said in a statement ahead of hochstein s visit washington s envoy for global infrastructure and investment is facilitating negotiations between lebanon and israel on the maritime boundary the statement added the maritime border dispute between lebanon and israel escalated in early june after israel moved a production vessel to the karish offshore field which is partly claimed by lebanon the move prompted beirut to call for the resumption of us mediated negotiations on the demarcation dispute lebanon and israel have no diplomatic relations and are separated by a un patrolled border they had resumed maritime border negotiations in 2020 but the process was stalled by beirut s claim that the map used by the united nations in the talks needed modifying lebanon initially demanded 860 square kilometres of territory in the disputed maritime area but then asked for an additional 1 430 square kilometres including part of the karish field israel claims that the field lies in its waters and is not part of the disputed area subject to ongoing negotiations on july 2 israel said it had downed three drones launched by lebanon s iran backed hezbollah that were headed towards the gas field the powerful shia muslim movement on sunday released a short video it said showed surveillance of several israeli chartered energy infrastructure ships including the production vessel sent to karish which is operated by london listed firm energean published in dawn august 1st 2022

with ireland s summer temperatures forecast to ratchet up higher as climate change bares its teeth experts say action needs to be taken to protect cities from more frequent scorching heatwaves climate scientists are unequivocal that the recent record breaking weather seen in ireland and the blistering temperatures that have claimed thousands of lives in continental europe notably in spain and portugal are set to become increasingly prevalent in the future research has shown that consistent with global trends ireland s summers are getting warmer while its winters get wetter temperatures have ticked upwards by about 0 9 degrees celsius over the course of the last century this has been accompanied by rising sea levels and more extreme weather events climatologist peter thorne told the journal recently that within the next couple of decades we will likely have heat extremes that are far worse in either duration extent or magnitude than what was experienced in july the comments are echoed by dr mary bourke an expert in natural hazards from trinity college dublin s geography department the earth sciences researcher studies health problems caused by the environment and seeks to find sustainable solutions to natural hazards one such hazard is sweltering hot cities during heatwaves which carry a health risk particularly for older people urban heat island effect rising temperatures cause an even greater problem in urban areas as cities are hotter than rural parts due to the urban heat island effect this phenomenon is caused by cities having an abundance of impervious surfaces like roads and buildings the temperature will rise the minute you enter a city and fall as soon as you get out it s a place based temperature trend not a meteorological one dr bourke explains we have built all these urban areas and replaced natural surfaces with concrete and tarmacadam and so on these materials especially the colour but also the materials themselves absorb the incoming solar energy and they hold on to it and then they let it out later in the day late heat peaks in urban areas after it peaks in rural areas the city holds heat for longer and it lets it out for longer so in general if you re living in a city your heat hazard will be higher than the people living in the rural areas advertisement several cities including new york los angeles and sydney have tried to tackle this by ditching dark coloured surfaces such as roads and roofs which absorb and radiate heat and painting these surfaces white green spaces provide relief from the urban heat island effect alamy stock photo alamy stock photo dr bourke added that urban heat is set to become a greater issue in the future as the population of cities continues to grow ireland s five cities are targeted to grow by 50 by 2040 under the national planning framework the situation is set to be compounded by the fact that older people face greater danger during heatwaves as they can struggle to regulate their body temperature and demographics show that the population is getting steadily older the stats by themselves suggest that the hazard is going to increase as we move through the century even if we didn t have more frequent hot events just the fact that we have an ageing population increases that standalone hazard bourke added nature based solutions dr bourke focuses much of her research on finding nature based solutions to the problems posed by climate change this approach which involves the protection restoration and management of natural ecosystems is heavily advocated by the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in its sixth assessment report which was published this year the major report made clear that climate change is causing severe and widespread disruption around the world the document notes that heatwaves have a greater impact in cities due to higher temperatures it says nature based solutions including planting and protecting trees play an important part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere trees and other vegetation have a cooling effect due to water being lost from their leaves through evaporation and transpiration because of this parks gardens and other green spaces in cities can reduce air temperatures by up to a few degrees the first thing is vegetation trees they create shade they decrease humidity they lower the temperature they are very effective in so many ways dr bourke told the journal cities that have more green spaces in them and i m talking about parks stephen s green cabinteely park that kind of place they re generally cooler compared to cities that don t have those green spaces read next related reads john gibbons in climate policy agri lobbyists are the tail wagging the government s dog trees have a cooling effect in city centres alamy stock photo alamy stock photo parks and green spaces also offer recreation opportunities and spending time in natural surroundings has been shown to be good for people s physical and mental health so called living walls and green roofs which are covered in plants and grass are also effective ways of increasing greenery in cities as well as having cooling properties they also help prevent flooding by absorbing rainfall and offer buildings a layer of insulation several prominent cities have created ambitious plans to increase their greenery paris is working to green 100 hectares across the city while in london mayor sadiq khan wants to make the uk capital the world s first national park city by 2050 the strategy to achieve this involves mass tree planting and park restoration what s ireland doing the climate action plan released last year is the roadmap for how the state hopes to reach its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 51 by 2030 it does not dictate any urban greening or other nature based solutions to help achieve this instead it places the initiative with local authorities which are each required to have a climate action strategy spanning five years a spokesperson for the department of the environment climate and communications said nature based solutions will also be considered in a forthcoming review of the national adaptation framework naf which was published in 2018 and seeks to create a climate resilient ireland where appropriate local authorities may include urban greening and other nature based actions in their plans the review of the naf which will be completed later in 2022 will also consider the role of urban greening and other nature based solutions in national adaptation policy the spokesperson said national funding programmes such as the urban regeneration and development fund also contribute to the delivery of public green spaces in urban areas the ipcc report notes that urban greening alone is far from enough to tackle the range of climate challenges ahead but experts say they have significant potential to make cities more livable for people and other animals trees parks changing the albedo of roads by brightening the colour of them they all help all these micro measures help and change things for the better dr bourke concluded
article originally published in may june 2022 edition we live in a hyper connected digitally focused world through globalization and advances in technology we re better connected and have greater access to goods and services and information than ever before so it s easy to forget that 90 percent of everything still travels exactly as it did 500 years ago by ship that trade is carried by the roughly 55 000 merchant ships that trade internationally whether general cargo container or tanker each of these is equipped with one or more propellers that drive the vessel through the water the propeller in turn is connected to the engine via a shaft and that shaft is supported by various bearings to keep it rotating smoothly these bearings often require grease or oil lubrication an oil lubricated stern tube system was introduced in the 1950s to help control the wear life of shaft bearings one of the system s components is known as the stern tube bearing and its main job is to seal the oil filled stern tube and prevent that oil from going into the sea and causing marine pollution yet accidents still happen fishing nets misaligned propeller shafts poorly maintained seals or manufacturing defects can all cause the seal to fail the resulting loss of oil containment can be costly for the shipowner and lead to fines or even jail time for the crew oil lubricated stern tube systems were developed ostensibly to control bearing wear life but what if these systems didn t need oil at all water cooled bearings water cooled bearings have the advantage of not requiring oil lubrication or eals environmentally acceptable lubricants reducing the pollution risk to zero while the shaft is spinning at speed the water creates a wedge that completely separates the shaft from the bearing material bringing the coefficient of friction to under 0 001 this reduces system wear to a negligible amount water also has twice the specific heat of oil an equal weight of water will absorb twice the heat of oil lubricants making the cooling properties far superior by using water as a lubricant contamination seals are not required if seals are not required pumps and tanks may not be necessary this leads to a simpler shaft bearing system and immediate cost savings in the build phase stern tube bearings are designed with a series of lands and grooves running longitudinally when a contaminant such as sand or grit enters the system the water will wash it into a groove where it is flushed out due to the material construction of this style of bearing it avoids scoring the propeller shaft unlike a metal bearing which has no give further a greased shaft will trap contaminants essentially turning it into a lapping compound this will continuously wear the shaft with every rotation water cooled bearings have been developed using the most modern technology available and one of the oldest sustainable resources known to man composite bearings thordon bearings a thompson gordon company is an ontario based manufacturer specializing in the production of oil and grease free bearings and seals the company uses a proprietary grease free water lubricated polymer material this low coefficient bearing material helps to reduce shaft bearing friction and eliminates stick slip thordon recently produced the largest rudder bearing ever manufactured in twenty four hours no less a containership drydocked in dubai was found to have rudder bearing clearances at the limit with the end of the maintenance period fast approaching the owner needed to decide whether to return to drydock or replace the existing metal bearing with thordon s water lubricated technology thordon s local partner ocean power international assured the shipyard it could deliver the bearing on time with only a rudder stock drawing to reference thordon s burlington ontario based team cast an oversized piece with an ample safety margin the finished piece measured 1 250 mm x 1 050 mm x 1 350 mm and weighed 2 500 lbs while the largest bearing ever delivered it was still seven times lighter than a comparable bronze bearing and light enough that it was loaded onto a commercial airliner that night twenty four hours later the bearing arrived in dubai where the local team completed final machining to the exact specifications the piece was then supercooled using liquid nitrogen causing the outer diameter to shrink by 21 93 mm and allowing the bearing to be easily fitted in place the resulting installation has a higher abrasion resistance than the bronze bearing it replaced with double the expected working life multi vessel contract the advantages of water cooled bearings paired with thordon s fast delivery time have led to a multi vessel agreement with maritime partners the world s largest operator of inland vessels twelve twin screw push boats are scheduled to be delivered from louisiana based fmt shipyard with equipment that includes rivertough tailshaft bearings thorplas blue rudder bearings with pucker seals thorplas blue steering linkage bushings sxl thrust washers and tg100 tailshaft seals operating one of the most modern new and environmentally efficient fleets across the u s inland river network maritime partners went all in with thordon s water cooled solutions to ensure reliable operation and zero pollution risk wooden bearings on the other end of the spectrum is the longest running water cooled bearing solution in history wooden bearings made from lignum vitae lignum vitae has been in service for over three centuries it received its first patent in 1852 listed in sname in 1882 used throughout the fleet in ww1 then again in ww2 it was chosen for use on the uss nautilus the world s first nuclear powered submarine the fastest ocean liner in the world the ss united states was awarded the blue riband for the fastest crossing of the atlantic on its maiden voyage in 1952 a record it holds to this day its shaft bearing was made from lignum vitae no other bearing material has the history or longevity of lv and because it s a totally renewable resource it holds the honor of being the most environmentally friendly solution available what makes it so good lignum vitae is the hardest of all traded woods reading 4 390 lbf on the janka scale equivalent to aluminum it s also the densest of all hardwoods at 6 8 lb bd ft compared with ebony at 5 8 lb bd ft it takes centuries for one of these trees to reach maturity it has natural oils causing self lubrication and wear resistance a study by the u s navy found that lv had the lowest coefficient of friction ever recorded these oils also provide resistance to rot and being a wood it s not susceptible to damage by electrolysis most of these properties are the result of its unique cellular structure unlike most wood which forms its grains in a longitudinal pattern lv forms as a woven matrix with a 60 degree angle of the grains this acts like a preloaded spring it can be compressed using a 100 ton press and will spring back and regain its shape with perfect memory after a few days it s this last property that makes it perfect for use in stern tubes the wooden bearing conforms to the shaft over time essentially lapping in which is when the lowest coefficient is formed and because shaft vibration is a function of too much clearance this property will almost totally eliminate vibration even with a misaligned shaft constant development bob shortridge the founder of lignum vitae north america is constantly pushing the envelope of the material he currently has his bearings undergoing testing by canadian based hydrotech a company specializing in bearing technology for marine and hydroelectric industries working to develop the best possible bearing for all conditions the pair are testing lv against all material types and designs finding a material that can develop the most effective water wedge at high speeds while limiting wear at low speeds is the ultimate goal and lignum vitae s initial results show it rising to the top shortridge is also a history buff with a longstanding fascination with the ss united states and what made her so fast as of this writing he is donating lignum vitae bearing material for display in the ss united states conservancy museum and awaiting permission to board the vessel to inspect the stern tube bearing with the goal of further refining his designs applying modern production methods to one of the oldest reliable materials is a recipe for sustainable success when things go wrong refitting or installing bearings and seals while in drydock is one thing repairing or replacing them while the vessel is in the water after a breakdown is something else entirely specializing in stern seals and propulsion systems aegir marine provides a flexible approach to ship maintenance while happy to match your drydock timeframe where it really stands out is conducting floating and emergency underwater repairs aegir s proprietary

institute for supply management reading the index registered a 52 8 reading for the month representing the percentage of businesses seeing growth for the month the number fell slightly from june s 53 reading but was a bit above the dow jones estimate for 52 1 importantly one big reason for the low reading was a massive slide in the prices index which tumbled 18 5 points to 60 though the number

do for the people the country and the planet what the florida public service commission felt was the right thing to do was to financially punish those whose power bills do not exceed 25 month by letting fpl and other power utilities arbitrarily add a base charge of 25 month to their bills so as of my june bill for the four or five months of the year my solar panels are most effective i am forced to make an involuntary donation of 100 or more to fpl the following notice was slipped into my june bill a new minimum base bill of 25 which was approved by the florida public service commission is now in effect for metered residential customers whose monthly base electric service costs fall below 25 lawyers can hash out whether this is legal it is certainly morally wrong the public service commission should be encouraging rather than punishing homeowner investment in solar power jack morton melbourne pharmacists and prescription drugs just a thought if pharmaceutical representatives had to pitch their drugs to pharmacists instead of doctors maybe some change in prescription prices and usage would occur pharmacists generally have more knowledge about the drugs their composition and generics that may or may not be recommended they also understand insurance and may recommend purchasing the prescription without using insurance i trust my pharmacist when it comes to prescription drugs more than i do my doctor i truly believe they invest more time and experience into researching new drugs and alternatives when i encounter the pharmaceutical representative refilling the cabinet with drug samples or setting out coffee and donuts in the doctor s office i have to question the prescription decision my doctor has made for me nancy barrett rockledge voters should decide abortion laws i have a very rigid view on abortion my wife and i could never do it but neither could we stop or condemn someone who chose to receive one without roe v wade the answer in my opinion is simple each state must hold a referendum on the procedure if voters condemn the procedure there must be exceptions for rape incest or a circumstance where the mother s health is impacted or threatened there must not be rules prohibiting travel to a state where it is legal and insurance companies must include it as any other procedure a friend from work years ago said there should be a referendum on the procedure with only women voting as they are the ones affected most interesting but probably not legal people do not want to be told to wear a mask but they can try and control a woman s body it is the business of the mother father only even though others may find it a sin or just not right how s that for a rigid fence sitter but that is to me the only obvious solution to this thorny dilemma craig graham melbourne founders valued individuals rights the gentleman who wrote the july 27 opinion column would have us believe that of the 10 original amendments to the constitution the second amendment was meant to apply collectively to government employees national guard militia rather than individual citizens this well educated attorney uses mental gymnastics to argue that the text of the second amendment clearly states that only those employed by the state have the right to keep weapons and only in the defense of the state anyone who has read the writings of our founders know that they endeavored to protect the natural rights of individual citizens over the whims of those in government every living creature is born with the right of self preservation and every tyrant since the beginning of time has tried to take away that right from those that they rule or intend to prey upon i find it hard to believe that the gentleman who wrote the column doesn t understand this point and feel it is more likely that he is being disingenuous to rehash tired liberal lies mike corley melbourne way past time to get tough on crime if people really wanted to stop the commission of felonies with guns they would stop attacking legal and responsible gun owners and the police and start enforcing the proper penalties for the crimes as long as there are no incentives for the criminals to not do the crime they will continue with or without guns we need to put the teeth back into our judicial system and our law enforcements and make it unattractive to commit any crime with a gun or any instrument capable of inflicting injury it s no wonder our jails and prisons are overcrowded and felons still walking our streets it s way past time to get tough on crime thomas johnson palm bay what are republicans thinking i can t believe these republicans republican candidate for senate j d vance of ohio told an audience at a christian high school that people nowadays get divorced too easily and that they should stay in bad marriages even violent ones for the sake of the children even though each month 70 women in the u s are fatally shot by intimate partners four republican states missouri arizona arkansas and texas will not allow divorce if the woman is pregnant and abortion is now outlawed in each of the states how s that for freedom of choice florida republican rep matt gaetz doubles down on his claim at a conservative student action summit that only unattractive women are worried about abortion rights republican rep glenn thompson of pennsylvania who voted recently against the respect for marriage act protecting gay marriage three days later attended his son s wedding to another man his spokesperson said thompson and his wife were thrilled to attend and celebrate their son s marriage so republicans believe women should put up with an abusive husband stay in a bad marriage take a baby to term before they can get divorced and vote against the same marital rights they celebrate with their children it took until 1920 for women to earn the constitutional right to vote i can t think of a better time than 2022 for women to exercise their franchise to elect people who will respect trust and enable them to make the best decision for their body and their family stop the denigration of women now vicky dorman satellite beach he ll take economics over empathy it is very interesting that when folks ascribe motives to others they don t realize they are projecting their own biases on the july 24 opinion page there are statements like democrats on the whole are more empathetic republicans seem to love chaos and hatred republicans want to tax the poor and help the rich and that rep bill posey voted not to impeach and remove the most corrupt u s president ever of course these types of statements are personal opinions not facts and do not stand up under scrutiny to wit which states have large debt and are losing residents due to increasing costs of living and rising crime california and new york who leads them democrats what was the u s like the day biden took office inflation was near zero gas was 1 93 per gallon there were no supply chain problems we had a record stock market and low interest rates the u s was energy independent and actually an exporter of oil in fact it was the best economy in 50 years so what were the republicans motives then and what were trump s motives it is then logical to ask what are biden s motives gas has gone over 4 per gallon inflation is the highest in 40 years supply chain problems are everywhere stock market way down oh but he is more empathetic no thanks george minto titusville answer to one question tells a lot it is important when choosing who to vote for no matter what office to know whether a candidate is intelligent and honest to this end it would be great if florida today asked every single candidate for any office whether they think joe biden was elected president and that the election was not stolen if a candidate chooses not to answer this question that should also be made clear price t bingham melbourne democrats we need a message i agree with recent thoughts from journalist and political commentator fareed zakaria democrats need to get back to bread and butter issues start building things again focus on gas prices food prices etc the culture wars are too divisive i met 10 people recently citizens and naturalized citizens from the caribbean haiti trinidad jamaica europe england the usa and africa nigeria all of whom are concerned five have switched from the democratic party to independent due to the culture wars saying there s too much emphasis on sexual orientation by politicians and people there is no teacher anywhere on this earth who s waking up and going to teach harmful sexual ideas to their students we are watching lies misinformation and such disrespectful behaviors by certain groups who claim to be the moral police we all care about all students receiving a quality public education and having opportunities to succeed in my humble opinion a lot of students are being taught hate division bigotry racism and fear at their homes places of worship and other places before they enter a school i firmly believe that the foundation for everything starts in the homes there is a time and place for everything and everyone the democrats are the party of the big tent with all welcome well we still don t have a message and we allow republicans to control the narrative on every single issue i m terrified about democracy vs autocracy we need a message democrats or we lose seeta begui melbourne

san francisco california a u s federal judge has ruled that ride sharing company uber has not violated a federal law protecting people with disabilities even though it does not offer wheelchair accessible vehicles in every market it serves san francisco federal court chief judge richard seeborg ruled against two plaintiffs from new orleans and one from jackson mississippi who use electric wheelchairs and argued that uber s failure to provide rides in their home cities violated the americans with disabilities act seeborg said it was unreasonable to require the san francisco based company to accommodate the plaintiffs because of the cost but he rejected uber s claim that it was excused because it had done more than its fair share in other cities uber estimated the bare minimum annual costs to team up with commercial providers of wheelchair accessible vehicles was 800 000 in new orleans or about 400 per ride and 550 000 in jackson mississippi or about 1 000 per ride even if the money was spent wheelchair users would likely face significant wait times as well as gaps of eight to 14 hours a day when no rides would be available seeborg said while ruling against plaintiffs scott crawford from jackson and stephan namisnak and francis falls from new orleans usin a statement uber said we welcome the outcome and are proud of our efforts to improve accessibility for all users from 2018 to 2020 uber said it spent more than 150 million to provide wheelchair accessible vehicles in new york los angeles chicago houston phoenix philadelphia austin san francisco washington boston and portland oregon according to court papers

the harm that trump has done to this country dividing it against itself undermining trust in the legitimacy of our democratic norms and institutions threatening the peaceful transfer of power promoting outrageous and destructive lies that have misled tens of millions of americans and normalized the insertion of violence into politics all of this and more has been made possible by the relentless right wing propaganda machine that is fox news until we reckon with the disastrous reality that a major news network has effectively abandoned the news abandoned any semblance of objectively reporting what in fact has occurred abandoned any fidelity to facts upon which all reasonable people can agree we will not pull ourselves away from the existential precipice where we now find ourselves tom nichols contributing writer to the atlantic observed that the january 6 hearings are crucial and every american should be watching them but added that the alternate reality that about forty percent of us live in will never be breached by actual facts fox news more than any other media organization bears responsibility for this dismal state of affairs by continuing to defend trump and his followers downplaying or simply ignoring the events of january 6 and what led up to it fox news is pressing our republic ever closer to self dissolution and authoritarianism this is not simply about republicans versus democrats it is about what kind of regime we are going to live under whether we will forfeit the rule of law and sink into the quagmire of neo fascism and right wing extremism where propaganda has supplanted evidence based analysis or whether we will condemn political violence demagoguery and the cult of personality and insist that our public officials uphold their oaths of office and abide by our democratic norms the rulings of our courts and the results of our elections consider the moral cowardice of fox news host sean hannity who exchanged text messages with trump s press secretary kayleigh mcenany a day after the riot where hannity urged no more crazy people and no more stolen election talk and in a january 10 text message to former white house chief of staff mark meadows hannity wrote that can t mention the election again ever i did not have a good call with him today and worse i m not sure what is left to do or say yet hannity could still dismiss the select committee investigating the january 6 attack as engaging in the dullest the most boring democratic fund raiser the moral harm that fox news is inflicting on america goes in fact beyond january 6 and even beyond trump the fox news primetime lineup which includes tucker carlson and laura ingraham is serving to unburden the american public of conscience concern for the welfare of the less fortunate and commitment to something higher and worthier than party loyalty what if we just cut off unemployment ingraham suggested during an interview last year hunger is a pretty powerful thing fox news one america news oan newsmax and talk radio constitute a right wing media ecosystem and as a research team based at harvard university observed these reinforce the message provide the president a platform and marginalize or attack those republican leaders or any conservative media personalities who insist that there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in his now classic study propaganda french philosopher jacques ellul identifies the specific methods that modern propagandists use to organize a mass of individuals through psychological manipulations to unify its member s behavior according to a pattern and directly influence the public s beliefs attitudes and judgments these techniques include the selective rendering of facts deliberate use of falsehoods spreading of rumors descriptions of groups and individuals through stereotyping and innuendo the invocation of prejudice fear and hatred within the populace and the incessant repetition of emotionally laden cultural myths and divisive slogans we may also add the use of loaded terms watchwords dog whistles and appeals to nationalism a team at mit analyzing propaganda techniques in the news underscores the use of logical fallacies such as strawmen the misrepresentation of the other s position red herrings the provision of irrelevancies false dichotomies offering two alternatives as the only possibilities and whataboutism a diversionary tactic to avoid directly addressing an issue whataboutism is worth considering more closely because it is becoming ubiquitous among republicans perhaps this is not surprising given that it is certainly trump s favorite dodge it is one of the fundamental rules by which he operates when you are criticized say that someone else is worse in an interview with trump bill o reilly states the obvious fact that putin is a killer and who can forget trump s response there are a lot of killers you got a lot of killers what you think our country is so innocent that is classic whataboutism and it is also of course all over fox news most popular line up for example when biden denounced the insurrection as the worst attack on our democracy since the civil war tucker carlson s response was really the worst attack on our democracy in 160 years how about the immigration act of 1965 carlson is referring to the hart celler act which brought an end to the national origins quota system and effectively banned racial discrimination from immigration policy so by his inane logic a legitimate anti racist law constitutes a greater affront to democracy than the attempt to overthrow a free and fair election fortunately we are beginning to see some of the network carriers awaken to the damage that these right wing propaganda machines are causing to our culture beliefs and political discourse the three right wing media organizations noted above are discovering that there may indeed be a steep price for systematically spreading misinformation and bald faced propaganda they have all been hit with billion dollar lawsuits by dominion voting machines which accuses them of spreading conspiracy theories that it rigged the presidential election against donald trump and skewed results in favor of now president joe biden according to newsweek in another blow to these masters of spreading fake news verizon will stop carrying one america news on its fios television service beginning saturday this so called news outlet has been spreading the most outlandish lies about the legitimacy of the 2020 elections verizon s decision to drop oan was preceded by at t s earlier decision in april to ditch oan the decisions of the two carriers will undoubtedly inflict massive financial losses to the network which is overdue given the unspeakable harm they have inflicted on our country what verizon and at t have done is admirable now it is time for them and many other carriers such as comcast spectrum and directv to consider dropping the biggest culprit of all the fake and manipulative media outlet fox news this would send a clear message to all right wing news outlets that they will no longer be the carrier of fake news and poisonous propaganda that polarize the public instill hatred and distrust and promote conspiracy theories all in the name of free speech regardless of the horrific harm they inflict on our democracy dr alon ben

menafn daily forex the difference between success and failure in forex cfd trading is very likely to depend mostly upon which assets you choose to trade each week and in which direction and not on the exact methods you might use to determine trade entries and exits so when starting the week it is a good idea to look at the big picture of what is developing in the market as a whole and how such developments and affected by macro fundamentals technical factors and market sentiment read on to get a weekly analysis below advertisement test your skills trade the weekly time frame now open a free practice account fundamental analysis behavioral sentiment on wednesday of last week the u s federal reserve surprised absolutely no one the u s central bank raised their key interest rate by 0 75 which was widely expected and simply met expectations however after the interest rate hike it was fed chairman jerome powell s comments that soothed the hearts of financial houses he allowed a bit of hope into his words when he spoke about the potential the federal reserve would be able to become less aggressive regarding its interest policy potentially at the end of the year yet skeptical analysts and experienced speculators remain suspicious of the u s federal reserve and its ability to control the u s economy the usd jpy gbp usd and s p 500 will all merit plenty of attention this week as investment companies and traders react to last week s rather strong reactions in forex and equity indices via technical and behavioral sentiment the usd jpy and the other major currency pairs all reacted with strong moves the usd did loss value in forex on thursday and friday as financial houses seemed to be pleased by the outcome of the u s fed s pronouncements the interest rate hike of 0 75 brought the key u s lending rate to 2 50 however not all is clear regarding the u s economy because while advance gdp tumbled lower and caused talk about a recession on thursday friday s core consumer price index numbers came in higher than expected which will likely set off a loud debate about the direction of the u s economy and what the federal reserve should do next global equity indices mostly gained the past week and usd lost some power but commodity prices did incrementally gain too in many respects which could cause suspicions and worry about inflation the week ahead 1st august 5th august 2022 the usd jpy was a good reflection of trading results across the forex spectrum the past week as volatility increased in the hours ahead of the u s fed announcement but then began to exhibit strong selling of the usd the usd jpy will open this week of trading near important support ratios speculators perhaps should practice some caution as the usd jpy opens for trading on early monday and be on the lookout for the potential of momentary reversal higher as financial houses seek equilibrium meaning that friday s selloff may have been slightly overdone in some eyes and buying may ensue on the opening however if the usd jpy does not see solid buying early this coming week it could be a legitimate signal that investment houses perceive the usd jpy is still in overbought territory if the usd jpy were to break below the 133 000 ratio and actually start to display the potential of challenging the 132 500 level this would be intriguing however technically the usd jpy remains within the highest elements of its long term range if nervousness about the u s federal reserve s policy compared to the bank of japan s pronouncements remains in stark contrast the usd jpy may be able to maintain the higher realms it is situated traders should be prepared for choppy conditions in the coming days on friday from japan there will be household spending data presented while this is not considered the most important statistical evidence regarding the japanese economy it will give insights into the spending habits of the japanese as some inflation hits their domestic landscape the usd jpy may challenge support levels below but from a momentum perspective traders should not become overly ambitious there is a reasonable amount of suspicion that the usd jpy could react with reversals higher if the 132 00 to 133 00 ratios are tested speculators should be careful because the usd jpy is capable of produced lightning quick results usd jpy weekly charta question of who do you believe and contrarian economic data will stir nervousness last week s results via economic data combined with the u s federal reserve s interest rate hike are sure to cause a firestorm of debate and perhaps even anger the fed s move was widely anticipated but the rather poor showing from the u s advance gdp and a result of minus 0 9 had the white house administration reacting in a manner that can be perceived as distasteful some may call their words a bold lie the biden administration was quick to claim the u s is not in an official recession however financial houses will view the white house s words as semantics meaning they do not believe what is being said and to add fire to the rather political interpretation of economic data which shows the american economy is slowing was treasury secretary janet yellen s comments that she did not believe the u s was in a recession it should be noted that yellen was one of a cast of characters who said u s inflation last year was transitory cough cough u s jobless numbers will be published this coming week and while day traders will get plenty of updates from their brokerage services about the non farm employment change data and its significance it is really the u s average hourly earnings data that should be given attention this coming friday the u s is still suffering from inflation this as the u s fed keeps increasing interest rates and refuses to acknowledge a recession earnings number will be important because if they show a gain it will mean employers are still under pressure to give their workers more pay even as their businesses suffer the word stagflation comes to mind however even as the word is thought out and perhaps considered equity indices did rather well for the second week in a row traders should however be careful because the upside momentum could come to a halt if behavioral sentiment were to suddenly shift again economic data from europe interest rate policy from the reserve bank of australia and england will be delivered this week along with u s numbers 10 key data points for the coming week traders should watch germany retail sales monday u s ism

scientists create sixth sense brain implant to detect infrared light telegraph feb 17 2013 a brain implant which could allow humans to detect invisible infrared light has been developed by scientists in america scientists have created a sixth sense by creating a brain implant through which infrared light can be detected although the light could not be seen lab rats were able to detect it via electrodes in the part of the brain responsible for their sense of touch similar devices have previously been used to make up for lost capabilities for example giving paralysed patients the ability to move a cursor around the screen with their thoughts but the new study by researchers from duke university in north carolina is the first case in which such devices have been used to give an animal a completely new sense dr miguel nicolelis said the advance reported in the nature communications journal this week was just a prelude to a major breakthrough on a brain to brain interface which will be announced in another paper next month speaking at the annual meeting of the american academy for the advancement of science in boston on sunday he described the mystery work as something no one has dreamed could be done the second paper is being kept secret until it is published but dr nicolelis s comments raise the prospect of an implant which could allow one animal s brain to interact directly with another read morescientists create sixth sense brain implant to detect infrared light

it s not too late to snatch up some great stocks at good prices after suffering the worst six months for stocks to start a year in more than half a century investors received a bit of a reprieve in july some may be wondering if they missed the boat and others may still be fearing the worst is yet to come for their portfolio but the best course of action is to continue putting your money to work by buying shares in great companies at good prices find out why these five fool contributors like novocure nvcr 6 26 the trade desk ttd 6 23 walt disney dis 0 93 t mobile tmus 0 14 and rexford industrial realty rexr 3 45 pulsing with potential keith speights novocure like many biotech stocks novocure has been beaten down a lot over the past 12 months but despite considerable volatility its shares are outperforming the market so far this year i think novocure is poised to skyrocket soon the company already markets its tumor treating fields ttfields therapy for treating glioblastoma an aggressive type of brain cancer and mesothelioma a type of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos novocure expects to announce results from a late stage study evaluating ttfields in treating non small cell lung cancer nsclc later this year the company s ttfields therapy works by using electric fields to pulse through the skin and disrupt the division of tumor cells this approach seems likely in my view to be effective in nsclc but success in this indication could be just the tip of the iceberg novocure is on track to report results from three other late stage studies over the next couple of years in 2023 the company expects to wrap up phase 3 studies targeting recurrent ovarian cancer and brain metastases in 2024 novocure anticipates data from a phase 3 study of ttfields in treating pancreatic cancer these four late stage indications together represent a market opportunity that s 14 times larger than novocure s current market with realistic prospects of greatly expanding its addressable market this biotech stock is pulsing with potential digital advertising isn t going anywhere chris neiger the trade desk investors on the lookout for a fast growing tech company that s betting big on digital advertising need to look no further than the trade desk the company s business model is pretty straightforward it connects companies who want to buy digital ad space with companies that are selling it the trade desk s platform makes it easy for these two groups to do business together and then it collects fees on the ads that are purchased that model has been working very well for the company the trade desk has been profitable for the past nine years and in the first quarter as reported on may 10 non gaap earnings increased nearly 50 to 0 21 per share the company s sales are also growing at a healthy clip with first quarter revenue rising 43 to 315 million and the trade desk isn t done growing its advertising platform reach the company recently expanded a deal with disney to automate targeted ads across the media giant s linear tv offerings including hulu espn and abc and could even be used for a new ad supported disney tier that s great news for the trade desk as it taps further into the broad u s digital ad space a market that emarketer estimates will be worth 315 billion three years from now like many other stocks in the tech sector the trade desk s share price has been on a wild ride lately but don t let the short term drop scare you away from the company s long term potential as a digital advertising platform leader an entertainment powerhouse at a five year low matt frankel cfp walt disney entertainment conglomerate disney has been beaten down severely in the recent market declines with shares down by nearly 50 from their 2021 highs but if you ve been to a disney theme park or attended the opening weekend of its most recent blockbuster you might be shocked to put it mildly although it was severely affected by the covid 19 pandemic s onset disney s business has rebounded strongly in 2022 in the segment of disney s business that includes the cash machine theme parks revenue more than doubled year over year in the first quarter as i write this at least two of disney s four florida based theme parks are sold out every day for the rest of the week the company s iconic film franchises and merchandise sales are extremely strong as well and its cruise line is starting to normalize to be fair there are some legitimate concerns about the streaming side of disney s business as there are clear signs growth may be slowing the disney streaming service has a staggering 137 7 million subscribers less than three years after its launch and hulu and espn add millions more to the total but the stock trades for more than 25 less than it was when disney launched so i d call this a bit of an overreaction in a nutshell disney s legacy businesses are emerging as strong as ever as pandemic restrictions wind down and the streaming side of the business has created a multibillion dollar recurring revenue stream that should get significantly larger over time the new leader in wireless adam levy t mobile t mobile reported earnings after at t and verizon last month and it saved the best for last the company s total postpaid subscriber net additions surpassed its two biggest rivals combined those net additions were fueled by an improvement in its subscriber retention rates t mobile was the only one of the three major carriers to see a year over year improvement in its churn rate management attributed that trend to a flight to value during the company s earnings call but it should not be lost on investors that it also coincides with the shut down of the legacy sprint network sprint customers historically switched at higher rates than other carriers on top of strong customer additions t mobile is seeing improvements in average revenue per user the metric increased 2 8 better than at t and verizon despite the carrier s promise not to raise its rates on customers as its competitors did last quarter it did so by signing up more subscribers for its premium service plan management now expects average revenue per user to climb 2 for the full year up from its previous guidance of 1 at the core of t mobile s improving position in the wireless industry is its leadership in 5g it bet early on mid band spectrum to support 5g while at t and verizon were focused on millimeter wave as a result it s about two years ahead in its buildout covering more than 100 million more people with its network than its closest rival on top of that it has the depth of spectrum in most markets to ensure it has the capacity to serve more customers than the competition t mobile appears to be set for growth for years to come quietly dominating this niche market tyler crowe rexford industrial realty every once in a while you come across a company that has such a unique profitable niche that you become fascinated by the business rexford industrial realty is high up on that list of niche businesses to which more investors should pay attention the industrial real estate investment trust reit owns and operates facilities exclusively in southern california this market is unique because it plays such an outsize role in exports and imports about 40 of shipping container traffic goes in and out of the l a long beach port complex moving that many goods puts industrial space at a premium according to rexford more than 99 of all industrial properties in los angeles county are leased and occupied what s more land in the county zoned for industrial use is shrinking as it gets repurposed for other use this high demand shrinking supply dynamic translates to off the charts rental growth for rexford in the most recent quarter comparable rental rates for new and renewed leases were 81 higher than this time last year while this is extraordinarily high rexford has been able to increase its net operating income 31 annually over the past five years rexford s stock trades at a bit of a premium to most of its industrial real estate peers but that is largely because it has grown shareholder value at a considerably higher rate for some time with few changes in the supply demand dynamic in the socal region it looks as though rexford is well positioned to succeed for many years to come

north wilkesboro barely an hour into the 9 a m start of the traditional workday but three plus hours into his day ronald queen zipped about the north wilkesboro speedway on his gas powered cart like he was racing for the checkered flag and in a very real way he was heavy equipment operators were razing metal grandstands on the track s south side a crew of old school painters from winston salem were recreating original signs and lighting contractors from louisiana were busy making sure the track will shine come tuesday night when the green flag drops for xr series racing revival racing you may have heard is returning to its roots this week thanks in no small part to a very large infusion of federal covid relief funds for wilkes county natives such as queen the operations manager at the speedway the return of fender bending rubbing is racing couldn t come fast enough i ain t got the words for it queen said a few tears welling in his eyes we ve poured our heart and soul into this but really it s for our friends families people we don t even know and young people who ve never seen racing here a long history by this point even casual observers know a little about the history of the quirky lay of the land north wilkesboro speedway in the late 40s a couple local men scratched out a dirt track that followed the contours of the rolling land uphill on the back straightaway downhill toward the start finish line to find out who among area bootleggers had the fastest car and the most nerve behind the wheel from that modest beginning the 5 8 mile track opened in 1947 quickly became intertwined with nascar two years later and settled in for a long run as a fixture on the circuit in the early days stock car racing was a regional attraction that changed in 1965 when renowned author tom wolfe published a profile about wilkes county native junior johnson an honest to god bootlegger from ronda called the last american hero is junior johnson yes that was eventually made into a movie the deep pockets of the r j reynolds tobacco co which signed on in 1971 as title sponsor of the winston cup helped make stock car racing a truly modern spectator sport as thousands flocked to places like north wilkesboro that experience helped capture the imagination of fans such as keith grubbs an old school craftsman busy last week painting and restoring logos on the track walls he started coming to the speedway in 1987 with a buddy who d pulled his car out of a ditch the previous winter we sat in the chicken bone section down low in row five turn one and ate kentucky fried chicken out of a box drank water and got hit in the head by flying chicken bones grubbs said we loved it and said we d be back every year that held true for a while but the streak ended eventually but a lifelong affinity for north wilkesboro never waned even as new bigger racetracks opened in nontraditional places such as chicago and kansas city just being here has always been pretty cool grubbs said the good times came to an end in 1996 though as the nationwide expansion of stock car racing squeezed out traditional tracks north wilkesboro rockingham and darlington saw their race dates turned over to the new speedways the last nascar race at the north wilkesboro speedway was run in may 1996 it was a blow to area fans who for years made the trip twice a year but perhaps worse an economic engine and source of considerable civic pride was idled after jeff gordon crossed the finish line first a few smaller races were held on the grounds during a mini revival in 2011 but it was never the same the old track eventually fell into a state of disrepair weeds popped up through the asphalt and metal grandstands visible from u s 421 began showing their age excitement fueled by relief funds rumors about interest from nascar s truck series or other smaller race circuits circulated every so often excitement fueled by hope would build before rumors proved to be nothing more than wishful thinking oddly it took the covid pandemic or more specifically economic relief money to help revive the place the federal government had allocated some 5 7 billion to north carolina through the american rescue plan and left it to politicians in raleigh to decide how to spend it gov roy cooper shrewdly proposed spending 30 million of that to refurbish north wilkesboro the rock richmond county and the charlotte motorspeedway cabarrus county some 15 other local tracks and drag strips received smaller grants totaling another 15 8 million this pandemic brought us a once in a generation challenge and these funds have brought us a once in a generation opportunity cooper said in 2021 the north wilkesboro speedway in a nod to its place in nascar s roots wound up getting 18 million in relief money and a significant contribution from the local government i think it was a brilliant political move for roy cooper to put together said eddie settle the chairman of the wilkes county board of commissioners last year while the details were being ironed out in the general assembly wilkes is a very red county same as richmond home of rockingham he knows he ll get support for it judging by the rush of activity at the north wilkesboro speedway spending pandemic relief funds is already providing an economic boost last year when legislators were discussing various proposals for the 5 7 billion settle estimated that a half dozen races a year could mean as much as 40 million to the local economy that s the whole area not just north wilkesboro he said dozens of workers have been working long hours getting the track and grounds ready for racing grandstands are being razed on the back stretch and concession areas are being overhauled and touched up old school signs and sponsor ads are being painted by hand original track logos and the fading red winston cup logo remain adding a real connection to the past that cannot be bought we re trying to be as authentic as we can in this said graig hoffman the executive director of the north wilkesboro speedway and a longtime employee of speedway motorsports inc the owner of 11 tracks spread from california to bristol tenn we re getting it up and running with the goal of having a modern facility here in wilkesboro with a real retro feel plans to repave the track surface next year as part of the overhaul naturally have given rise to the 1 million question could nascar return hoffman who runs the bristol motor speedway chose the diplomatic route while focusing on the present it s great to dream but you have to take baby steps first he said the speedway when complete will host a variety of events concerts or christmas light shows perhaps in a vision of it becoming a multi purpose venue people talk about how nascar left and lowe s home improvement left so we want to get it rebuilt in a way that restores a sense of pride to the entire community hoffman said much work will remain even after the green flag drops tuesday night we just got power last week hoffman said restrooms and food concessions won t be finished this week but organizers have found temporary workarounds porta johns have been brought in and food vendors will be setting up shop inside the gates cold drinks water soda beer and moonshine cocktails also will be available for a crowd that could reach 9 000 and while some observers initially questioned whether spending pandemic funds truly counted as economic relief the proof was fairly obvious last week inside the broiling oval people such as grubbs who should be enjoying an actual retirement working for companies like jks motorsports in winston salem leaped at the chance to work at the north wilkesboro speedway i ve been painting for 50 years the last 24 with jks and nascar grubbs said while working on a logo when i was sitting in the stands over there i never imagined i d get the chance to work here in north wilkesboro a few feet away near victory lane hoffman kept busy checking items of a near bottomless to do list while queen the track s operations manager made sure contractors had everything they needed the progress made an impression on jason reavis the operations officer of the wilkes ems who d dropped by to review plans for medical coverage on opening night i m thinking this is going to be a real successful thing he told hoffman it s going to be good for wilkes county which is

luo jie china daily us interest rate hikes unlikely to trigger another financial crisis in southeast asia in the face of the soaring inflation the us federal reserve has no choice but to raise its benchmark interest rate to control commodity prices the consumer price index in the united states rose 1 3 percent in june or aggregately 9 1 percent over the last 12 months to hit a 40 year high to achieve a so called soft landing of the national economy on july 28 the fed increased its interest rate by 75 basis points and claimed that another unusually large increase could be appropriate in september over the past few months it has raised its interest rate several times following a 0 25 percent rise in march the interest rate amounted to a target range of 0 75 1 percent in may on june 15 the federal open market committee emphasized that it is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective toward this goal it decided to continue raising interest rates and reducing its holdings of treasury securities agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities the fed s hawkish position is a risky signal for others former us treasury secretary john connally once said the us dollar is our currency but your problem when one sovereign currency plays a dominant role in lubricating the global economy accounting for about 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions before the pandemic tightening its supply will have profound implications on global capital flows specifically when the value of the us dollar becomes the strongest it has been over the past decades it inevitably devalues currencies worldwide at the same time as interest rates are now markedly higher in the us than elsewhere investors are motivated to hold relatively conservative investments such as treasury bonds to pursue higher returns importantly the risks derived from the raised interest rates are never equally shared the last decades have witnessed several boom and bust cycles in emerging markets global investors move into these economies during good times but will suddenly back out when the recipient countries expose deteriorations in the macroeconomy or when the us tightens capital supply in other words emerging markets often face more risks and vulnerability than wealth and prosperity when dealing with global finance this is why analysts also keep tracking the impact the recently raised interest rates will have on southeast asian countries as they still have a loose peg to the us dollar the primary challenge is that rising interest rate makes the payments to service existing debt more expensive which may trigger an outflow of capital investment historically southeast asian countries experienced a similar episode 25 years ago as the us economy recovered from a recession in the early 1990s the fed under alan greenspan began to raise the benchmark interest rates to head off inflation consequently the strong dollar made the us a more attractive investment destination than southeast asia which contributed to sudden capital outflows while not denying the endogenous weaknesses within these economies like large current account deficits insufficient foreign reserves and excessive exposure to foreign exchange risk raising the interest rate in the us is indeed an indispensable trigger hence in july 1997 when the thai baht suffered sharp devaluation a shock wave soon reverberated across the region the malaysian currency was devaluated dramatically and the index of the kuala lumpur stock exchange went down from 1200 to 260 points southeast asian countries paid heavy prices to recover from the turmoil however even though it is necessary to be alert to the potential impacts there is unlikely to be another full blown financial crisis in the region while pressure on exchange rates and bond yields is likely to persist over the coming months some solid evidence indicates that many economies are better prepared first of all they have accumulated sufficient reserves to hedge the risks attributed to external debt according to the world bank the international reserves to total external debt stocks in thailand reached 126 4 percent in 2020 in contrast to 24 5 percent in 1997 similarly the total reserves equaled 111 7 percent of total external debt in the philippines in 2020 in contrast to 17 2 percent in 1997 hence even though sri lanka recently announced national bankruptcy because of its inability to pay off external debt it is more likely an outlier many countries in this region have learned from the painful experiences of the past to build resilience to buttress their currency and national economy in addition many regional countries have also strengthened their current account and fiscal balances the current account to gdp in indonesia and malaysia is 0 28 percent and 3 46 percent in 2021 respectively in contrast to 2 26 percent and 5 93 percent in 1997 at the same time the worldwide inflation wave can also benefit countries that export food and commodities overall despite the hike interest rate backdrop southeast asia is in a relatively solid position the overheated domestic economy may force the fed to continue tightening the money supply which triggers tensions and risks to emerging markets nevertheless we should not overestimate the impacts this time the author is an assistant

luo jie china daily depreciation of euro will hurt eu economy and could trigger market turmoil in some emerging markets on july 12 the euro hit parity with the us dollar which is the first time since december 2002 the parity between the euro and the dollar will not only hurt the eu economy but also increase global market turmoil the depreciation of the euro is the result of multiple pressures including the eu s energy crisis rate spread and the strong dollar the chief concern in europe is the energy crisis after the outbreak of the russia ukraine conflict the european union reduced its imports of oil and natural gas from russia this has not only driven up energy prices sharply but also resulted in an energy crisis in the eurozone it cannot be ruled out that russia may suspend energy supplies to europe in addition the energy structure transformation in europe has led to a continuous decline in traditional energy production making it difficult to find suitable alternative energy sources in the short term the rate spread between the us dollar and the euro is also a driving force compared to the us federal reserve raising interest rates three times before the end of june the european central bank has been slow to adopt such aggressive policy the increasingly high fed interest rate creates a rate spread between the us dollar and the euro which has put depreciation pressure on the euro the rate spread between us 10 year government bonds and european 10 year aaa government bonds rose from 1 41 percent in mid june to 1 7 percent in mid july the strong dollar is exerting additional pressure at a time when international market risk aversion is on the rise because of the russia ukraine conflict and the entire world is dealing with high inflation and worrying about global recession the dollar has become a safe haven increasing demand for the dollar has led to the us dollar index soaring which is also the reason for the depreciation of the euro on july 15 the us dollar index rose to a 20 year high of 108 57 up 13 6 percent from the start of this year on july 28 the fed raised interest rates by 75 basis points which will give the strong dollar further support in the energy crisis the euro will weaken further the euro dollar parity will hurt the eurozone s economy in many aspects for example it will spike the inflation rate worsen trade imbalances and create additional difficulties for the ecb first the euro dollar parity will spike the euro inflation rate that is already out of control the surging prices of commodities under the russia ukraine conflict combining with the strong dollar will feed euro inflation level through imports the harmonized indices of consumer prices rose to 8 6 percent in june up from 8 1 percent in may and setting a new record for the eurozone but excluding energy and food the eurozone s core inflation index is 3 7 percent in june down from 3 8 percent in may and furthermore within the eurozone the greater the dependence on the international energy supply the higher the inflation rate france which mainly generates its electricity from nuclear power reported 6 5 percent inflation in june while spain a big importer of natural gas has a reported inflation rate of 10 2 percent and baltic states that rely heavily on russian energy report inflation rates of more than 20 percent second the euro dollar parity will worsen trade imbalances and the eurozone economy in theory the weaker euro may benefit eu exporters and narrow the trade deficit but the big increase in the costs of imports driven by the strong dollar and high commodity prices not only offsets the benefits but also exacerbates the trade deficit by may the eu had run a trade deficit for seven consecutive months in the same term germany imports 126 7 billion euros up 28 percent year on year and exports 125 8 billion euros up only 12 percent year on year after excluding seasonal effects germany s trade deficit was close to 1 billion euros in may for the first time since january 2008 france is also facing the similar problem the trade deficit of france hit a record 13 1 billion euros in may bringing the cumulative trade deficit to 113 9 billion euros over the past 12 months as the growth engine of the eurozone the performance of the german economy is quite important with 55 percent of its gas coming from russia german s economic model will be unsustainable without cheap russian energy which will cause real trouble for the european economy third the continuing weakness of the euro will undoubtedly create additional difficulties for the ecb to stop the euro depreciating further the ecb must raise interest rates more quickly and substantially but as a single currency the ecb s decision to raise interest rates needs to weigh and balance the economic fundamentals and prospects of all eurozone members in addition to the threat of inflation and recession the ecb also faces the risk of sovereign borrowing costs divergences right now in june the yield on 10 year german bonds reached 1 7 percent while italian 10 year bonds have risen above 4 percent which means the rate spreads between different eurozone countries has widened sharply and when the rate spreads widen it will become harder for the highly indebted countries in the eurozone to refinance their debt potentially triggering another sovereign debt crisis as a result the ecb has greater difficulty in setting a timetable for raising rates than the fed besides hurting the eurozone economy the euro dollar parity could trigger market turmoil in some emerging markets the euro dollar parity encourages global capital flows back to the united states which will exacerbate capital outflow pressures on other economies particularly emerging market economies and capital outflows will lead to exchange rate volatility and currency depreciation in emerging markets figures from the institute of international finance show a net outflow of 4 billion from emerging market portfolios in june which was the four consecutive months that emerging market countries had faced outflows furthermore the external debt of emerging market economies is mostly denominated in us dollars and a strong dollar will inevitably increase their debt repayment pressure and refinancing costs resulting in a surge in debt risks and in severe cases a sovereign debt crisis on july 26 the latest world economic outlook issued by the international monetary fund says that many emerging markets and developing economies are running out of fiscal space with 60 percent of low income countries already in or facing high risk of government debt distress ni shuhui is an assistant researcher of the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of

the dallas city council could consider a resolution in august aimed at blunting the impact of the texas legislature s trigger law that will go into effect following the supreme court s decision that overturned roe vs wade dallas measure would direct city staff which includes the dallas police department to make investigating and prosecuting accusations of abortion the lowest priority for enforcement and instructs city manager t c broadnax to not use city resources including funds personnel or hardware to create records regarding individual pregnancy outcomes provide information about pregnancy outcomes to any agency or to investigate whether an abortion has occurred a draft copy of the resolution obtained by d reads i would say that it technically really does accomplish the decriminalization here locally said dallas city councilman adam bazaldua who worked on the resolution and chairs the committee that will consider the matter before it goes to the full council being the lowest priority there s not much of an investigation that could be done if there s no resources that are able to be allocated the measure does not apply to instances where law enforcement officials might need to investigate cases of criminal negligence by a practitioner in the care of a pregnant person or where force or coercion is used against a pregnant person the resolution will be introduced in a special called meeting of the council s quality of life arts and culture committee tuesday if approved by the committee he aims to have it before the full council at its aug 10 meeting if it passes dallas would join many cities that have sought restrictions with similar resolutions including denton waco and austin the san antonio city council will vote on its resolution tuesday dallas county district attorney john creuzot said in june that he would not prosecute cases generated by the state s trigger law which the texas legislature established to make abortion illegal after the supreme court s ruling bazaldua hopes that the dallas county commissioners court would agree to a similar resolution all of this is to say that the city will undoubtedly be trading some paint with state officials particularly texas attorney general ken paxton when it comes to these measures paxton has already vowed to prosecute cases that run afoul of the new state law when local district attorneys won t that trigger law bans almost all abortions when it goes into effect aug 25 it increases the criminal and civil penalties associated with abortion that were already in place by way of laws that existed prior to the 1973 federal roe vs wade decision bazaldua said he knows the city can do little about the law itself but he hopes this resolution would provide a measure of protection for healthcare providers who could face felony charges if suspected of providing an abortion pregnant people would also have similar protections he said there s only so much that can be done at the local level and this is about as much as we can get he said adding that after the resolution is passed ideally the city would begin working with nonprofit and private sector partners to help people locate resources if they need to travel to another state for an abortion he also doesn t see this resolution endangering the city when it comes to another recently passed law that would penalize cities that defund their police departments he argues that funding isn t being reduced what can they do punish a city for saying this should not be a priority of ours he said when we have violent crime that s going on that we should be focusing our resources and funding on bazaldua said he worked with the city attorney s office on the wording of the resolution he said he also talked through the idea with colleagues he anticipates that the committee tuesday will support the measure and that a supermajority of the council will be in favor of it when it comes before the entire body i think that it s important for us to take a stance as local elected officials he said we were voted in and when we see something as outrageous and dangerous as the dobbs ruling for us to sit back and not provide some type of protection for dallas women to me is a missed opportunity get the d brief newsletter dallas most important news stories of the week delivered to your inbox each sunday
andrew yang losing candidate for president and new york city mayor is one of the founders of the forward party rob kim getty images in june 2022 gallup asked participants in a u s survey about their party membership in politics pollsters asked as of today do you consider yourself a republican a democrat or an independent the largest segment of participants 43 said they were independent republicans and democrats represented 27 each note the lower case i in independent that means it s not a party as the democrats and republicans are actual political parties have policies they have big bank accounts they have organizations in every state and they have a place on the ballot in elections but if the leaders of a new centrist political party whose formation was announced on july 28 2022 accomplish their goal the forward party will attract many voters who no longer identify as democrats or republicans and it will become a force for moderation and an institution in u s electoral politics how will we solve the big issues facing america the founders said at a news conference not left not right forward here are three stories from the conversation s archives that analyze the chances of third party success at changing the u s political system the founding fathers didn t think highly of political parties with alexander hamilton second from right saying they were a most fatal disease stock montage getty images 1 don t count on it political scientist alexander cohen of clarkson university acknowledges that the u s two party system has long been besieged critics of party politics in general date to the country s founding alexander hamilton called political parties a most fatal disease cohen writes james madison renounced the violence of faction and george washington feared that an overly successful party would create frightful despotism still parties persisted as the vehicles of electoral politics in the country evolving into the current two party system from a variety of parties that emerged and died over the past 200 years an upstart third party is unlikely to dislodge the status quo cohen says the modern republicans and democrats are unlikely to go the way of the whigs federalists and anti federalists regardless of recent political earthquakes 2 it s hard to end the party the american electoral system is the primary reason why the u s is the sole major democracy with only two parties consistently capable of electing public officials writes hershey votes are counted in most american elections using plurality rules or winner take all whoever gets the most votes wins the single seat up for election but in many other democracies hershey says multiple political parties can thrive because of a different system of electing representatives for example hershey writes there are widely used systems that award seats proportionally to the percentage of votes a party wins the 1852 whig party presidential campaign poster within 10 years the party was no more library of congress prints and photographs division in the netherlands for instance writes hershey even a small third party called the party for the animals composed of animal rights supporters not dogs and cats won 3 2 of the legislative vote in 2017 and earned five seats out of 150 in the national legislature if that system existed in the u s that would mean even a small party would be smart to run congressional candidates because even if the party only got 5 of the vote they could win 5 of the state s u s house seats but a caveat those voters who call themselves independent or say they re disappointed by or disillusioned with political parties are still influenced by vestigial party sentiment pollsters find writes hershey that most of these independents actually lean toward either the democrats or the republicans and their voting choices are almost as intensely partisan as those who do claim a party affiliation read more why trump is more likely to win in the gop than to take his followers to a new third party 3 winning isn t everything not everyone sees failure at the ballot box as the final judgment on u s third parties winning elections isn t necessarily the goal the most successful third parties in u s politics don t typically rise to dominance but instead challenge the major parties enough to force them to change course writes political scientist bernard tamas of valdosta state university tamas who has written a book on u s third parties says that they tend to emerge when democrats and republicans are politically polarized something that has happened periodically since the civil war that polarization between parties means larger groups of voters end up being not represented by either one and the intense contention between them also increases political dissatisfaction for the 50 years after the civil war the two parties were very polarized third parties were aggressive and strong during that period tamas writes but their aim wasn t to make themselves an institution in a new multiparty democracy as the forward party s leaders hope now for example the greenback party in the 1870s and the populist party in the 1890s both aimed via electoral victories to force the major parties to adopt policies supporting poor farmers and opposing business monopolies the populist party was especially successful in pressing the democrats to embrace those positions tamas predicted in 2021 that a new centrist third party would emerge very much like the party that made its debut on july 28 he noted that challenging the trump influenced gop would be a main focus of such a party the new party could gain strategic advantages by fielding candidates in local and state elections in more moderate places where some republican candidates have nevertheless chosen to follow their party to the extreme he writes but even if the forward party raises money and fields successful candidates it may not be long in the u s political landscape the progressive party existed for less than a decade for example tamas writes but by strategically winning the votes of moderate conservatives and thereby undermining

all in all the current market weakness is a buying opportunity if you re in for the long term the short term time frame is trickier oh my would you believe this just as we all thought oil might head north of us 150 a barrel part of the sector is doing a 180 you might notice when you look out the side window of your car petrol prices are retreating there s a reason for this but is it supply or demand well it s probably both but i suspect it may be more demand softening than supply surging pk verleger is an associate of mine and has covered this space for 50 years data out of the us shows gasoline use is down from its previous highs even before covid and this is in the peak summer driving period this is hitting the refiners between the legs as reuters reported the other week a sudden crash in global gasoline prices in the past two weeks has dented refiners profits pushing up inventories in key trading hubs around the world while looming exports from china and india also add to pressure on growing stockpiles unfortunately i don t have the data for europe but one analyst said natural gas prices there are trading for the equivalent of 600 a barrel that has to hit demand as discretionary income gets choked one wonders if gasoline use will ever breach those old highs in the eu and us data out of california seems to imply a permanent decline because it s the leading state in terms of electric vehicle ev adoption just on that another early adopter of electric vehicles is norway last month their statistical agency said electric vehicles now drive more miles annually on average than cars running purely on gasoline or diesel i m prepared to back the idea that more countries will turn like norway and california than not in the next five years that s why i view now as a perfect time to accumulate stocks related to the ev transition like my favourite three we just got good news from one of them this morning and it s up in trade as i write don t wait 2 another statistic release i like to follow is those from the banks each month we can see how much credit is going out and into which sectors we got the data from apra last friday the australian financial review afr covered it like this enter your email address in the box below and you ll get fat tail daily every day absolutely free as banks prepare their earnings updates and the reserve bank prepares to once again increase interest rates more evidence of a slowdown in new mortgage lending to owner occupiers has emerged the latest australian prudential regulatory authority data for june showed lending growth moderated to 0 8 per cent to 10 5 billion for owner occupiers and 0 7 per cent to 4 8 billion for investors in the last month of the financial year hmm slowdown ok yes 0 8 to owner occupiers may be slowing down but that figure is much higher than the dog days of 2019 and get this when it comes to the investors the afr says investor loans however grew by 6 4 per cent month on month the highest since november 2015 as cashed up landlords get ready for the return of international students and other migrants hmm how does the strength in investor lending and soaring rents square with those calling for a 15 40 decline in house prices in my view it doesn t it would take a much more substantial subtraction in those credit statistics to have me worried but hey you don t have to believe me the share market can help out here for example rea group which runs realestate com au has rallied more than 20 since june this wouldn t happen if the market was still fearful of a property crash i m kind of kicking myself for not buying it for less than 100 when i had the chance it wasn t fear that held me back it was greed i wanted it cheaper now i think the opportunity may have passed that s not to say the market will go up from here but rarely do you get a second look when a unique opportunity presents ah well every day another train leaves the station to my mind there s plenty more bargains around property out there on the market the previous hammering was prodigious but we can see the impetus for a potential rally another way interest rate expectations are moderating see here from the afr money markets have significantly wound back pricing on the expected peak reserve bank of australia cash rate to 3 per cent down from as much as 4 5 per cent tipped less than two months ago that doesn t seem so scary does it 3 doesn t even put the rate at equal to the current rate of inflation all in all the current market weakness is a buying opportunity if you re in for the long term the short term time frame is trickier regards callum newman editor the daily reckoning australia
