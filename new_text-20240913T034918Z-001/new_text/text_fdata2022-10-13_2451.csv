an inflationary tsunami is passing through the world economy creating economic disorder in some cases acute political crisis in every country it touches this is gathering momentum as the u s which is leading other global north economies attempts to control inflation by rapidly raising interest rates forcing the global north economies into recession the global south economies have been thereby struck by a quadruple whammy producing still more severe stagflation rising inflation and slowing growth than in the global north first rising u s interest rates force up the dollar s exchange rate against the currencies of developing countries increasing import prices that are usually set in dollars thereby worsening inflation for these developing countries second the dollar s climb against the currencies of developing countries increases the cost in their currencies of repaying international debts which are dollar priced third to attempt to prevent a very sharp fall in their exchange rates and to try to prevent capital from flowing out of their economies into the u s the global south countries raise interest rates pushing their economies toward recession fourth the global north s recession lowers the demand for global south exports putting further downward pressure on their economies politically this situation creates crises for several right wing regimes in the global south but also adds negative pressure on the policies of progressive left governments and leads to the threat of color revolutions u s inflation the u s claims that this global inflation and the downward pressure on living standards it creates is due to the ukraine war and that therefore countries should blame and unite against russia but a brief look at the facts refutes this claim the ukraine war started on february 24 2022 but u s inflation had already been rising sharply for nearly two years before that u s price rises were 0 1 percent in may 2020 but by january 2022 before the ukraine war prices had risen to 7 5 percent u s inflation rose by 7 4 percent before the war in august 2022 u s price rises were 8 3 percent a rise of only 0 8 percent since the war began more than 90 percent of the u s price rises took place before the ukraine war therefore it is important to think critically when the u s blames russia for the worldwide inflation and the resulting reduction in living standards the huge u s inflationary wave which spread globally with only a two to three month delay since the u s is the world s largest economy took place before the ukraine war as the wall street journal editorial board noted this isn t putin s inflation this inflation was made in washington what caused the u s inflation it is easy to explain in technical economic terms why u s inflation soared it was analyzed as it occurred by u s economists such as former treasury secretary larry summers in may 2021 summers warned we re taking very substantial risks on the inflation side the fed s idea used to be that it removed the punchbowl before the party got good now the fed s doctrine is that it will only remove the punchbowl after it sees some people staggering around drunk we are printing money we are creating government bonds we are borrowing on unprecedented scales the u s budget deficit rose to 26 percent of gdp and the annual increase in u s money supply reached 27 percent both by far the highest in u s peacetime history with a huge surge in demand taking place and no major increase in supply soaring u s inflation was inevitable what was the role of inflation but more important than a technical explanation is understanding the social role of inflation inflation showed that demand was far higher than supply putting upward pressure on the prices of goods and services so with no increase in supply taking place demand had to be cut back the key social question was which u s spending would be cut many u s reforms could be implemented by cutting demand and reallocating spending thereby reducing inflationary pressures while not reducing u s living standards indeed these reforms would improve u s economic efficiency and living standards u s military expenditure is the highest in the world more than the military spending by the next nine countries combined this 3 7 percent of u s gdp spending could be reduced with no fall in u s living standards equally in 2020 u s expenditure on healthcare reached 19 7 percent of gdp almost one fifth of its economy but the u s private healthcare system is very inefficient the u s spends a higher proportion on health care as a share of its economy than any other economy in the world but the u s life expectancy is only 77 years compared to an average of 83 years in other high income economies the cost of the private health care system in the u s comprises a higher proportion of the country s economy for its citizens to live around six years less than comparable countries but reducing u s military expenditure or rationalizing health care would go against the vested interests of arms manufacturers and big pharma in the u s respectively reducing u s military spending would force a lessening of its aggressive overseas military policy rationalizing u s healthcare would entail a move toward a public healthcare system as more successfully used by other countries and would cut the profits of big private healthcare corporations the u s government s vested interest in supporting arms manufacturers and big pharma means that no such actions will be taken but if no measures are taken against these vested interests then the only alternative way to reduce spending is to cut working class living standards this is what happens during inflation as john maynard keynes explained it is much easier to cut real wages by high inflation than by directly reducing money wages it is a partially concealed cut and workers cannot negotiate with their employers over inflation levels the medium and long term inflation is destabilizing and must be controlled normally in capitalism this is achieved through recession but short term inflation is a powerful tool to reduce real wages which is what is happening the average u s money wages are increasing in august they rose by 4 6 percent but prices increased more rapidly by 8 3 percent during the same period u s real wages therefore fell as they have every month since april 2021 in august 2022 u s real weekly earnings were 3 4 percent lower than a year previously but this inflation which is cutting u s workers real earnings spills out into the rest of the world creating a crisis in the global south u s inflation therefore attacks both u s workers and the rest of the world this article was produced by globetrotter john ross is a senior fellow at

interest rates in 1931 following the stock market crash of 1929 they made it even harder for people to survive for businesses to survive for people to buy stuff and that pushed the economy into the complete collapse of the depression he says it is perhaps the worst error in the history of the federal reserve still given the choice between having the federal reserve regulate the flow of currency in the u s and delegating the task to congress goldstein sides with the fed in the long run it s reasonable to think we ll be better off with some amount of short term pain now that comes from raising interest rates he says the belief is that politicians who have to answer to voters in a month won t be able to make those trade offs of short term pain for long term gain and i think that s a reasonable belief i think i buy it interview highlights on the idea of money as a made up thing i came to thinking about money pretty late in my life i was an english major in college and a newspaper reporter and it wasn t really until i got to planet money right after the financial crisis that i really started studying money thinking about money i hadn t really thought about it but it seemed like water or something it just seemed like something that exists in the world and is subject to the laws of physics and what i learned what i realized as i started learning more about it studying it is that is not true at all money doesn t exist in the world until people invent it that is the fundamental idea of the made up thing and moreover people didn t just invent money once people we have kept reinventing money and reinventing money in different ways with different rules and all of those rules are really interesting and have interesting sort of social context and social consequences on the invention of paper money by the time paper money shows up coins have been around for well over 1 000 years paper money first shows up in china around 1000 a d and it shows up in a very particular place it shows up in sichuan province and in sichuan province they used iron coins for money in most of china they used bronze coins but in sichuan they used a lot of iron and this is the era when the value of a coin is based on the value of the metal it contains in europe they re using silver coins and gold coins which are obviously worth a lot bronze is worth a fair bit iron then as is now is not worth very much so you needed a lot of iron coins to buy anything you needed for example a pound and a half of iron coins to buy a pound of salt i think of it like if you had to go to the grocery store and you could only use pennies it s just a terrible thing to use for money so some merchant in sichuan has this idea where he tells his customers look it s terrible having to carry around all these iron coins i ll tell you what let s do you leave a bunch of your iron coins with me leave say 1 000 iron coins with me and i ll write you a receipt like a claim check this piece of paper is good for 1 000 iron coins at my shop and people start doing that and then when they want to buy something instead of going back to get the 1 000 coins from the shop they just give that claim check that iou to the person they re buying from and that piece of paper becomes money and everybody loves it it s a great idea the government sees that happening the government soon takes over the business of printing paper money and it comes into the world on how paper money transformed the chinese economy we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient it was a huge deal it was you know we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient there is no mechanical transport at this time so you have to carry around your vast quantities of iron coins whatever on a cart or something that s expensive it s impractical it s easy to get robbed now you can transport the same amount of purchasing power with a piece of paper it s a crazy breakthrough and as it happens this breakthrough comes at this moment in chinese history and helps to propel this moment in chinese history that is this real economic flowering there is more trade in part because of paper money and with more trade you can have more specialization so people can grow the food that grows best where they live and then trade it across distances you have urbanization you have cities of over a million people growing up at a moment when cities in europe are under 100 000 it s really this kind of like a proto industrial revolution you have technological advancements it s this incredible economic flowering that is driven in part but certainly not entirely by the advent of paper money on how in the early years of the u s there was no national currency but thousands of kinds of paper money there is this amazing moment in u s history that kind of peaks in the 1840s or so where there are thousands of different kinds of paper money there was no central bank there weren t even any national banks there were lots of little banks given charters by their states by the states they were in in a lot of states any bank that followed a few rules could print its own paper money and if you can print paper money why wouldn t you and so there was this incredible proliferation of paper money the idea was you could bring your paper dollars to the bank that issued them and redeem them for gold or silver whenever you wanted but as you can imagine this creates a lot of problems problems for people who just want to buy or sell stuff like if you re a merchant and somebody walks into your store with a dollar bill from a bank you ve never heard of how do you even know it s real how do you know that the bank is legit how do you know that the bank is sound maybe it is a real bank but they re going to go bankrupt and you ll bring your piece of paper in and they won t be able to give you your gold or silver and so there arose to solve this problem these periodicals called banknote reporters that were like little newsletters basically little magazines that listed every bank in america and what their currency looked like what pictures it had on it and also a recommendation for whether to take the money at face value or whether to apply a discount rate if the bank is unsound you might say yeah i ll take your 5 bill but i ll only give you 4 50 credit for it and this persisted for decades kind of amazingly lauren

the federal reserve is currently engaged in a battle to bring down the nation s inflation rate which has beenrising steadily since 2021 journalist jacob goldstein says the fed s ultimate goal is to slow inflation by raising interest rates while also avoiding a recession it feels kind of scary right now frankly goldstein says raising interest rates is a blunt tool and they don t know exactly what the effects are going to be and so there is a very reasonable chance that what they are doing is going to cause a recession goldstein is an executive producer at the audio production company pushkin

brooke cagle having a solid linkedin profile is one way to increase your visibility and open up more professional opportunities for yourself people often invest most their efforts into capturing their career accomplishments in the experience section unfortunately the profile picture and background header photo are often an afterthought however not carefully considering the imagery you feature on your linkedin profile is a mistake especially since these images are what profile visitors see first creating that important first impression of your reputation and personal brand the background banner image in particular is not something all users even consider adjusting some users simply use the default image of the blue gradient with dots and lines perhaps because they don t realize a custom image can be uploaded don t get around to it or just don t know what image would be good to use linkedin your linkedin background banner photo should reinforce who you are and visually support the written portions of your profile this image should communication your value skills and professional identity your background image is a perfect place to highlight social proof or achievements says shashank shalabh ceo of omnidigit linkedin is all about branding with the right messaging both visual and text you can create a better impression with this in mind what sort of background image can you use that doesn t come across as overly promotional forced or self aggrandizing here are 10 simple ideas to help you select an image that reinforces your personal brand 1 work space jo johnston pixabay a picture of an office space desk or work environment is a simple way to connote professionalism a clean and simplistic workspace gives off a professional but reserved and respectful vibe says liz jeneault vp of marketing for faveable com if you choose an image of a desk she suggests featuring objects like a laptop mobile device glasses pads of paper pens or paperclips which can convey sophistication alexander lowry professor of finance at gordon college also suggests featuring a meeting space like a boardroom especially if you re a corporate executive yourself or work on issues related to corporate governance 2 benefit your client desires filip mroz unsplash focusing on the end benefit your client or customer desires allows you to communicate the value you offer without overly promoting your specific product or services says marsha kelly president of best 4 business she recommends you speak directly to people s emotional buying impulses for example if you work in the medical or insurance markets you could feature an image of healthy people engaged in enjoyable activities if you work in financial planning you could use an image that conveys financial freedom 3 city landscape martin adams unsplash if your work is related to a specific geographical location you could feature a city skyline or landmark this is a great way of showcasing to potential connections the city you re based in says deborah sweeney ceo of mycorporation com you could also use an image of a place that relates to your personal history sharing the city you live in where you were born or a place with special meaning to you is visually appealing and adds personality to an otherwise professionally focused page says alexandra shadrow ceo ofrelovv com 4 physical architecture emil zimmerman showing a nice shot of the building where you work conveys a sense of credibility and status especially if your organization has a strong reputation if you don t prefer to feature your actual company you could also use a generic image of an office lobby building facade or city district the idea is to feature an image that aligns with your sector if you work in the corporate world consider using a modern office building if you work within education perhaps a school campus 5 people you serve christina morillo showing a picture of your clients customers community or employees connotes the impact you re having on individuals around you featuring people in your image is ideal for any client facing professional who needs to show a connection with those in his her industry says jeff steen social media and marketing specialist at fitsmallbusiness com you don t have to necessarily include the actual individuals you serve if you re concerned about confidentiality instead you could grab a stock image that features people who are good examples of the types of people you serve or people in a typical setting where you meet your clients 6 cause or mission rawfilm unsplash using an image that represents the impact you re trying to create in your career can elevate your professional image beyond your basic job title or role stefania sigurdson forbes marketing consultant at gravityhub recommends using an outdoor photo having an outdoor photo with meaning can be a refreshing change to the self aggrandizement you can see on linkedin she states showing this gives a peek at your personality and the outdoor shot gives people a break from being inside the office for example if you are passionate about renewable energy consider including a picture of a wind turbine if you are passionate about the arts perhaps some sort of outdoor installation that features the style of art you embrace 7 tools of the trade william bayreuther featuring common objects used in in your line of work is a simple way to convey how you spend your time a picture depicting the primary tools of the pictured person s profession can offset the boring plain backgrounds seen in most profile photos says jeremy rose director of certahosting for example a photographer could feature a close up image of a camera a coder could show a computer screen a coffeeshop owner could show coffee beans using tools can reinforce your profession and capabilities without being overly promotional vain or self aggrandising says sammi coppedge public relations specialist at one click ventures 8 your product or service vanveenjf you could feature an image of the actual product or service you re offering an entrepreneur could be the product you re launching a high quality photo showcasing your product s directly on your profile can instantly intrigue potential buyers partners and investors says alexis davis founder of the content plug a shop owner could feature an image of your best selling product someone who works in b2b product manufacturing could feature a close up of the component you supply to customers if you re in more of a service industry you could simply google the name of your sector to generate ideas of which images are associated with your sector for example if you work in logistics perhaps a cargo ship or airplane if you work in social services a community event if you re involved in supplying solar energy solar panels 9 you doing your work j kelly brito an image really can be worth a thousand words when you feature an image of you doing your actual work while this can risk coming across as a bit staged and self aggrandizing a tasteful natural image of you in action can demonstrate the impact you re having if you re a creator like a writer you could have someone take a natural shot of you drafting ideas on paper or typing on your laptop if you re a speaker you could show a picture of you speaking an audience or a microphone 10 solid color or abstract texture ferdinand stöhr if all else fails you could simply use a color other than the linkedin default blue to give your profile a more considered feel even just another color can help you stand out in a sea of linkedin blue according to debra boggs cofounder of d s professional coaching choose a color that matches your personality or if you re a business owner choose a color that matches your brand colors you could also consider some sort of abstract texture boggs states while photos of things like laptops cups of coffee and keyboards can look overused and cliche abstract images or textures can make your profile stand out without looking inauthentic she says you should choose a texture that invokes a feeling you want your audience to associate with you where to find photos once you decide on what type of image you want to feature as your background image you need to then find an actual photo you have the rights to use simply using a photo you quickly find using google images isn t the best way forward because those images aren t always legal to reuse if you don t already have a photo you ve taken yourself or photo you have explicit permission to use you could purchase a photo from stock image sites like getty or shutterstock however this tends to be quite expensive and staged stock images can often look a bit dated or artificial these days instead consider using attribution free cc0 creative commons images these images are free and legal for you to use popular cc0 sites include unsplash or pexels where images tend to feel more current and natural you can also create custom background images on sites like canva or visme once you ve decided on what sort of photo to use simply follow these linkedin s instructions to edit your background photo on your profile customize your background image to stand out your linkedin profile s background image is your opportunity to create a positive first impression that matters images are often more powerful than words alone take the time to select a thoughtful background image so you can reinforce your personal brand convey what makes you unique and differentiate yourself from the sea of other professionals out there after all words alone may not always be enough to capture the full picture of who you are and what you can offer to others

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

the federal reserve is currently engaged in a battle to bring down the nation s inflation rate which has beenrising steadily since 2021 journalist jacob goldstein says the fed s ultimate goal is to slow inflation by raising interest rates while also avoiding a recession it feels kind of scary right now frankly goldstein says raising interest rates is a blunt tool and they don t know exactly what the effects are going to be and so there is a very reasonable chance that what they are doing is going to cause a recession goldstein is an executive producer at the audio production company pushkin industries where he hosts the business and tech podcast what s your problem prior to that he spent 10 years as the co host of the npr program planet money his 2020 book money the true story of a made up thing traces the history and meaning of money including the role of the federal reserve in regulating the u s economy goldstein says the fed inadvertently fueled the great depression when it raised interest rates in 1931 following the stock market crash of 1929 they made it even harder for people to survive for businesses to survive for people to buy stuff and that pushed the economy into the complete collapse of the depression he says it is perhaps the worst error in the history of the federal reserve still given the choice between having the federal reserve regulate the flow of currency in the u s and delegating the task to congress goldstein sides with the fed in the long run it s reasonable to think we ll be better off with some amount of short term pain now that comes from raising interest rates he says the belief is that politicians who have to answer to voters in a month won t be able to make those trade offs of short term pain for long term gain and i think that s a reasonable belief i think i buy it interview highlights on the idea of money as a made up thing i came to thinking about money pretty late in my life i was an english major in college and a newspaper reporter and it wasn t really until i got to planet money right after the financial crisis that i really started studying money thinking about money i hadn t really thought about it but it seemed like water or something it just seemed like something that exists in the world and is subject to the laws of physics and what i learned what i realized as i started learning more about it studying it is that is not true at all money doesn t exist in the world until people invent it that is the fundamental idea of the made up thing and moreover people didn t just invent money once people we have kept reinventing money and reinventing money in different ways with different rules and all of those rules are really interesting and have interesting sort of social context and social consequences on the invention of paper money by the time paper money shows up coins have been around for well over 1 000 years paper money first shows up in china around 1000 a d and it shows up in a very particular place it shows up in sichuan province and in sichuan province they used iron coins for money in most of china they used bronze coins but in sichuan they used a lot of iron and this is the era when the value of a coin is based on the value of the metal it contains in europe they re using silver coins and gold coins which are obviously worth a lot bronze is worth a fair bit iron then as is now is not worth very much so you needed a lot of iron coins to buy anything you needed for example a pound and a half of iron coins to buy a pound of salt i think of it like if you had to go to the grocery store and you could only use pennies it s just a terrible thing to use for money so some merchant in sichuan has this idea where he tells his customers look it s terrible having to carry around all these iron coins i ll tell you what let s do you leave a bunch of your iron coins with me leave say 1 000 iron coins with me and i ll write you a receipt like a claim check this piece of paper is good for 1 000 iron coins at my shop and people start doing that and then when they want to buy something instead of going back to get the 1 000 coins from the shop they just give that claim check that iou to the person they re buying from and that piece of paper becomes money and everybody loves it it s a great idea the government sees that happening the government soon takes over the business of printing paper money and it comes into the world on how paper money transformed the chinese economy we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient it was a huge deal it was you know we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient there is no mechanical transport at this time so you have to carry around your vast quantities of iron coins whatever on a cart or something that s expensive it s impractical it s easy to get robbed now you can transport the same amount of purchasing power with a piece of paper it s a crazy breakthrough and as it happens this breakthrough comes at this moment in chinese history and helps to propel this moment in chinese history that is this real economic flowering there is more trade in part because of paper money and with more trade you can have more specialization so people can grow the food that grows best where they live and then trade it across distances you have urbanization you have cities of over a million people growing up at a moment when cities in europe are under 100 000 it s really this kind of like a proto industrial revolution you have technological advancements it s this incredible economic flowering that is driven in part but certainly not entirely by the advent of paper money on how in the early years of the u s there was no national currency but thousands of kinds of paper money there is this amazing moment in u s history that kind of peaks in the 1840s or so where there are thousands of different kinds of paper money there was no central bank there weren t even any national banks there were lots of little banks given charters by their states by the states they were in in a lot of states any bank that followed a few rules could print its own paper money and if you can print paper money why wouldn t you and so there was this incredible proliferation of paper money the idea was you could bring your paper dollars to the bank that issued them and redeem them for gold or silver whenever you wanted but as you can imagine this creates a lot of problems problems for people who just want to buy or sell stuff like if you re a merchant and somebody walks into your store with a dollar bill from a bank you ve never heard of how do you even know it s real how do you know that the bank is legit how do you know that the bank is sound maybe it is a real bank but they re going to go bankrupt and you ll bring your piece of paper in and they won t be able to give you your gold or silver and so there arose to solve this problem these periodicals called banknote reporters that were like little newsletters basically little magazines that listed every bank in america and what their currency looked like what pictures it had on it and also a recommendation for whether to take the money at face value or whether to apply a discount rate if the bank is unsound you might say yeah i ll take your 5 bill but i ll only give you 4 50 credit for it and this persisted for decades kind of amazingly lauren

the conspiracy theorist has turned career ending setbacks into profit windfalls but will the sandy hook judgement be too much to overcome as the jury s numbers were announced 120 million for the father of six year old emilie parker 109 million for the parents of six year old ben wheeler alex jones was already live on infowars this was an emergency broadcast to save the company he said and he would stay on until midnight the numbers kept coming in the end the connecticut jury decided that jones must pay a staggering 965 million for pushing the false claims that the sandy hook elementary school shooting where 20 first graders and six adults were killed in 2012 had been staged and the grieving parents were crisis actors jones empire looked to be in ruins and there s more to come this was the second of three trials to determine how much jones must pay after he was found liable for defamation by default for pushing the false claims about sandy hook in august a texas jury found he should pay 49 million a third trial also in texas where jones lives is expected to begin later this year robbie and alyssa parker whose daughter emilie was killed at sandy hook elementary school are seen shortly after the 2012 shooting robbie parker was later falsely called a crisis actor and the parkers are among those who sued alex jones for defamation howard simmons ny daily news via getty images while the judgment could cripple his business jones went straight to the same playbook that s allowed him to stay in the national conversation for more than two decades make outrageous claims galvanize his loyal audience around a collective sense of martyrdom and then cash in on their support he gets so riled up on his way to becoming america s most notorious conspiracy theorist jones has faced plenty of setbacks that would derail most broadcasters but jones isn t a normal broadcaster his critics are part of the very mainstream that infowars was set up to discredit and he has spent two decades turning career ending setbacks into profit windfalls jones got his start from flipping a table on set as a community college student in austin he appeared on a public access cable station one night during his late night slot jones was going on a wild rant and let loose on a table the segment caught the eye of brian billeck the operations director for austin talk radio station kjfk who was looking to hire the phone went flying and the table went flying and he s screaming at the camera and everything billeck recalls and i was like that s beautiful billeck brought jones on to host a late night show and as jones audience grew he was moved earlier and earlier on the lineup the one thing you cannot deny about alex is his passion billeck said if you watch him or listen to him you will believe that he is adamant about whatever he is talking about he just gets so riled up kjfk became an arena for jones to explore conspiracies jones pushed the baseless claims that the 1995 oklahoma city bombing that killed 168 people was a government false flag operation and that the 76 branch davidians who died at the fbi s 1993 siege of their waco texas compound had been killed by government agents instead of purposely setting fire to the ranch eventually it got to be too much not the content itself but jones fixation on a single story billeck said alex jones confronts hispanic protesters in austin texas on september 18 2005 at the texas capitol who were protesting minutemen plans to patrol the texas border for illegal aliens robert daemmrich photography inc corbis via getty images the world had kind of moved on in a way and alex was still clamoring on about the branch davidians literally spending his entire show talking about that billeck said eventually it just got to a point where alex was just not listening to us anymore doing what he wanted to do selling ads became difficult he said jones would later tell the austin chronicle that his firing had been purely political a move by the higher ups to get him to stop talking about waco and other political topics either way from then on jones would be his own boss this meant he had to not only plan his broadcasts but learn how to make them profitable going independent jones turned the setback into an opportunity after his firing jones set up a home broadcasting operation where he could record shows for stations around the country his new platform infowars allowed him to bypass editors and broadcasters who might compel him to moderate his output it didn t take long for him to get traction in 2000 jones released a two hour film called dark secrets inside bohemian grove jones and an undercover cameraman had gained access to bohemian grove a secretive invitation only gathering in northern california the event held every year in july attracted some of the richest and most powerful men in the world for two weeks of heavy drinking super secret talks druid worship and other rituals as the washington post would later report jones film included footage from the cremation of the care ceremony and participants in costume burning a coffin effigy it caused a stir that was kind of his big break that put him on the map said jared holt a senior research manager at the institute for strategic dialogue a think tank that studies extremism the film marked an important transition for jones from and austin based libertarian shock jock to a conspiracy theorist with a national audience holt said the next summer jones went on infowars with a warning about coming false flag attacks just as the 1933 fire at germany s parliament the reichstag became a pretext to crush dissent and usher in adolf hitler s nazi dictatorship jones lectured his audience the u s government would also use terrorist attacks to justify intrusions into americans liberty osama bin laden the al qaeda leader who three years earlier had orchestrated attacks at two u s embassies in east africa would be blamed jones said six weeks later sept 11 2001 jones went on air to crow about his i told you so moment and to make the baseless claim that the attack had been a false flag as he told his listeners that morning ninety eight percent chance this was a government orchestrated controlled bombing jones words attracted fierce backlash he would later tell rolling stone that he lost 70 of his affiliates on 9 11 alone but jones didn t relent he doubled down building more elaborate conspiracy theories and bolstering his reputation in the so called 9 11 truther movement a decade after 9 11 according to jones infowars com had an audience of more than 32 million users gold and supplements running infowars gave alex jones the freedom to say whatever he wanted and hawking his own products or working directly with entrepreneurs who were also his allies allowed him to bypass traditional advertisers from the earliest days of infowars jones partnered with the talk show syndication company genesis communications network genesis was owned by ted anderson a precious metals seller who used the company largely to push advertisements for his bullion business midas resources jones saw how pushing fears could lead directly to sales and old recordings of jones shows demonstrate just how symbiotic his relationship with anderson could be jones would talk about how he believed the globalists were planning to tank the world s economy and then anderson would come on to offer a special rate to buy gold there is one thing that they can t get their greedy hands on and that s gold and silver and precious metals jones said during a broadcast in 2009 they can put property taxes on your land and take it they can do anything they can t get your gold and silver unless they physically stick you up for it the state of minnesota eventually shut midas resources in 2017 in part for misappropriating money and jones business relationship with genesis is now minimal as he has shifted focus from radio to online but advertisements remain a huge part of the infowars experience and these days many of the products jones is selling are his own and he continues to be the perfect pitchman in 2013 jones made the leap to selling dietary supplements turning infowars as new york magazine would write into a snake oil empire a few years later when buzzfeed news sent six of infowars most popular supplements to a lab for testing in 2017 they found that they were reasonably safe but largely less effective than cheaper counterparts on the market the infowars online store also sells a large selection of disaster preparedness products like storable food packs and radios jones approached his job like a televangelist according to mark fenster a conspiracy theory expert at the university of florida s levin college of law they too sell merchandise that s related to the impending apocalypse and it is therefore a longstanding tradition in the us of finding ways of taking advantage of whether you believe it or not the coming end fenster said picture showing a computer screen displaying the twitter account of far right conspiracy theorist alex jones taken on august 15 2018 in washngton dc eric baradat afp via getty images ads not only play during the breaks but jones often pitches products during the broadcasts itself making it almost impossible to determine how much of an episode is devoted to selling products he spends like half of his time on air doing poorly disguised ads trying to put a number on it or statistical analysis would require defining what actually constitutes an ad dan friesen who hosts a podcast about infowars said you could argue that 100 of the show is ads since infowars remains a privately held company it s somewhat opaque how much money jones makes from shilling supplements while infowars recently filed for bankruptcy and jones himself has claimed he s practically broke an expert who testified at the sandy hook trial in texas painted a picture of enormous wealth with likely even more hidden away in shell companies bernard pettingill jr a forensic economist called by the plaintiffs estimated that jones and his company free speech systems have a combined worth somewhere between 135 million and 270 million at one point in 2018 jones company was raking in more than 800 000 in sales a day according to evidence presented at the first sandy hook trial alex talks about the goal of infowars of being kind of a revolutionary one and i think that has really caught up some of his followers holt said it s produced a very reliable base of true believers for him that will continue buying the water filters and supplements and whatnot no matter if they have to go to a weird platform to watch alex the very bad year fifteen years after first reaching a national audience the first signs of real trouble for jones came after the 2016 presidential election in response to the disinformation that flooded social media platforms companies that hosted jones videos began clamping down on his content jones began receiving more frequent warnings that his content had been removed or restricted for violating the rules according to robert jacobson a former infowars staffer jones seemed genuinely worried on days that youtube would take something down jacobson described the mood around the office as shut the lights off everybody nobody talks in the office you know turn on red lights all over the place alex is mad then came 2018 in march of 2018 a report by cnn found that advertisements for major companies were running on jones youtube videos without the advertisers advance knowledge companies like nike 20th century fox acer expedia and others quickly pulled their ads from the jones videos at the end of july jones set off an even stricter crackdown by multiple major social media platforms when he made a threatening statement about russia investigation special counsel robert mueller on his show within days spotify facebook apple youtube and pinterest had banned jones from their platforms facebook said in a statement at the time that jones violated policies against glorifying violence and using dehumanizing language against minorities in the meantime between april and october of 2018 jones faced multiple defamation lawsuits over his sandy hook claims from parents who were subjected to threats and harassment by his fans but as always jones response to alleged persecution concocted or real was to hold steady and find ways to profit from the backlash the social media ban might have been career ending for many but it was the best thing that can ever happen to jones friesen said he has this notion that whenever he s being attacked that means he s on the right track friesen said and so when companies deplatformed him it was able to be spun within his already existing audience as evidence that alex is more right than even we thought according to the financial expert who testified in the texas sandy hook trial jones brought in more money after being deplatformed pettingill the expert called by the plaintiffs estimated that jones companies made 64 9 million in 2021 up from an average of 53 2 million between september 2018 and december 2018 jones attorneys disputed the analysis as jones sees it even if deplatforming slimmed down his daily reach his show now is more underground and more avant garde more black sheep more rebel and more outlaw and made it more successful in a way as he told channel 5 after the sandy hook trial in texas crushing globalists watching the alex jones show can be baffling for those uninitiated in the world of conspiracy theories the show isn t so much a news broadcast as a four hour long improv show minus the comedic relief for his prompts jones flips between printouts of news stories and then launches into rants about how you the loyal viewer are being played speaking directly to the camera and talking a mile a minute the shows are punctuated with references to the globalists and figures like klaus schwab executive director the world economic forum and liberal philanthropist george soros then cut to an ad touting survival shield x 3 iodine drops jones has said that fluoridated drinking water is making people dumber and the government has developed technology to control the weather according to him bill gates is leading a eugenics plot to sterilize and kill many in the developing world under the guise of vaccinations from his foundation longtime informal adviser to donald trump roger stone right and and alex jones left speak to reporters in december 2018 alex wong getty images he leveraged the covid 19 pandemic into a financial bonanza the new yorker reported in 2020 finding a vast new audience for his claims that vaccines and covid related restrictions were part of a plot to take away people s freedom when the covid 19 vaccines became available jones called them poison shots designed to erase our immune systems and cause cancer and heart attacks these conspiracy theories might sound like different stories but in jones world it s really one single theory that there s a shadowy group of globalists working in the upper echelons of society to create a totalitarian regime in december 2015 jones profile grew when he hosted then presidential candidate donald trump on his show a new fear began to emerge in the media was jones influencing republican politics thanks to trump fringe news enters the mainstream one washington post headline read after the interview alex jones s bigoted buffoonery goes viral in the time of trump wrote tablet outlets began profiling jones salon warned of jones dangerous rise esquire called him a nexus of patriotism and fear in 2019 the show this american life devoted an entire episode to debunking jones origin story that crooked cops had forced him from his high school after he accused police at an assembly of selling drugs to students ten people who were at the school at the time told the show that they never remembered jones speaking up and in fact one friend said the joneses left town a couple weeks after alex was beaten up at a party jones has twisted this criticism to bolster his case that he s a patriotic whistleblower who s under attack for speaking truth to power the globalists he says are trying to suppress his voice tripling down for most public figures having to confront the sandy hook families in court for essentially siccing his followers on them would be an embarrassing pr nightmare to say the least for jones the trials have been yet another opportunity to tell his audience that the powerful are out to get him and to call his army of fans to action graphics mocking the two judges have appeared on the infowars website while on his show jones has offered grist for the opposing lawyers to grill him about on the witness stand toward the end of his testimony in connecticut as chris mattei lead attorney for the plaintiffs said jones had put a target on the backs of the grieving families jones snapped is this a struggle session are we in china i ve already said i m sorry hundreds of times and i m done saying i m sorry jones said while jones outburst might appear on the surface to go against his best interests inflaming the jury needlessly it spoke to jones broader approach of speaking directly to his fanbase and to encourage their support alex jones testifying during the sandy hook defamation damages trial on sept 22 2022 tyler sizemore hearst connecticut media pool via reuters the words the most censored news broadcast in the world now appear over his online broadcasts as jones tells his audience things like we re in a tow to tow battle with the globalists and when you stand up like i ve done they come after you while the trial was broadcast live on youtube infowars ran clips and encouraged his audience to help out he recently started running a mega massive sale on his supplements and urged his fans to stock up and support him at the same time he also set up a new website saveinfowars com which directs to a legal defense fund we re going to make it through these times with god s help but i can t imagine a world

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

the federal reserve is currently engaged in a battle to bring down the nation s inflation rate which has beenrising steadily since 2021 journalist jacob goldstein says the fed s ultimate goal is to slow inflation by raising interest rates while also avoiding a recession it feels kind of scary right now frankly goldstein says raising interest rates is a blunt tool and they don t know exactly what the effects are going to be and so there is a very reasonable chance that what they are doing is going to cause a recession goldstein is an executive producer at the audio production company pushkin industries where he hosts the business and tech podcast what s your problem prior to that he spent 10 years as the co host of the npr program planet money his 2020 book money the true story of a made up thing traces the history and meaning of money including the role of the federal reserve in regulating the u s economy goldstein says the fed inadvertently fueled the great depression when it raised interest rates in 1931 following the stock market crash of 1929 they made it even harder for people to survive for businesses to survive for people to buy stuff and that pushed the economy into the complete collapse of the depression he says it is perhaps the worst error in the history of the federal reserve still given the choice between having the federal reserve regulate the flow of currency in the u s and delegating the task to congress goldstein sides with the fed in the long run it s reasonable to think we ll be better off with some amount of short term pain now that comes from raising interest rates he says the belief is that politicians who have to answer to voters in a month won t be able to make those trade offs of short term pain for long term gain and i think that s a reasonable belief i think i buy it interview highlights on the idea of money as a made up thing i came to thinking about money pretty late in my life i was an english major in college and a newspaper reporter and it wasn t really until i got to planet money right after the financial crisis that i really started studying money thinking about money i hadn t really thought about it but it seemed like water or something it just seemed like something that exists in the world and is subject to the laws of physics and what i learned what i realized as i started learning more about it studying it is that is not true at all money doesn t exist in the world until people invent it that is the fundamental idea of the made up thing and moreover people didn t just invent money once people we have kept reinventing money and reinventing money in different ways with different rules and all of those rules are really interesting and have interesting sort of social context and social consequences on the invention of paper money by the time paper money shows up coins have been around for well over 1 000 years paper money first shows up in china around 1000 a d and it shows up in a very particular place it shows up in sichuan province and in sichuan province they used iron coins for money in most of china they used bronze coins but in sichuan they used a lot of iron and this is the era when the value of a coin is based on the value of the metal it contains in europe they re using silver coins and gold coins which are obviously worth a lot bronze is worth a fair bit iron then as is now is not worth very much so you needed a lot of iron coins to buy anything you needed for example a pound and a half of iron coins to buy a pound of salt i think of it like if you had to go to the grocery store and you could only use pennies it s just a terrible thing to use for money so some merchant in sichuan has this idea where he tells his customers look it s terrible having to carry around all these iron coins i ll tell you what let s do you leave a bunch of your iron coins with me leave say 1 000 iron coins with me and i ll write you a receipt like a claim check this piece of paper is good for 1 000 iron coins at my shop and people start doing that and then when they want to buy something instead of going back to get the 1 000 coins from the shop they just give that claim check that iou to the person they re buying from and that piece of paper becomes money and everybody loves it it s a great idea the government sees that happening the government soon takes over the business of printing paper money and it comes into the world on how paper money transformed the chinese economy we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient it was a huge deal it was you know we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient there is no mechanical transport at this time so you have to carry around your vast quantities of iron coins whatever on a cart or something that s expensive it s impractical it s easy to get robbed now you can transport the same amount of purchasing power with a piece of paper it s a crazy breakthrough and as it happens this breakthrough comes at this moment in chinese history and helps to propel this moment in chinese history that is this real economic flowering there is more trade in part because of paper money and with more trade you can have more specialization so people can grow the food that grows best where they live and then trade it across distances you have urbanization you have cities of over a million people growing up at a moment when cities in europe are under 100 000 it s really this kind of like a proto industrial revolution you have technological advancements it s this incredible economic flowering that is driven in part but certainly not entirely by the advent of paper money on how in the early years of the u s there was no national currency but thousands of kinds of paper money there is this amazing moment in u s history that kind of peaks in the 1840s or so where there are thousands of different kinds of paper money there was no central bank there weren t even any national banks there were lots of little banks given charters by their states by the states they were in in a lot of states any bank that followed a few rules could print its own paper money and if you can print paper money why wouldn t you and so there was this incredible proliferation of paper money the idea was you could bring your paper dollars to the bank that issued them and redeem them for gold or silver whenever you wanted but as you can imagine this creates a lot of problems problems for people who just want to buy or sell stuff like if you re a merchant and somebody walks into your store with a dollar bill from a bank you ve never heard of how do you even know it s real how do you know that the bank is legit how do you know that the bank is sound maybe it is a real bank but they re going to go bankrupt and you ll bring your piece of paper in and they won t be able to give you your gold or silver and so there arose to solve this problem these periodicals called banknote reporters that were like little newsletters basically little magazines that listed every bank in america and what their currency looked like what pictures it had on it and also a recommendation for whether to take the money at face value or whether to apply a discount rate if the bank is unsound you might say yeah i ll take your 5 bill but i ll only give you 4 50 credit for it and this persisted for decades kind of amazingly lauren

by michael s derby new york reuters federal reserve governor michelle bowman said on wednesday that if high inflation does not start to wane she will continue to support aggressive rate rises aimed at taming price pressures inflation is much too high and i strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis bowman said in the text of a speech to be delivered before a gathering in new york city the policy maker said fed rate rises this year which have been very large relative to the pace of past rate rise campaigns had her full support what happens with inflation will determine what is next for the fed bowman said if we do not see signs that inflation is moving down my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table she said but if inflation starts to cool i believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate bowman said she also noted she does not see any rate cuts ahead for now to bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time bowman said the central banker said it was not yet clear how far the fed will need to increase the cost of short term credit and how long it will need to maintain a restrictive policy stance bowman spoke following the release earlier in the day of meeting minutes from the central bank s late september policy meeting then policy makers raised their overnight target rate by 0 75 percentage point lifting the federal funds target rate to between 3 and 3 25 they also penciled in more increases as they contend with the strongest levels of inflation seen in decades fed forecasts from the september gathering saw officials pencil in a 4 6 federal funds rate by next year fed officials have all been on board with the fed s inflation fight and the meeting minutes said many officials emphasized the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action fed officials are pressing forward with aggressive increases even as worries are mounting that their actions are driving up financial market stresses and are boosting the risk that something goes awry bowman also said in her remarks that while the fed has had success in the past giving guidance about the outlook for monetary policy the current period is uncertain enough to limit the power of that tool under current circumstances however the best we can do on the public communications front is first to continue to stress our unwavering resolve to do what is needed to restore price stability bowman said reporting by michael s derby editing by chris reese

for 1 000 iron coins at my shop and people start doing that and then when they want to buy something instead of going back to get the 1 000 coins from the shop they just give that claim check that iou to the person they re buying from and that piece of paper becomes money and everybody loves it it s a great idea the government sees that happening the government soon takes over the business of printing paper money and it comes into the world on how paper money transformed the chinese economy we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient it was a huge deal it was you know we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient there is no mechanical transport at this time so you have to carry around your vast quantities of iron coins whatever on a cart or something that s expensive it s impractical it s easy to get robbed now you can transport the same amount of purchasing power with a piece of paper it s a crazy breakthrough and as it happens this breakthrough comes at this moment in chinese history and helps to propel this moment in chinese history that is this real economic flowering there is more trade in part because of paper money and with more trade you can have more specialization so people can grow the food that grows best where they live and then trade it across distances you have urbanization you have cities of over a million people growing up at a moment when cities in europe are under 100 000 it s really this kind of like a proto industrial revolution you have technological advancements it s this incredible economic flowering that is driven in part but certainly not entirely by the advent of paper money on how in the early years of the u s there was no national currency but thousands of kinds of paper money there is this amazing moment in u s history that kind of peaks in the 1840s or so where there are thousands of different kinds of paper money there was no central bank there weren t even any national banks there were lots of little banks given charters by their states by the states they were in in a lot of states any bank that followed a few rules could print its own paper money and if you can print paper money why wouldn t you and so there was this incredible proliferation of paper money the idea was you could bring your paper dollars to the bank that issued them and redeem them for gold or silver whenever you wanted but as you can imagine this creates a lot of problems problems for people who just want to buy or sell stuff like if you re a merchant and somebody walks into your store with a dollar bill from a bank you ve never heard of how do you even know it s real how do you know that the bank is legit how do you know that the bank is sound maybe it is a real bank but they re going to go bankrupt and you ll bring your piece of paper in and they won t be able to give you your gold or silver and so there arose to solve this problem these periodicals called banknote reporters that were like little newsletters basically little magazines that listed every bank in america and what their currency looked like what pictures it had on it and also a recommendation for whether to take the money at face value or whether to apply a discount rate if the bank is unsound you might say yeah i ll take your 5 bill but i ll only give you 4 50 credit for it and this persisted for decades kind of amazingly lauren

the us economy s paradigm shift away from the era of low interest rates and free money is going to be painful according to billionaire investor and bridgewater associates founder ray dalio the federal reserve has a difficult task ahead of it bring down soaring inflation without triggering a severe and prolonged recession but the central bank may have its work cut out for it as it deals with what dalio calls a perfect storm of crises because of the size of the issues we are dealing with it s not something we are used to because of its magnitude dalio said in an interview with bloomberg wednesday at the greenwich economic forum in connecticut dalio who last week ceded control of his 150 billion investment firmsaid that the us is facing a triad of conflicting challenges a bad economic situation caused by rising debt levels and ridiculously stupid low interest rates political infighting between democrats and republicans and the economic consequences of the ukraine war traditionally those three things are the perfect storm they all affect each other dalio said conflicting crises to bring down inflation the federal reserve has resorted to an aggressive series of interest rate hikes five so far this year with more planned for 2023 it s a reversal from the extremely low interest rates the fed maintained throughout most of the pandemic which dalio called ridiculously stupid the fed s low interest rates during the pandemic and large government stimulus programs left behind lots of government debt creating a bubble in the us economy dalio said the central bank is now rapidly trying to shrink this bubble by putting the brakes on the economy but the process will inevitably cause pain to markets they ve produced this giant lurch forward and now they will raise interest rates to the point that there s enough economic pain and financial market pain to deal with that he said and while bringing down inflation fast is the fed s priority the central bank also has to contend with two conflicts one domestic and one international that threaten to strain the economy even more dalio said there are irreconcilable differences between the left and right wing political parties leading the us today and this has contributed to a huge wealth gap and socio economic crisis that the country hadn t seen since the early 20th century additionally the ukraine war threatens to place an even greater burden on the us economy as the fed navigates its way out of inflation the war has so far cost countries allied with nato including the us around 8 trillion dalio said with reconstruction costs likely to keep piling onto the us economy s tab it s not like we re going to stop spending so you have to achieve that financial balance in some kind of a way he added the ukraine war may have cost the global economy as much as 8 9 trillion so far according to an august study by the cd howe institute a nonpartisan economic think tank based in canada other studies have been more conservative with the oecd last month estimating that the war has only cost so far 2 8 trillionalthough the oecd report notes that the figure could be much higher as the conflict continues to slow down economic activity in developed nations dalio said that the fed will eventually be able to bring inflation to an annual rate of 4 to 5 down from the 8 3 recorded last month but this will require interest rates to keep rising interest rates could go as high as 4 5 up from 3 25 todayafter which the economy could not take an interest rate much higher than that dalio said
the federal reserve is currently engaged in a battle to bring down the nation s inflation rate which has beenrising steadily since 2021 journalist jacob goldstein says the fed s ultimate goal is to slow inflation by raising interest rates while also avoiding a recession it feels kind of scary right now frankly goldstein says raising interest rates is a blunt tool and they don t know exactly what the effects are going to be and so there is a very reasonable chance that what they are doing is going to cause a recession goldstein is an executive producer at the audio production company pushkin industries where he hosts the business and tech podcast what s your problem prior to that he spent 10 years as the co host of the npr program planet money his 2020 book money the true story of a made up thing traces the history and meaning of money including the role of the federal reserve in regulating the u s economy goldstein says the fed inadvertently fueled the great depression when it raised interest rates in 1931 following the stock market crash of 1929 they made it even harder for people to survive for businesses to survive for people to buy stuff and that pushed the economy into the complete collapse of the depression he says it is perhaps the worst error in the history of the federal reserve still given the choice between having the federal reserve regulate the flow of currency in the u s and delegating the task to congress goldstein sides with the fed in the long run it s reasonable to think we ll be better off with some amount of short term pain now that comes from raising interest rates he says the belief is that politicians who have to answer to voters in a month won t be able to make those trade offs of short term pain for long term gain and i think that s a reasonable belief i think i buy it interview highlights on the idea of money as a made up thing i came to thinking about money pretty late in my life i was an english major in college and a newspaper reporter and it wasn t really until i got to planet money right after the financial crisis that i really started studying money thinking about money i hadn t really thought about it but it seemed like water or something it just seemed like something that exists in the world and is subject to the laws of physics and what i learned what i realized as i started learning more about it studying it is that is not true at all money doesn t exist in the world until people invent it that is the fundamental idea of the made up thing and moreover people didn t just invent money once people we have kept reinventing money and reinventing money in different ways with different rules and all of those rules are really interesting and have interesting sort of social context and social consequences on the invention of paper money by the time paper money shows up coins have been around for well over 1 000 years paper money first shows up in china around 1000 a d and it shows up in a very particular place it shows up in sichuan province and in sichuan province they used iron coins for money in most of china they used bronze coins but in sichuan they used a lot of iron and this is the era when the value of a coin is based on the value of the metal it contains in europe they re using silver coins and gold coins which are obviously worth a lot bronze is worth a fair bit iron then as is now is not worth very much so you needed a lot of iron coins to buy anything you needed for example a pound and a half of iron coins to buy a pound of salt i think of it like if you had to go to the grocery

between new district lines and a lack of real opposition state rep christine conley d groton said it s been a different campaign as she seeks a fourth term in the 40th district house seat the only opponent on the ballot lauren gauthier is on the independent party line but is acting as a placeholder to help the independents maintain their party line she and conley squared off in the 2020 election with gauthier on both the republican and independent ticket lines conley won the election with 58 9 of the vote to secure her third term in office groton town councilor scott westervelt a republican had been on the ballot as a placeholder as well before dropping off at the end of september i would hope that my candidacy is leading towards a future for voters to have more options on the ballot gauthier said since new district lines were drawn in 2020 the 40th district now consists of the town of groton north of i 95 the northern part of the city of groton and the southern portion of new london with new london replacing ledyard in her district conley said she wants to work on securing funding for the new london community center to get it further along in the construction phase conley is excited at the idea of representing new london it s a wonderful challenge i believe because new london is the hub of our services she said pointing to the slew of social services and nonprofits in the city conley 40 lives in groton with her husband tim beebe and is an attorney at embry neusner arscott shafner llc she is a connecticut board certified workers compensation specialist and a member of the executive committee of the workers compensation section she received her law degree from western new england university school of law and her bachelor of science degree from bay

board for groton parks and recreation now a veteran legislator conley said she is looking forward to a fourth term in office as a freshman in her first term after the 2016 election conley said she would look to others for help now i m being sought out for help conley said she said the help from senior house members in her first term allowed her to be more independent in her second term when she helped codify pre existing health conditions and maternity care in connecticut state law as part of the 10 essential health benefits in the affordable care act her third term was marred by the global pandemic conley recalled how representatives had to put lawmaking on the back burner while they answered phone calls from residents who needed help with social services and held zoom meetings to explain executive orders from the governor s office once vaccines were available she said things slowly returned to normal and representatives were able to focus on mental healthcare issues and the following year s budget she said she s been campaigning door to door as she continues to work on healthcare voting rights reproductive health and community funding issues gauthier said she had a lot of life changes such as the birth of a son and a career change that did not allow her to dedicate the time necessary to run a campaign gauthier explained that by keeping her name on the ballot the independent party could qualify for funding from the state election enforcement commission seec if she receives a large enough percentage of the vote she said that the citizen s election program guidelines call for candidates to raise 5 800 from 250 people in the district third party candidates have to do that plus get 20 of registered voters to sign a petition in order to receive full grant funding if gauthier receives 15 of the vote she said an independent party candidate in 2024 will not have to petition affordable housing conley said the affordable housing issue is not new and is something she s seen for years she said the groton new london area is blessed with growing companies that bring employees and their families to the area but they need somewhere to live we do have the affordable housing necessary where we re not facing any state penalties conley said but we still need more housing that s affordable for families she said residents may not be able to afford rent or a down payment on a home while also paying for child care utility bills and student loans as a member of the planning and development committee for the last six years conley said they put bills through every year to help with zoning regulations and housing stock abortion as a member of the judiciary committee conley helped write house bill 5414 and said she supports all efforts to make connecticut a safe haven for women seeking abortions she was so saddened when her own obgyn told her that women were already traveling from out of state to his office for care we need to make our laws very strong because it s most important that women have good healthcare conley said state surplus when it comes to the more than 4 billion surplus in connecticut conley said the extra rainy day funds have to go toward pensions and said the pension problem has been ongoing for the last 70 years conley voted on the budget in 2017 that created the volatility cap which requires the state take excess revenue from categories deemed volatile and put them aside in the budget reserve fund or what is known as the rainy day fund as of sept 21 2 8 billion are available to pay down pension debt climate change conley showed her support for clean energy alternatives when she voted for the clean air act earlier this year which invests funds into water and wind energies conley explained the cleaner energy alternatives are costly compared to oil and gas which is why she said we need to invest in the growing technologies she said the same problems with electric vehicles have persisted in her six years on the transportation committee while state residents can purchase electric cars manufacturers want special provisions in the law which has prevented the electric car bill from moving forward she said safety standards need to be the same across the board and is hopeful the bill will be ready for next year 2020 election and voting conley said that joe biden won the 2020 election she said she was

said on the nation s polarization conley said she supports early voting and will vote yes for it again this fall she s a proponent of absentee ballots as well and said we should encourage more people to vote short term rentals the region and groton specifically has faced issues with short term rentals as groton works on potential regulations to remedy the problem conley said it would not be right for the legislature to intervene and set standards for the entire state as some coastal communities already have regulations in place that work well k arnold theday com

s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

the federal reserve is currently engaged in a battle to bring down the nation s inflation rate which has beenrising steadily since 2021 journalist jacob goldstein says the fed s ultimate goal is to slow inflation by raising interest rates while also avoiding a recession it feels kind of scary right now frankly goldstein says raising interest rates is a blunt tool and they don t know exactly what the effects are going to be and so there is a very reasonable chance that what they are doing is going to cause a recession goldstein is an executive producer at the audio production company pushkin industries where he hosts the business and tech podcast what s your problem prior to that he spent 10 years as the co host of the npr program planet money his 2020 book money the true story of a made up thing traces the history and meaning of money including the role of the federal reserve in regulating the u s economy goldstein says the fed inadvertently fueled the great depression when it raised interest rates in 1931 following the stock market crash of 1929 they made it even harder for people to survive for businesses to survive for people to buy stuff and that pushed the economy into the complete collapse of the depression he says it is perhaps the worst error in the history of the federal reserve still given the choice between having the federal reserve regulate the flow of currency in the u s and delegating the task to congress goldstein sides with the fed in the long run it s reasonable to think we ll be better off with some amount of short term pain now that comes from raising interest rates he says the belief is that politicians who have to answer to voters in a month won t be able to make those trade offs of short term pain for long term gain and i think that s a reasonable belief i think i buy it interview highlights on the idea of money as a made up thing i came to thinking about money pretty late in my life i was an english major in college and a newspaper reporter and it wasn t really until i got to planet money right after the financial crisis that i really started studying money thinking about money i hadn t really thought about it but it seemed like water or something it just seemed like something that exists in the world and is subject to the laws of physics and what i learned what i realized as i started learning more about it studying it is that is not true at all money doesn t exist in the world until people invent it that is the fundamental idea of the made up thing and moreover people didn t just invent money once people we have kept reinventing money and reinventing money in different ways with different rules and all of those rules are really interesting and have interesting sort of social context and social consequences on the invention of paper money by the time paper money shows up coins have been around for well over 1 000 years paper money first shows up in china around 1000 a d and it shows up in a very particular place it shows up in sichuan province and in sichuan province they used iron coins for money in most of china they used bronze coins but in sichuan they used a lot of iron and this is the era when the value of a coin is based on the value of the metal it contains in europe they re using silver coins and gold coins which are obviously worth a lot bronze is worth a fair bit iron then as is now is not worth very much so you needed a lot of iron coins to buy anything you needed for example a pound and a half of iron coins to buy a pound of salt i think of it like if you had to go to the grocery store and you could only use pennies it s just a terrible thing to use for money so some merchant in sichuan has this idea where he tells his customers look it s terrible having to carry around all these iron coins i ll tell you what let s do you leave a bunch of your iron coins with me leave say 1 000 iron coins with me and i ll write you a receipt like a claim check this piece of paper is good for 1 000 iron coins at my shop and people start doing that and then when they want to buy something instead of going back to get the 1 000 coins from the shop they just give that claim check that iou to the person they re buying from and that piece of paper becomes money and everybody loves it it s a great idea the government sees that happening the government soon takes over the business of printing paper money and it comes into the world on how paper money transformed the chinese economy we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient it was a huge deal it was you know we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient there is no mechanical transport at this time so you have to carry around your vast quantities of iron coins whatever on a cart or something that s expensive it s impractical it s easy to get robbed now you can transport the same amount of purchasing power with a piece of paper it s a crazy breakthrough and as it happens this breakthrough comes at this moment in chinese history and helps to propel this moment in chinese history that is this real economic flowering there is more trade in part because of paper money and with more trade you can have more specialization so people can grow the food that grows best where they live and then trade it across distances you have urbanization you have cities of over a million people growing up at a moment when cities in europe are under 100 000 it s really this kind of like a proto industrial revolution you have technological advancements it s this incredible economic flowering that is driven in part but certainly not entirely by the advent of paper money on how in the early years of the u s there was no national currency but thousands of kinds of paper money there is this amazing moment in u s history that kind of peaks in the 1840s or so where there are thousands of different kinds of paper money there was no central bank there weren t even any national banks there were lots of little banks given charters by their states by the states they were in in a lot of states any bank that followed a few rules could print its own paper money and if you can print paper money why wouldn t you and so there was this incredible proliferation of paper money the idea was you could bring your paper dollars to the bank that issued them and redeem them for gold or silver whenever you wanted but as you can imagine this creates a lot of problems problems for people who just want to buy or sell stuff like if you re a merchant and somebody walks into your store with a dollar bill from a bank you ve never heard of how do you even know it s real how do you know that the bank is legit how do you know that the bank is sound maybe it is a real bank but they re going to go bankrupt and you ll bring your piece of paper in and they won t be able to give you your gold or silver and so there arose to solve this problem these periodicals called banknote reporters that were like little newsletters basically little magazines that listed every bank in america and what their currency looked like what pictures it had on it and also a recommendation for whether to take the money at face value or whether to apply a discount rate if the bank is unsound you might say yeah i ll take your 5 bill but i ll only give you 4 50 credit for it and this persisted for decades kind of amazingly lauren

antonio tx us philbrick ashley raine san antonio tx us rapport garrett rielly san antonio tx us romero jr jose l san antonio tx us szentes michael jay san antonio tx us this patent was filed on september 23 2019 and was published online on september 20 2022 from the background information supplied by the inventors news correspondents obtained the following quote the present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for issuing and validating virtual teller checks this section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present disclosure which are described below this discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure accordingly it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light and not as admissions of prior art checks typically provide a safe and convenient method for an individual such as a payor to transfer funds to a payee to use a check the individual usually opens a checking account or other similar account at a financial institution and deposits funds which are then available for later withdrawal to transfer funds with a check the payor usually designates a payee and an amount payable on the check in addition the payor often signs the check once the check has been signed it is usually deemed negotiable meaning the check may be validly transferred to the payee upon delivery by signing and transferring the check to the payee the payor authorizes funds to be withdrawn from the payor s account on behalf of the payee certain types of checks such as teller checks i e cashier s checks are backed by the issuing bank accordingly they may be preferred for transactions in which the payor payee wish to have additional levels of protection supplementing the background information on this patent newsrx reporters also obtained the inventors summary information for this patent one or more specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below in an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification it should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation as in any engineering or design project numerous implementation specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers specific goals such as compliance with system related and business related constraints which may vary from one implementation to another moreover it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design fabrication and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure various embodiments of the present invention generally relate to systems and methods for generating a check i e a cashier s check a teller check and or an image of a check more specifically some embodiments of the present invention generate a teller check that includes a pattern or picture generated as part of the teller check and that functions to validate the check teller checks or cashier s check are notes guaranteed by a bank and may be used in transactions in which the payor and the payee do not have an established payment relationship e g security deposits insurance or legal settlements because teller checks are guaranteed by the issuing bank it may be desirable to generate teller checks that include enhanced security features that discourage counterfeiting while certain types of security features such as specialized check paper stock may be available for physical teller checks such features cannot be used for virtual teller checks as well provided herein is a teller check system with enhanced security features that may be used in conjunction with virtual and or physical teller checks the enhanced security features may include a visible pattern or picture on the teller check that is rendered in a manner such that the pattern or picture may be extracted from an image of the teller check in certain embodiments a physical teller check or a virtual teller check may be provided that is in certain embodiments the teller check is not printed and is provided electronically through all stages of the issuing to verification and funds distribution process the pattern or picture may be relatively difficult to duplicate such that verification that a correct pattern or picture is on the teller check serves at the enhanced security feature in one embodiment the pattern or picture is generated based on a function that uses user data or check data as an input in one embodiment the pattern may seem random e g random dots or swirls but may be generated based on a seed by a random seed generator that is the pattern may be recreated only if the initial seed is known the initial seed functions as a key to the pattern and may be linked to the check issuing institution or user e g an account holder the pattern or picture may be unique and issued on demand in response to a request such that each teller check is associated with only one unique pattern or picture in one embodiment the unique pattern or picture encodes certain check information that may

seeking to remove and replace two of your highly qualified directors we have engaged with land buildings to better understand its perspectives and have reviewed the qualifications of the candidates it has put forth it is clear from our interactions to date however that land buildings is primarily focused on historical issues and decisions made prior to the reconstitution of the aimco board and the replacement of the aimco management team while the new aimco board and management are open to continued dialogue with land buildings we believe that additional director turnover at this time is unwarranted we also believe that the candidates proposed by land buildings would not bring any relevant expertise that is not already well represented on the aimco board and that election of land buildings candidates would remove expertise from the new aimco board that is critical to our success against this backdrop you now face an important decision regarding the future of your investment

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more

completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

rises this year which have been very large relative to the pace of past rate rise campaigns had her full support what happens with inflation will determine what is next for the fed bowman said if we do not see signs that inflation is moving down my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table she said but if inflation starts to cool i believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate bowman said she also noted she does not see any rate cuts ahead for now to bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time bowman said the central banker said it was not yet clear how far the fed will need to increase the cost of short term credit and how long it will need to maintain a restrictive policy stance bowman spoke following the release earlier in the day of meeting minutes from the central bank s late september policy meeting then policy makers raised their overnight target rate by 0 75 percentage point lifting the federal funds target rate to between 3 and 3 25 they also penciled in more increases as they contend with the strongest levels of inflation seen in decades advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content fed forecasts from the september gathering saw officials pencil in a 4 6 federal funds rate by next year fed officials have all been on board with the fed s inflation fight and the meeting minutes said many officials emphasized the cost of taking too little action to bring down inflation likely outweighed the cost of taking too much action fed officials are pressing forward with aggressive increases even as worries are mounting that their actions are driving up financial market stresses and are boosting the risk that something goes awry bowman also said in her remarks that while the fed has had success in the past giving guidance about the outlook for monetary policy the current period is uncertain enough to limit the power of that tool under current circumstances however the best we can do on the public communications front is first to continue to stress our unwavering resolve to do what is needed to restore price stability bowman said reporting by michael s derby editing by chris reese

support us gearjunkie may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article learn more this has already been a big year for launches from wolf tooth components but it seems the brand has saved the best for last looking at its vast product catalog now it s hard to believe it started with a single chainring not long ago from that chainring it evolved to offer everything from bottle cages to complete bikes under the otso brand this article was originally published on bikerumor and now well now you can add a dropper post to that list too it s not just another dropper post it s obsessively engineered and will stand out against a sea of existing dropper posts wolf tooth components first dropper post play dropper posts are one of those true game changers in mountain biking an overused but accurate phrase when utilized properly they can change the way you ride but they can also be annoying maintenance hogs depending on the model for its resolve dropper post wolf tooth components created a post that would never need manual bleeding or an expensive replacement cartridge instead of relying on an internal floating piston ifp which can allow air to slip by the seal and mix with the oil causing it to become squishy the resolve uses a proprietary needle and piston cartridge design that self bleeds the actuation of the dropper post routinely performs this self bleeding procedure keeping the post from going squishy in the long run technically the wolf tooth components resolve dropper can become squishy in extreme cases more on that in the review but the fix is to simply compress the post wait 20 30 seconds and extend the post do that a few times and it s back to normal while the resolve technology is undoubtedly one reason to choose the wolf tooth components dropper over others it s not the only reason claiming the shortest stack height on the market at 32 mm the distance from the bottom of the post collar to the saddle rail clamp when compressed the resolve will allow many riders to run longer travel droppers the resolve posts also have a short insertion length meaning they ll work better with frames with curved seat tubes or internal obstructions that cause longer dropper posts to bottom out dropper post sizes dimensions combined with three different stock dropper travel lengths and the ability to customize the travel of each post in 5mm increments they can maximize the travel for your frame and seat post height the resolve will come in 125mm 160mm and 200mm travel posts with minimum insertion depths of 90 mm 100 mm and 140 mm respectively as mentioned the rider can reduce the travel by 5mm increments wolf tooth components tells us that installing these spacers is pretty straightforward but you can order your seat post with the preferred spacer configuration preinstalled up to 10 spacers which would reduce travel by 50 mm not sure what travel you can safely use on your bike wtc has a handy dropper post calculator to make the process easier custom saddle clamp a big part of getting the stack height so low was the creation of a custom saddle clamp the actual saddle rail clamp plates are so low profile that the air cap protrudes through the top that cap also had to be designed to be shallow profile to clear the bottom of your saddle the two bolt design offers a 23 degree saddle angle adjustment range and is compatible with round or oval saddle rails due to the design of the clamp you will have to completely remove the top plate to fit the saddle initially you can t just loosen the bolts and slip the saddle in as with some posts cable actuated remote naturally the resolve is a cable actuated dropper post to take advantage of wolf tooth s excellent remote dropper lever meant for use with its remote light action lever integrations are available for numerous brake levers from shimano sram magura and hope the cabling is very easy to run with the cable head sitting in a cradle at the bottom of the post and the end of the cable clamped at the lever actual weight wolf tooth components claims that when it comes to grams per mm of travel the resolve is one of the lightest droppers on the market saying it s up to 26 lighter than other droppers of the same travel and size claimed weights are listed as 125 x 30 9 440g 125 x 31 6 456g 160 x 30 9 490g 160 x 31 6 513g 200 x 30 9 544g and 200 x 31 6 563g on our scale the 160 x 31 6mm model came in at 512 g or 1 g less than claimed other details wolf tooth components has made a big push recently with designing its products with right to repair in mind that means you ll be able to find all the replacement parts to fix your post should you have an issue rather than replace it that includes the air filter yes the air filter while the air cartridge is fully sealed the bottom of the post can t be sealed for it to work correctly to prevent it from pulling dust from inside the frame into the post the resolve has a patent pending external air filter wolf tooth components mentions that it decided to make the filter externally accessible for easy replacement additional details include claims that the post will continue to work in cold weather we re inclined to believe the brand as it s in minnesota you can also apparently swap diameters meaning you can make an existing 30 9mm post into a 31 6mm diameter post and vice versa wolf tooth components dropper post pricing availability with all of the features and engineering that went into the resolve it s somewhat surprising to see it priced at 350 granted that s without the dropper lever but still it s pretty impressive that pricing is a big part of why this post is designed and assembled in the usa but the parts are manufactured in taiwan initially wolf tooth components told us that it wanted to manufacture everything in house but the resulting price would be too high to be competitive however it s quick to point out that the posts are still designed here assembled here and shipped from here it s available in 30 9 or 31 6 diameters and 125mm 160mm and 200mm stock lengths and wolf tooth components can install additional travel spacers for no charge with the initial purchase extras include remote light action levers which start at 70 and even a titanium hardware upgrade kit in black gold or oil slick for 13 resolve dropper posts are available now
u s producer prices increased more than expected in september but underlying goods prices were unchanged for the first time in nearly 2 1 2 years offering some hope in the battle against inflation despite the mixed report from the labor department on wednesday inflation remains stubbornly high likely compelling the federal reserve to raise interest rates by 75 basis points next month for the fourth time this year inflation is all about pass through costs at the lower level of production so this report counts as some relief for beleaguered consumers who face runaway inflation on the goods sitting on store shelves said christopher rupkey chief economist at fwdbonds in new york the fed s war on inflation hasn t been won yet but at least the costs of goods at the producer level have stopped rising at a rate that looked out of control earlier this year the producer price index for final demand rebounded 0 4 last month data for august was revised lower to show the ppi falling 0 2 instead of dipping 0 1 as previously reported economists polled by reuters had forecast the ppi rising 0 2 a 0 4 rise in the price of services accounted for two thirds of the increase in the ppi in september services climbed 0 3 in august more than a quarter of the rise in september was driven by a 6 4 surge in hotel and motel accommodation prices there were also increases in the costs of food and alcohol retailing portfolio management machinery and vehicle wholesaling oil and gas well drilling services as well as hospital inpatient care but prices for long distance motor carrying fell as did fuels and lubricants retailing and consumer loans goods prices increased 0 4 after declining 1 1 in august a 1 2 jump in the price of food accounted for 60 of the increase in goods food prices were boosted by a 15 7 surge in the cost of fresh and dry vegetables there were also increases in the prices for chicken eggs and pork energy prices rose 0 7 driven by diesel fuel residential natural gas and home heating oil excluding food and energy goods prices were unchanged this was the weakest reading for the so called core goods since may 2020 u s stocks opened higher the dollar rose against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices were mixed supply chains easing in the 12 months through september the ppi increased 8 5 after advancing 8 7 in august the moderation in annual producer inflation is being driven by an easing in supply chain bottlenecks as well as a retreat in commodity prices from the highs seen in the spring but oil and gasoline prices have likely bottomed following last week s decision by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies to cut crude production data on thursday is likely to show consumer prices picking up in september according to a reuters survey of economists financial markets have almost priced in a rate hike of three quarters of a percentage point at the fed s nov 1 2 policy meeting according to cme s fedwatch tool the fed has since march raised its policy rate from near zero to the current range of 3 00 to 3 25 excluding the volatile food energy and trade services components producer prices also rose 0 4 in september the core ppi increased 0 2 in august in the 12 months through september the core ppi rose 5 6 after a similar gain in august source reuters
congressional contender amanda adkins is trailing in most polls more importantly this is likely the last chance for adkins to make a credible challenge against the incumbent if she doesn t win this time around the donors and republican supporters probably won t be there for her next time accordingly we notice the kansas leader getting very aggressive in her statements to the media here is her latest amanda adkins davids continues divisive dishonest campaign tactics overland park kan amanda adkins republican candidate for kansas third congressional district released a statement on sharice davids continued divisive and dishonest campaign tactics after a video was published late last week showing davids trying to dodge a question about her negative ads speaking in miami county davids attempted to answer a question about her ads you mentioned the ads so i ll like i ll i ll touch on that you know we ve got we i i try to keep my i don t want to be part of divisiveness and like negative just like negativity in general my opponent is out of step with uh not just the third district but on some issues with the entire state unfortunately davids ads are nothing but divisive and negative for months davids has been running ads that claim amanda adkins supports a nationwide abortion ban despite adkins being on the record more than a dozen times opposing such measures before the supreme court decision was even finalized adkins stated in an interview that she would not be in support of a congressional ban on abortion and in an august op ed published in the kansas city star adkins states outright i don t support a federal ban on abortion nor do i support any other federal policymaking related to contraception or fertility in one of davids ads a doctor states when i hear amanda adkins say that she absolutely supports banning all abortions with no exceptions a nationwide abortion ban would put the lives of women at risk adkins has made it very clear that she will not protect the women of kansas in another davids ad a narrator says she was 100 for allowing politicians now amanda adkins absolutely suports a total ban on all abortions nationwide with no exceptions for rape incest or life of the mother for a ban with no exceptions amanda adkins is 100 wrong for kansas davids is clearly lying to voters davids has also lied repeatedly in several ads about adkins role in the tax and education cuts implemented during the brownback administration one states when brownback passed tax giveaways to giant corporations and made disastrous cuts to kansas schools to pay for them adkins was with him every step of the way another continues that adkins was responsible for helping him pass his failed tax experiment leaving kansans with nearly one billion dollars in deficits our schools decimated and our teachers without jobs while handing out huge tax giveaways to corporations adkins had no role in drafting or implementing kansas fiscal policies no control of the budget and she was not in the state legislature instead she worked at cerner for the entirety of his tenure as governor and has never taken a paycheck from the state of kansas kansans deserve the truth and expect their candidates to run an honest campaign adkins said i am doing both but sharice davids has done neither instead she is lying to distract from the fact that she is the candidate who is out of step with kansans she votes with joe biden and nancy pelosi one hundred percent of the time and their policies are directly responsible for policies that have resulted in economic disaster including record levels of inflation rising prices interest rate increases and a plummeting stock market sharice davids would rather reinforce lies divisiveness and negativity with millions of dollars than help kansas families who are suffering we deserve better today s blast that also deserves attention kmbc finds davids ad inaccurate overland park kan kmbc s micheal mahoney called out sharice davids for continuously running inaccurate ads about amanda adkins record on abortion davids has peddled the lie that adkins supports a federal ban on abortion in numerous mail pieces and ads despite the fact that adkins is on the record opposing a federal ban on abortion over a dozen times since the overturning of roe v wade kansas democratic incumbent congresswoman sharice davids has a new commercial out saying her gop opponent amanda adkins wants a nationwide ban on abortion kmbc 9 s micheal mahoney checks the accuracy of that claim in the kansas third district congressional race kmbc

debate the real issues that kansans face every day adkins responded sharice davids has profoundly claimed in the past that she only runs truth ads not negative ads and dodged a question last week about her deceptive commercials by stating she doesn t want to be part of divisiveness and negativity unfortunately davids has changed since she went to washington and began voting with nancy pelosi 100 of the time davids 2022 campaign strategy is to lie her way out of accountability for the bad economic policies she supported which have led to skyrocketing inflation kansans deserve better the

completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

at least some people got pretty rich from amc s two year stock roller coaster but it wasn t the company s super loyal buy and hold investors known as the apes a fox business analysis shows that company insiders such as hedge funds private equity firms as well as board members top executives and other big investors in the world s largest movie theater chain sold a staggering 883 5 million in

ceo adam aron who courted the apes in social media posts and even private meetings earned 43 million from his insider sales at prices well above the current single digit value of amc stock shares of amc have fallen nearly 90 from their highs of a year ago adam aron the amc executives and the board ran an enrichment scheme at the expense of individual investors who actually saved the company said former hedge fund trader marc cohodes a frequent critic of amc management still betting on a short squeeze even as the stock has fallen well below its highs some of the apes are still vowing in social media posts to hold on to their stock betting it will spark a so called short squeeze that could send shares to 1 000 in a short sale an investor profits by borrowing shares selling them immediately and replacing the borrow when the stock declines a squeeze occurs when investors band together and refuse to lend or sell shares sending the stock significantly higher and leading to massive losses for the shorts that is what occurred with amc and other meme stocks in early 2021 when they soared in value leading to widespread losses among some big investors yet aside from that brief period of euphoria in which one fund melvin capital was forced to liquidate the touted squeeze to 1 000 never materialized shares of amc did climb to just above 72 intraday june 2 2021 except for some spikes in

no comment aron also declined comment diluting retail while avoiding bankruptcy insiders selling their stock is not illegal of course in fact it is quite common in corporate america where executives often cite estate planning for the sales executive compensation plans include significant amounts of stock option awards to senior management to align their interests with the interests of shareholders securities regulators mandate disclosure of these insider sales to help alert the investing public of how management may view the company s business prospects during much of the period of insider selling amc s financials improved somewhat particularly after several blockbuster theatrical releases such as top gun maverick which broke box office records earlier this year generating 1 4 billion in worldwide ticket sales after 14 weeks but amc faced existential issues even before the shutdown headwinds include the rise of streaming which continues to depress ticket sales and a significant debt load used to finance past expansion amc continues to lose money albeit at a slower clip and its box office revenues remain below pre pandemic levels the tough operating environment recently forced one of its competitors cineworld to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization aron has said that amc will avoid a similar fate based on past recapitalization plans and a more recent one where he created a new preferred stock known as the ape a homage to his loyal retail investor base surviving bankruptcy will come at a cost for retail holders who comprise 90 of all amc s investors the creation of the ape is the equivalent of a stock split and it sets the stage for the significant sale of stock and dilution of shares in the weeks to come in sec filings and repeated in media reports amc has warned investors that its shares are over valued based on standard metrics and to be prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment then in late september when amc announced plans to sell as much as 425 million new ape shares aron described the move as good dilution to help amc avoid a fate similar to cineworld but his comments were widely criticized by analysts because such a term doesn t exist and dilution almost always leads to investor losses because it increases share counts even if it aids in a company s survival because the ape is a preferred stock and not common shares the dilution doesn t need shareholder approval unlike prior attempts that investors voted down the situation retail investors find themselves in now

why nmotion gives founders without a startup 100k and tells them to forget their assumptions startland news startup road trip series explores innovative and uncommon ideas finding success in rural america and midwestern startup hubs outside the kansas city metro this series is possible thanks to the ewing marion kauffman foundation which leads a collaborative nationwide effort to identify and remove large and small barriers to new business creation lincoln nebraska on a break from stanford university bumper founder luke moberly is back in the cornhusker state meeting with investors attending local startup events and buoyed by about 7 000 app users and a half million dollars in funding his startup an investing app for teens is one of nmotion venture studio s early proof points the first company from one of the lincoln based program s cohorts to earn significant investment after completion and for bumper it took only nine months from idea to funding most accelerators you have to go in with a startup idea and they help accelerate you moberly said contrasting his experience with nmotion s 2021 venture studio which saw his plan for a horseback riding app evolve into the bumper investment tool but what s unique about nmotion is that it s more of an incubator i d say where you re coming up with all these different ideas and they select founders i was eventually able to land on something that had potential and that i enjoyed working on he continued but had i gone in with my initial idea which was an equestrian performance analysis tool for horseback riders i don t think it would have done very well and so they really push you to test a bunch of different ideas that process alone was worth its weight in gold click here to read more about bumper s origins its 500 000 pre seed round and what helped prompt the pivot to teen investments the concept behind nmotion venture studio dovetails with moberly s experience said scott henderson managing principal and studio lead for nmotion it s about building a startup from scratch a problem you have is that the founders have already kind of built their assumptions he explained they ve baked the cake and committed to a market they ve got technology and a lot of sunk costs into it which then blinds them to see the real opportunities instead the venture studio part of nmotion powered by gener8tor starts by laying the groundwork for founders to explore entirely new concepts during the 16 week program we re based on this thesis of category creation which means look in the world and see where there are problems that people have overlooked or haven t assembled those problems into a clear distinct shared problem henderson said really define the problem and define who s in that market then go build a company that will be the first one to solve the shared problem and be the best one that solves it so that you can become the category monarch each founder in the nmotion venture studio receives 100 000 in investment capital he said half of the funds are raised by investors and half is matched by a state created evergreen fund called invest nebraska henderson noted that three of motion s key funders invest nebraska nebraska angels and nelnet are also the state s three largest industry agnostic early stage investors it requires a lot more hands on intensive work and you re betting on a person not a company so there s a much higher risk to it henderson said nmotion closed applications for its third venture studio cohort in september the program will run oct 20 to feb 23 for six selected founders the output of the nmotion venture studio isn t a fully formed product henderson said it s not a fully formed market it s not a fully formed company it truly does look like just a cocktail napkin drawing of a concept founder focused programming founders selected for the nmotion venture studio cohort face a rigorous first four weeks of the 16 week program said henderson noting one on one coaching sessions group workshops and a quality control session where they pitch their ideas to the gener8tor staff and stakeholders to get feedback we re really pressure testing it pushing back on it asking questions he said the founders have to do that four weeks in a row and then we step back they re learning each week how to conceive a category creating idea better but it s not the same idea explored differently it s a whole different market opportunity each week once they decide which idea to pursue founders spend the next eight weeks building traction we do a lot of technology experiments and customer experiments henderson said we re just testing stuff out to see if it would work then we put a narrative together and help craft their pitch decks and an executive summary together with them the building phase is also all about networking he noted with one on one mentor swarms speed mentoring sessions roundtable discussions locally and nationally and community events they re meeting a lot of people to really increase their surface area of luck henderson said we never know who s in that person s rolodex or what knowledge or experience they had in their career that will help be of help to you we re just trying to find that one thing that they have that will help you break through or make that incremental step forward in the last four weeks of the venture studio founders pitch their ideas to 50 or more early stage investors the program works to challenge founder assumptions as early as possible to help them avoid wasting time and energy henderson said we re putting in as much upfront as possible to pressure test their assumptions pressure test the market he continued so they at least know do others who are in this business think there s actually a path to a path to success there are a lot of other potholes mine fields booby traps sideswipes and crosstown buses that are going to come but at least they ll know early on that they haven t gotten so enamored with their solution that they forgot to ask is there a problem and is there somebody who wants to pay for that solution and is that the right solution nmotion in motion nmotion began about nine years ago in lincoln nebraska led by brian ardinger as a traditional 12 week program investment accelerator after six cohorts and the launch of companies like quantifiedag that sold to merck animal health sciences liveby that sold for 15 million nobl health and realmfive nmotion decided to pivot from investment to programming about three years ago madison wisconsin based gener8tor took over the day to day operations of nmotion ultimately gener8tor moved back toward the equity investment and venture studio models after looking at its existing portfolio and identifying its companies needs gener8tor said well what if we go further upstream said henderson the first nmotion venture studio cohort debuted in december 2020 founders in the venture studio concept receive 80 percent common stock equity 60 percent founder stock vested over four years and 20 percent key employee option pool what s different about the model is that we actually create the delaware c corporations before we select the founders henderson explained once we select the founders they become co founders in them and earn 80 percent of the equity over a four year period they become the ceo and the primary active founder responsible for allocation of the budget and daily operations monetization moves nmotion venture studio has to date launched 10 startups three are women led three are black led and two are hispanic led according to henderson seven of those 10 have raised follow on funding for a collective total of 1 9 million of those six four bumper snappy workflow ensemble and forsure fit have received a non dilutive prototype grant from the state with the highest award of the four being 89 000 right now we re focused on monetization moberly said of bumper s top priority we ve been able to grow for the most part organically pretty well i think right now it s like 25 to 30 percent month over month almost all organically so that s been great we ve seen that teens and parents are really interested in this idea of teen investing the startup is also working with a beta group for paid services he said what we re focused on is implementing different subscription tiers to try to figure out business models moberly added even though he s finished with the program now he said nmotion s support has been ongoing i can text scott whenever and he s available to hop on a 15 to 20 minute zoom call moberly said especially in the nebraska ecosystem there s just so much continuous support after you raise a round and after you go through the program whenever i have a large issue that we re facing there s always someone i can talk to and riff on great trees never grow alone nebraska s business community understands the importance of boosting entrepreneurs said henderson noting that backing has been crucial for nmotion to succeed and continue support of startups like bumper just like kansas city for the last 15 years we ve seen a lot more technology startup investments and we re starting to see exits he said and those founders understand the best thing they can do with a good chunk of their money they got from their exit is to reinvest it in the next wave business and economic development leaders who support nmotion know the best hope for growing the economy is investing in their own people henderson continued these leaders understand if they can help encourage high growth and aspirational transformative entrepreneurs and help them succeed it s just going to make their own businesses stronger because they re gonna get more customers and they re gonna get better talent to hire eventually he said it boils down to the fact that great trees never grow alone henderson said if you want more vibrant forests here on the plains you have to make sure that the forest is taking care of itself and making sure that it s not just a single tree but the entire forest that can grow he added this story is possible thanks to support from the ewing marion kauffman foundation a private nonpartisan foundation that works together with communities in education and entrepreneurship to create uncommon solutions and empower people to shape their futures and be

the federal reserve is currently engaged in a battle to bring down the nation s inflation rate which has beenrising steadily since 2021 journalist jacob goldstein says the fed s ultimate goal is to slow inflation by raising interest rates while also avoiding a recession it feels kind of scary right now frankly goldstein says raising interest rates is a blunt tool and they don t know exactly what the effects are going to be and so there is a very reasonable chance that what they are doing is going to cause a recession goldstein is an executive producer at the audio production company pushkin industries where he hosts the business and tech podcast what s your problem prior to that he spent 10 years as the co host of the npr program planet money his 2020 book money the true story of a made up thing traces the history and meaning of money including the role of the federal reserve in regulating the u s economy goldstein says the fed inadvertently fueled the great depression when it raised interest rates in 1931 following the stock market crash of 1929 they made it even harder for people to survive for businesses to survive for people to buy stuff and that pushed the economy into the complete collapse of the depression he says it is perhaps the worst error in the history of the federal reserve still given the choice between having the federal reserve regulate the flow of currency in the u s and delegating the task to congress goldstein sides with the fed in the long run it s reasonable to think we ll be better off with some amount of short term pain now that comes from raising interest rates he says the belief is that politicians who have to answer to voters in a month won t be able to make those trade offs of short term pain for long term gain and i think that s a reasonable belief i think i buy it interview highlights on the idea of money as a made up thing i came to thinking about money pretty late in my life i was an english major in college and a newspaper reporter and it wasn t really until i got to planet money right after the financial crisis that i really started studying money thinking about money i hadn t really thought about it but it seemed like water or something it just seemed like something that exists in the world and is subject to the laws of physics and what i learned what i realized as i started learning more about it studying it is that is not true at all money doesn t exist in the world until people invent it that is the fundamental idea of the made up thing and moreover people didn t just invent money once people we have kept reinventing money and reinventing money in different ways with different rules and all of those rules are really interesting and have interesting sort of social context and social consequences on the invention of paper money by the time paper money shows up coins have been around for well over 1 000 years paper money first shows up in china around 1000 a d and it shows up in a very particular place it shows up in sichuan province and in sichuan province they used iron coins for money in most of china they used bronze coins but in sichuan they used a lot of iron and this is the era when the value of a coin is based on the value of the metal it contains in europe they re using silver coins and gold coins which are obviously worth a lot bronze is worth a fair bit iron then as is now is not worth very much so you needed a lot of iron coins to buy anything you needed for example a pound and a half of iron coins to buy a pound of salt i think of it like if you had to go to the grocery store and you could only use pennies it s just a terrible thing to use for money so some merchant in sichuan has this idea where he tells his customers look it s terrible having to carry around all these iron coins i ll tell you what let s do you leave a bunch of your iron coins with me leave say 1 000 iron coins with me and i ll write you a receipt like a claim check this piece of paper is good for 1 000 iron coins at my shop and people start doing that and then when they want to buy something instead of going back to get the 1 000 coins from the shop they just give that claim check that iou to the person they re buying from and that piece of paper becomes money and everybody loves it it s a great idea the government sees that happening the government soon takes over the business of printing paper money and it comes into the world on how paper money transformed the chinese economy we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient it was a huge deal it was you know we don t think of money or paper money as technology but we should it was it was a tool in this case that made a transaction made exchange much more efficient there is no mechanical transport at this time so you have to carry around your vast quantities of iron coins whatever on a cart or something that s expensive it s impractical it s easy to get robbed now you can transport the same amount of purchasing power with a piece of paper it s a crazy breakthrough and as it happens this breakthrough comes at this moment in chinese history and helps to propel this moment in chinese history that is this real economic flowering there is more trade in part because of paper money and with more trade you can have more specialization so people can grow the food that grows best where they live and then trade it across distances you have urbanization you have cities of over a million people growing up at a moment when cities in europe are under 100 000 it s really this kind of like a proto industrial revolution you have technological advancements it s this incredible economic flowering that is driven in part but certainly not entirely by the advent of paper money on how in the early years of the u s there was no national currency but thousands of kinds of paper money there is this amazing moment in u s history that kind of peaks in the 1840s or so where there are thousands of different kinds of paper money there was no central bank there weren t even any national banks there were lots of little banks given charters by their states by the states they were in in a lot of states any bank that followed a few rules could print its own paper money and if you can print paper money why wouldn t you and so there was this incredible proliferation of paper money the idea was you could bring your paper dollars to the bank that issued them and redeem them for gold or silver whenever you wanted but as you can imagine this creates a lot of problems problems for people who just want to buy or sell stuff like if you re a merchant and somebody walks into your store with a dollar bill from a bank you ve never heard of how do you even know it s real how do you know that the bank is legit how do you know that the bank is sound maybe it is a real bank but they re going to go bankrupt and you ll bring your piece of paper in and they won t be able to give you your gold or silver and so there arose to solve this problem these periodicals called banknote reporters that were like little newsletters basically little magazines that listed every bank in america and what their currency looked like what pictures it had on it and also a recommendation for whether to take the money at face value or whether to apply a discount rate if the bank is unsound you might say yeah i ll take your 5 bill but i ll only give you 4 50 credit for it and this persisted for decades kind of amazingly lauren
