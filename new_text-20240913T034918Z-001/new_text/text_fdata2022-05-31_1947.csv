decreased revenue due to tax refunds and weaker economic production and another 3 5 trillion yuan of lost land sales revenue beijing the chinese government faces a growing shortfall of cash analysts say as they predict an increase of debt to fill the gap the latest wave of omicron and the widespread lockdowns in place since mid march have resulted in a sharp contraction in government revenue including land sales revenue ting lu chief china economist at nomura and a team said in a report last week they estimate a funding gap of about 6 trillion yuan 895 52 billion roughly 2 5 trillion yuan in decreased revenue due to tax refunds and weaker economic production and another 3 5 trillion yuan of lost land sales revenue get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters much of the incoming stimulus measures be it special government bonds or incremental lending by policy banks will be merely used to fill this funding gap the nomura analysts said it s that 3 5 trillion yuan figure they expect will be hard to fill and they listed several measures from using fiscal deposits to increasing borrowing that could be used to make up the shortfall economic data for april showed weakening growth as covid controls took a toll premier li keqiang said during a rare nationwide meeting last week that in some respects the difficulties were greater than in 2020 even before the latest covid outbreak land sales a significant source of local government revenue have plunged following beijing s crackdown on real estate developers high reliance on debt local governments are also responsible for implementing tax cuts and refunds that beijing has announced to support growth the japanese bank and analysts from other firms did not share specific figures on how much additional debt might be needed but they pointed to growing pressure on growth that would require more support from debt excluding tax cuts and refunds the ministry of finance said local fiscal revenue grew by 5 4 during the first four months of the year from a year ago eight of china s 31 province level regions saw a drop in fiscal revenue during that time the ministry said without naming them incomplete data for the period from wind information showed the regions of qinghai shandong liaoning hebei guizhou hubei hunan and tianjin posted year on year declines in fiscal revenue for the first four months of the year tianjin was the worst with a 27 decline in 2021 tibet was the only province level region to see a decline in fiscal revenue according to wind it s important to notice that the decline of fiscal revenue happened not only in cities under lockdown said zhiwei zhang president and chief economist pinpoint asset management many cities without omicron outbreaks also suffered as their economies are linked to those currently under lockdown zhang said in an email in mid may the economic costs are not limited to a small number of cities it is a national problem shenzhen sees fiscal revenue plunge since march mainland china has sought to control its worst covid outbreak in two years with stay home orders and travel restrictions in many parts of the country notably shanghai and the surrounding region although financial data isn t readily available for many chinese cities the southern tech hub of shenzhen released figures showing a 44 year on year drop in fiscal revenue in april to 25 53 billion yuan that followed a 7 year on year decline in march to 22 95 billion yuan the local governments face mounting fiscal pressure their expenditure is rising but revenue dropping zhang said land sales are down sharply as well i think the central government may have to revise the fiscal budget and issue more debt to help the local governments beijing in march already announced an increase in transfer of funds from the central to local governments when asked in may whether that would be expanded the ministry of finance noted some funding for next year would be transferred ahead of time to help local governments with tax refunds and cuts this year pressure to spend on infrastructure to susan chu senior director at s p global ratings she s more concerned about the deficit the decline in revenue versus spending land sales don t create deficit pressure she said noting that more pressure will come from infrastructure spending tax cut allocation a widening deficit means there s a chance of more borrowing or debt burden in the future chu said in a phone interview earlier this month while she doesn t expect off budget borrowing will come back she said it is an important signal to watch for assessing risk in late april chinese president xi jinping called for a nationwide push to develop infrastructure ranging from waterways to cloud computing infrastructure it was not clear at what scale or timeframe the projects would be constructed this year one consequence will be that there will be less money left over for infrastructure expenditure jack yuan vp and senior analyst at moody s investors service said in a phone interview earlier this month he said since land sales have been an important source for local government spending on infrastructure a drop in land sales and limited increase in special purpose bonds would restrict financing options for infrastructure spending we expect the debt to continue to climb this year as a result of these economic pressures yuan said noting it remains to be seen how beijing decides to balance economic growth with debt levels this year

say as they predict an increase of debt to fill the gap the latest wave of omicron and the widespread lockdowns in place since mid march have resulted in a sharp contraction in government revenue including land sales revenue ting lu chief china economist at nomura and a team said in a report last week they estimate a funding gap of about 6 trillion yuan 895 52 billion roughly 2 5 trillion yuan

funding gap the nomura analysts said it s that 3 5 trillion yuan figure they expect will be hard to fill and they listed several measures from using fiscal deposits to increasing borrowing that could be used to make up the shortfall economic data for april showed weakening growth as covid controls took a toll premier li keqiang said during a rare nationwide meeting last week that in some respects the difficulties were greater than in 2020 even before the latest covid outbreak land sales a significant source of local government revenue have plunged following beijing s crackdown on real estate developers high reliance on debt local governments are also responsible for implementing tax cuts and refunds that beijing has announced to support growth the japanese bank and analysts from other firms did not share specific figures on how much additional debt might be needed but they pointed to growing pressure on growth that would require more support from debt excluding tax cuts and refunds the ministry of finance said local fiscal revenue grew by 5 4 during the first four months of the year from a year ago eight of china s 31 province level regions saw a drop in fiscal revenue during that time the ministry said without naming them incomplete data for the period from wind information showed the regions of qinghai shandong liaoning hebei guizhou hubei hunan and tianjin posted year on year declines in fiscal revenue for the first four months of the year tianjin was the worst with a 27 decline in 2021 tibet was the only province level region to see a decline in fiscal revenue according to wind it s important to notice that the decline of fiscal revenue happened not only in cities under lockdown said zhiwei zhang president and chief economist pinpoint asset management many cities without omicron outbreaks also suffered as their economies are linked to those currently under lockdown zhang said in an email in mid may the economic costs are not limited to a small number of cities it is a national problem shenzhen sees fiscal revenue plunge since march mainland china has sought to control its worst covid outbreak in two years with stay home orders and travel restrictions in many parts of the country notably shanghai and the surrounding region although financial data isn t readily available for many chinese cities the southern tech hub of shenzhen released figures showing a 44 year on year drop in fiscal revenue in april to 25 53 billion yuan that followed a 7 year on year decline in march to 22 95 billion yuan the local governments face mounting fiscal pressure their expenditure is rising but revenue dropping zhang said land sales are down sharply as well i think the central government may have to revise the fiscal budget and issue more debt to help the local governments beijing in march already announced an increase in transfer of funds from the central to local governments when asked in may whether that would be expanded the ministry of finance noted some funding for next year would be transferred ahead of time to help local governments with tax refunds and cuts this year pressure to spend on infrastructure to susan chu senior director at s p global ratings she s more concerned about the deficit the decline in revenue versus spending land sales don t create deficit pressure she said noting that more pressure will come from infrastructure spending tax cut allocation a widening deficit means there s a chance of more borrowing or debt burden in the future chu said in a phone interview earlier this month while she doesn t expect off budget borrowing will come back she said it is an important signal to watch for assessing risk in late april chinese president xi jinping called for a nationwide push to develop infrastructure ranging from waterways to cloud computing infrastructure it was not clear at what scale or timeframe the projects would be constructed this year one consequence will be that there will be less money left over for infrastructure expenditure jack yuan vp and senior analyst at moody s investors service said in a phone interview earlier this month he said since land sales have been an important source for local government spending on infrastructure a drop in land sales and limited increase in special purpose bonds would restrict financing options for infrastructure spending we expect the debt to continue to climb this year as a result of these economic pressures yuan said noting it remains to be seen how beijing decides to balance economic growth with debt levels this year

by antonio candido de melo e souza 1 when you walk down the avenida presidente wilson in rio de janeiro you pass by a small graceful building which we call the petit trianon brazilians are proud of the edifice because it is the home of the academy of letters it signifies an accomplishment of the mind and spirit which in our distracting tropical land we cannot lightly disregard and on the facade of the building there is a statue of a seated man whose head is turned in such a way that the face is in shadow it is machado de assis all brazilians even the young writers who rebel most passionately against academic traditions know this figure with the shadowy unprepossessing face know him and revere him for he was the greatest of all brazilian writers one of the subtlest writers of modern times and sixty years ago he founded our academy yet foreigners who walk by the petit trianon if they notice the statue at all or take the trouble to inquire about it seldom recognize the name of the man who is so famous in brazil and this is something which puzzles brazilians and sometimes annoys them only recently half a century too late have three novels of machado de assis dom casmurro epitaph of a small winner and philosopher or dog been translated into english and published in the united states where they have enjoyed a succès d estime critics and scholars believe that if they had been known fifty years ago they might have had an important bearing on the development of modern european and north american literature now when the direction of modern writing has already been determined by james and dostoevski by kafka and proust and pirandello the influence of machado de assis cannot be felt though of course his books are still very much worth reading for their own sake but why was there this long period of neglect why for that matter are the writers of present day brazil relatively little known throughout the rest of the world machado de assis born 1839 died in 1908 and modern writing i use the term in the same sense that one does when one speaks of modern painting or modern music began in brazil some time later first to move to new grounds was monteiro lobato 1883 1948 a coffee planter in the interior of the state of são paulo who became so incensed at his neighbors and alarmed by their habit of setting dangerously large fires to burn off the underbrush on their plantations thal he wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper in the state capital the letter was so well expressed that it was published on the front page and lobato decided to take up a literary career in 1918 he published a collection of sketches entitled urapês which was the first brazilian book written in a distinctly modern manner not that it was radical in matters of form and style but lobato wrote about the country people of brazil the caboclos of the backlands as if they were real people not simply stock figures he look them seriously and his sketches opened up a whole new area for brazilian writers in much the same way that the writings of edgar lee masters or sherwood anderson were a liberating force in the literature of the united states until his death lobato continued his somewhat stormy career as a writer never failing to delight brazilians with his stories and his epigrammatic criticism antônio cândido de melo e souza born 1918 earned his litt d and sc d at the university of são paula where he is note assistant professor of sociology a literary critic by profession from 1941 to 1946 he is the author of books of criticism a collection of essays and many articles on literature and sociology but it is probably more accurate to say that the beginning of modernismo in brazil was the semana de arte moderna or modern art week which was held in the municipal theater of são baulo in 1922 it was a clamorous high spirited affair where the general brazilian public had its first opportunity to become acquainted with dadaism cubism futurism imagism vorticism and what have you the whole modernist ferment of blague and rebellion which burst on the world of european art during the first two decades of the century it is interesting that some of the aesthetic patterns of the europeans were better suited to our own literary needs than to their own and were able to flourish here with more freedom and fertility primitivism for example as illustrated by picasso s concern with negro art or by the free association of the dadaists was much less artificial here than in the more civilized countries of the old world the heritage of the primitive africans and indians who gave so much racially and spiritually to brazil is naturally more alive and meaningful to us than to europeans the same is true of the daring experiments in free verse automatic writing aesthetic distortion the taste for the prosaic and representation for its own sake all of which corresponded to deep undercurrents in popular art that were seeking tentatively to come to the surface oswald de andrade 1890 1954 was the tireless and irreverent champion of modern writing in brazil the perpetual enfant terrible of all the avant garde reviews which sprang up in the twenties his revista de antropofagia proclaiming the truth of anthropophagy i e cannibalism is perhaps the best remembered a highly gifted writer he laid the foundation for much of the brazilian poetry that has been written during the past thirty years his experiments in verse ranged from sallies into primitivism to subtle and learned applications of symbolist techniques in his prose fiction he developed a synthetic and allusive style in which he wrote two little masterpieces of social satire memórial sentimentais de joãn miramar 1924 and serafim ponte grande 1933 and before his death he was engaged in writing marco zero a historical novel sequence that revived some aspects of lobato s earlier venture into the realistic treatment of backland themes 2 two other writers who were associated with the beginnings of modernismo mário de andrade 18931945 and manuel bandeira born 1886 had an even greater influence judged by the scope of his work the variety of his interests and the creativeness of his mind mário de andrade was perhaps the outstanding figure of the movement he was the leader of the são paulo futurists publishing his first book paulicéia desvairada hallucinated city shortly after the semana de arte moderna in it he attacked bourgeois culture with unrelenting fury and he continued throughout his life to insist on absolute purity in the aims and methods of literature many people feel that his macimaíma 1927 is the most significant literary achievement of modern brazil manuel bandeira is the outstanding poet of the modernist a movement born in pernambuco he later moved to rio and today he is the permanent secretary of the brazilian academy his experiments in verse form and meter are studied by all our young poets and equally important have been those works in which bandeira adapted the older portuguese lyric traditions to contemporary needs as an editor and anthologist to say nothing of his distinguished criticism he has done a great deal to animate and direct the course of poetry in brazil so far i have said nothing to distinguish the modern movement in brazilian literature from the same phenomenon in the other nations of america and it is quite true that during the twenties the writers of brazil were doing the same things as the writers of the united states or mexico that is to say they were oriented toward paris they were busy absorbing and adapting the great european experiment in the arts hence their works were often obviously imitative and in spite of their polemic ardor their theories and programs were frequently without roots but by 1930 a more searching spirit of self criticism and nativism became apparent in the first place a new literary generation appeared young writers who had come of age so to speak after the advent of modernismo they could afford to criticize the radical oldsters in the second place literary activity took on newlife in the vast northeast the region of great plantations where the ravages of the droughts and the depressed world markets were particularly disastrous in the third place there are real differences between brazil and other nations and these young writers of the northeast set out to discover the differences and exploit them to create in other words a truly native literature without abandoning the technical and formal advances that had been made during the period of experimentation what are the marks which distinguish brazil from other countries for one thing brazil is the only tropical land in the world which has produced a significant literature in the modern period but more important brazil is the only nation with a european cultural background which has assimilated not only negro and indian cultures but the negroes and indians themselves at all levels of society the place of the mestiço the person of mixed racial descent in the evolving social scheme has been debated by brazilians since the sixteenth century and again in the thirties it became along with the political and economic problems of those troubled years a primary theme for the young novelists of the northeast did these writers produce what critics in the united states often call proletarian novels no at least not in the narrowly ideological sense brazilian writers are as politically minded as writers anywhere else but they have always been too personal too introspeetive and perhaps too melancholy to create a genuinely propagandistic litterature let me mention three writers who deserve special attention jorge amado born 1912 jose lins do rego born 1901 and graciliano ramos 18921953 though they are different they share a deep concern to create a modern indigenous literature a few of their books have even managed to break the barrier of silence which foreign readers and critics haxe imposed on brazil perhaps more than any other writers these three haxe captured the qualities of brazilian life which foreigners can grasp and understand though they wrote solely to interpret brazil to brazilians among them they produced half a dozen noxels which are modern classics the first jorge amado is undisciplined and uneven guided mainly by intuition concerned almost always with political or otherwise controxersial subjects and gifted with a poetic sense which greatly enhances his best books jubiabá 1935 and terras do sem fun the violent land 1948 jose lins do rego is the chronicler of the decadence suffered by the old plantation families he has a rare capacity for the dramatic and one of the most powerful styles in the language menino do engenho boy of the sugar mill 1932 and bangue 1934 are his outstanding books the books of graeiliano ramos are of quite another kind in them the outside world and the development of a plot are at very most of secondary importance ramos a classicist in style was scarcely affected by modernism and remains the master of psychological analysis and the most unixersal novelist of the group sao bernardo 1934 and augústia anguish 1941 published in english in 1946 are typical of his finest work among the many names which ought to be mentioned one virtually demands attention gilberto freyre born 1900 historian sociologist literary critic he has brought to his many books and essays the sensibility of a poet and the learning of a scholar even his earliest works are still highly respected in brazil and each new publication in his continuing interpretation of brazilian life is an important exent for serious readers two of his books haxe a special interest for north americans casa grande e senzala translated into english as the masters and the slaves 1946 and brazil an interpretation 1945 which senhor freyre wrote directly in english and which contains a particularly useful chapter entitled the modern literature of brazil its relation to brazilian social problems one of brazil s most successful and popular writers is krico yerissimo born in 1905 in the gavcho state of rio grande do sul his widely read noxels are concerned with everyday people and their problems and a clue to his technique is perhaps found in the fact that he has translated james hilton john steinbeck and aldous huxley yerissimo has written two books giving his impressions of the united states the first having the engaging title black cat in a field of snow and four of his novels crossroads the best is silence consider the lilies of the field and time and the wind are available in english 3 in the decade after 1940 there was an appreciable change of direction a reaction against the novel of social significance and a search for new poetic forms modernismo was treated with open distrust by many young writers as a result of this shill in attitude the belligerence of the twenties and thirties died away and instead there emerged a climate of literary opinion which was more receptive to varied interpretations and oven to marginal or openly hostile writers the success of such traditional novels as o amanvmse belmiro belmiro the amanuensis by ciro dos anjos and perto do curação selvagem near the untamed heart by clarice lispector illustrates the point on the other hand counteracting the social tendencies of the writers of the northeast and of a southern novelist like verissimo there is a spiritual tendency which is becoming stronger and stronger such writers as lúcio cardoso and otávio de faria concern themselves with the problems of the inner life even when they are stated in a social context on poetry the influence of modernism has lasted more strongly as a form a spirit and even as a stimulus to rebellion besides coloring the work of our beloved academician manuel bandeira it manifests itself in carlos drummond de andrade born 1902 who knows how to distill from the collective consciousness the purest substance of personal poetic expression and who has succeeded where his predecessors failed in bringing humor to pathos he is perhaps the writer in all of contemporary brazilian literature who most appropriately personifies the word anxiety in its most profound sense his verse has been collected in 0 fazendeiro do ar the air farmer and poesia ate agora poetry until today murilo mendes born 1901 uses his heritage from the modernist movement quite differently he has widened the boundaries of poetry and writes his tumultuous experience of discovery and revelation forcing the words into new meanings and combinations according to his laws of inspiration author of poesia cm pdnico poetry in panic 1938 and o visionário the visionary 1941 auguslo frederioo schmidt born 1906 a businessman poet exalts in broad rhythms the faith and direct emotional revelation inherent in the spirit and themes of the romantic brazilian tradition the magic of the poetry of cecília meireles born 1901 springs partly from her fresh use of simple words and images and partly from the clear cool and often profound quality of her imagination she is but another of the gifted women poets found in latin america and in passing it might be recalled that gabriela mistral the great chilean poet and nobel prize winner lived in petrópolis near bio do janeiro from 1938 to 1946 and her influence on our literary life was not inconsiderable jorge dc lima 1895 1952 is the most versatile poet of all having started within the academic school and progressed through the regional phase he then developed among us a religious poetry movement and finally produced works of abundant inspiration in which the imagination creates symbols for his poetic anguish among them are a túnica inconsutil the tunic without hems 1988 and invencdo de orfeu the invention of orpheus 1952 with yinfcius de mora is torn 1918 we come to the youngest of the post modernists he reveals the marked influence of those who came before him but he has achieved an extremely personal poetic style vibrating with emotion and rare virtuosity two of his best known collections are cinco elegias 1943 and poemas sonetos e baladas 1946 many young poets with an attitude of combative negation have repudiated the accomplishments of their predecessors they are oriented by a kind of aesthetic intellectualism through which they seek a poetry of the universal eternal and general instead of the local ordinary and personal which was emphasized so strongly by the previous generation the name of joão cabral de melo neto who was born in 1920 will stand for the many in this younger generation better than most he has combined the mode of technical experiment with an authentic expression of feeling a word should be said here on the canto or short story for in this genre our writers like those of spanish speaking america have given an immediate and telling picture of the national character and customs machado de assis was a master of the form and we have had a number of gifted exponents such as the astonishingly fertile coelho neto 1864 1934 chronicler of our vie de boheme and the aristocratic regionalist of minas gerais afonso arinos de melo franco 1868 1916 in our day the diplomat writer bibeiro couto born 1898 with his tragicomic pictures of daily life and the northeastern illustrator luis jardim born 1901 possessor of a dry pungent prose style deserve mention perhaps the most talented of the generation however was antbnio de alcantara machado 1901 35 a keen student of human nature with a delicious sense of humor and a feeling for le mot juste deeply moved by the semana de arte moderna he was able to describe brazilians and particularly paulistas in such a way that their local qualities acquire universal symbolism his death at the age of thirty four deprived brazil of its most promising fiction writer again we cannot neglect the columnists and creators of sketches for instance genolino amado who writes charmingly on practically even subject one can think of osorio borba well known for the literary cornedy and marques rebelo the chronicler of rio de janeiro whose dialogue is so realistic that one can practically see his characters another bubem braga born 1913 who can be compared to certain contributors to the new yorker has a particular affection for the man in the street and a gentle sense of irony which delights brazilian intellectuals literary criticism has also developed in our day alccu amoroso lima born 1893 who sometimes signs himself trislao de atakle is a neo thomist of broad background and carefully considered aesthetic principles expressed in limpid harmonious prose a recent book on the united states a realidade americana is worthy to be placed on the shelf of that long series of studies by foreigners the most famous of which is by alexis de tocqueville álvaro lins erudite and high minded sergio milliet director of the municipal library in são paulo sometimes called the brazilian gide lucia miguel pereira author of penetrating literary studies and andrade muricy music critic and editor of an indispensable anthology the new brazilian literature indicate the wide variety of the field 4 it would be both difficult and pretentious to try to evaluate the nation s literature at this moment one thing is clear though and that is that modernismo remains the essential core determining the quality and quantity of output and defining the role of the writer in society the brazilian people continue to demand a poetic expression for their native life and writers continue to refine the craftsman s techniques so long as the two do not become incompatible the way is open for a free and constructive development of modern literature and even for the rise of greatness but there is a more immediate and practical reason for optimism over the future of brazilian literature and that is the state of the book market with the improvement of communications and the slow reduction of illiteracy the book market has grown steadily until today writing is a real profession foreign readers probably do not realize the extent to which the pursuit of literature in the past was bound up with other professions which unfortunately were the criteria of social recognition formerly one was a professor and writer a doctor and writer a lawyer and writer but today writers can at last feel that they have a genuine role in the life of the nation as writers this growth toward the autonomy of literature may he partly responsible for the perplexity of some of the younger writers who although their attitude is strong and affirmative have shown a definite bewilderment at finding themselves for the first time in control of their own destinies the independence which the relatively prosperous book market has given them is not always easy to accept hence the profusion of reviews programs and manifestoes which have sprung up lately most of them centered upon the argument between the exponents of aestheticism and those who ad vocate a social literature but it is safe to predict that these forces will find an equilibrium just as those which divided the older generations did the tropical splendors of brazil are picturesque and often magnificent yet it would be a shame if these were the only qualities of our national life to awaken interest beyond our borders brazilian writers believe that there are deeper currents in our culture which can offer something more positive to the intelligent and sensitive international public a strong sense of experience and a generous inspiration are the marks of brazilian writing of course the picturesque is often a barrier to international understanding it gets in the way of more important things thus europeans are more curious about the deep south of the united states than about the real problems of life today in vermont or ohio or oklahoma just as americans are curious about sicily or the russian steppes and so it may take time before the brazilian sertão the customs of our cities the qualities peculiar to our people and the way in which the drama of our soul is lived out are understood abroad even if we find faulkners vergas and sholokhovs to interpret t hem our language is another barrier of course as can be seen from the unfortunate case of machado de assis but it is not such an impassable barrier as people sometimes think portuguese after all is no more difficult or obscure than russian yet the great works of russian literature have been known everywhere for many decades if the translators will turn to brazilian literature past and present they will find a rich and significant source and this is what the young writers who browse through jose olympic s bookshop in rio or gather in the cafes of são paulo reading and discussing the new reviews from paris and new york hope will happen translated by margery elio

washington may 30 efe president joe biden said monday that his administration will not send long range missiles capable of reaching russian territory to ukraine despite the fact that kyiv has urgently requested them from the west to help it strike back at staging areas for russian invasion forces when asked by reporters at the white house about whether he was planning to send this kind of weaponry to ukraine biden responded that he will not send rocket systems that can strike into russia the us president made his remarks on the matter just before departing for arlington national cemetery on the outskirts of washington where he paid tribute as per longstanding tradition to us war dead on memorial day a national holiday being celebrated on monday in early may biden asked congress for more money to continue aiding ukraine defend itself against the massive military invasion launched by moscow on feb 24 but also to be able to guarantee the replenishment of us weapons stocks for its own defense the cost of this fight it s not cheap but caving to new aggression is going to be more costly said biden at the time adding we either back the ukrainian people as they defend their country or we stand by as the russians continue their atrocities and aggression in ukraine the president also told congress and the nation that it was critical this funding gets approved and approved as quickly as possible on april 28 biden formally asked congress for 33 billion in additional aid for ukraine which congress later upped to 40 billion of which more than 20 billion will be destined to military assistance to support kyiv in its fight against russia although pentagon and white house spokespeople have insisted that the aid to ukraine does not affect the us ability to defend itself they also acknowledged that an ongoing evaluation is being made of us weapons reserves every time new war materiel is dispatched to the beleaguered east european nation efe arc rrt bp
partnership established with a major united states urology group to conduct clinical studies in prostate cancer and as a potential route to market midlantic urology to evaluate the parsortix system in prostate cancer clinical studies and enable potential sales to solaris health extensive patient base major unmet medical need for a pre screening tool ahead of invasive prostate tissue biopsy as an aid to assessing prostate cancer presence and aggressiveness to guide treatment choices guildford uk accesswire may 30 2022 angle plc aim agl otcqx anpcy a world leading liquid biopsy company is delighted to announce it has signed a master clinical study agreement with solaris health holdings llc solaris and joinder agreements with midlantic urology llc to collaborate and conduct clinical studies in prostate cancer and as a potential route to market in the united states midlantic urology an affiliate of solaris is one of the largest providers of specialist urology services in the united states with more than 70 physicians operating from 47 dedicated urology centres across the state of pennsylvania the solaris health network encompasses more than 500 clinical urology providers across 179 locations and nine states with more than 729 000 unique patients annually together with midlantic urology angle will initiate clinical studies aimed at investigating the use of the parsortix system for the detection of prostate cancer and prediction of its severity in patients who present with an elevated prostate specific antigen psa level and or abnormal digital rectal exam the design of the first study to be conducted with midlantic urology expected to be initiated in q3 2022 has been informed by earlier pilot studies independently conducted at the barts cancer institute queen mary university london which used the parsortix system to harvest circulating tumour cells ctcs this study will initially enrol 100 men scheduled to undergo a prostate tissue biopsy at a minimum of three study sites over an anticipated period of up to nine months blood samples collected by midlantic urology will be shipped to angle s united states clinical laboratory for processing by the parsortix system to harvest and analyse ctcs and associated immune cells the parsortix harvests will be evaluated by both imaging and molecular analysis to assess the potential to predict the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer prior to tissue biopsy and to assess potential correlation with established disease severity scores e g the gleason score in those patients found to have prostate cancer angle expects headline results from the first study of 100 men in 2023 compelling data could form the basis of a laboratory developed test which angle would offer from its clinical laboratories in the united states and the uk solaris could be angle s first route to market for this test offering the established test to their extensive patient base successful results could also allow the design of a larger validation study to support an eventual submission to fda and other regulatory bodies for this application prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer in men and accounts for 13 of all new cancer cases in the united states under the national screening programme 11 million men will undergo a psa test in the us each year of these some 1 2 million will have an abnormal result leading to further investigations the current standard of care transrectal or transperitoneal prostate tissue biopsy is an invasive procedure associated with significant clinical complications and cost following the procedure 32 of patients are reported to experience moderate side effects with 1 4 of patients experiencing major complications this includes post biopsy sepsis in 2 5 of cases with up to 25 requiring admission to icu at an estimated cost of us 19 000 per patient prostate tissue biopsies are negative in 75 of patients and therefore place patients at unnecessary risk but may also miss the cancer in 30 40 of cases requiring patients to undergo repeat tissue biopsy at least 60 of prostate cancers diagnosed are indolent and unlikely to cause harm during a patient s lifetime nonetheless many men will undergo radical prostatectomy which is associated with significant post procedure complications including urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction liquid biopsy offers the potential for a much safer cost effective diagnosis active surveillance where appropriate and following diagnosis the ability to offer longitudinal monitoring and up to date targeted treatment selection dr jose moreno principal investigator midlantic urology commented even though psa is a valuable marker of response to prostate cancer treatment its role in screening is modest at best and can lead to both overdiagnosis of clinically indolent prostate cancer and underdiagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer which can result in increased rates of local failure and metastatic disease angle s parsortix platform has the potential to enable molecular characterisation of the cancer using a blood test in patients undergoing both traditional ultrasound biopsies and mri fusion biopsies the preliminary data suggest that we may be able to create an assay for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer that has high specificity and sensitivity moreover the assay can be customized to operate in a wide spectrum of prostate cancer disease states including pre prostate biopsy after a negative biopsy active surveillance after local failure and in early and late metastatic disease states if our results are validated our midlantic urology patients and solaris health affiliates may be the first to benefit from these developments angle founder and chief executive andrew newland added we are delighted that solaris and midlantic urology have agreed to work with angle on clinical studies in prostate cancer which build on prior work done by barts cancer institute and demonstrates the power of our leveraged research approach successful development of this simple blood test could prevent men from being subjected to unnecessary tissue biopsies when they either do not have prostate cancer despite the elevated level of psa or their cancer is indolent and unlikely to impact either their life expectancy or quality of life the funding for this study which addresses a major unmet medical need was a key element of our capital raise last year and could open up a significant market opportunity for angle initiation of the study

with sample to answer solutions angle s proven patent protected platforms include a circulating tumor cell ctc harvesting technology known as the parsortix system and a downstream analysis system for cost effective highly multiplexed analysis of nucleic acids and proteins angle s parsortix system is fda cleared for its intended use in metastatic breast cancer and is currently the first and only fda cleared medical device to harvest intact circulating cancer cells from blood intended use the parsortix pc1 system is an in vitro diagnostic device intended to enrich circulating tumor cells ctcs from peripheral blood collected in k 2 edta tubes from patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer the system employs a microfluidic chamber a parsortix cell separation cassette to capture cells of a certain size and deformability from the population of cells present in blood the cells retained in the cassette are harvested by the parsortix pc1 system for use in subsequent downstream assays the end user is responsible for the validation of any downstream assay the standalone device as indicated does not identify enumerate or characterize ctcs and cannot be used to make any diagnostic prognostic claims for ctcs including monitoring indications or as an aid in any disease management and or treatment decisions the parsortix system enables a liquid biopsy a simple blood test to be used to provide the circulating metastatic breast cancer cells to the user in a format suitable for multiple types of downstream analyses the system is based on a microfluidic device that captures cells based on a combination of their size and compressibility the system is epitope independent and can capture all phenotypes of ctcs epithelial mesenchymal and emting ctcs as well as ctc clusters in a viable form alive ctcs harvested from the system enable a complete picture of a cancer to be seen as being an intact cell they allow dna rna and protein analysis as well as cytological and morphological examination and may provide comparable analysis to a tissue biopsy in metastatic breast cancer because ctc analysis is a non invasive process unlike tissue biopsy it can be repeated as often as needed this is important because cancer develops and changes over time and there is a clear medical need for up to date information on the status of a patient s tumor in addition the live ctcs harvested by the parsortix system can be cultured which offers the potential for testing tumor response to drugs outside the patient the parsortix technology is the subject of 26 granted patents in europe the united states china australia canada india japan and mexico with three extensive families of patents are being progressed worldwide in the united states the parsortix pc1 system has received a class ii classification from fda for use with metastatic breast cancer patients fda clearance is seen as the global gold standard angle s parsortix system is the first ever fda cleared system for harvesting ctcs for subsequent analysis angle has applied the ivd ce mark to the same system for the same intended use in europe angle has also completed two separate 200 subject clinical studies under a program designed to develop an ovarian cancer pelvic mass triage test with the results showing best in class accuracy auc roc of 95 1 the pelvic mass triage assay has undergone further refinement and optimisation and a 200 patient clinical verification study has now completed enrolment angle s technology for the multiplex evaluation of proteins and nucleic acids of all types is called the hyceadtm platform and is based on a patented flow through array technology it provides for low cost highly multiplexed rapid and sensitive capture of targets from a wide variety of sample types a proprietary chemistry approach the hycead method allows for the capture and amplification of over 100 biomarkers simultaneously in a single reaction the hycead system is extremely sensitive and is ideal for measuring gene expression and other markers directly from parsortix harvests and was used in the ovarian cancer pelvic mass triage test to achieve best in class accuracy auc roc of 95 1 angle s proprietary technologies can be combined to provide automated sample to answer results in both centralised laboratory and point of use cartridge formats angle has established formal collaborations with world class cancer centres and major corporates such as abbott philips and qiagen and works closely with leading ctc translational research customers these key opinion leaders kols are working to identify applications with medical utility clear benefit to patients and to secure clinical data that demonstrates that utility in patient studies the body of evidence as to the benefits of the parsortix system is growing rapidly from our own clinical studies in metastatic breast cancer and ovarian cancer and also from kols with 60 peer reviewed publications and numerous publicly available posters from 31 independent cancer centres available on our website angle has established clinical services laboratories in the uk and the united states to accelerate commercialisation of the parsortix system and act as demonstrators to support product development the laboratories offer services globally to pharmaceutical and biotech customers for use of parsortix in cancer drug trials and once the laboratories are accredited and tests validated will provide laboratory developed tests ldts for patient management this information is provided by rns the news

company behind jiffystock cryptocurrency is one of our first steps because it is a revolution in the way payments are made our buyers won t have to pay huge transaction fees that a traditional banking system would charge the process is fast and secure he added further how do crypto payments benefit wholesale businesses major b2b wholesale marketplaces in the industry don t yet support any unconventional methods of payment in b2b wholesale business managing payments is one of the biggest headaches and many businesses suffer from issues like payments getting stuck cheques bouncing off or issues in loc procedures etc making payment process faster with minimal transaction fees around 0 001 or less through cryptocurrency is something every wholesale business would want and that is not just it although cryptocurrency is in a strong bear market right now there are still many holders that see it as a stable way of making payments even people who are skeptical about crypto can use it to make payments in their b2b wholesale business if some businesses don t wish to use keep and hold crypto they can still transfer or receive payments in stable coins and withdraw them to their bank without any loss in value they can benefit from the fast and secure transactions that crypto blockchain provides the future of jiffystock when asked what future the ceo rami altawara sees for jiffystock he said we would be hopefully building our own blockchain to host our marketplace where everything will be decentralized and fast we want to tell our customer businesses that our platform can not go offline or be taken down like other marketplaces that are hosted on conventional hosting severs it shows that he firmly believes in the future of decentralized marketplaces and the use of blockchain to build secure and fast sites he also added further that launching blockchain would also allow us to take the decentralized payments one step further whatever they are headed towards jiffy stock s development would be an interesting sight to see nonetheless about jiffystock crypto payments aren t the only differentiating factor in jiffy stock and other b2b wholesale marketplaces it is a relatively new marketplace and that gives it an edge over other marketplaces instead of sticking to an old design slow speed difficult to use interface and outdated technology like older wholesale e commerce platforms jiffystock has eliminated all the problems and jumped straight to the good parts being relatively new means that it is designed with the latest technologies to enhance customer experience improve speed and include all the necessary tools that a customer company might need to build its online wholesale business how does jiffystock work so how does jiffystoock s customer base

budget borrowing will come back she said it is an important signal to watch for assessing risk in late april chinese president xi jinping called for a nationwide push to develop infrastructure ranging from waterways to cloud computing infrastructure it was not clear at what scale or timeframe the projects would be constructed this year one consequence will be that there will be less money left over for infrastructure expenditure jack yuan vp and senior analyst at moody s investors service said in a phone interview earlier this month he said since land sales have been an important source for local government spending on infrastructure a drop in land sales and limited increase in special purpose bonds would restrict financing options for infrastructure spending we expect the debt to continue to climb this year as a result of these economic pressures yuan said noting it remains to be seen how beijing decides to balance economic growth with debt levels this year

job itself can be a difficult chore and becomes even more grueling for someone with a shady past after serving their time felons may feel the urge to get on with a virtuous life to achieve this the first thing they require is a job felons may feel that finding a job would be impossible after the crimes they have committed but that is not true many companies may be dubious about hiring convicts but a great deal of them also believe in giving second chances firms belonging to different sectors reserve a wide diversity of jobs for felons as a felon looking for a new job one should focus mainly on companies that hire felons applying to big companies is not a sensible option there is a very high probability of the application being rejected applying for a job at a trucking company sounds like a rational idea for individuals holding a commercial driver s license cdl a good wage together with a great demand for commercial drivers makes truck driving a lucrative job the mere holding of cdl has helped innumerable truck drivers get back on their feet trucking companies also offer to cover one s cost of the training school in return for the truck driver working for them for a specific time the duties of a truck driver include inspection of the truck to ensure that its efficiently functioning supervising the loading and unloading of cargo and matters pertaining to paperwork employees will be appointed tasks of local driving regional driving and over the road truck driving lists of trucking companies that hire felons include boyd bros transportation carolina cargo celadon trucking cheeseman transportation cr england crete carrier deboer transportation hunt knight transportation national carrier pgt trucking roehl stevens transport swift transportation tmc trans am transportation trans way uhaul western express trucking companies conduct a thorough background check of felons before hiring to ensure that the felons have the least driving offenses regular drug and alcohol tests are also conducted and even the slightest taste of an undesired substance in the blood gets one fired truck drivers enjoy handsome pay together with other benefits their pay scale ranges from 45000 per year to 85000 trucking companies work according to their hiring policies some companies may hire felons according to the severity of their crime while others may only hire convicts who have spent 5 to 7 years without resorting back to crimes felons must be really truthful on their job applications companies run deep background checks on every felon they have to hire trying to hide any felony to ameliorate one s chances of getting hired is thus useless numerous crimes committed like arson assault with intent to murder bribery extortion kidnapping operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level of 0 08 or higher dui reckless driving resulting in death serious traffic offenses involving misconduct with a motor vehicle e g road rage smuggling trafficking in controlled substances or weapons treason using a commercial vehicle cmv to commit a felony and vehicular manslaughter curbs one s chances of getting hired truck driving is not the only job that felons can turn to the list

companies retail chains warehouse and distribution employers communication companies and airlines a grocery store is an ideal place to look for a job as no special degree is required a mere high school diploma would do the job here felons can start from entry level jobs like stock clerk cashier shopping cart attendant bagger warehouse assistant and custodian by working tirelessly and with ambition felons can then make their way up to higher positions like mangers and assistant managers applying to hotel companies is also a sensible idea for felons although the jobs offered at hotels are pretty laborious they are bound to have a good impact on an individual s reputation as a hard working and willing to change individual the jobs include housekeeping hotel maintenance and food and

washington and colorado after laws were passed that legalized cannabis on a recreational level the mitigation of drug testing provides employers with an increased number of qualified job applicants it

recent media reports that the introduction of amtrak s new avelia liberty trains if it s america it s always liberty or freedom manufactured by france s alstom are facing yet another delay of 18 months pushing the total delay to more than three years the cause surprising to say the least to begin under new instructions to ban everything chinese the company had to turn to france to purchase their rolling stock but what amtrak has purchased is 3 generations old in china at the very bottom of anything that today would be termed high speed rail and is old in france as well reading between the lines it seems alstom agreed to reproduce some older technology equipment to match america s abilities but things haven t gone so well according to amtrak executives the need for more testing is the cause of things being behind schedule with amtrak citing rigorous testing required by federal regulations somehow implying american safety standards of exceptional rigor but the details seem to tell a different story in fact a review of the details reveals that the real cause was the discovery of compatibility problems with the northeast corridor tracks that prompted modifications to the train design as well as an incompatibility with its catenary system which is the overhead electrical source that provides power to the trains if this isn t clear amtrak executives discovered no doubt to their complete amazement that the trains they purchased didn t fit the tracks on which those trains would run nor could they connect with the available overhead power sources the spin placed on this by amtrak executives was that the train had to be modified to work harmoniously with the infrastructure however it wasn t an issue of working harmoniously but of working at all amtrak provided to alstom the design necessities for 30 new train sets which were manufactured to those specifications but when delivered the company discovered their design was so badly flawed that the new trains didn t match the trackage or the power supply and had to be modified this sounds like a three stooges episode or a jackie gleason comedy how is it possible for thinking persons to design and manufacture trains that can t fit their own tracks read more china has more than 38 000 kilometres of fast trains tracks gus didn t we have similar californian problems in sydney when trains were ordered with the wrong specs what about the new really ugly ferries that are too high for pasengers to stay on the top deck when going under bridges meanwhile going back a few years say the previous elections 2019 when politics was being cooked up by miraculous scomo the fast train dream on australia s east coast was being studied brisbane commuters will be able to catch a bullet train to either the sunshine coast or melbourne depending on who wins the next federal election labor has reignited the decades long dream to build a high speed train from brisbane to melbourne promising to appoint a high speed rail authority if elected read more meanwhile technology transfer is not free whenever the subject of technology transfer arises there seems to always surface a flurry of accusations about copying or stealing readers should carefully note that china did not steal anyone s rail technology instead it was all purchased china paid billions of dollars for that transfer of technology it is the same in all important industries today china has the money and is willing to pay handsomely for technology it needs to further its development to compensate for a late start the chinese government began in only 2004 by purchasing rail technology abroad signing agreements with alstom and kawasaki to build hsr train sets for china in cooperation with local firms kawasaki who designed the original hayate bullet train signed a deal with the chinese ministry of railways for the transfer of a full spectrum of hsr technology they began with kawasaki manufacturing 50 hsr train sets in japan and exporting these to china fully assembled then progressed to establishing factories in china where kawasaki helped the chinese manufacturers to produce another 50 train sets locally china also paid kawasaki for the training of manufacturing staff first in japan and then at the factories in china this process carried a heavy price the arrangement with kawasaki cost china around 800 million plus countless millions for training and many technology updates the contract with kawasaki included the transfer of the whole spectrum of technology and know how for the bullet train so that these trains became in fact chinese owned ip with this experience under its belt china then duplicated the process with siemens alstom and bombardier in similar deals for a full transfer of technology and ip rights so that china could freely manufacture these train sets domestically and sell them internationally similar to the procedure with kawasaki chinese engineers were sent to europe for extended periods of study and also had these firms assist china in establishing domestic manufacturing facilities all the firms trained chinese engineers while helping the country develop its own supply chain for train components and all of this involved several billions of dollars in fees but it wasn t all gravy because the chinese rail companies paid billions of dollars for was in fact old technology from those four companies knowing the chinese wanted to produce trains based entirely on their own ip and technology kawasaki and siemens in particular refused to sell their more advanced products and would sell china only rail technology that was already two or even three generations old these foreign companies were actually planning to take full control of china s vast market for hsr transportation expecting to fully supply the the most ambitious rapid rail system in history with rewards in the billions that did not deter the chinese as a first step they disassembled evaluated and combined all those technologies into one train combining the best features of each then they applied their formidable r d abilities to improve and enhance those features and create entirely new trains built exclusively on chinese owned ip the result was trains that were faster smoother quieter and less expensive than the newest generation of their former suppliers to say that the foreign firms underestimated the power of chinese innovation and the speed and quality of r d in china is an understatement of some magnitude with both kawasaki and siemens finding themselves left at the starting gate only a few years later the western firms confused their head start with their r d capacity attributing both to natural superiority confidently assuming they were more innovative rather than simply having begun earlier the assumption was that japanese and german r d capability coupled with their huge lead would maintain an impassable gap and permit them to capture the entire chinese market their willingness to sell their technology was from an expectation that the chinese would need at least 30 years to absorb and implement it before being ready to proceed on their own the reality was somewhat different they found themselves having to compete with chinese firms who adapted and improved their technology and produced superior products only three years later read more

first thing they require is a job felons may feel that finding a job would be impossible after the crimes they have committed but that is not true many companies may be dubious about hiring convicts but a great deal of them also believe in giving second chances firms belonging to different sectors reserve a wide diversity of jobs for felons as a felon looking for a new job one should focus mainly on companies that hire felons applying to big companies is not a sensible option there is a very high probability of the application being rejected applying for a job at a trucking company sounds like a rational idea for individuals holding a commercial driver s license cdl a good wage together with a great demand for commercial drivers makes truck driving a lucrative job the mere holding of cdl has helped innumerable truck drivers get back on their feet trucking companies also offer to cover one s cost of the training school in return for the truck driver working for them for a specific time the duties of a truck driver include inspection of the truck to ensure that its efficiently functioning supervising the loading and unloading of cargo and matters pertaining to paperwork employees will be appointed tasks of local driving regional driving and over the road truck driving lists of trucking companies that hire felons include boyd bros transportation carolina cargo celadon trucking cheeseman transportation cr england crete carrier deboer transportation hunt knight transportation national carrier pgt trucking roehl stevens transport swift transportation tmc trans am transportation trans way uhaul western express trucking companies conduct a thorough background check of felons before hiring to ensure that the felons have the least driving offenses regular drug and alcohol tests are also conducted and even the slightest taste of an undesired substance in the blood gets one fired truck drivers enjoy handsome pay together with other benefits their pay scale ranges from 45000 per year to 85000 trucking companies work according to their hiring policies some companies may hire felons according to the severity of their crime while others may only hire convicts who have spent 5 to 7 years without resorting back to crimes felons must be really truthful on their job applications companies run deep background checks on every felon they have to hire trying to hide any felony to ameliorate one s chances of getting hired is thus useless numerous crimes committed like arson assault with intent to murder bribery extortion kidnapping operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol level of 0 08 or higher dui reckless driving resulting in death serious traffic offenses involving misconduct with a motor vehicle e g road rage smuggling trafficking in controlled substances or weapons treason using a commercial vehicle cmv to commit a felony and vehicular manslaughter curbs one s chances of getting hired truck driving is not the only job that felons can turn to the list of companies that hire felons can be broadly classified into sectors like grocery stores hotel chains restaurants and food service outlets food processing employers manufacturing companies delivery companies retail chains warehouse and distribution employers communication companies and airlines a grocery store is an ideal place to look for a job as no special degree is required a mere high school diploma would do the job here felons can start from entry level jobs like stock clerk cashier shopping cart attendant bagger warehouse assistant and custodian by working tirelessly and with ambition felons can then make their way up to higher positions like mangers and assistant managers applying to hotel companies is also a sensible idea for felons although the jobs offered at hotels are pretty laborious they are bound to have a good impact on an individual s reputation as a hard working and willing to change individual the jobs include housekeeping hotel maintenance and food and beverage service restaurant and food service is one of the sectors that provide job opportunities to felons the pay here may not be so high but by working diligently as chefs waiters and hostesses

many moons have passed since the value of the pound was considered the main driver of britain s economic policy nevertheless a warning from strategists at bank of america that sterling should be regarded as no better than an emerging market currency and could face an existential threat is hardly in keeping with the national mood ahead of the platinum jubilee after all the star turn on bank of england notes is the queen bofa s epic scepticism about sterling reflects dissonance with both the bank of england and government many moons have passed since the value of the pound was considered the main driver of britain s economic policy under the leadership of andrew bailey the bank s credibility has suffered a serious setback at the current 9pc rate consumer price inflation in the uk is running at almost five times the 2pc target the bank was the first of the central banks to start raising rates after covid 19 but it did so only after a series of zig zags which left markets befuddled bailey and his compliant team of interest rate setters have been far too leisurely in raising interest rates it became so political in the pandemic when it saw saving jobs and business as the priority that it lost sight of its core mission sterling has clawed back ground since last week s energy market package from rishi sunak and stands at 1 26 in latest trading it has tumbled 11pc against the dollar since the pandemic peak of 1 42 two years ago any fall in the pound against the currencies of our trading partners raises domestic prices a 5pc drop in the pound adds 0 9pc to domestic prices so it is a significant contributor to inflation the bofa is as confused about the old lady of threadneedle street as most of us it argues that it has become hard to decipher and less transparent and declines to discuss the impact of brexit on the supply side of the economy that is unfair to bailey given the huge impact of covid and the russian war on ukraine on the supply side of the economy indeed the bank has worked hard to make sure that the city a big source of foreign earnings and taxation is not disadvantaged by brexit neither is the idea that the uk is no longer attractive to inward investment borne out by events singapore s sovereign wealth fund has just piled 3 3bn into uk student housing in a significant real estate transaction and britain is under siege from overseas buyers with companies as different as house builder countryside and fashion group ted baker currently targets sterling has clawed back ground since last week s energy market package from rishi sunak and stands at 1 26 in latest trading it would be foolish for the authorities to ignore bank of america s comments partygate has undermined confidence in the uk political establishment and the bank has done a lousy job tougher and faster action on interest rates will be needed to douse inflation and stabilise sterling ftse fat cats amid all the accounts of hardship from the consumer frontline as a consequence of inflation one group is filling its boots a survey of 2022 agms by deloitte has found that the median pay of ftse 100 chief executives reached 3 6bn in the 2021 22 financial year not far off a record high of 4m in 2017 so while most citizens are suffering a nasty squeeze on real incomes boardroom chiefs are again gorging on bumper payouts from annual bonuses and incentive plans restraint shown during the pandemic when business was protected from harm by furlough and loan guarantees has not extended into the era of supply chain bottlenecks inflation and war on ukraine there can only be admiration for the way that martin sorrell dusted himself down after parting company with wpp the high pay centre calculated recently that the gap between the pay of ftse 350 chiefs moderated to 44 times that of the average colleague in covid 19 but is surging ahead again serial sinners such as car dealer pendragon deserve bloody noses at upcoming agms sorrell test there can only be admiration for the way that martin sorrell dusted himself down after parting company with wpp he executed a rapid fire series of 30 deals to turn his new group s4 capital into a digital advertising powerhouse in the first quarter s4 reports frenetic new business with gross profit up by onethird in spite of dispiriting global events none of this will be relevant to shareholders until a fresh set of eyes at auditors pwc is able to restore confidence in the firm s financial reporting

the stamina 001 study will evaluate the safety pharmacology and preliminary efficacy of atg 037 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab an immune checkpoint inhibitors icis in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors atg 037 is an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor antengene has exclusive global rights to develop commercialize and manufacture atg 037 shanghai and hong kong may 30 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the phase i stamina 001 trial to evaluate atg 037 as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors in australia the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety tolerability recommended phase ii dose and preliminary antitumor efficacy of atg 037 as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor cd73 is an immune checkpoint mediator that interferes with anti tumor immune responses by generating adenosine which leads to immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment atg 037 can reverse adenosine mediated immunosuppression it has demonstrated promising preclinical efficacy as a monotherapy and in combination with icis and chemotherapy agents in preclinical studies this compound overcomes the hook effect that is common in anti cd73 antibodies in addition glp toxicology studies indicate the compound has a potentially wide therapeutic window while icis are widely used in the treatment of various cancers many patients have resistant or refractory disease which has created a large unmet need said dr ganessan kichenadasse principal investigator southern oncology clinical research unit in adelaide australia mounting evidence suggests that adenosine plays a critical role in suppressing anti tumor immunoactivity cd73 can convert adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine atg 037 an orally available small molecule cd73 inhibitor can block the generation of adenosine we are excited to be a part of the stamina 001 trial this phase i study brings together a group of highly experienced australian investigators to collaborate with antengene we are excited to assess the therapeutic potential of atg 037 for patients with solid tumors as a single agent as well the exploring the opportunity for benefit with the addition of an icis developing agents that can act in the tumor microenvironment to reverse immunosuppression is one of the key focus areas for antengene said dr kevin lynch antengene s chief medical officer preclinical data presented at the 2022 american association of cancer research annual meeting aacr 2022 showed that atg 037 had a stronger ability to restore t cell function in higher amp environments compared with anti cd73 monoclonal antibodies these data highlighted the potential therapeutic advantages of small molecule inhibitors of cd73 over blocking antibodies either as a monotherapy or in combination with other immune oncological treatments we have been very pleased with the drug s performance in preclinical studies and are hopeful that in this phase i study atg 037 can demonstrate the tolerability and signals of activity that will allow us to move forward into a broader development program we are very excited about the start of this first in human clinical trial and look forward to next steps with atg 037 about the stamina 001 trial the stamina 001 trial is a phase i multi center open label dose finding study of atg 037 monotherapy or combination therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic solid tumors subjects will begin with two monotherapy cycles and then be allowed to receive the addition of pembrolizumab the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atg 037 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and or recommended phase 2 dose rp2d and or optimal biological dose of atg 037 monotherapy and preliminary efficacy secondary objectives include characterization of the pharmacology of atg 037 as a phase i study there will be intensive safety monitoring throughout the trial about atg 037 atg 037 is an orally available highly selective small molecule that completely blocks the activity of cd73 cd73 an ecto 5 nucleotidase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine monophosphate amp to adenosine adenosine production leads to significant immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment now recognized as one of the most important immunomodulatory pathways in the tumor microenvironment many human tumors overexpress cd73 and this expression is frequently associated with poor prognosis blocking cd73 has been shown to be effective in controlling tumor growth and metastases and cd73 inhibitors may increase the therapeutic activity of icis and chemotherapy agents clinical data so far indicate that cd73 inhibitors add little additional toxicity to standard of care treatments about antengene antengene corporation limited

say as they predict an increase of debt to fill the gap the latest wave of omicron and the widespread lockdowns in place since mid march have resulted in a sharp contraction in government revenue including land sales revenue ting lu chief china economist at nomura and a team said in a report last week they estimate a funding gap of about 6 trillion yuan 895 52 billion roughly 2 5 trillion yuan in decreased revenue due to tax refunds and weaker economic production and another 3 5 trillion yuan of lost land sales revenue get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your

nomura analysts said it s that 3 5 trillion yuan figure they expect will be hard to fill and they listed several measures from using fiscal deposits to increasing borrowing that could be used to make up the shortfall economic data for april showed weakening growth as covid controls took a toll premier li keqiang said during a rare nationwide meeting last week that in some respects the difficulties were greater than in 2020 even before the latest covid outbreak land sales a significant source of local government revenue have plunged following beijing s crackdown on real estate developers high reliance on debt local governments are also responsible for implementing tax cuts and refunds that beijing has announced to support growth the japanese bank and analysts from other firms did not share specific figures on how much additional debt might be needed but they pointed to growing pressure on growth that would require more support from debt excluding tax cuts and refunds the ministry of finance said local fiscal revenue grew by 5 4 during the first four months of the year from a year ago eight of china s 31 province level regions saw a drop in fiscal revenue during that time the ministry said without naming them incomplete data for the period from wind information showed the regions of qinghai shandong liaoning hebei guizhou hubei hunan and tianjin posted year on year declines in fiscal revenue for the first four months of the year tianjin was the worst with a 27 decline in 2021 tibet was the only province level region to see a decline in fiscal revenue according to wind it s important to notice that the decline of fiscal revenue happened not only in cities under lockdown said zhiwei zhang president and chief economist pinpoint asset management many cities without omicron outbreaks also suffered as their economies are linked to those currently under lockdown zhang said in an email in mid may the economic costs are not limited to a small number of cities it is a national problem shenzhen sees fiscal revenue plunge since march mainland china has sought to control its worst covid outbreak in two years with stay home orders and travel restrictions in many parts of the country notably shanghai and the surrounding region although financial data isn t readily available for many chinese cities the southern tech hub of shenzhen released figures showing a 44 year on year drop in fiscal revenue in april to 25 53 billion yuan that followed a 7 year on year decline in march to 22 95 billion yuan the local governments face mounting fiscal pressure their expenditure is rising but revenue dropping zhang said land sales are down sharply as well i think the central government may have to revise the fiscal budget and issue more debt to help the local governments beijing in march already announced an increase in transfer of funds from the central to local governments when asked in may whether that would be expanded the ministry of finance noted some funding for next year would be transferred ahead of time to help local governments with tax refunds and cuts this year pressure to spend on infrastructure to susan chu senior director at s p global ratings she s more concerned about the deficit the decline in revenue versus spending land sales don t create deficit pressure she said noting that more pressure will come from infrastructure spending tax cut allocation a widening deficit means there s a chance of more borrowing or debt burden in the future chu said in a phone interview earlier this month while she doesn t expect off budget borrowing will come back she said it is an important signal to watch for assessing risk in late april chinese president xi jinping called for a nationwide push to develop infrastructure ranging from waterways to cloud computing infrastructure it was not clear at what scale or timeframe the projects would be constructed this year one consequence will be that there will be less money left over for infrastructure expenditure jack yuan vp and senior analyst at moody s investors service said in a phone interview earlier this month he said since land sales have been an important source for local government spending on infrastructure a drop in land sales and limited increase in special purpose bonds would restrict financing options for infrastructure spending we expect the debt to continue to climb this year as a result of these economic pressures yuan said noting it remains to be seen how beijing decides to balance economic growth with debt levels this year

photo tasos katopodis getty images united states president joe biden announced the reason that his administration was not sending rockets to help ukrainians defend themselves against the russian military assault the democrat s administration officials said that they were considering the distribution of rocket systems as long as they withhold the longest range united states president joe biden reveals the real reason his government is not sending rockets to assist ukraine in its fight against russia amid the nearly four month long war on monday the democratic leader said the u s will not send rocket systems to the european nation that could potentially reach into russia the announcement came after reports that his administration was planning to send long range systems to the besieged nation rockets to help ukrainians several media outlets reported that the biden administration was leaning toward sending advanced long range systems to ukraine reporters outside the white house asked the president if his administration would supply the latter with weapon systems that could strike russia the situation comes amid reports of the biden administration considering the distribution of the multiple launch rocket system mlrs this would allow ukrainian military forces to fire rockets much further than they are currently able the mlrs had reportedly been one of ukrainian officials top requests from the united states and they argued they needed it to stop the advance of the russian military in the east moscow s forces have already taken control of the key city of lyman last week as per fox news biden s reluctance to send the weapon systems comes as the u s attempts to ease the tension with moscow while it was unclear what the president meant with his remarks it was consistent with other briefings over the weekend that the white house was willing to provide the mlrs as long as it withheld the longest range missiles read also lavrov comments on putin s health rumors amid claims that russian president has 3 years left to live the us made mlrs comes in many different variants which in turn can use a variety of munitions the longest range can fire missiles up to 185 miles away while others use rockets that have shorter ranges of 20 to 40 miles according to the guardian one senior u s official said that mlrs was under consideration but noted that nothing was on the table with long range strike capabilities in a statement former russian president dmitry medvedev described biden s remarks as reasonable and warned that if russian cities were struck moscow s forces would have struck at the centers of these criminal decisions russia ukraine war ukraine appears close to losing the city of severodonetsk which is the easternmost city that it has controlled in the donbas region the situation comes amid a relentless russian artillery barrage that has already destroyed a large portion of the region that had a population of roughly 100 000 president volodymyr zelensky on sunday acknowledged that the entire critical infrastructure and more than two thirds of the city s housing stock had already been completely destroyed by russian forces he repeated his pleas to international governments for modern weapons to defend his count and his people the biden administration is expected to announce a decision regarding the deployment of weapon systems to ukraine this week pentagon press secretary john kirby said before the memorial day weekend that u s officials were still trying to determine what the next drawdown package will include in order to defend ukraine against russia s assault newsweek reported related article lithuanians pitch in to buy advanced military drone to help ukraine against russia 2024 hngn all rights reserved do not reproduce without permission
hartnett still doesn t believe markets have found their bottom but he s not alone in seeing a few reasons to be cheerful jpmorgan s us strategy team notes investor positioning has been even more bearish than it appears while wall street has posted its fourth worst start to a year on record stocks have been supported by a wave of buybacks from companies that are flush with cash jpmorgan says there is us1 9 trillion 2 6 trillion of cash on s p 500 balance sheets excluding financials and a stunning 219 companies have 25 per cent or more of their market value in cash the strategists reckon that without these buybacks and the surge of buying by directors and management the 13 per cent drop in the s p 500 would have been more like 20 per cent or more positioned for the worst as such jpmorgan says investors have positioned for the worst possible outcome for the us economy with stocks broadly three quarters of the way to the lows of prior recessions advertisement and so any bit of good news such as last week s suggestion from federal reserve member raphael bostic that the fed could take a strategic pause after raising rates could lift the market anything short of a recession will likely catch most investors completely wrong footed especially after broad and severe drawdowns that are 75 per cent of the way to prior recession bottoms jpmorgan says it s important to remember that a us recession is far from locked in indeed bank of america s equity and quant analyst savita subramanian says the bank s economists put the chances about 30 per cent she says if the us economy does fall into recession then the s p could find a bottom at 3200 points or about 23 per cent below the current level of 4158 points but subramanian also provides five reasons to be bullish starting with the fact investors are struggling to find reasons to do so she notes that the negative real interest rates bubble has been popped consumer and corporate balance sheets are strong the us is in a position of relative energy strength and wage pressure is hastening the need for automation which will help spark a cycle of capital expenditure that can deliver a tailwind for stocks advertisement investors might get a sense of how this little rally is looking in the next few nights capex guidance has remained surprisingly strong despite negative guidance on profits and margins she says today capex is a must do covid and geopolitics have glaringly revealed the downside risks of global supply chains and near shoring is an easy way to reduce carbon emissions the promise of 90 per cent of companies that we cover of course the momentum behind the swing to bullishness is so strong that some investors may be suspicious the market is trying to talk itself into rallying certainly market rallies are not unusual in periods like this in the 2000 tech crash there were no fewer than 11 dead cat bounces on the nasdaq between the market s peak in march 2000 to its eventual trough in october 2002 two of those rallies delivered gains of more than 40 per cent it s also worth noting that defensive sectors particularly energy seemingly the universal pick of analysts across the world are favoured while sentiment around tech stocks still seems weak advertisement tech is facing the quadruple whammy of rising discount rates peak globalisation tough comps and crowding subramanian says investors are still 23 per cent overweight the tech media and telco sector and their muscle memory of making money on dip buying in tech needs to fade before tech bottoms investors might get a sense of how this little rally is looking in the next few nights the s p 500 s next test is likely to come around 4250 points the index s 50 day moving average if the index can hold around that level and news flow can remain mildly positive then perhaps momentum can continue into june but june is also when the fed is due to start quantitative tightening and is likely to raise rates again as will the reserve bank of australia the tests for skittish markets will keep coming
colombo after sri lanka defaulted on its debt jack mcintyre a portfolio manager at brandywine global investment management started watching rice and grain prices more closely for a swath of the markets he s tracking global food shortages are presenting governments with a stark choice pay their debts or feed their people sri lanka opted for the latter falling into arrears on its foreign debt may 18 amid a lack of dollars to ease shortages of everything from food to fuel and bets are high that others may follow fifteen emerging market em nations now trade with debt at distressed levels or a risk premium of more than 10 percentage points four of those nations are in africa where one of the steepest run ups in food prices is taking a toll the default in sri lanka made me nervous says mcintyre you don t have to drive heat your home but you have to eat with memories of the arab spring unrest in the early 2010s in mind investors are fleeing emerging market nations threatened with crippling food shortages and uprisings russia s invasion of ukraine disrupted vital supplies of food staples adding to problems caused by extreme temperatures and elusive rain in breadbaskets from the great plains to the horn of africa indeed food prices have skyrocketed by more than 30 over the past year according to a united nations measure that s all the more striking when you consider that in the two decades through 2020 they rose an average of 4 3 every year the countries that are most affected and least able to cope are those in the developing world for these nations food is almost a third of current year on year headline inflation gauges in the united states united kingdom and much of europe food accounts for 10 or less of similar measures desperate measures like india s move to restrict wheat exports announced earlier this month will add to global price pressures thwarting efforts by central bankers to subdue them and protests against domestic pain have the potential to spread the markets have firmly underestimated the implications of the rise in input costs said bnp paribas markets emerging markets economist luiz eduardo peixoto we are particularly concerned about food inflation the repercussions of the increase in the cost of food will be seen in the next few months causing a dramatic increase in global inflation not that prices haven t already taken a hit

programmes in place to buffer the effects on households his team is cautious on the bond markets of nigeria india kazakhstan egypt and pakistan due to their large food inflation components and has ratcheted up expectations for emerging market inflation in most countries what s clear to all is there s no quick fix for food shortages or the markets fallout even before the russia ukraine conflict disrupted food supplies networks had been weakened by the lingering effects of pandemic shutdowns climate change and the energy crisis it s a situation that s led to hoarding on a global scale with food producing nations now stopping some exports and perpetuating a cycle of inflation and hunger india the world s second biggest producer of wheat followed its prohibition on sales of the staple

article 3 months old international may 31 2022 a plethora of negative events has caused the tesla share price to fall this year but the company and its founder continue to find support from loyal believers by danielle ecuyer tesla s share price fall in 2022 at its low down 45 to us 625 has coincided with a plethora of negative happenings the selloff may well prove to be noise for the brave investors who can look beyond tesla s controversial founder and ceo elon musk and his personal media aspirations and political commentary china lockdowns and supply chain problems tesla shanghai has been the beacon of tesla s achievements to date a greenfield leading edge electric vehicle manufacturing hub that represents the stage 2 iteration of facilities after freemont according to long term tesla shareholder ross gerber co founder and ceo of gerber kawasaki the shanghai production fills demand for not only china s desire for electric vehicles but the plant is also a major exporting hub harsh lockdowns cratered production for giga shanghai in april but manufacturing has restarted in late may with a closed loop system workers remain on site shanghai represents around 40 of tesla s total delivery numbers and the lower contribution will soften the june quarter production results in china as well as tesla s earnings in general twitter circus dan ives from wedbush securities a positive commentator and analyst of tesla didn t mince his words on bloomberg regarding the proposed us 44bn takeover of twitter by elon musk it twitter has been a disaster from the beginning and he musk continues to add fuel to the fire twitter has and continues to be the portal for elon musk to communicate with the world even though his musings can be both inflammatory and provocative musk has always been controversial but loyal followers were happy to look through any transgressions from a self confessed aspergers sufferer to the genius that was changing the world through an online zoom interview ross gerber stated the more stress that he musk comes under the crazier he seems and if you want to invest with genius absolute flat out genius and you want normal it doesn t work that way like that so you get on the ride and if you don t like it you don t you can bitch and moan as much as you want about it it won t change one thing he is going to do and he is going to change the world in ways that i haven t seen a person do in my life and the latter includes the revered steve jobs says gerber but will the twitter circus as dan ives declared leave some semi permanent taints on tesla there is no doubting musk has become a much more political voice on the social media platform however contrary to the critics and the naysayers gerber retains a different view regarding the impact of the twitter fiasco on tesla s management and culture gerber stated that the mission is so important to the people who do it that they do not pay attention to this stuff the misperception between reality and what we see and read is a gulf and the gulf is gapped through experience tesla management is on a mission and everyone believes they will succeed on the flipside gerber highlighted that elon burns through a lot of people and it doesn t attract everyone linking through the twitter debacle to an impact on tesla could well be as short sighted as not looking through the shanghai lockdowns as a buying opportunity is there smoke without fire in early february 2022 the california department of fair employment and housing announced plans to sue tesla over racism and harassment of black employees at the california freemont factory the lawsuit comes on the back of a us 137m payout to a former black employee for racial abuse when he worked at the freemont factory in 2015 and 2016 adding further fuel to the many fires global ratings agency s p has dropped tesla from its esg index several reasons were cited but one analyst rick mills from newsletter ahead of the herd makes for some very compelling analysis see link below musk was recently photographed with the indonesian president jokowi widodo at tesla s austin texas plant no one can criticise tesla for wanting to secure the necessary materials and minerals but the question needs to be asked at what cost and what is the image tesla is trying to put out to the market mills conclusion raises food for thought a company that has shown itself more than willing to make deals with the devil in indonesia and new caledonia shouldn t be masquerading as an angel when it comes to its environmental practices putting the headwinds into context looking beyond the china lockdowns and the twitter sideshow tesla s vehicle demand is so strong the company announced it has stopped taking orders until the 12 month plus backlogs can be filled how the other automotive companies would love to have the same problem with the ongoing commissioning of giga austin and berlin the stage 3 iteration of the machine that makes the machines tesla is going to produce the model y with the new 4680 battery cell packs new amd chip hardware and full self driving software fsd that is expected to reach a new level of autonomy by the end of 2022 musk is continuing with the twitter takeover but has de risked tesla with the expiration of the margin loan over his shares for the equity portion of the takeover musk formerly stated after the us 8bn worth of tesla stock sales that he will not sell more tesla shares wedbush s share price target for tesla shares has been lowered to us 1000 from us 1400 with the lockdown impacts and slower china growth in the second half of 2022 impacting on earnings forecasts but dan ives retains an overweight recommendation jefferies also cut the price target for tesla to us 1050 from us 1250 and retains a buy rating the broker cited an uncomfortable pile up of negative news including china ratings downgrades controversial political opinions and ethical questions credit suisse post a visit to the freemont factory reiterated its us 1125 price target and reconfirmed its outperform rating general market sentiment is fragile the economic macro economic environment remains challenging with the federal reserve raising interest rates and starting quantitative tightening talk of global recession remains constant and us stock markets remain fragile as witnessed by sell offs post weak results and guidance from companies such as walmart target and snap to name but a few in a risk off environment high multiple stocks remain vulnerable to more selling including those with large cash positions on the balance sheet such as apple and tesla the ever present threat of competition and at times questionable ethical standards in combination with the major shareholder elon musk raises the risk profile for the stock gerber believes 2022 is like 2019 when the company battled numerous challenges with scaling production of the now so popular model 3 for now the true tesla believers consider the selldown offers value to a company that is so much more than just electric vehicles it is energy battery storage insurance software robo taxis and even optimus the robot if one is willing to accept the musk aspirations to read rick mills analysis stripped of its esg credentials tesla continues to pursue dirty nickel in indonesia danielle ecuyer has been involved in share investing in

digitalhallway istock via getty images the official launch of new jersey recreational cannabis sales should have the market excited about multi state operators msos verano holdings otcqx vrnof is one of those msos set to benefit from the unlock of massive cannabis volumes in northeast markets my investment thesis remains bullish on the stock with the unlock of value from new jersey and the new york license in hand q1 struggles the whole cannabis sector struggled during q1 22 due to the tough comps boosted by stimulus checks last year and the omicron shutdowns during january and february verano was no exception with revenues down over 9 million from the solid december quarter the mso continues to produce impressive gross margins above 60 while ebitda mergers are strong at 40 of revenues my one major complaint about verano was the company potentially under spending on brand marketing during this early period of retail expansion where limited licenses reduce the need to advertise the company has spent more on sg a in the recent quarters with these cots now at 27 of revenue levels up 2 percentage points from the q4 21 level of 25 the company claims the higher expenses are from entering new markets and increasing marketing initiatives but verano doesn t break out the financial details in the md a verano now leads the large mso sector with the top ebitda margins for q1 22 as follows verano 40 curaleaf otcpk curlf 23 cresco 24 green thumb otcqx gtbif 32 trulieve otcqx tcnnf 33 verano has 47 stores in florida making up a large part of the retail footprint of 116 locations which includes the locations from the pending acquisition of goodness growth holdings otcqx gdnsf unlike trulieve cannabis with a dominant focus on florida retail locations verano is poised for growth in the northeast from their new jersey stores launching recreational cannabis on april 21 and the goodness growth license in new york source verano q1 22 presentation the mso already has the industry leading margins before entering these massive market opportunities a market like new jersey requires a sizable amount of spending to build up operations before launching recreational cannabis services and the view was that the state would begin operations long before mid april verano should be able to maintain or grow margins based on the massive sales volumes in these states though one needs to be cautioned that goodness growth currently has negative ebitda margins the company guided to 20 margins for the year before launching new york recreational cannabis next year but the amount will impact verano margins incredible value as with a lot of msos verano now trades at an incredible value for a growth company with large adjusted ebitda margins entering another growth phrase as a standalone company the mso is expected to see revenue jump to 963 million this year and reach nearly 1 3 billion next year data by ycharts for a stock with only a 2 4 billion valuation the valuation equation is rather remarkable the launch of recreational cannabis in new jersey especially with the launch of a 3rd store in jersey shore sets verano up to test the upper limits of the revenue estimates the deal with goodness growth provides major upside to those growth estimates at a cost of only 413 million the mso already has a 60 million revenue run rate with flower sales in minnesota s medical markets and adult use sales in new mexico pushing the total business up to 100 million the whole new york business is a bonus with revenues easily topping 200 million in 2023 on an early year launch of recreational cannabis though unlikely verano has the potential to reach 2023 sales of 1 5 billion while the market cap is just 2 7 billion at even just 35 adjusted ebitda margins lowered for the addition of goodness growth and more sg a spending the mso would produce 525 million in adjusted ebitda and trade at close to just 5x targets the company now has net debt of 240 million which isn t exactly ideal in a rising rate environment as with other msos the net debt levels are covered by adjusted ebitda limiting the risk but the market isn t very forgiving right now takeaway the key investor takeaway is that verano trading below 5x 2023 adjusted ebitda targets is almost a crime the stock isn t priced for the growth potential over the next few years as recreational cannabis sales launch in crucial northeast markets like new jersey and new york

19 update for our legacy huazhu business revpar recovery in the first two months of 2022 was on track nevertheless such recovery was significantly interrupted by the large scale outbreak of the omicron variant in over 30 provinces in china since early march 2022 many cities such as shanghai and jilin have been subject to lockdown since then which resulted in a sharp decline of both business and leisure traveling activities however this outbreak led to a rise in demand for our hotels to serve the quarantine needs of infected persons or those in close contact with infected persons as well as the accommodation needs of medical teams and delivery riders as the omicron variant is highly infectious there are still uncertainties in terms of the impact on our legacy huazhu business in the near term to mitigate risks we are now implementing several costs and cash flow management measures legacy dh has been experiencing continuous revpar recovery since germany unfolded its opening up

guidance since march 2022 the highly infectious omicron variant has been spreading rapidly in china which again seriously affected our business performance also the current covid prevention policy has rendered business performance more unpredictable in the foreseeable future under such circumstances we will suspend providing or updating guidance in respect of annual revenue and hotel openings until

financial measures to supplement the company s unaudited consolidated financial results presented in accordance with u s generally accepted accounting principles gaap the company uses the following non gaap measures defined as non gaap financial measures by the u s securities and exchange commission sec adjusted net income loss attributable to huazhu group limited excluding share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities adjusted basic and diluted earnings losses per share ads excluding share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities ebitda adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda from the legacy huazhu segment and adjusted ebitda from the legacy dh segment excluding share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap for more information on these non gaap financial measures please see the table captioned reconciliations of gaap and non gaap results set forth at the end of this release the company believes that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding company performance by excluding share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities that may not be indicative of company operating performance the company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing company performance and when planning and forecasting future periods these non gaap financial measures also facilitate management s internal comparisons to the company s historical performance the company believes these non gaap financial measures are also useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used regularly by company management in financial and operational decision making a limitation of using non gaap financial measures excluding share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities is that share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities have been and will continue to be significant and recurring in the company s business management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the gaap amounts excluded from each non gaap measure the accompanying tables have more details on the reconciliations between gaap financial measures that are most directly comparable to non gaap financial measures the company believes that ebitda is a useful financial metric to assess the operating and financial performance before the impact of investing and financing transactions and income taxes given the significant investments that the company has made in leasehold improvements depreciation and amortization expense that comprise a significant portion of the company s cost structure in addition the company believes that ebitda is widely used by other companies in the lodging industry and may be used by investors as a measure of financial performance the company believes that ebitda information provides investors with a useful tool for comparability between periods because it excludes depreciation and amortization expense attributable to capital expenditures the company also uses adjusted ebitda which is defined as ebitda before share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities to assess operating results of its hotels in operation the company believes that the exclusion of share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities helps facilitate year on year comparisons of the results of operations as the share based compensation expenses and unrealized gains losses from fair value changes of equity securities may not be indicative of company operating performance the company believes that unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of equity securities are generally meaningless in understanding the company s reported results or evaluating the economic performance of its businesses these gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in reported periodic earnings therefore the company believes adjusted ebitda more closely reflects the performance capability of our hotels the presentation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be construed

than in 2020 even before the latest covid outbreak land sales a significant source of local government revenue have plunged following beijing s crackdown on real estate developers high reliance on debt local governments are also responsible for implementing tax cuts and refunds that beijing has announced to support growth the japanese bank and analysts from other firms did not share specific

spending tax cut allocation a widening deficit means there s a chance of more borrowing or debt burden in the future chu said in a phone interview earlier this month while she doesn t expect off budget borrowing will come back she said it is an important signal to watch for assessing risk in late april chinese president xi jinping called for a nationwide push to develop infrastructure ranging from waterways to cloud computing infrastructure it was not clear at what scale or timeframe the projects would be constructed this year one consequence will be that there will be less money left over for infrastructure expenditure jack yuan vp and senior analyst at moody s investors service said in a phone interview earlier this month he said since land sales have been an important source for local government spending on infrastructure a drop in land sales and limited increase in special purpose bonds would restrict financing options for infrastructure spending we expect the debt to

p global ratings she s more concerned about the deficit the decline in revenue versus spending land sales don t create deficit pressure she said noting that more pressure will come from infrastructure spending tax cut allocation a widening deficit means there s a chance of more borrowing or debt burden in the future chu said in a phone interview earlier this month while she doesn t expect off budget borrowing will come back she said it is an important signal to watch for assessing risk in late april chinese president xi jinping called for a nationwide push to develop infrastructure ranging from waterways to cloud computing infrastructure it was not clear at what scale or timeframe the projects would be constructed this year one consequence will be that there will be less money left over for infrastructure expenditure jack yuan vp and senior analyst at moody s investors service said in a phone interview earlier this month he said since land sales have been an important source for local government spending on infrastructure a drop in land sales and limited increase in special purpose bonds would restrict financing options for infrastructure spending we expect the debt to continue to climb this year as a result of these economic pressures yuan said noting it remains to be seen how beijing decides to balance economic growth with debt levels this year

listen to the seventh episode of the quartz obsession podcast season 3 on inflation advertisement listen on apple podcasts spotify google stitcher kira bindrim if you ve paid for pretty much anything in the past six months you might have noticed a few changes meat prices are up fruit prices are up electricity prices are up furniture prices are up car prices are up rent is up gas is up how much you re paid on the other hand that might not be up at all after more than 20 years of slow and steady price increases the us and other countries are now dealing with record levels of inflation and we know how that works greedy companies raise their prices paychecks don t go as far and regular people suffer right not exactly figuring out why inflation happens is more complicated than people realize and the culprits that tend to get blamed often aren t at fault the truth is we also need inflation at least some of it to keep the economy humming advertisement of course tell that to a family trying to put food on the table no matter how complex inflation is or how little economists agree on it we know how it makes us feel and that feeling is one reason inflation has become such a critical indicator for consumers it s personal this is the quartz obsession a podcast that explores the fascinating backstories behind everyday ideas and what they tell us about the global economy i m your host kira bindrim today inflation how we get to the prices we pay i am joined now by heather landy who is an executive editor at quartz and who s with me here in the studio in new york i m curious heather if i say inflation to you are there immediate examples that come to mind from your own life experience heather landy yeah sure i mean these days plenty but even thinking back there was this high end deli turkey meat that i used to regularly buy when it was like 8 99 maybe 9 99 a pound i didn t really ever notice the price like not on a week to week basis and i didn t really care until one day in 2009 or so i got totally jolted by seeing it crossed the 10 mark and i honestly think that this was my first real inflation awakening but there s plenty of other places that you can find inflation so starbucks they raised prices back in october of 2021 and then again in january of 2022 and then said in february that another increase would be coming and so far starbucks addicts seem to be absorbing the increase but i like the starbucks example because they re a good proxy maybe for what s happening to a lot of big companies out there advertisement kira bindrim i want to back up a little bit and start with just some basics for people and also i kind of want to wrap my mind around where the current moment fits in inflation history so let me start with what is the definition of inflation and how do we measure it or what s our best metric for measuring it how is inflation calculated heather landy there s two good ways to think about the definition in basic terms one is it a rise in prices for stuff that we buy and the other way to think about it is a decrease in the purchasing power of your money so what a dollar or a pound or a euro or a yen will get you how do we measure it a couple different ways in the united states there s two main things that we look at one is the consumer price index or cpi which is a basket of goods and services with about 80 000 different items in it and it s weighted by the average importance to american consumers so if more people eat say cereal than eggs for breakfast a change in cereal prices will count more toward inflation than a change in egg prices then there s the pce which is the price index for personal consumption expenditures it s similar but different in a few key ways so the cpi is put out by the us bureau of labor statistics the pce is put out by the bureau of economic analysis pce usually runs a smidge behind cpi but pce is the number that the fed generally has its eye on so that s what it s trying to keep to 2 kira bindrim i want to ask you to define two more things because i honestly feel like we have a branding challenge here which is there are just too many words that end in ation and i think people get confused so we ve talked about inflation which is price increases what is hyperinflation hyperinflation vs stagflation heather landy hyperinflation is technically a monthly inflation rate of 50 or more it has happened more than 50 times throughout world history we re nowhere near that now in the united states nor in most countries so in weimar germany in the 1920s inflation was nearly 30 000 1 became equal to literally 1 trillion german marks in hungary after world war ii 419 quadrillion percent inflation that s 15 zeros more recent examples venezuela zimbabwe have had hyperinflation that money in those countries becomes nearly worthless and so what you need when that happens is typically a new currency backed by a stable government so in zimbabwe for example that s meant using foreign notes including the us dollar and there are reports that venezuelans are using the dollar too advertisement kira bindrim so when we hear that stereotypical a wheelbarrow full of money was necessary to buy one loaf of bread generally that s hyperinflation heather landy exactly kira bindrim other ation word what is stagflation heather landy stagflation is when inflation is rising and the rest of the economy doesn t look good at all so you know the stock market might be in decline unemployment might be on the rise gdp is falling so the economy is not doing well and inflation is rising stagflation not a good situation advertisement kira bindrim so let s talk a little bit about what s going on in this moment when we say we are experiencing record inflation right now what does that actually look like heather landy well we re not really i mean in the us inflation was running way higher actually in the 70s and early 80s than it is now but the annual inflation rate in the united states was at 7 9 in february of 2022 and that s the fastest pace that we ve seen since back in early 1982 so a 40 year high kind of alarming energy has been the biggest contributor to the recent increases so gas prices have climbed tremendously just in general and then with the conflict in ukraine but even getting rid of energy and also food and again these tend to be the most volatile categories the cpi was still up 6 4 in february also the most in 40 years kira bindrim so we re talking about inflation rates that are 7 8 9 and you mentioned earlier 2 as the thing that the fed is shooting for why where does that 2 come from what is the current inflation rate heather landy yeah that s a funny story this so the fed s been using that 2 target since at least 1996 and a lot of other countries use it too canada sweden japan the uk also the european central bank and it turns out that this framework dates to a 1988 television interview with a guy who was then the finance minister of new zealand which at the time was recovering from a big spike in inflation that was running at like 15 and by the time in the interview it was closer to 10 so an improvement and the minister was asked if the government was satisfied now and he said no actually he d rather see it between zero and 1 and so he and his teams went back and set a boundary of 2 to give them just a little more wiggle room on that and then suddenly canada settled on a 2 target and then it was like dominoes everybody was suddenly setting targets and 2 was a very common one to hit so for the latter 90s and much of the early 2000s the us was actually interested more in a 1 5 target it turns out but after the 2008 recession 2 became the target formally just to give the economy a little more space to grow and that would in turn give the fed a little more flexibility to lower and raise rates as needed it has been suggested that 4 perhaps might be a better target we don t really know it s hard to set up formal tests of these things but there s a lot of resistance to moving the target not because a new one might be wrong but because you don t want to sow concern in the market that the target can just change on a whim i mean that s the kind of uncertainty that throws markets for a loop and might even be worse than whatever the economic data s actually being produced so we re likely stuck with a 2 target for the next long while advertisement kira bindrim it s making me think of what i am going to assume as an even dumber question but i m going to ask you anyway why isn t the ideal rate of inflation zero in other words like what is the case for prices going up at all heather landy you want to see prices going up at least a bit i mean that is the sign of a healthy economy that wages are in fact growing and that people have more money to buy more things when inflation goes to zero or turns negative or deflation that is generally the sign of a very unhealthy economy so a little bit is good you just don t want it to get to the point where nobody can afford anything kira bindrim everything in moderation really heather landy exactly advertisement kira bindrim so let s talk about what causes inflation and what impacts it has beyond sort of the straightforward impact which is obviously prices go up i alluded earlier to this idea that i think a good number of people might have which is that inflation is largely a byproduct of greedy companies raising their prices to have more money and take it away from the people i m going assume that s not the case but i m gonna ask you anyway is that the case and if not what do we know about what causes inflation what causes inflation heather landy i mean we blame corporations for being greedy and for raising prices so that they can profit but the problem with this argument is that companies are always greedy that is what they are meant to do at least in a capitalistic system they didn t just stop being greedy for three decades when inflation was running low and then suddenly just decide in the past year or so to get profitable they re raising their prices because their expenses are going up too i mean that s how inflation works it s like this rising tide lifts all boats situation you asked me about the causes of inflation so demand we want more stuff and just basic law of supply and demand we can expect to pay more for it lately very relevant to the situation around the world because of covid the rotation from services into goods in part because this causes another major factor in inflation which is supply issues so we re spending less on going out to eat or to the movies or what have you because we re locked down at home but suddenly we want to build that jungle gym in the back for the kids or get a new tv entertainment system because we re all home watching netflix or what have you and that s going to put pressure on the supply of things like lumber and then we see those prices rise and you know expectations as i talked about before this is a really important factor in inflation so if you think your money will be worth less tomorrow than it is today that your dollar won t go as far you ll buy today and stretch that dollar if you can and that s smart from an individual budgeting perspective but then that also is going to generate more demand for those products in the short term and that s going to push up prices all the more and right now inflation expectations in the us and in much of europe are way higher than they ve been in a long time kira bindrim so it s a combination of supply demand and emotion advertisement heather landy yeah that sounds right kira bindrim how universal is the experience of inflation i have to imagine that rising prices for things like food and gas impact people differently depending on their socioeconomics is that the case what do we know about how it s hitting different communities differently heather landy yeah absolutely so in the united states lower income households spend say three quarters of their income on necessities and high income households are spending more like 30 of their income on necessities so there s much less flexibility in the budgets obviously of lower income people kira bindrim other than prices going up which is obviously the main manifestation of inflation are there other ways that people might be able to observe the impacts of inflation out in the world advertisement heather landy a common one if we can go back to the grocery store is shrinkflation as it s called so that s when you re paying the same or maybe even a higher price for something but you re getting less than you used to the package might be smaller there might be fewer sheets on the roll of paper towels that you bought there might be fewer chips in your bag of doritos there might be a little less toothpaste in that toothpaste tube and those three are actually all real examples that we ve seen in this latest bout with inflation so again your dollar isn t getting stretched as far not necessarily because the price is going up but it s getting you fewer doritos than it used to kira bindrim i have one more impact question and i suspect it s like got the most complicated answer but let s go for it what is the relationship between wages and inflation what are we seeing in terms of impacts on wages are wages keeping up with inflation heather landy this is a confusing one so it s a little bit chicken and egg there s something known as the wage price spiral when prices rise as a result of higher wages but which came first so recently we have seen inflation rising but we ve also seen wages rising for the first time in a long time in the united states the wage gains recently have been stronger at the lower end of the wage distribution and in fact if you factor in inflation to look at what the real wage gains are like what you actually get after you account for inflation it s only on average lower wage workers that are seeing an increase in their actual purchasing power with the money that they re earning but overall purchasing power is falling so we re seeing wage gains in sectors that have some of the lowest pay leisure and hospitality retail transportation and warehousing what does that do it means that companies that employ those kinds of workers might have to charge more what does that mean we re paying more and so inflation overall is rising what does that mean those workers now want or need even more in order to afford all the stuff that they re buying at home that s the spiral where it actually starts the economy s almost like too big for us to really get a handle on that and the point is they speed into one another wages and prices and you know this is actually one of the issues that a lot of people have when the federal reserve starts talking about taming inflation what they re saying on some level is that wages are rising too quickly and we need to de escalate this and that doesn t sit well politically with a lot of people for good reason even with wages having risen as much as they have over the past few years i don t think most people would tell you that they think people who work at grocery stores are making too much money advertisement kira bindrim after the break how do you solve a problem like inflation kira bindrim hearing you talk about inflation and how we talk about it at quartz it s interesting to think because it s just this sort of somewhat routine aspect of living in any economy but it looms so large in people s minds it is on the tip of everyone s tongue right now when inflation is up it s sort of all anyone can talk about and i m really interested in sort of separating the economic definition of inflation from this role it plays for us as this is kind of like boogeyman in the economy why do you think inflation has that boogeyman reputation is it just as simple as no one likes when prices go up or is there you know precedent or i don t know factors that kind of elevated in our minds inflation throughout history heather landy i think a lot of it is emotional i mean we ve all kind of had parents telling us about when ice cream cost a nickel for an ice cream cone or going to the movies was a dime or whatever but i think the worst part of it or the scariest element of it which is probably not the thing that most people are thinking about on a daily basis but maybe is in the back of their minds is that it can get out of control quickly if it s not addressed and to economists that s probably the biggest part of the boogeyman effect of this advertisement kira bindrim do you think there s something generational here too i m actually thinking of the blackrock president who pretty recently said we have an entitled generation that is experiencing inflation for the first time and oh poor them they go to the store they can t get exactly what they want that seems a little harsh but do you think there is an element of each generation gets its tour with recession and its tour with high inflation that there s something a little bit cyclical about this and gen z and the millennials are just facing it for the first time heather landy yeah i mean that s exactly it there is something cyclical throughout all of this and you know i recently saw a headline that talked about how mortgage rates in the us are now at a whopping 5 and my dad won t hesitate to remind you that he bought a house in 1984 with sterling credit and a 14 mortgage which is extraordinarily high by today s standard so yeah there is a generational aspect in terms of who s experienced what when but mostly and more importantly than that there s a monetary aspect to it so back in the 1960s milton friedman the famous economist noted inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon which became a famous phrase if you look at the money supply and it s rising look out because inflation everywhere since friedman said this and probably well before has largely been the outcome of a rise in the money supply or a rise in the growth of the money supply that s where inflation really comes from that s what stoking demand there s just more money sloshing around and in this case with the pandemic a lot of governments united states included really went to town pumping the economy full of money in order to keep things afloat and that s a big part of what we re seeing now kira bindrim okay now let s talk about how you address inflation so we are in this moment in the us where inflation is at not a record of all time but a record for certain generations let s say and everyone s freaking out about it everyone sort of comes around to the idea that it s not transitory it is a problem that needs to be addressed my first question for you is who addresses inflation whose job whose responsibility is it to try and maintain that 2 or maintain a certain level of inflation and react if it runs too hot how the fed controls inflation heather landy well that would primarily be the fed so we talked about that 2 target that they have for inflation they also are responsible for keeping the us economy at maximum employment and this is actually a really tricky balance when inflation starts to rise because the typical way that you stop inflation in its tracks is to ratchet up interest rates you make money more expensive to borrow there s less investment happening less spending on stuff but you do that and then it s very easy to tip into a recession and then you see people getting laid off and businesses closing so those two mandates that the fed has are often in opposition to each other so it s a tricky balance advertisement kira bindrim we ve gone through some historical examples of hyperinflation is there a good historical example of successfully taming inflation would that just be the last time we had high inflation heather landy yeah the 1980s paul volcker he came in and did the painful work of really raising interest rates like to 20 it was painful the recession as a result was super deep but it did slow things down enough to whip inflation as they called it and to restore confidence in the dollar all around the world because suddenly the purchasing power of the dollar you didn t have to worry about it diminishing as quickly as you did back when inflation was running hot and this triggered a real era of prosperity but it s important to note that that prosperity that we enjoyed in the 90s and early 2000s was not shared equally and it made us complacent about a lot of things that we then really started to take for granted in our economy kira bindrim is some inflation easier to whip than other inflation heather landy yes and no i mean to the extent that inflation is the result of what the fed would call a transitory situation kind of an impermanent a hiccup a supply chain issue that can be relatively easily resolved that can be easier to clear up the problem that the us has now is that what looked to maybe be a temporary hiccup in things like supply chain either wasn t like it was more than just that or that temporary hiccup sort of i m gonna mix all kinds of metaphors here bled into other areas of the economy and now we ve seen broad based inflation take hold in a much more permanent way advertisement kira bindrim is there a world in which inflation resolves itself common colds itself just burns itself out without any intervention heather landy we don t really know but rising rates would be the way to go the fed support for the economy in other ways can also get unwound and you will see that happen throughout 2022 for sure the fed had stepped in and was purchasing bonds on the open market just to keep everything afloat during the covid crisis similar to what it was doing in 2008 during the credit crisis but generally higher interest rates have been the solution to inflationary periods kira bindrim there is so much to return to here and i feel like i ve gone from like i ll be at the grocery store and i ll see the raspberries are expensive and i ll be mad to now i ll be like that s complicated heather landy it s complicated and not so i keep perspective in two ways one i think about all the things that i want for the world i want people who are fairly paid wherever they may live and wherever they may work i want technologies and companies that are better for the environment and that costs money to develop and to implement so it could be even with all the inflation that we ve been experiencing since the start of covid we still might not be paying anywhere near what we should be for those of us who are maybe a little more idealistic about what the economy should be providing to humanity advertisement the other thing i think about is that historical perspective the worst ever annual inflation rate in the us ever recorded was back in 1778 just shy of 30 there were three more periods of double digit inflation between then and 1913 which is when the federal reserve came into the picture and at that point the data got a lot better that s when the cpi got introduced but four years after the federal reserve was created back in 1917 inflation was still just under 20 so you know it s a volatile history but if we want more recent perspective i think of and have been reading a lot lately about the 70s and early 80s so richard nixon comes into office he inherits a recession and even though he was a republican and republicans tend to be more conservative about these things at least on paper if not in practice as history has now shown us many times he took a keynesian approach and ran budget deficits so he s amping up government spending to keep the economy afloat and then in 1971 he institutes wage and price controls which was a new thing for the states but this sort of pact about how the government wanted to make the economy work for more americans he s also pressuring the fed to keep rates low which is generally better for electability and is also one of the reasons why the fed s independence and maintaining that is such an important thing so rates are low and then you also have the tail end of the vietnam war and war unfortunately tends to be great for economic productivity and then you also have the oil embargo in 1973 and then another energy shortage in 1979 so prices are rising overall and by 1980 the us inflation rate was at 14 so what we re seeing today is not what our parents experienced at the grocery store or in the housing market and i think about that a lot also what we re experiencing today is unlike other inflationary periods in that the market has been on a tear for the past few years and with all of that we have still had keynesian monetary policy low rates the fed stepping in and that heated up inflation and we just always have to remember that these things are a balance this is the interesting thing about inflation it sometimes seems to just spin up out of nothing or so many factors that it s hard to tease them apart and calibrating when to respond how severely to respond is really quite difficult work and that s what we re going to see the fed figure out over the next few quarters kira bindrim i m just curious what the most fascinating thing you ve learned about inflation is so now i m also at the grocery store with the person looking at the turkey and i m going to drop some knowledge on them share a fun fact with them about inflation while they re staring at turkey what is something interesting that i could let them know advertisement other causes of inflation heather landy the things that we think cause inflation don t always turn out to be the cause so after the inflation of the 70s and 80s the oil embargo and the vietnam war were the two big culprits that people always pointed to and that does make some logical sense that that would be the cause of it but it turns out when you strip those things out inflation was still running really hot kira bindrim do you think inflation just becomes this distraction like i m just thinking about how many bigger non cyclical things we need to solve cough cough climate change and all we re talking about right now not you and i because we re doing an episode but all people are talking about in america is how prices are going up and what are we going to do about prices and who am i going to vote for based on what they promised me about prices it just seems like a recipe to never deal with anything else am i too cynical heather landy no i wouldn t say you re too cynical but i will say it s been very heartening to me to see governors of the federal reserve for example talking about this issue in the context of wage inequality household wealth inequality so if one of your broader goals for the economy is to have something that s more inclusive and equalizing then you know this is not a wasted debate to have because the things that happen in terms of inflationary pressures and the ways that we respond to them are going to have real implications for either closing or widening things like wealth gaps of course we re going to be more obsessed with what s happening in our own backyards and in our own grocery carts today it s natural and i guess the most important thing on that would be to make sure that the policies that we re applying to that and the people we are electing as a result are still going to do the things that we want and need them to do kira bindrim okay so there s something sort of glass half full in there that the conversation the debate around inflation can ultimately affect some of the systemic issues that are important in all kinds of other ways so i shouldn t lose hope advertisement heather landy don t lose hope kira bindrim thank you

with president joe biden s build back better agenda in ruins democrats want to blame big business for the mayhem of high inflation and a collapsing stock market advertisement the white house has pointed its finger at every industry from big tech to meat producers oil and gas producers the poultry industry and pharmaceutical companies apparently corporate america suddenly became incredibly greedy when biden entered office now another move against capitalism is in the works sponsored by sen amy klobuchar and supported by the democrats leading business basher sen elizabeth warren senate democrats want to punish big business by pressing for a vote on a bill to break up big technology firms and other companies in the united states financial success is today seen by many democrats as prima facie evidence of a monopoly ripping off the little guy klobuchar s bill would limit mergers and acquisitions increase penalties for supposed price gougers enrich thousands of lawyers as they harass america s employers and put america s technological superiority in grave danger as china tries to take over these industries note that there are no credible antitrust laws to speak of in china meanwhile in the house of representatives an almost equally dangerous bill is being sponsored by a republican rep ken buck of colorado some of this punish big tech agenda is being driven by legitimate conservative anger over social media censorship those of us on the right are all fighting for more equal treatment and free speech protections on the major social media platforms thank goodness we now have crusaders such as elon musk talking about cleaning up twitter s bias against conservatives advertisement recommended but mimicking a klobuchar warren agenda as buck and too many other free market republicans are proposing will only give more power to regulate our tech companies in ways that are unlikely to give a better shake to conservative voices and companies more likely bills such as warren s and buck s would empower biden regulators to police the internet and prohibit legitimate business practices that will only give more power to the woke left klobuchar s bill will ban the way that amazon prime and google maps operate this won t benefit consumers because their prices are very low the big winners will be their businesses rivals many of them are chinese the federal regulators are salivating over the new controls and powers to oversee and punish u s businesses and the leftist social justice groups openly boast that the law will give unprecedented new powers to regulate commerce republicans like buck are pleading with their liberal allies to keep their mouths shut about what this bill would empower big government to do i will not get a lot of support if there is a picture of ken buck and joe biden giving a thumbs up towards moving forward on antitrust bills he said last month at the 2022 antitrust and competition conference indeed the biggest winner from the warren buck legislation would be biden superregulator lina khan khan is the young progressive academic who was raked over the coals by senate republicans during her confirmation hearing for her wrecking ball approach to business she sees a monopoly at every street corner advertisement again buck is worried when khan talks about using antitrust for climate change labor issues and racial issues he complains i ve got a lot of explaining to do on my side yes you do congressman why would buck want to hide from his house gop colleagues the true intentions of his bill this is as subversive as saying we will read the bill after we pass it and to what end consumer prices in many of the technology industries are falling not rising this is why the new trustbusters want to sidestep the consumer welfare standard for antitrust if a supposed monopoly is lowering prices then just who is the victim that buck and warren are trying to help free market republicans would be wise to scamper away from these bills it won t solve the censorship problem but it will give a sword to biden regulators whose disdain for profitable businesses is only matched by their contempt for conservatives
our unique dataset on gun money in politics now includes spending on state and federal lobbying as well state and federal contributions from gun control groups gun rights groups and gun manufacturers in addition to contributions to members of congress and the most up to date nra data explore opensecrets gun data to follow the money boosting officeholders across the country mass shootings are often quickly politicized as lawmakers and members of the public alike grapple with how to address senseless gun violence but organizations on both sides of the issue have been working in washington for decades contributing to decades of political gridlock broken in june 2022 by the bipartisan gun safety bill national outcry for solutions after several high profile mass shootings preceded recent legislative action less than two weeks after a may 10 shooting left 10 people in the tops friendly markets in buffalo n y dead and several others injured 19 children and two adults were killed in an elementary school shooting in uvalde texas between the two mass casualty events another shooting left one dead and multiple injured at a taiwanese church in california the california and new york shootings are being investigated as hate crimes congress passed bipartisan legislation that expanded background checks for buyers under 21 funds state intervention programs including so called red flag laws and allocates millions for mental health and school safety resources the bill also cracks down on gun trafficking and straw purchasers and expands the ban on domestic abusers to include serious or recent partners fifteen senate republicans voted with democrats to pass the legislation although a majority of congressional republicans backed by prominent gun rights groups including the national rifle association opposed the bill as too broad president joe biden signed the bill into law on june 25 2022 a week later a gunman killed seven people at a 4th of july parade in the highland park neighborhood in chicago the killing highlighted acknowledged limitations of the bipartisan bill to stop such mass shootings but broader bans on assault rifles or other weapons are unlikely to pass the current congress we ve been here before deadly shootings across the country shock the conscience and spur debate in both communities and congress in april 2019 a shooting at a synagogue in the town of poway in southern california killed one and injured three in what officials deem a hate crime the poway synagogue shooting came exactly six months after a man spouting anti semitic slurs opened fire on worshippers at the tree of life synagogue in an attack that left 11 dead the anti defamation league described the tree of life shooting as the deadliest attack on the jewish community in american history the deadliest mass shooting in modern american history occurred one year earlier in oct 2017 at a las vegas music festival resulting in the deaths of 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds more only 16 months before that a gunman armed with a handgun and a semi automatic rifle murdered 49 people and injured 58 at an orlando nightclub in what was then the country s worst mass shooting the horrific attack in orlando came less than six months after a man and a woman opened fire at a san bernardino calif social services center killing 14 and injuring 22 despite the outpouring of grief and sympathy that followed the san bernardino incident on dec 2 2015 the very next day the senate rejected a bill to tighten background check requirements on would be gun buyers just as it did in 2013 shortly after a lone gunman killed six adults and 20 children at sandy hook elementary school in newtown conn the issue of how to strike a balance between gun rights and public safety has been a political hot potato for years prominent gun rights organizations consistently spent millions more on lobbying in washington than their gun control counterparts according to opensecrets data

measure undertaken by the trump administration was the banning of bump stocks a tool that allows semi automatic rifles to fire as fast as automatics after the las vegas shooting the ban which took effect in march 2019 requires existing bump stocks to be turned in to the government or destroyed but former president donald trump repeatedly pledged to protect second amendment rights and often warned gun owners that their second amendment rights are under assault in an april 2019 speech to nra members trump announced he will not ratify america s participation in the international arms trade treaty which would provide some international oversight on arms sales in opposition to the republicans the democratic controlled house prioritized passing gun control legislation the house previously passed two measures with some bipartisan support that strengthen and expand the background check process and reauthorized the violence against women act opposed by the nra because of the bill s measure that seeks to prevent domestic abusers from obtaining guns in june 2016 democrats mounted a successful filibuster that forced senate republicans to vote on four gun control proposals none of which passed house democrats also proposed their own broader legislative response to mass shootings in june 2022 the house passed the protecting our kids act with some republican support in early june but the senate opted to move forward with its own bipartisan gun safety legislation that biden ultimately signed into law later that month a 44 caliber political issue the last major piece of gun control legislation to make it into law prior to the bipartisan gun bill passed in june was the assault weapons ban passed in 1994 as part of a larger crime related bill approved by congress and signed by then president bill clinton but the ban which applied to the manufacture of 19 specific models of semi automatic firearms and other guns with similar features expired in 2004 and repeated attempts to renew it failed 81 of americans told pew research center in 2021 that they support expanding background checks to include private firearm sales and purchases at gun shows including a majority of republican respondents preventing individuals with mental illnesses from purchasing guns is also supported by the vast majority of people on both sides of the political spectrum some democrats thought their support for the assault weapons ban cost them control of congress in the 1994 midterm elections whether or not that s true there s little question that the politics of gun ownership have swung to the right republicans largely oppose gun control and democrats are split with some lawmakers cautious about going against the views of more conservative constituencies

the central issue he ran on the necessity of more gun control legislation was essentially standard among all democratic candidates several of whom own guns despite highly publicized mass shootings no earlier gun control measures with the exception of the bump stock ban made it into law prior to the recent bipartisan gun safety legislation that includes the so called manchin toomey amendment to require background checks in all commercial gun sales including those at gun shows the closest attempt in recent history to reform gun laws the measure first came to a vote in april 2013 four months after the newtown shooting it failed getting only 54 of the 60 votes it needed to overcome a filibuster opensecrets found that nearly all of the 46 senators who voted against the amendment had accepted significant campaign contributions from the political action committees of gun rights groups there were exceptions to the rule notably the measure s sponsors sens joe manchin d w va and pat toomey r pa but in general the correlation was a close one no senators who were in office for the 2013 vote changed their position when the provision came up again after the san bernardino killings in 2015 and the second time around only 48 votes of support for expanding background checks could be found another bill put to a vote that day sponsored by sen dianne feinstein d calif would have prohibited individuals on the federal government s terrorist watchlist from buying guns it was rejected as well guns and money there s no denying that much of the strength of the leading gun rights organization the nra comes from its broad and passionate membership base and its mastery of grassroots politics but if lawmakers seem to tiptoe around gun issues that could be in part because the nra and other gun rights groups are loaded for bear with a seemingly limitless stash of cash ammunition gun rights interests gave more than 75 1 million to federal candidates parties and outside spending groups from 1989 through the third quarter of 2022 with 90 of the funds contributed to candidates and parties going to republicans the nra is consistently the top contributing organization among gun rights groups during the 2018 midterm elections gun control groups outspent the nra for the first time by a 2 6 million margin but gun control groups total 23 5 million in 2020 election spending was dwarfed by the nra s spending that cycle and gun rights groups outspent gun control advocates during the 2022 midterm elections the nra spent 13 3 million during the 2022 midterms that s as much money as gun control groups spent during the 2022 election cycle but down significantly from the 29 1 million spent in 2020 federal elections most of that 2020 spending went to support trump in the final months of the cycle with around 19 5 million of that spending bankrolled by its newly created nra victory fund super pac and 9 million by its traditional pac just four years earlier the group spent 54 4 million during the 2016 election cycle breaking the group s prior spending records of that 31 2 million went to supporting trump s first presidential campaign most of the nra s 2016 spending was routed through its main 501 c 4 dark money group which does not disclose its donors during the 2018 election cycle the nra made around 9 4 million in outside expenditures a significant decrease from the 27 million spent during the 2014 midterm election cycle and a massive drop from its 2016 presidential election spending gun control interests by comparison have generally been a blip on the radar screen they ve emerged as a greater political force in recent cycles however those interests gave 54 2 million to candidates and party committees from 1989 through the third quarter of 2022 with nearly all of that going to democrats despite being dwarfed by gun rights lobbying and campaign contributions gun control groups have increased outside spending since the 2018 election cycle gun control advocates poured 16 6 million into outside spending in 2020 compared to just 14 000 in 2016 table top 20 recipients of funds from gun control interests among members of congress 1989 2022

during the 2022 cycle independence usa pac a super pac backed by bloomberg says it supports a variety of causes including stricter gun laws after spending a whopping 56 5 million on the 2020 election

owners of america have poured millions into lobbying campaign contributions and outside spending to advocate for the right to bear arms at least 81 4 million americans owned guns in 2021 gun rights groups are still powerful in the realm of lobbying consistently spending more money to influence policy than gun control organizations gun rights groups spent a record 15 8 million on lobbying in 2021 and have invested 196 5 million in lobbying efforts since 1998 gun rights advocates spent more than 121 1 million of that total since 2013 lobbying by gun rights advocates nearly tripled in 2013 after a gunman murdered 26 people including 20 children at sandy hook elementary on dec 14 2012 the following year was the closest the senate came to passing meaningful gun control legislation in the decade between the shooting and the bipartisan gun control bill groups advocating for gun control spent a record 2 9 million in 2021 but gun control advocates spearheaded by giffords and everytown for gun safety spent just 30 1 million on lobbying from 1998 through the third quarter of 2022 about six and a half times less than gun rights groups spent over the same period taylor giorno anna massoglia

washington ap focused on relentlessly rising prices president joe biden plotted inflation fighting strategy tuesday with the chairman of the federal reserve with the fate of the economy and his own

other prices whiles still insisting an independent fed will act free from political pressure like biden the fed wants to slow inflation without knocking the u s economy into recession a highly sensitive mission that is to include increasing benchmark interest rates this summer the president said he would not attempt to direct that course as some previous presidents have tried my plan to address inflation starts with simple proposition respect the fed respect the fed s independence biden said the sit down on a heat drenched late spring day was biden s latest effort to show his dedication to containing the 8 3 leap in consumer prices over the past year rising gas and food costs have angered many americans heading into the midterm elections putting democrats control of the house and senate at risk biden is running out of options on his own his past attempts oil releases from the strategic reserve improving port operations and calls to investigate price gouging have fallen short of satisfactory results high prices have undermined his efforts to highlight the low 3 6 unemployment rate leaving a growing sense of pessimism among americans tuesday s meeting was the first since powell was renominated in november by biden to lead the central bank and came two weeks after his confirmation for a second term by the senate it also represented something of a reversal

european union has agreed to cut off 90 of its oil purchases from russia that will force the eu to buy more oil from elsewhere and it drove oil prices to 115 a barrel tuesday this was only the fourth meeting between the president and the federal reserve chair though powell breakfasts as often as once a week with treasury secretary janet yellen who also attended tuesday s meeting along with brian deese the white house national economic council director ahead of the meeting biden suggested that he and powell were aligned on addressing inflation my predecessor demeaned the fed and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation biden said in an op ed posted monday by the wall street journal i won t do this i have appointed highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution i agree with their assessment that fighting inflation is our top economic challenge right now in contrast president donald trump

cause layoffs raise the unemployment rate and even tip the economy into recession amid worries that the u s economy may repeat the high persistent inflation of the 1970s the cooperation between biden

and spending may push the economy into recession that concern has caused sharp drops in stock prices in the past two months though markets rallied last week biden in his op ed indicated that the record setting pace of job creation in the aftermath of the pandemic would slow dramatically suggesting more moderate levels of 150 000 jobs per month from 500 000 that he said would be no warning of weakness but a sign that we are successfully moving into the next phase of recovery as this kind of job growth is consistent with a low unemployment rate and a healthy economy

the simplicity and transparency of the oracle of omaha s investing strategy has led to an average annual return of 20 1 over 57 years you could rightly say that berkshire hathaway brk a 0 59 brk b 0 74 ceo warren buffett knows a thing or two about investing in the stock market since becoming ceo in 1965 he s led berkshire s class a shares brk a to an average annual return of 20 1 and created almost 690 billion in value for shareholders himself included on an aggregate basis buffett has overseen a greater than 3 600 000 increase in his company s share price in 57 years berkshire hathaway s share price could plummet 99 tomorrow and it would still be handily outperforming the s p 500 including dividend payouts since the beginning of 1965 but perhaps the greatest aspect of buffett s success isn t his vast outperformance so much as the transparency and simplicity of the strategy that s allowed him and his shareholders to flourish what follows are the 10 reasons warren buffett has been such a successful investor for nearly six decades as berkshire s ceo 1 the oracle of omaha lets his winners run over the long term despite generating a 20 1 average annual return over 57 years buffett isn t infallible berkshire hathaway has had down years and will almost certainly have negative return years in the future but one of his many keys to outperformance has been allowing his winners to run over long periods winning stocks like beverage giant coca cola credit servicer american express credit ratings agency moody s and insurer globe life have been continuous holdings since 1988 1993 2000 and 2001 respectively 2 he tends to gravitate to cyclical companies and industries to build on the previous point the oracle of omaha absolutely loves to buy cyclical stocks by cyclical i mean companies that perform well when the economy is expanding and struggle when it s contracting even though recessions are inevitable periods of expansion last considerably longer rather than trying to guess when a recession might occur buffett has set berkshire hathaway s portfolio up to benefit from these disproportionately long periods of expansion and the natural growth of the u s and global economy over time 3 brand name time tested businesses are popular buys another reason for buffett s incredible success is his willingness to invest in brand name time tested businesses while management teams come and go buffett is well aware of the power behind branding and a loyal customer base for instance apple aapl 2 19 is one of the most recognized brands in the world and it has an exceptionally loyal customer base apple has relied on product innovation to control the lion s share of the u s smartphone market and is in the process of reinventing itself to emphasize subscription services moving forward after generating 116 4 billion in operating cash flow over the past 12 months the data suggests apple s strategy is working 4 meanwhile potential fads and momentum plays are often avoided equally important is buffett s avoidance of trends and investments that can be viewed as fads although next big thing investments such as genomics 3 d printing cannabis and blockchain technology have offered incredible growth potential these trends have also endured large bubble bursting events buffett has been particularly critical of crypto blue chip bitcoin btc 4 88 stating that if you owned all of the bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for 25 i wouldn t take it the oracle of omaha prefers businesses with longevity that produce something in buffett s view bitcoin is a major red flag because it doesn t produce anything 5 buffett focuses on sectors and industries he knows well a fifth reason for warren buffett s success is his narrow research focus instead of trying to understand a little bit about every sector of the market the oracle of omaha aims to be highly knowledgeable in a few sectors and industries in particular buffett has a keen eye for spotting value and well rounded businesses in the financial energy and consumer staples sectors peruse berkshire hathaway s portfolio and its owned acquired assets and you ll find plenty of banks insurance companies energy providers and food beverage companies financial stocks have been buffett s go to for decades 6 he leans on his investing team for sectors industries outside his comfort zone warren buffett realizes he can t cover the entire stock market which is why he relies on his investment team to help him out in the sectors and industries he doesn t have a firm grasp on this team includes right hand man charlie munger as well as investing lieutenants todd combs and ted weschler combs and weschler have often been leaned on for their expertise in tech and healthcare however a recent example of their investing prowess can be seen in berkshire s kroger position buffett s company is sitting on hearty gains thanks to one or both investing lieutenants recognizing that covid 19 and inflation would ultimately turn out to be a positive for the nation s largest grocery chain 7 berkshire s portfolio is relatively concentrated in spite of holding stakes in more than four dozen securities berkshire hathaway s portfolio is concentrated in just a small handful of stocks apple bank of america bac 0 45 chevron cvx 0 86 coca cola and american express combine to account for 72 2 of the nearly 343 billion investment portfolio further berkshire s top 10 holdings make up 85 3 of invested assets warren buffett has long believed that diversification is only necessary is you don t know what you re doing with a narrow research focus and plenty of help from his investing lieutenants in other areas of the market outside of his comfort zone it s plainly evident that buffett and his team feel confident in their research 8 buffett buys when others are fearful yet another reason for buffett s long term outperformance is his inability to be scared away from market corrections bear markets and complete meltdowns whereas it s common for investors emotions to bait them into poor decision making during market downturns buffett chooses to be greedy when others are fearful as an example the oracle of omaha invested 5 billion into preferred stock of bank of america in 2011 bofa was struggling mightily at the time under the weight of legal settlements following the housing crash since then buffett has pivoted this initial investment as well as subsequent buys into a nearly 38 billion stake in bank of america today bofa is highly profitable and returning boatloads of capital to its shareholders 9 buffett s company is a passive income powerhouse speaking of returning capital to shareholders buffett s success is also due to his company collecting massive amounts of passive income each year taking into account an active first quarter that saw buffett and his team make a number of investments berkshire hathaway appears to be on track to collect more than 6 billion in dividend income over the next 12 months integrated oil and gas stock chevron is currently berkshire s golden goose for dividends with 904 1 million expected to be collected over the next year chevron is benefiting from multidecade highs in crude oil and natural gas and can rely on its midstream e g transmission pipelines and storage and downstream assets refineries and chemical plants if crude and natural gas prices back significantly off their highs 10 he s a big believer in share buybacks lastly buffett and munger have invested heavily in what s clearly their favorite stock on the planet their own company since berkshire s board of directors introduced new share repurchase parameters in july 2018 the oracle of omaha has green lit 61 1 billion worth of buybacks buying back stock tends to have a positive impact on the share price of companies that are profitable on a recurring basis by reducing the number of shares outstanding earnings per share tends to climb over time this can make a stock appear more fundamentally attractive thereby lifting its share price this transparent strategy is the secret sauce that s allowed warren buffett to run circles around the s p 500 for decades

assessing eight years of government in terms of economic performance beyond jobs and income representational image pixabay as the narendra modi led government completed three years during this lok sabha and cumulatively eight years since modi first became prime minister in 2014 there have been many articles assessing the government s performance such assessments can be done through the social political or economic lens on the former we can look at the metrics of social mobility and empowerment social cohesion and reduction in social tensions enhancement of law and order and feeling of safety and so on from the political lens we can look at stability and evidence of the political will to enforce difficult decisions for the economic lens which is the topic that this column will cover it is metrics like generation of jobs rise in people s incomes and price stability these are the main variables that affect most people s daily lives people care about economic well being and opportunities to rise especially for their young ones the non income related variables are education and health one can examine many other indicators which are indirectly related to job creation and income rising these could be exports investment savings stock markets the foreign inflow of investment rising stock of foreign exchange and so on we will not undertake a detailed analysis of how various conventional economic indicators have behaved in the past eight years suffice to say that eight years ago india was emerging from an externally induced shock called taper tantrum and internally caused stress due to high inflation and perceptions of high scales of corruption perhaps voters were unhappy with the perceived scale of corruption remember the three year movement called india against corruption and were also worn out with the prevailing double digit inflation the taper tantrum refers to the phenomenon that the united states had started to taper its monetary expansion leading to an instinctive and massive outflow of dollars from developing countries which in turn caused their currencies to crash and the indian rupee was one of them this led to much macroeconomic vulnerability hence the term victims of the taper tantrum but beyond the trajectory of variables like gdp jobs and incomes is the somewhat qualitative aspect of the resilience of the indian economy the term resilience is difficult to quantify as compared to the number of jobs or rupees of investment or percentage of growth in gdp the term resilience refers to the ability of the economy to withstand economic shocks be they internal or external for instance 1991 was an external shock caused by the first gulf war and the steep rise in oil prices because india s macroeconomic fundamentals were weak i e very high inflation very low stock of foreign exchange and negative growth in the industrial sector and very high fiscal deficit the country almost went to the brink of default this meant that the economy was not resilient enough similarly in earlier decades whenever there was an adverse shock from the weather front like failed monsoons or drought the agricultural output and incomes would suffer and so would the economy this too is an example of inadequate resilience thankfully the agricultural sector is much less vulnerable to weather shocks thanks to better irrigation systems integration of markets domestically and internationally and diversification of sources of income for farmers away from agricultural commodities to animal husbandry and the services economy in the past eight years the economy has suffered major adverse shocks both internal and external there have also been positive shocks although one can debate whether these should be called positive shocks or windfall gains the positive shock was a steep fall in oil prices worldwide by more than fifty per cent and they stayed low for nearly two years the internal negative shocks were the big crash of a large non bank finance company nbfc called infrastructure leasing and financial services limited ilfs in september 2018 two years prior to that was the sudden announcement of the banning of high denomination notes i e demonetisation of nearly 86 per cent of the currency in circulation and a third internal shock which was not sudden and somewhat diffused was the clumsy implementation of the rollout of the goods and services tax a major tax reform that made the entire country shift to a completely different tax regime one of the more recent external shocks has been the pandemic caused by covid which has affected us for more than two years and now the war in ukraine these are of great magnitude for they have affected the entire global economy beyond these six shocks there are several smaller scale ones like the severe floods and natural disasters hurricane induced evacuations and so on there was also another generalised shock since the trump presidency of a receding of globalisation and a fall in the volume of world trade this negative sentiment can hurt exporting nations like india which depends on strong exports to aid domestic growth india also took some shock like decisions like walking out of a free trade agreement called rcep at the last moment in november 2019 the resilience of the economy is a measure of how well the economy was able to cope with these negative shocks the short answer is quite well in earlier times each of these shocks would have caused the economy to flounder but now there is sufficient resilience in the form of diversification of economic activity safety buffers in terms of stock of food or forex and well funded welfare schemes which do not allow the economy to go off the rails an example of the latter is the free food scheme that has been running for more than two years and has protected a large section of india s public from food inflation and ensured food security this has prevented an income and jobs crisis caused by the pandemic from becoming a food crisis the contrast with neighbouring sri lanka and pakistan is quite stark and displays the relative lack of resilience in their respective economies resilience is not built overnight but is the effect of cumulative economic policies on this count certainly the indian economy has come a long way though there is no cause for complacency the dark clouds of war and inflation do have this silver lining dr ajit ranade is a noted economist
