collectively the non gaap financial measures are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with u s gaap the non gaap financial measures are not measurements of our financial performance under u s gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with u s gaap we define ebitda as net income before interest expense net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization we define adjusted ebitda as ebitda further adjusted for non cash charges related to equity based compensation programs acquisition transaction costs and other expenses certain severance relocation and related costs loss on debt extinguishment foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other unusual or one time items adjusted ebitda margin is calculated as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales we define adjusted net income as net income attributable to funko inc adjusted for the reallocation of income attributable to non controlling interests from the assumed exchange of all outstanding common units and options in fah llc for newly issued shares of class a common stock of funko inc and further adjusted for the impact of certain non cash charges and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance these items include among other things non cash charges related to equity based compensation programs acquisition transaction costs and other expenses certain severance relocation and related costs loss on debt extinguishment foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other unusual or one time items and the income tax expense benefit effect of these adjustments we define adjusted earnings per diluted

issued shares of class a common stock of funko inc and 2 the dilutive effect of stock options and unvested common units if any we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of the non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors because not all companies and analysts calculate the non gaap financial measures in the same manner we present the non gaap financial measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry management believes that investors understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non gaap financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations management uses the non gaap financial measures as a measurement of operating performance because they assist us in comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent basis as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our core operations for planning purposes including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget and financial projections as a consideration to assess incentive compensation for our employees to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies and to evaluate our capacity to expand our business by providing these non gaap financial measures together with reconciliations we believe we are enhancing investors understanding of our business and our results of operations as well as assisting investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic initiatives the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to or a substitute for net income or other financial statement data presented in this press release as indicators of financial performance some of the limitations are such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments such measures do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for our working capital needs such measures do not reflect the interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and other companies in our industry may calculate such measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures due to these limitations non gaap financial measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our u s gaap results and using these non gaap measures only supplementally as noted in the table below the non gaap financial measures include adjustments for non cash charges related to equity based compensation programs acquisition transaction costs and other expenses certain severance relocation and related costs loss on debt extinguishment foreign currency transaction losses gains and other unusual or one time items it is reasonable to expect that these items will occur in future periods however we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period do not directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of other companies over time each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described herein and in the reconciliation table below help management with a measure of our core operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day to day operations the following tables reconcile the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable u s gaap

time is running out on a senate plan to make permanent daylight saving time the law of the land the senate stunned everyone in march when members approved a bill by unanimous consent to shift the nation forward one hour year round without objection so ordered declared sen kyrsten sinema d ariz trying to suppress a smile as she presided over the stupefying vote to end the bi annual time change sinema then sounded like marv albert after bernard king drained a three pointer at madison square garden yes exclaimed sinema from the senate dais pulling her forearms toward her and clenching her fists in a sign of victory i think everyone was a little bit surprised that no one came down to object because they were all made aware of it said sen marco rubio r fla who wrote the bill i think there s growing support for the notion of this flipping back and forth makes no sense americans switch the clocks this weekend for the first time since the senate passed the daylight saving time bill eight months ago but the house of representatives isn t convinced that perpetual daylight saving time is an idea whose time has come the house hasn t touched the bill the senate bill will expire if the house doesn t align before the end of this congress 11 59 59 a m et on jan 3 2023 for the senate legislation you can almost see the grains of sand slipping through the neck of an hourglass until they all disappear that said this is the closest congress has come to implementing permanent daylight saving time in the u s in decades president richard nixon shifted the u s ahead an hour for two years during the 1970s opec oil embargo and once one body of congress approves a piece of legislation that often ripens the potential for passage in the other chamber the speaker s lobby protecting congress that s why standard time may be operating on borrowed time congress may not adopt a bill to go to daylight saving time all the time before the end of the 117th congress in fact it may take a few years but this issue is maturing why do we keep doing this back and forth thing groused rubio maybe there s a good reason but i don t think there is to be frank so why is congress involved in the setting of time at all article i section 8 of the constitution grants congress control of time via a provision to fix the standard of weights and measures lawmakers have tweaked time ever since in fact ben franklin was the first to propose a seasonal switch of the clocks to align better with the sun franklin suggested the practice would conserve candles believe it or not congress has only successfully overridden a presidential veto on 112 occasions in the history of the republic one of them was over a dispute between congress and president woodrow wilson about changing the clocks after world war i lawmakers last wrinkled time in 2004 congress adopted a massive energy policy bill buried in the legislation was a provision that reduced the period the u s spent on standard time from approximately six months to just four months that s why we now spring forward in march and fall back in november the time changes just to unfold in april and october respectively rep fred upton r mich crafted the language to change the time paul pelosi attack capitol police begin internal security review after officers missed break in halloween is the number one death day for your kids said upton he noted that the time change sometimes fell in october when various communities would hold beggar s night a week or two prior to halloween so you had one less hour of sunlight and you ve got little kids darting between cars in neighborhoods said upton we have the extra hour and it can show that it actually reduces crime because most crime is at night at dusk but sleep experts aren t sold on the time change dr beth malow of the sleep disorders division at vanderbilt university medical center says choosing one time or another would be better overall but malow dislikes a permanent shift to daylight saving time we re off cycle for an hour for almost eight months out of the year said malow we re changing our clocks but we re not changing the light there are also questions about the economic impact of switching the clocks twice a year the general thesis is that adjusting the clocks for summer gave people more daylight ninety nine percent of your population is awake and moving around and about at that time of the day and they can use the sun to help them said university of washington law professor steve calandrillo commerce and most economic and business interests do favor the uniform permanent daylight saving time because they realize that more people are awake and want to go out and top and recreate and engage in activities in the early evening that s when we live our lives but it s debatable whether the time shift is truly lucrative us capitol police officers weren t watching live home security cameras when paul pelosi was attacked the dow the nasdaq and the s p 500 experienced negative returns the monday following both time switches said calandrillo you pick any random calendar day over the course of history it s a positive expected value and yet the expected value is negative on the mondays following both clock changes that will show that people hate when you mess up their sleep cycles they re in a bad mood and that affects the stock market some have wondered if it may be better to rely on local time standards rather than a sweeping national mandate from congress for instance st paul minn and minneapolis used to operate on different clocks the mississippi river carved a temporal border between the twin cities geography probably plays more of a role than politics says malow this is a nonpartisan issue because it s really about where you live that s why residents in the north or extreme ends of time zones worry about a change that would make it get dark too early or light too late it can be really disruptive to us said malow they feel off cycle off kilter and they just want to be done with it click here to get the fox news app there s only a finite amount of light and dark to go around regardless of the season or where you live if congress doesn t change the time change we re stuck with the time changing as they say time waits for no one the least of which is the u s congress

there are no alternatives to ensure a reliable supply of water except for the desalination project the report also includes several conditions to ensure that the project s potential impacts to coastal resources and low income ratepayers are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible we have worked for the last 10 years with community advocates and stakeholders cutting edge researchers coastal experts and industry leading engineers to develop a solution that meets the community s needs moreover this project will ensure the most vulnerable among us have access to safe affordable water if approved by the commission this project would end a decades long water supply crisis that has affected the peninsula since the 1990s limited the building of affordable housing and impacted equitable access to safe water for too long in 2009 the state water resources control board issued a cease and desist order that placed a building moratorium in much of the area exacerbating the local housing crisis for working families including military families stationed in the area and workers in the hospitality industry today s news is a relief for the tens of thousands of residents and businesses who have been worried about the future of their water supply said yvette padilla a castroville community leader limited water supply has resulted in a building moratorium that has restricted the expansion of affordable housing has stifled economic growth in the region and has left residents living under the constant threat of water rationing for far too long the coastal commission staff recommendation to approve the mpwsp is the right decision to help our community move forward the project has undergone extensive public review since it was proposed to the california public utilities commission in 2012 including numerous stakeholder meetings and public hearings before multiple state and local government agencies california american water has held more than two dozen additional meetings and community workshops and conducted further extensive outreach to stakeholders in the region over the last four months to gather additional feedback and inform the public about the project in response to

inflation is a major issue on voters minds before the 2022 midterm elections where all 435 house seats and dozens of senate seats are on the ballot norfolk va in 2022 you re probably feeling it everything is more expensive that includes filling up your car s tank and buying food at the grocery store as the covid 19 pandemic subsided inflation made it harder to make ends meet for people in the united states and the rest of the world inflation is a major issue on voters minds before the 2022 midterm elections where all 435 house of representatives seats and dozens of senate seats are on the ballot republicans who are looking to retake control of congress from the democrats made inflation a talking point by blaming president joe biden and democratic leaders democrats have responded by highlighting laws they ve passed aimed at helping americans withstand inflation while blaming the economic impact on russia s war in ukraine inflation is a complicated and global issue that deserves context outside of political talking points so 13news now spoke with two economists from hampton roads to break it down vinod agarwal an economics professor at old dominion university in norfolk he s the deputy director of odu s dragas center for economic analysis and policy an economics professor at old dominion university in norfolk he s the deputy director of odu s dragas center for economic analysis and policy nathaniel throckmorton an economics professor at william mary in williamsburg to truly see where this began let s time travel to 2020 when covid 19 was spreading across the country and the resulting economic situation was uncertain to stop the spread of covid 19 businesses had to change the way they work or even close resulting in job losses and the threat of recession at one point in april 2020 the u s employment rate hit 14 7 a big jump from just 4 4 the month before higher demand low supply to keep the economy afloat in 2020 congress passed and then president donald trump signed two key pieces of legislation the cares act and the consolidated appropriations act caa in 2021 biden and a democratic controlled congress followed up with the american rescue plan act arpa these laws contained a variety of programs including direct stimulus payments to adults expanded unemployment benefits and the paycheck protection program ppp to keep employees on the payroll in other words the federal government under the trump and biden administrations pumped a lot of money into the economy both administrations sent out stimulus checks additionally the federal reserve the u s central bank expanded its monetary policy during the pandemic the most notable change being the drop in interest rates to nearly 0 these cuts are used to lower the cost of borrowing encouraging people and businesses to invest and spend money during economic slowdowns when covid 19 subsided and the economy opened up again people had money to spend people s spending behavior had also changed from services to goods during the pandemic they re not going out and spending on leisure and hospitality things so instead they re ordering stuff on amazon they re renovating their homes or they re buying new homes and buying more goods to go into those homes throckmorton explained when demand spiked prices went up because the supply couldn t keep up with the pace despite this agarwal argued stimulus was a good idea because the country was able to recover job losses due to covid 19 in two years time without the stimulus programs he believes it would have taken years to recover jobs in my opinion this was the right thing to do agarwal explained if they did not do this we would have had massive unemployment even today throckmorton believes if the stimulus programs never happened the price of goods wouldn t have increased as rapidly but the unanswerable question is how much less supply chains labor markets when demand spiked supply couldn t keep up for a major reason supply chain bottlenecks an august analysis from the new york fed s liberty street economics concluded that stimulus and other demand factors wouldn t have driven inflation as high as it became without supply constraints being an issue as well several factors played into the bottleneck including a spike in covid 19 outbreaks and cases in a particular place pandemic business closures and a shortage of workers covid 19 affected different countries in the world at different times creating what has come to be known as supply chain shocks agarwal explained so essentially what you have is demand continued to rise supply simply did not keep pace supply actually decreased on top of the supply chain issues throckmorton explained that the pandemic led to unprecedented wage growth which increased costs for businesses even without the cares act and the other large fiscal policies we just had a large number of people leave and reenter the workforce throckmorton explained there s all this churning in the labor market and when people are looking for new work they re looking for a job that suits their needs and fits their lifestyle and benefits them for businesses to maintain profitability while paying people more they would have to raise prices which adds to inflation throckmorton said elevated gas prices you ve probably noticed pain at the pump something we ve all felt this year gas prices skyrocketed following russia s invasion of ukraine in february 2022 and the united states subsequent sanctions including a ban on russian oil imports the average price of unleaded gasoline hit its highest recorded point on june 14 at 5 016 a gallon but prices have since declined below 4 a gallon according to aaa data throckmorton explained that since the demand for gasoline is fixed any change in supply will affect prices quickly people need to get from point a to point b and they need to drive their cars and their trucks to work and we need trucks to transport goods across the country so there s just a fixed demand for oil throckmorton said he added that the energy markets are global and they respond to all different parts of what s going on in the world some other factors that have impacted gas prices in the u s are oil refinery issues and the opec alliance s decision to drastically cut oil production what can be done to fix inflation throughout 2022 the federal reserve has drastically raised interest rates in an effort to pump the breaks on inflation agarwal said the fed s goal is to decrease the demand for goods and services without slamming the breaks too hard what the federal reserve is trying to do is control demand bring it down slow it down agarwal explained for example he pointed out that when interest rates go up mortgage rates will go up which should decrease demand for housing and put downward pressure on prices agarwal added that the interest rate hike would also discourage people to spend money on credit cards or other loans which in turn decreases demand and could relieve supply chain issues throckmorton believes many of the economic issues we re seeing are out of our control but could resolve themselves over time

staff released its report yesterday recommending that the coastal commission approve the california american water monterey peninsula water supply project at a hearing on november 17 2022 the recommendation for approval comes with special conditions and modifications to the project that california american water is looking forward to implementing collaboratively with the california coastal commission the project as recommended will provide the region with the reliable drought proof water supply it urgently needs the coastal commission staff completed a comprehensive review and thorough report on the project said ian crooks vice president of engineering for california american water the staff report recognizes that historic drought conditions are making additional water supplies critical in the coming years and that there are no alternatives to ensure a reliable supply of water except for the desalination project the report also includes several conditions to ensure that the project s potential impacts to coastal resources and low income ratepayers are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible we have worked for the last 10 years with community advocates and stakeholders cutting edge researchers coastal experts and industry leading engineers to develop a solution that meets the community s needs moreover this project will ensure the most vulnerable among us have access to safe affordable water if approved by the commission this project would end a decades long water supply crisis that has affected the peninsula since the 1990s limited the building of affordable housing and impacted equitable access to safe water for too long in 2009 the state water resources control board issued a cease and desist order that placed a building moratorium in much of the area exacerbating the local housing crisis for working families including military families stationed in the area and workers in the hospitality industry today s news is a relief for the tens of thousands of residents and businesses who have been worried about the future of their water supply said yvette padilla a castroville community leader limited water supply has resulted in a building moratorium that has restricted the expansion of affordable housing has stifled economic growth in the region and has left residents living under the constant threat of water rationing for far too long the coastal commission staff recommendation to approve the mpwsp is the right decision to help our community move forward the project has undergone extensive public review since it was proposed to the california public utilities commission in 2012 including numerous stakeholder meetings and public hearings before multiple state and local government agencies california american water has held more than two dozen additional meetings and community workshops and conducted further extensive outreach to stakeholders in the region over the last four months to gather additional feedback and inform the public about the project in response to community input california american water recently announced a phased approach to the project to better fit the needs of the region including in marina where the project s source water slant wells will be located under this approach the first phase of the project would be built to produce 4 8 million gallons per day in the future california american water could seek approval to expand the project if needed to produce up to 6 4 million gallons per day california american water also has proposed additional affordability initiatives to ensure that customers needing financial assistance can afford access to adequate water for drinking sanitation and health needs in addition to these important project elements california american water has reaffirmed its commitment to renewable energy to ensure the desalination facility has net zero ghg emissions and to expand the existing groundwater monitoring network with the monterey county water

expression by ebere wabara the feeling is that many don t want to be seen to take a position which would be interpreted as confrontational and as such they have resulted resorted to lobbying prominent figures outside government to the actual name of the person expected to chairman chair preside over this occasion is wrong atimes right at times two words those who have the power to release the suspect but are passing the bulk buck to the courts should be informed that it is against the national interest to refuse to release the former minister of finance dr ngozi okonjo iweala explained

waist still on perfection americans talked about building a more perfect union while george orwell wrote that some animals are more equal than others we all know that perfect and equal are absolute superlatives some writers even write or refer to editorial comment of a newspaper or magazine hence grammarians say that the adjective is the enemy of the noun while the adverb is the enemy of the adjective copy and sub editors use words of strong impact and dramatic significance all for special effect and strong drama hence journalists write about bombshell instead of shocker or nasty shock or surprise packet this reminds me of what louis turner and jon ash wrote in their interesting book entitled the golden hordes on page 200 the financial backers of haiti s habitation leclerc a pleasure reserve include mick jagger alain delon the late aristotle onassis and other multinational business tycoons last year you also argued that business tycoon is tautologous i disagreed it is not in strict grammar end is correct but month end is not weekend is also correct end of the year is allowed but year end is not language can be fun but it is not always logical another special note annals of history is correct too example a great deal has been left unwritten in the annals of history but these phrases and words are incorrect i can t remember very great alright monies moslem quoran machineries very best level best possible best etc annals of history like a living witness or consensus of opinion is not pleonastic they are set phrases let me take this opportunity to restate the fact that centre round is incorrect to make ourselves understood clearly we must first make sure that each one of our words makes the right dictionary sense and if we can think of more than one word that makes the right dictionary sense then we can choose the one that we consider to be the most vivid and precise centre on upon or centre in for precision or exactness is the correct phrase known to standard english we also correctly say or write world war i world war ii not first world war second world war you must try to read andrew fergus book entitled what they are doing to your child at school it is an interesting educative book fergus made it known that all over the united kingdom traditionalists trads and trendies are fighting in classrooms over correct usage i am a traditionalist and l love everything that is old i am very happy when you remarked i have found out overtime that you have a deep attachment to some expressions especially those of celebrated and often archival authors and speakers the truth of the matter is that dr samuel johnson through his dictionary published in 1755 removed all improprieties and absurdities from the english language in short he like a number of current priests of usage and literary sophisticates became a linguistic legislator attempting to perform for english those offices performed for french by the french academy the current generation of collegians and university graduates are just literate literate enough to be dangerous they are not educated in the broad sense of the word besides they are killingly monolingual it is sad and saddening an awful lot of them can t write grammatical paragraphs as and when if and when are tautologous or pleonastic in these phrases one of the words in the pairs can be omitted however as at when is a piece of journalese besides it is the height of illiteracy to write as at when congrats is used in spoken or informal english congratulations on your success is correct white elephants are also called loop projects useless senseless crazy silly projects kaduna bomb victims for burial in on church premises we most certainly have not heard the last about the governor s convoy crash and the woes and blood it left in on its trail the huge confidence reposed on in them by the populace they are the products of what some people did or did not do over a period of time but whose

given the fog of war it is hard to know exactly how large the carnage is inside twitter as i write this the company s internal faq we can confirm says that roughly half of employees are being ousted by ceo co owner and sole director elon musk that would be a bloodbath with few precedents in tech history roughly 3 750 people in a single company in a single day musk took to twitter late friday to blame a massive drop in revenue due to activist groups pressuring advertisers and claimed that everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance in return for signing what exactly we don t know earlier reports suggested the severance offer was for one month former employees have launched a lawsuit noting a 60 day notice requirement in federal law we should caution that musk is a misinformation maven and noted troll that roughly 50 percent may end up being lower so musk can look kind by comparison he s busy threatening a thermonuclear name and shame of former twitter advertisers you can t accuse him of having consistent business logic here s what else we should caution even the horror of 3 750 firings isn t much compared to the tech sector as a whole which has shed or released plans to shed 52 000 employees since the beginning of 2022 here s the most complete list musk can probably boast of having the single largest firing round of the year in tech but new york s struggling bike with screen seller peloton has laid off more overall 4 084 since january a lot of the tech firings didn t make musk sized headlines in part because a lot of them were and are being carried out carefully and compassionately but they re happening nonetheless and the fog of war is everywhere in tech let s look for trend lines in the major firing incidents prior to twitter starting with the murkiest meta facebook s parent company which is ever more tightly controlled by mark zuckerberg in the wake of sheryl sandberg s leaving put as many as 15 percent of its workforce on performance improvement plans in october you may have seen a bunch of headlines suggesting zuck fired 15 percent of the company that s because employees expect the pips to lead to their eventual ouster we don t know if this is the case not yet zuck may consider it more seemly to cut headcount at the holidays when fewer people are paying attention to news memo to elon musk from your comrade in social media evil this is how you fire people without risking an instant federal lawsuit meanwhile meta has instituted a hiring freeze and rescinded a handful of job offers not great but not yet the same as pink slips it s worth pointing out meta has unique troubles apple nuked facebook s advertising model zuckerberg is losing billions on a vr dream his employees don t understand that don t apply to the industry as a whole but the industry as a whole is definitely trending the same way let s turn to that ancient bellwether microsoft hey remember the dot com crash of 2000 that stock market decline a long time coming thanks to overvalued startups was sparked by news that an antitrust judge had thrown the book at microsoft well the company isn t nearly as prominent in tech as it was in the bill gates era but it is still out there ahead of market trends the redmond washington based company did a quiet round of layoffs in october reportedly in the realm of 1 000 people but in an odd coincidence there s good news at microsoft china that division plans to increase its headcount by 1 000 according to a september announcement that news came despite china s generally weak economy and tough new u s restrictions on chip imports snap back in august the company formerly known as snapchat announced one of the year s deepest cuts around 1 200 workers or 20 percent of its total workforce that wasn t a surprise however snap may have been a social media icon back in the day but unlike twitter and facebook it never found a sustainable way to turn a profit one of the most telling signs that snap was circling the drain its stock price had already nosedived by around 80 quick reminder that twitter is now private there is no stock market pressure and the only reason it can t turn a profit now is the 13 billion debt that musk s buyout forced the company to put on its books everyone else musk wasn t the only one exploding an employment bomb in downtown san francisco this week the rideshare company lyft made a similar move it laid off nearly 700 people citing the coming recession so did a financial tech company called stripe laying off another thousand the cryptocurrency industry meanwhile has shed thousands this year perhaps more than any other sub group of tech firms we could go on but let s stick to the names you know intel which is struggling with slow pc sales and reportedly plans to cut thousands of jobs by the end of the year musk may have competition yet notably however we ve heard of hiring freezes but no major layoffs at major tech giants apple google and amazon the latter is in fact gearing up for the holiday season by hiring 1 500 workers other layoffs merely suggest a company grew too fast during that period where we were all in covid lockdowns using their products twilio a business communications platform said in september it would lay off 900 people but it also hired more than 4 000 since 2020 so you could call it a post pandemic correction if there weren t y know actual human livelihoods involved hiring and firing in the tech world beyond the u s seems to be offering the same mixed message ottawa based shopify also rapidly expanded during the pandemic now it s slashing 10 percent or 1 000 employees australian business software giant atlassian is currently trying to hire exactly the same number of people maybe these commonwealth countries can work on some kind of exchange in short the trend is that there is no trend not yet anyway tech companies are hunkering down in general but some are better placed than others

predictable polls focused pocketbook while latino voters lean democratic in the run up to us midterm elections soaring inflation makes their support less predictable and may compel a shift toward republican candidates analysts say inflation now at eight percent troubles latinos as it does all americans according to polls released before the november 8 vote in which president joe biden s democratic party faces heavy possible losses other issues the right to abortion gun control and a crisis over undocumented migrants are secondary polls show more than half of latinos intend to vote democratic in the vote for legislative seats while 30 percent support republicans higher than four years ago the surveys indicate what matters most to latino voters is inflation and many are ready to give republicans a chance rodrigo dominguez villegas director of research at the latino policy politics institute at the university of california at los angeles told afp sounding an alarm but a stampede of latino voters toward republicans hasn t been perceived in the election in which the 435 seat house of representatives a third of the 100 seat senate and some 30 state governorships are up for grabs he said the alarm for the democratic party is that if it doesn t retain its margin of support among latino voters it runs the risk of losing key tightly contested elections dominguez villegas added while latinos have historically supported democrats there is a large group who are swing voters who change preferences with each election and the republican party is targeting them he said latinos are not a monolithic group we have different origins with different aspirations and different problems said jaime florez hispanic communications director for the republican national committee florez cited three key areas the economy education and public safety but above all else at the moment is inflation economic issues affect us all independently of our country of origin the language that we speak many times even our economic condition because even rich people have lost enormous sums with the fall of the stock market he said a wrong assumption the republican party enjoys a perception that it handles economic issues better while some democratic leaders are accused of believing latinos will simply fall into line behind them they only run these get out the vote operations in the weeks before the election and expect that latinos will show up and support them and i think that s a wrong assumption geraldo cadava a history professor at northwestern university told afp while republics still trail democrats among latinos latinos have both voted for republicans in increasing numbers over the past few years and they have left the democratic party over the last few years cadava said the dynamic is complex he said but in part latinos are drawn to particular republican policies at the same time that they re abandoning democratic policies on a number of issues latinos are in sync with the democratic party said stephen nuno perez analyst and pollster with bsp research in terms of data points we continue to see strong support for policies that the democrats are pushing whether it s immigration reform abortion rights upwards of 70 percent taking action against climate change student debt relief gun safety all of these he said none of these are issues that we would call republican issues latinos are increasingly favor restrictive immigration reforms including building border walls cadava added historically say over the past 20 or 25 years about 15 percent of latinos would say that they support restrictive immigration reform cadava said but now support has climbed to 36 percent

islamabad pakistan on friday said to have secured about 13 billion in additional financial support from two traditional friends about 9bn from china and over 4bn from saudi arabia on top of assurances for about 20bn investments finance minister ishaq dar told journalists that during prime minister shehbaz sharif s recent visit to beijing the chinese leadership promised to roll over 4bn in sovereign loans refinance 3 3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about 1 45bn from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan the total worked out at 8 75bn they promised the security of financial support mr dar said and quoted chinese president xi jinping as telling mr sharif to don t worry we will not let you down mr dar said the pakistani delegation had four major engagements including meeting with the chinese president and the prime minister and the chairman of the national people s congress the country s legislature these would be rolled over whenever they reach maturity the minister said adding that about 200 million worth of commercial loans had already flowed in a few days back responding to a question mr dar said the chinese side had also agreed to fast track the processing for a 9 8bn high speed rail project main line 1 from karachi to peshawar and both sides would immediately trigger their respective teams another official said the two sides were hoping to arrange bidding for the project by december and negotiations for financing terms and conditions could follow once a bidder is selected mr dar said the karachi circular railway kcr and hyderabad karachi motorway projects were also taken up and the kcr would soon be in the implementation phase the minister said he had also suggested a part of outstanding dues of chinese power producers to be converted into overall debt stock and had already cleared about rs160bn in recent months responding to a question he said saudi arabia had also given a positive response to pakistan s request for increasing its financing by another 3bn to 6bn and doubling its deferred oil facility of 1 2bn the two heads worked out at 4 2bn and the finance minister said there was no delay except a month or so of processing time mr dar said saudi arabia had also agreed to revive the 10 12bn petrochemical refining project at gwadar for which he had been assigned by the prime minister to coordinate with respective ministries for finalisation on top of that the minister said pakistan was engaging saudi arabia in privatisation transactions like in lng power projects and shares in other entities to ensure non debt creating foreign inflows moreover the minister said another 1 4bn worth of inflows were almost mature including 500m from the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib and two world bank loans of 900m under the national harmonisation of general sales tax he said he had a positive meeting with the sindh chief minister to harmonise gst and the financing envelope could be settled amicably he noted that harmonising gst was important for world bank inflows to arrive in the country on the exchange rate the minister insisted that the rupee s real effective exchange rate reer was around rs194 per dollar even lower than rs200 he expected the stakeholders to also keep in mind the national interest instead of just outrageous profitmaking pakistan had been engaging with china and saudi arabia for financial support including rolling over maturing loans as part of arrangements for about 35bn putouts against debt and liabilities during the current fiscal year the minister parried a question relating to the extension in debt repayments of chinese independent power producers ipps as part of the 7th and 8th quarterly reviews of the international monetary fund pakistan and the imf had estimated total external financing needs at about 33 34bn but this did not include the requirements of flood damages the minister said the leadership of beijing based asian infrastructure investment bank aiib had welcomed pakistan s announcement of not seeking paris club debt rescheduling ensuring international bond payments on maturity and completing the ongoing imf programme last month mr dar made it clear that pakistan would rather seek to reschedule bilateral debt that now stands at around 27bn to secure greater breathing space in foreign loan repayments amid tight external account conditions rescheduling bilateral debt is fine he said at the time while ruling out the rescheduling of international debt from wealthy western nations under the paris club multilateral and international sovereign bonds talking to journalists on monday the minister said there was no point in paris club rescheduling because the overall debt to these creditors was no more than 11pc of total foreign debt and debt relief over the year would be less than 1 2bn paris club creditor countries generally comprise australia austria belgium canada denmark finland france germany ireland italy

pacific grove calif business wire the california coastal commission staff released its report yesterday recommending that the coastal commission approve the california american water monterey peninsula water supply project at a hearing on november 17 2022 the recommendation for approval comes with special conditions and modifications to the project that california american water is looking forward to implementing collaboratively with the california coastal commission the project as recommended will provide the region with the reliable drought proof water supply it urgently needs the coastal commission staff completed a comprehensive review and thorough report on the project said ian crooks vice president of engineering for california american water the staff report recognizes that historic drought conditions are making additional water supplies critical in the coming years and that there are no alternatives to ensure a reliable supply of water except for the desalination project the report also includes several conditions to ensure that the project s potential impacts to coastal resources and low income ratepayers are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible we have worked for the last 10 years with community advocates and stakeholders cutting edge researchers coastal experts and industry leading engineers to develop a solution that meets the community s needs moreover this project will ensure the most vulnerable among us have access to safe affordable water if approved by the commission this project would end a decades long water supply crisis that has affected the peninsula since the 1990s limited the building of affordable housing and impacted equitable access to safe water for too long in 2009 the state water resources control board issued a cease and desist order that placed a building moratorium in much of the area exacerbating the local housing crisis for working families including military families stationed in the area and workers in the hospitality industry today s news is a relief for the tens of thousands of residents and businesses who have been worried about the future of their water supply said yvette padilla a castroville community leader limited water supply has resulted in a building moratorium that has restricted the expansion of affordable housing has stifled economic growth in the region and has left residents living under the constant threat of water rationing for far too long the coastal commission staff recommendation to approve the mpwsp is the right decision to help our community move forward the project has undergone extensive public review since it was proposed to the california public utilities commission in 2012 including numerous stakeholder meetings and public hearings before multiple state and local government agencies california american water has held more than two dozen additional meetings and community workshops and conducted further extensive outreach to stakeholders in the region over the last four months to gather additional feedback and inform the public about the project in response to community input california american water recently announced a phased approach to the project to better fit the needs of the region including in marina where the project s source water slant wells will be located under this approach the first phase of the project would be built to produce 4 8 million gallons per day in the future california american water could seek approval to expand the project if needed to produce up to 6 4 million gallons per day california american water also has proposed additional affordability initiatives to ensure that customers needing financial assistance can afford access to adequate water for drinking sanitation and health needs in addition to these important project elements california american water has reaffirmed its commitment to renewable energy to ensure the desalination facility has net zero ghg emissions and to expand the existing groundwater monitoring network with the monterey county water resources agency to ensure that project operation does not harm local groundwater users about california american water california

in an exclusive interview published today by the murdoch media s australian prime minister anthony albanese vowed that his government would spend whatever is necessary to acquire long range missiles and other hi tech weaponry all of which would be critical for involvement in a us led war against china president joe biden right shakes hands with australian prime minister anthony albanese during the quad leaders summit meeting at kantei palace tuesday may 24 2022 in tokyo albanese condemned the previous liberal national government for allegedly moving too slowly to execute this vast expansion in military spending and accompanying shift in focus to blatantly target china according to the australian s foreign editor greg sheridan who conducted the interview he guaranteed repeatedly that the government would spend whatever was necessary to produce the defence force that could defend australia albanese declared to sheridan who has close ties to the us military and intelligence apparatuses yes yes we will do what is necessary to achieve it we ve made that very clear we ve been really upfront and we ll do what is necessary this is not optional it s necessary albanese and sheridan presented this vow as one of defending australia against an aggressive china in reality without any public consultation the australian population is being placed on the front line of a us war to reassert washington s hegemony over the indo pacific and prevent china from challenging us global dominance this agenda was reiterated in the latest us national security strategy released by the biden administration last month it proclaimed a decisive decade of geopolitical conflict between the major powers china was the only competitor with both the intent and increasingly the capability to reshape the international order something the us would stop at nothing to halt for washington the us nato war against russia in ukraine which threatens a nuclear catastrophe is a precursor to a war against china the biden administration is seeking to provoke beijing into military actions possibly over taiwan just as the us goaded the russian regime into a disastrous invasion of ukraine by installing a pro us government via a coup in 2014 and arming it to the teeth against russia in fact albanese was explicit in naming china as a supposed threat to australia and the source of strategic competition in the pacific china clearly has changed its posture in the region and that s something that we as a middle power in the region have to take account of he told sheridan strategic competition in the region informs our view of our relationships with nations in the region in that context albanese stated we need more weaponry that can actually make a difference he singled out long range missiles missile defences armed drones and cyber warfare weapons these would be capable of striking china or chinese forces or facilities in the region including the south china sea labor s prime minister castigated the previous government for continuing to orient the armed forces for land warfare following australia s recent military experience in iraq and afghanistan successive australian governments liberal national and labor alike backed politically and militarily the barbaric us invasions and occupations of those countries based on lies in a bid to assert us dominance over the strategic and resource rich middle east and central asia as he has since becoming party leader in 2019 albanese positioned labor as the author and therefore most committed partner of the us military alliance the curtin labor government initiated the alliance in 1941 during world war ii shifting from australia s previous reliance on british imperialism albanese aggressively rejected criticism from the chinese foreign ministry over the us decision to rotate at least six us b 52 nuclear capable strategic bombers through the australian air force base at tindal in the northern territory china warned of a regional arms race we made our decision in 1941 albanese said that was the right decision and our alliance with the us is the right partnership now the b 52 decision as the wsws stated marks a significant escalation of the militarisation of australia the indo pacific region and the world it involves ending australia s official nuclear free status that is reinforced by the construction of us fuel and ammunition depots at tindal and nearby darwin and a significant expansion of the us australian pine gap facility near alice springs in central australia which plays a central role in us military operations throughout eurasia this integration into us war plans began long before the supposed change in china s posture under xi jinping and washington s sudden professed concern for the people of taiwan where it backed a military dictatorship that fled the mainland after the chinese revolution of 1949 right up until the 1990s in fact albanese s government is taking to a new level the moves undertaken by the gillard labor government when it signed up to the obama administration s pivot to asia a vast military build up throughout the indo pacific directed against china that included rotating us marines now more than 2 000 through bases around darwin albanese gave no indication of the cash needed for the weaponry that can actually make a difference but it would be on top of the huge expenditure required by the aukus military pact with the us and uk unveiled in september 2021 after months of secretive discussions under the aukus treaty to which the labor government has committed itself unconditionally australia is buying and basing long range nuclear powered submarines and hypersonic missiles the proposed eight submarines alone are estimated to cost up to 171 billion underscoring the pace of the military buildup albanese said his government was not waiting for the final report of its defence strategic review due in march along with a decision on which us or uk submarines to buy he said cabinet s national security committee nsc has been actively involved in the review and a parallel study into the aukus submarine program the nsc meets almost weekly sometimes more often albanese said we have received reports from the two reviews on the way through an editorial in today s australian praised albanese for responding to the growing interest of the us in the strategic value of northern australia despite fiscal restraint in the government s first budget last week albanese was determined to acquire the assets australia needs to defend ourselves but also to project force last week s budget was labor s first instalment in boosting military outlays and slashing social spending to do so military spending will increase by 8 percent this financial year continuing growth from 34 billion in 2016 to 70 billion by 2030 these figures will be dwarfed by what is to come albanese s pledge to spend whatever is required on this militarisation stands in stark contrast to his government s refusal in last week s vicious budget to provide cost of living relief despite soaring inflation and its insistence on cutting public hospital and other social services billions of dollars more are to be poured into the us instigated war drive while the labor government satisfies the demands of the global financial markets for budget repair even as sky rocketing prices and interest rates threaten millions of people with financial hardship and potential defaults on home loans this militarisation is largely occurring covertly in australia and internationally because the governments know that workers and young people oppose war and austerity this popular hostility must be developed into a conscious political movement of the international working class aimed at halting the catastrophe that capitalism is preparing that is the basis for the call issued by the international youth and students for social equality the student and youth movement of the socialist equality parties for the building of a mass global movement of young people to demand an immediate end to the us nato proxy war in ukraine and the reckless escalation toward world war iii
international literature is what my store aims to share with my customers and my community says linda alvarado arce owner of people called women a mobile feminist bookstore out of toledo ohio alvarado arce is heading to this year s guadalajara international book fair fil as one of three recipients of books across borders travel fellowships i don t think i would have been able to attend this fair without the fellowship it was such a beautiful surprise in 2016 i founded books across borders then called bookselling without borders a bookseller travel fund aimed at helping u s booksellers visit trade fairs abroad our idea at the program s inception was simple by expanding and strengthening global connections in the literary and bookselling community it could empower booksellers to access understand and more effectively promote international and diverse titles booksellers so our thinking went who were better connected with their global counterparts and with the international book trade would also be in a better position to put books by international voices into the hands of their customers in the u s in its inaugural year the program sent one brave bookseller from bozeman mont on a whirlwind visit to the world s biggest trade book fair in frankfurt germany after that the publisher funded initiative grew rapidly and in the first five years we provided travel fellowships to 45 booksellers from stores big and small urban and rural in more than 20 states in addition to funding fellowships to international book fairs bab also introduced weekslong bookseller residencies in rome and india and by 2020 it was working with partners abroad to bring foreign booksellers to the u s on a sort of exchange program a bookseller fulbright if you will there seemed to be no limit to the opportunities for travel learning and exchange that bab could profitably provide booksellers in the future everything came to a halt however in march 2020 when covid 19 stopped bab in its tracks after an initial period of adjustment the program used the cessation of travel to do some housekeeping first by forming a 501 c 3 nonprofit and then by relaunching as the pandemic and travel restrictions stretched into fall 2020 and then 2021 we scrambled to keep the network of contacts and the community of like minded booksellers alive via online events podcasts newsletters and much more while these activities were necessary and meaningful it was always the person to person contact the travel the experience of being lifted out of one s routine and put down in a different country immersed in different ways of thinking about the world of books and the cultures of reading that made the program special only recently have we been able to get back to that core mission now thanks to continuing support from our publisher partners and ingram content group and in partnership with publishers weekly bab is back and supporting three travel fellowships in 2022 there are plans to grow the number of fellowships to about a dozen in 2023 with applications opening in january a curated itinerary of events and meetings caters to individual bookseller needs and requests at each of the fairs that bab works with this year alvarado arce will travel with verlean singletary and luis correa to fil it s my first ever book fair alvarado arce says i am hoping to learn things that i do not know to gather new ideas and to build friendships with other booksellers that will assist me in my bookselling journey i know i have quite a big blind spot when it comes to international voices says correa who is operations manager at avid bookshop a curated and community driven store in athens ga as much as i try not to be swayed i m still very influenced by the marketing of american publishers i ve had my heart set on attending fil ever since i first learned about this fellowship and i m expecting it to be a completely eye opening experience singletary s da book joint is a bipoc owned store in a refurbished shipping container in the bronzeville area of chicago we specialize in black and brown titles she says we want to show our children that people who look like them write books and those books have characters who look like them i want to provide the titles that are in demand in my community and learn about literature from other countries and this fellowship will give me an opportunity to do so both singletary and correa believe they can learn a lot by attending fil with its large offerings of spanish language publications and over 1 000 hours of author and professional events international literature particularly from latin america is very important to me as it helps me explore my own heritage and a world history that i was not taught in school correa says avid s customers tend to value diversity and while we re a general bookstore carrying a wide range of titles our inventory is driven by our booksellers tastes in my case that means that we stock a lot of queer books and works in translation at the fair in guadalajara i d love to get in touch with anyone who is doing work with queer literature in latin america today bab is supported by its industry and media partners and by partner publishers catapult counterpoint soft skull europa editions histeria books other press princeton university press two lines northsouth books and the independent publishers caucus we hope to expand both the pool of supporters and the range of activities in 2023 michael reynolds is the editor in chief of europa editions and the founder of books across borders return to

trend in the making with cpi and uofm ahead recommended by john kicklighter building confidence in trading get my guide the erosion of risk trends via s p 500 paired against the uncomfortable stoicism of vix the federal reserve managed to extend the market s anxiety rather than offer the relief many were expecting after various peers throttled back on their inflation fight while chairman powell and other fed members speaking soon after the fourth 75 basis point bp rate hike was announced were making the effort to throttle back expectations for further front loading of monetary policy big rate hike in other words the warning that a longer regime of tightening would take its place was quick to follow whether or not that is an improvement in course or not for risk trends remains to be seen but the seasonality may be a market force that shores up the bias for bullish drift notably this past week the s p 500 my preferred imperfect measure of convenient risk update ended with a friday rally following four days slide that said the overall week rendered a slide that reversed from the midpoint of the august to october bear leg i don t see enough here to suggest conviction is solidifying among the speculative rank chart of s p 500 with 20 and 100 day smas volume and 1 day rate of change daily chart created on tradingview platform while the benchmark s p 500 is essentially chopping in a range established over the past weeks between the broader bear trend of 2022 and the ever persistent pressure of speculative hope the internal dynamics of risk appetite continue to erode i believe it is important to look at sentiment through both breadth and depth looking for sentiment through a wider picture global indices seemed to firm up relative to the s p 500 through friday while emerging market junk bonds and even carry trade firmed that is a very tentative jog higher and it comes notably with very limited fundamental backdrop for the larger market participants to draw from but the anticipation will be building with the additional seasonal expectations around the 45th week of the year and november overall meanwhile i continue to monitor the falling out of favor of the benchmarks treated as the torchbearers for risk trends beyond the s p 500 and its many derivatives the demand for top market cap stocks which happen to be the tech giants in the faang grouping has stood as a proxy for risk on and risk off that is a problem considering the nasdaq 100 dow ratio continued its collapse this past week chart of the nasdaq 100 dow ratio with 100 day sma and 1 weeky

recession risks financial crises or simply a strong reaction to the next major event eg the us cpi on thursday in fact with this past week s underlying market volatility around the fomc rate decision the vix volatility index continued its slide to account for a more than 20 percent retreat in the span of the last 20 trading days equivalent to one trading month we have yet to see anything that could be reasonably be construed as capitulation something i would consider akin to a surge for or above the 50 threshold thus far it has all been remarkably orderly despite the lows in the underlying

friday s volatility was extraordinary for a number of different reasons and markets one such surprise came from the us dollar on the final day of the trading week the dxy dollar index registered a 1 9 percent tumble the worst single day loss since december 3rd 2015 and before that march 18th 2009 seven years ago the spark for the index was the smaller than expected easing update from the ecb leveraging the dollar s largest counterpart higher temporarily with the march 2009 slump the catalyst was an explicit 75 basis point rate cut from the fed i wouldn t say anything of that same magnitude was on the radar through the end of the past week nfps was better than expected and thereby supports the fight against inflation but fed speak did remind that the policy path was moving away from large front loaded hikes and towards a longer path to a higher terminal rate when it comes to the us dollar i consider three major factors to be a boon to the currency its relative safe haven

president joe biden smiles as he walks onto stage after being introduced by taryne haskamp to speak about the chips and science act a measure intended to boost the semiconductor industry and scientific research at communications company viasat friday nov 4 2022 in carlsbad calif ap photo patrick semansky washington ap president joe biden has notched an envious record on jobs with 10 3 million gained during his tenure but voters in tuesday s midterm elections are far more focused on inflation hovering near 40 year highs that s left the president trying to convince the public that the job gains mean better days are ahead even as fears of a recession build presidents have long trusted that voters would reward them for strong economic growth but inflation has thrown a monkey wrench into the already difficult probability of democrats retaining control of the house and senate economic anxieties have compounded as the federal reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark interest rates to lower inflation and possibly raise unemployment mortgage costs have shot upwards while the s p 500 stock index has dropped more than 20 so far this year as the world braces for a possible downturn biden is asking voters to look beyond the current financial pain saying that what matters are the job gains that he believes his policies are fostering the government reported friday that employers added 261 000 jobs in october as the unemployment rate bumped up to 3 7 roughly 740 000 manufacturing jobs have been added since the start of biden s presidency a figure that the president says will keep rising because of his funding for infrastructure projects the production of computer chips and the switch to clean energy sources advertisement advertisement america is reasserting itself it s as simple as that biden said in a friday speech we also know folks are still struggling with inflation it s our number one priority yet the president is also warning that a republican majority in congress could make inflation worse by seeking to undo his programs and treating payments on the federal debt as a bargaining chip instead of an obligation to honor his challenge is that the party in power generally faces skeptical voters in u s midterms and inflation looms over the public mindset more than job growth if you have a job it s small comfort to know that the job market is strong if at the same time you feel like every paycheck is worth less and less anyway said pollster kristen soltis anderson inflation is such political poison because voters are reminded every day whenever they spend money that it is a problem we are experiencing advertisement advertisement as biden tries to fend off fears that inflation is causing the country to slide into a recession his chief evidence of the economy s resilience is the continued job growth as we see the economy as a whole we do not see it going into a recession white house press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters in anticipation of the latest jobs report going into the election biden and democrats are already at a disadvantage voters generally favor the party out of the white house in midterms giving republicans an automatic leg up when yale university economist ray fair looked at past elections his model forecast that democrats would get just 46 4 of the national vote largely because biden was in the oval office fair s analysis suggests that inflation basically erased the political boost that democrats could have gotten from strong economic growth during three quarters in 2021 even if the economy is top of mind for many voters the conflicting forces of past growth and high inflation cancel out each other advertisement advertisement this makes the democrats vote share roughly the same as suggested by the historical trend fair concluded but inflation compounds the obstacles for a president who has tried to convey optimism as he tours the country in the run up to the elections research in social psychology and behavioral economics generally shows that people often focus on the negatives and can block out the positives people pay more attention to bad news than to good news and are more likely to retain and recall bad news said matthew incantalupo a political scientist at yeshiva university incantalupo s research looks at how voters absorb economic news when unemployment is low as it is now he said voters generally think about jobs as a personal issue rather than a systemic one involving government policies but most think about inflation as a social problem beyond any person s control unless that individual happens to run the fed advertisement advertisement when it is high everyone experiences it at least a little bit and there really is no individual way to avoid it incantalupo said voters are going to look to government for remedies under those circumstances and in many cases that will result in them punishing incumbents even in the presence of other positive news about the economy republican candidates have specifically said biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package last year overheated the economy causing prices to rise alongside the job gains that they claim would have happened anyway as the pandemic receded they have also said that biden should have loosened restrictions on oil production in order to increase domestic output and lower gasoline prices house republican leader kevin mccarthy who could become speaker if the gop wins a house majority has hammered biden on high prices as biden has warned that republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election are a threat to democracy the california congressman countered that what voters care about are the costs of gas and groceries president biden is trying to divide and deflect at a time when america needs to unite because he can t talk about his policies that have driven up the cost of living mccarthy tweeted this past week the american people

mitaire mimi okumagba is the director of a united kingdom based okumagba invests ltd a company that assists nigerian businesses to raise capital directly from the london financial market for developmental projects across the country in this interview with chijioke iremeka okumagba who was among the royalties recently nominated for the stool of orosuen of the okere urhobo kingdom in warri delta state said global nature of financial market in london increases the odds for nigerian businesses to raise capital for projects the name mitaire mimi okumagba rings a bell in nigeria especially in the niger delta region but for the benefit of others who may not know could you share your background and upbringing with us i was born in lagos in 1967 during the nigeria civil war as the third child and first son of my late father chief michael peter okumagba and by virtue into the okumagba family of okere urhobo warri at the time my father was working at the central bank of nigeria cbn subsequently he was promoted to a comptroller and the family had to move with him to port harcourt as he was assigned to introduce the naira currency in that region of the country as well being a young boy developing through my primary and secondary education in port harcourt i was observing my father at home having meetings and sometimes business meetings relating to work in banking and in retrospect it was like marketing slash diplomacy around the mid 1980s my father decided that the family moves back to our homeland warri after years of his retirement it was during this years that i got to see and interact with my greater family and got to understand a lot about my heritage which is predominantly a rich farming and real estate legacy emanating from hard work and organisation from my late grandfather chief okumagba eboh this legacy continued with my father s generation at the helm notably by my late uncles chief daniel okumagba who had a successful political life and chief benjamin okumagba who later became orosuen king after the death of my father thereafter in 1986 i decided to create my path so i moved to london and had to work part time jobs to support my education at london college of communications after graduation i worked in an insurance company where realised my capabilities at sales and marketing later in 1996 i moved to texas usa where i had several years working in health and fitness industry it was in texas that i decided to start a family and i was blessed with two children being married to a british i had to return to london and be with my young family it was on my return to london that i had to use what i learned in college to found afiado a website development company which subsequently developed the website of the nigeria high commission to the uk i also co founded myheartlog with ken curwen whom i met networking as a member of the institute of directors iod in the financial district known as the city of london myheartlog was an online community site for heart rehabilitation support ken was rehabilitating from triple bypass heart operation after successful fundraising activities i was able to get myheartlog to receive funding as a support group for the british heart foundation that inspired me to add value to my homeland so i later moved to nigeria in 2014 and built the autoserve restaurant and bar warri complex it was at autoserve open mic sessions that i realised the abundance of raw talents in the country and a year later i organised the warrius music search to give young people a platform to showcase themselves after a successful years of warrius and seeing the transformation of some of the contestants i realised i ve laid a foundation for others at home to build upon so i returned to london in 2018 and i founded tinge group an environmental company with the vision of protecting the environment while employing young people into the sector in addition i have extended my investment company okumagba invests ltd based in london to assist nigerian business people who want to raise much needed capital directly from the city of london financial market the okumagba family of niger delta has been renowned for land farming and urban real estate development for decades would you say this has impacted the country s real estate sector especially the housing deficits in nigeria and food security i was fortunate to be born into my greater family as it led me to realise the importance of farming and cultivating the land thereby increasing peoples options of the development of real estate you are the director of okumagba invest ltd a company which provides funding support for infrastructural projects in africa through innovative means what necessitated its emergence and how can it impact the nigerian business environment my investment company okumagba invest ltd is based in london and the aim is to assist nigerian business people who want to raise much needed capital directly from the city of london financial market i realised from observation and experience doing business and attending meetings at institute of directors iod forum that the global nature of the financial market in london increases the odds for nigerian business people to raise capital here it s only six hours flight away it s the largest in volume and close proximity nigeria has historical ties with the uk with social media and technology you don t need a visa raising capital requirements are the same whether in nigeria or globally how does this fundraising work who can benefit from it what s the requirement is it for the government alone or across the board you have to prepare a business plan and a prospectus of your project any businessperson can approach the financial market here in london it can be a private or of a public project there are some for social interests investors who offer interest free or grants too you made a patriotic approach by rebranding the website of the nigeria high commission to the uk in 2009 which still functions till date how do you feel pulling this stride i felt very good about contributing to making life easier for people going to the high commission for passport and identity documentation it helps also for communication between the high commission and the greater public in the uk you were among candidates selected for the stool of orosuen of the okere urhobo kingdom in warri earlier what was your interest in the stool and how did the contest end yes i was proud to be nominated at the time however it became very contentious so withdrew to focus on other areas that can make impact for our people i would not re contest because it is something you are called in to be not contest for in my opinion you had a noble project in niger delta entertainment space but after warrius 2016 show a year after it was launched not much had been heard of the show what has become of this talent discovery platform after a successful years of warrius and seeing the transformation of some of the contestants i realised i ve laid a foundation for others at home to build upon in fact our first winner of 2015 is victor ad that became very famous and successful the aim of this musical showbiz was discovering talents of unprivileged youths residing in south south would you say this project met the essence yes we achieved what we aimed at which is to divert young people away from crime and desperation of their situation in the niger delta neglect victor ad is a good example that if young people were being given a platform or an opportunity to showcase what they are gifted in it would totally improve their lives and inspire others too warrius was inspired by the never give up attitude and the we nor go carry last mentality emanating from warri would you say you achieved this yes i can look at my life in retrospect that i m driven resilient and always thriving for excellence in where ever situation i find myself could you speak on your environmental and property maintenance ventures since i returned to london in 2018 i founded tinge group an environmental company with the vision of protecting the environment while employing young people into the sector in addition i have extended my investment company okumagba invests ltd to assist nigerian business people who want to raise much needed capital directly from the city of london

mobilisation in the russian federation is a sad sight hundreds of thousands of people uprooted from their homes and driven perhaps to their deaths the ruins of their former lives left behind ahead lies destruction and the mobilised soldiers are both the instruments and to a lesser extent the victims of it yet while this picture is almost universal there have always been wars in russia it always looks rougher more sentimental downcast peasants and boys herded into some dirty square in front of an unremarkable train station all wearing similar clothes and similar expressions on their faces as a sentimental tune plays in the background the brute force of the russian state doesn t only hit you where it hurts it does not recognise human life as such which is why the current authorities have no doubts no regrets the russian state as if following foucault s mantra of discipline and punish does not see any value in its current object of discipline and punishment the mobilised soldier instinctively the russian authorities are trying to fight against ukraine and the collective west with foreign hands hands that are different by virtue of their social class or national background the regime is trying to shift the dirty work of the war onto others whose existence in its eyes is purely functional as if the kremlin s war on ukraine was just like the upkeep of moscow where migrant workers from central asia sweep the streets and repair the roads oppression in today s russia is of course based on race ethnicity and religion but the most primitive class principle is its ultimate guiding force the other for the russian authorities is not so much a resident of dagestan or buryatia but a poor man whether a worker a peasant a teacher or a small entrepreneur he is the main instrument of the war but after ukraine he is also one of its main targets the other war at the beginning of october 2022 two russian independent media istories and cit conducted a joint investigation into who is most often taken to the war in ukraine the result confirms that russia s national republics and the poorest sections of its population provide the most soldiers for mobilisation indeed the kremlin s partial mobilisation really is partial in the sense that it has only targeted a part of the population on the basis of their social and national characteristics the ensuing exodus of middle class russians with higher education to kazakhstan or georgia only exacerbates this point

washington ap president joe biden has notched an envious record on jobs with 10 3 million gained during his tenure but voters in tuesday s midterm elections are far more focused on inflation hovering near 40 year highs that s left the president trying to convince the public that the job gains mean better days are ahead even as fears of a recession build presidents have long trusted that voters would reward them for strong economic growth but inflation has thrown a monkey wrench into the already difficult probability of democrats retaining control of the house and senate economic anxieties have compounded as the federal reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark interest rates to lower inflation and possibly raise unemployment mortgage costs have shot upwards while the s p 500 stock index has dropped more than 20 so far this year as the world braces for a possible downturn biden is asking voters to look beyond the current financial pain saying that what matters are the job gains that he believes his policies are fostering the government reported friday that employers added 261 000 jobs in october as the unemployment rate bumped up to 3 7 roughly 740 000 manufacturing jobs have been added since the start of biden s presidency a figure that the president says will keep rising because of his funding for infrastructure projects the production of computer chips and the switch to clean energy sources america is reasserting itself it s as simple as that biden said in a friday speech we also know folks are still struggling with inflation it s our number one priority yet the president is also warning that a republican majority in congress could make inflation worse by seeking to undo his programs and treating payments on the federal debt as a bargaining chip instead of an obligation to honor his challenge is that the party in power generally faces skeptical voters in u s midterms and inflation looms over the public mindset more than job growth if you have a job it s small comfort to know that the job market is strong if at the same time you feel like every paycheck is worth less and less anyway said pollster kristen soltis anderson inflation is such political poison because voters are reminded every day whenever they spend money that it is a problem we are experiencing as biden tries to fend off fears that inflation is causing the country to slide into a recession his chief evidence of the economy s resilience is the continued job growth as we see the economy as a whole we do not see it going into a recession white house press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters in anticipation of the latest jobs report going into the election biden and democrats are already at a disadvantage voters generally favor the party out of the white house in midterms giving republicans an automatic leg up when yale university economist ray fair looked at past elections his model forecast that democrats would get just 46 4 of the national vote largely because biden was in the oval office fair s analysis suggests that inflation basically erased the political boost that democrats could have gotten from strong economic growth during three quarters in 2021 even if the economy is top of mind for many voters the conflicting forces of past growth and high inflation cancel out each other this makes the democrats vote share roughly the same as suggested by the historical trend fair concluded but inflation compounds the obstacles for a president who has tried to convey optimism as he tours the country in the run up to the elections research in social psychology and behavioral economics generally shows that people often focus on the negatives and can block out the positives people pay more attention to bad news than to good news and are more likely to retain and recall bad news said matthew incantalupo a political scientist at yeshiva university incantalupo s research looks at how voters absorb economic news when unemployment is low as it is now he said voters generally think about jobs as a personal issue rather than a systemic one involving government policies but most think about inflation as a social problem beyond any person s control unless that individual happens to run the fed when it is high everyone experiences it at least a little bit and there really is no individual way to avoid it incantalupo said voters are going to look to government for remedies under those circumstances and in many cases that will result in them punishing incumbents even in the presence of other positive news about the economy republican candidates have specifically said biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package last year overheated the economy causing prices to rise alongside the job gains that they claim would have happened anyway as the pandemic receded they have also said that biden should have loosened restrictions on oil production in order to increase domestic output and lower gasoline prices house republican leader kevin mccarthy who could become speaker if the gop wins a house majority has hammered biden on high prices as biden has warned that republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020

iran acknowledged that it had sent drones to russia but said they were provided before the war began foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian foreign minister hossein amirabdollahian told reporters saturday that iran had provided a limited number of drones to russia months before the ukraine war and had not received any confirmation that they had been used in ukraine iran has repeatedly denied supplying moscow with drones to use in ukraine even as ukraine accused russia of using iranian made drones and u s officials said the united states had examined the wreckage of iranian made drones shot down in ukraine zelensky said that amirabdollahian s comments were a confession and that the world will make even more efforts to investigate the kremlin and iran he did not provide details on any such investigation but zelensky and that the world will make even more efforts to investigate the kremlin and iran he did not provide details on any such investigation but zelensky said in his nightly address saturday that his forces shot down 11 iranian made shahed drones on friday power restrictions were in place for residents in kyiv and other parts of ukraine on saturday the country s energy facilitator ukrenergo onsaturday the country s energy facilitator ukrenergo said in a statement as work to repair key energy infrastructure hit by russian attacks continues ukrenergo said it implemented more emergency energy restrictions for seven regions because saturday s energy consumption was up 6 2 percent from last saturday the group of seven announced the establishment of a coordination mechanism to help ukraine repair restore and defend its critical energy and water infrastructure it did not set a timeline for implementation but said it was important to act immediately given the onset of winter the pentagon announced additional support for ukraine on friday with a 400 million aid package that includes additional air defenses against russian attacks on critical infrastructure it also promised kyiv the refurbishment of 45 t 72 tanks for ukraine the first time washington has answered pleas from ukraine to provide for such weapons to be sent to the front lines as well as drones air defense missiles and riverine boats
biden stumps on job growth as voters dread inflation patrick semansky associated press washington president joe biden has notched an envious record on jobs with 10 3 million gained during his tenure but voters in tuesday s midterm elections are far more focused on inflation hovering near 40 year highs that s left the president trying to convince the public that the job gains mean better days are ahead even as fears of a recession build presidents have long trusted that voters would reward them for strong economic growth but inflation has thrown a monkey wrench into the already difficult probability of democrats retaining control of the house and senate economic anxieties have compounded as the federal reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark interest rates to lower inflation and possibly raise unemployment mortgage costs have shot upwards while the s p 500 stock index has dropped more than 20 so far this year as the world braces for a possible downturn biden is asking voters to look beyond the current financial pain saying that what matters are the job gains that he believes his policies are fostering the government reported friday that employers added 261 000 jobs in october as the unemployment rate bumped up to 3 7 roughly 740 000 manufacturing jobs have been added since the start of biden s presidency a figure that the president says will keep rising because of his funding for infrastructure projects the production of computer chips and the switch to clean energy sources america is reasserting itself it s as simple as that biden said in a friday speech we also know folks are still struggling with inflation it s our number one priority yet the president is also warning that a republican majority in congress could make inflation worse by seeking to undo his programs and treating payments on the federal debt as a bargaining chip instead of an obligation to honor his challenge is that the party in power generally faces skeptical voters in u s midterms and inflation looms over the public mindset more than job growth if you have a job it s small comfort to know that the job market is strong if at the same time you feel like every paycheck is worth less and less anyway said pollster kristen soltis anderson inflation is such political poison because voters are reminded every day whenever they spend money that it is a problem we are experiencing as biden tries to fend off fears that inflation is causing the country to slide into a recession his chief evidence of the economy s resilience is the continued job growth as we see the economy as a whole we do not see it going into a recession white house press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters in anticipation of the latest jobs report going into the election biden and democrats are already at a disadvantage voters generally favor the party out of the white house in midterms giving republicans an automatic leg up when yale university economist ray fair looked at past elections his model forecast that democrats would get just 46 4 of the national vote largely because biden was in the oval office fair s analysis suggests that inflation basically erased the political boost that democrats could have gotten from strong economic growth during three quarters in 2021 even if the economy is top of mind for many voters the conflicting forces of past growth and high inflation cancel out each other this makes the democrats vote share roughly the same as suggested by the historical trend fair concluded but inflation compounds the obstacles for a president who has tried to convey optimism as he tours the country in the run up to the elections research in social psychology and behavioral economics generally shows that people often focus on the negatives and can block out the positives people pay more attention to bad news than to good news and are more likely to retain and recall bad news said matthew incantalupo a political scientist at yeshiva university incantalupo s research looks at how voters absorb economic news when unemployment is low as it is now he said voters generally think about jobs as a personal issue rather than a systemic one involving government policies but most think about inflation as a social problem beyond any person s control unless that individual happens to run the fed when it is high everyone experiences it at least a little bit and there really is no individual way to avoid it incantalupo said voters are going to look to government for remedies under those circumstances and in many cases that will result in them punishing incumbents even in the presence of other positive news about the economy republican candidates have specifically said biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package last year overheated the economy causing prices to rise alongside the job gains that they claim would have happened anyway as the pandemic receded they have also said that biden should have loosened restrictions on oil production in order to increase domestic output and lower gasoline prices house republican leader kevin mccarthy who could become speaker if the gop wins a house majority has hammered biden on high prices as biden has warned that republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election are a threat to democracy the california congressman countered that what voters care about are the costs of gas and groceries president biden is trying to divide and deflect at a time when america needs to unite because he can t talk about his policies that have driven up the cost of living mccarthy tweeted this past week the american people aren t buying it still inflation is not solely a domestic issue after russia invaded ukraine energy and food costs rose and suddenly flipped the global dynamics as inflation rose faster in parts of the world with less aggressive coronavirus relief than the u s annual inflation in the euro zone is a record 10 7 much higher than the 8 2 in the u s meanwhile growth has slowed in china the pace of world trade is slipping and saudi arabia led opec has cut oil production in order to prop up prices and because the fed is raising rates to lower domestic inflation the dollar has increased in value and essentially exported higher prices to the rest of the world this has left u s voters in the curious position of not necessarily blaming the president for inflation even as they disapprove of his economic leadership an october poll by ap norc center for public affairs captured this split more than half of voters say that prices are higher because of factors beyond biden s control but just 36 approve of his economic leadership back to top
washington the federal reserve suggested on friday that lofty home prices could be susceptible to steep declines after big run ups in recent years on the back of ultra low interest rates with valuations at high levels house prices could be particularly sensitive to shocks the fed said in its semiannual financial stability report released friday though housing price increases have slowed recently as the fed has raised interest rates valuations remain stretched when compared with such metrics as rents the central bank said it also cited strained liquidity conditions in the treasury and some other crucial financial markets elevated leverage at hedge funds and high commercial real estate prices when compared with market fundamentals fed chairman jerome powell has taken issue with warnings that the us is on the verge of another economically paralyzing housing bubble bust akin to what it suffered some 15 years ago arguing that lenders have been much more careful in extending mortgages this time around that s a point also made in the report which said household debt remains moderate but in addition to pointing out that house prices remain elevated the report said an economic downturn or a correction in real estate prices would put pressure on household balance sheets the fed is in the midst of its most aggressive credit tightening campaign since the 1970s as it struggles to corral an inflation rate that s near a four decade high the s p 500 rose 1 4 per cent on friday and is down 21 per cent so far this year the rate increases come after years of ultra easy credit conditions that encouraged borrowers to take on added leverage and prompted investors to adopt riskier positions to boost returns uncertain global outlook today s environment of rapid synchronous global monetary policy tightening elevated inflation and high uncertainty associated with the pandemic and the war raises the risk that a shock could lead to the amplification of vulnerabilities for instance due to strained liquidity in core financial markets or hidden leverage fed vice chair lael brainard said in a statement accompanying the report the fed also highlighted potential risks to the us financial system from developments abroad including ongoing stresses in china s property market and russia s invasion of ukraine these could affect the us in various ways including by triggering a general pullback in risk taking in world financial markets the report includes a lengthy discussion on liquidity in financial markets while saying that the treasury market has continued to function smoothly the fed said liquidity is less resilient than usual it blamed that mainly on elevated interest rate volatility stemming from the uncertain economic outlook trading conditions in the nearly 24 trillion treasury market have at times been difficult after a year of steep losses for bonds driven by rising inflation higher fed interest rates and a reduction in the central bank s balance sheet
by yehualashet tamiru ethiopia has recently ratified the new york convention on recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards commonly known as the new york convention ethiopia has formally acceded to the convention and as of november 22 2020 the convention becomes fully implemented in the ratification proclamation proclamation no 1184 2020 ethiopia has made two declarations and one reservation the ratification proclamation made two reservations reciprocity and commercial reservations reciprocity is one of the reservations recognized under the new york convention according to article 1 3 of the convention contracting states may declare that they will apply the convention to the recognition and enforcement of awards made only in the territory of another contracting state this principle of reciprocity can protect the nationals of the contracting state where the enforcement of a foreign judgment is sought against the bias of contracting state where a foreign judgment or award was made it also reaffirms the principle of state equality and mutuality in international relationships the reciprocity reservation has been used by approximately two third of the contracting states various courts have held that when a contracting state makes the reciprocity reservation it will apply the new york convention only to the awards rendered in the territory of a state which is a party to the convention in this regard one of the controversial issues is whether the nationality of the litigant parties is relevant unlike the geneva convention on the execution of foreign arbitral awards new york convention considers the nationality or citizenship of the parties irrelevant courts have consistently held that the nationality of the parties is irrelevant for the purpose of establishing reciprocity what matters the most is that reciprocity exists between the state where the award was rendered and the state where recognition and enforcement were sought the second reservation is that the new york convention only applies to disputes arising out of legal relationships considered as commercial under the national law of the state making such declaration there are no clear criteria as to what constitutes commercial transactions as a matter of practice courts have interpreted the scope of this phase to be broad for instance a court in india has construed the phrase as being one of the largest import encompassing all the business and trade transactions are any of their forms a united states court has similarly held that the notion of commercial relationship is broad noting that its purpose is only excluding matrimonial and other domestic relations awards political awards and the like as a matter of practice in the area the following legal relationship has been deemed to be commercial transactions a cereal purchase contract a charter party a contract for the provision of consulting service a contract for the shipment of goods an agreement for the division of property and businesses a joint venture agreement to establish and operate a chain of stores a seamen s employment contract a contract for the reorganization of a company and buyout of shareholders a contract for the reorganization of a company and buyout of shareholders a contract for the construction of a nitro phosphate plant and dispute between corporate shareholders regarding the proceeds of a stock transaction however in some cases the courts have indicated non commercial matters for instance an indian court held that a contract for the supply of technical know how in return for a fee was not a commercial contract in another case the united states court held that a dispute arising out of proceedings to disqualify counsel was non commercial ethiopia made a declaration that is not part of new york convention article 3 of proclamation no 1184 2020 made a declaration as to the time of application accordingly the convention only applies in the federal democratic republic of ethiopia with respect to arbitration agreements concluded and arbitral awards rendered after the date of its accession to the convention normally under ethiopian law enforcement of foreign judgments and arbitral awards are executed as per the conditions laid down under the civil procedure code as per article 468 of the civil procedure code foreign awards may not be enforced in ethiopia unless the following conditions are met reciprocity the award has been made following a regular arbitration agreement or other legal act in the country where it was made the parties have had equal rights in appointing the arbitrators and they have been summoned to attend the proceedings the arbitration tribunal regularly constituted the award does not relate to matters which under the provisions of ethiopian laws could not be submitted to arbitration or is not contrary to public order or morals and the award is of such nature as to be enforceable on the condition laid down in ethiopian laws out of the above six conditions the first requirement of reciprocity has practically made enforcement of foreign arbitral awards in ethiopia impossible for reciprocity to exist the parties must prove that the state where the award was made would reciprocally recognize and enforce arbitral awards made in ethiopia the federal supreme court has further interpreted the principle of reciprocity in the paulos papassinus case stating that the only way to prove that another state allows execution of ethiopian judgments is by producing a judicial assistance treaty signed between ethiopia and the other state without such a treaty the court ruled that reciprocity is not considered to have been met this meant that even if the party seeking enforcement could produce proof of recognition and enforcement of an ethiopian award by the other state party ethiopian courts would not entertain it short of a judicial assistance treaty there is only one such treaty with the republic of china which was concluded in 2017 however this stance has been reversed by the federal higher court decision in a case between goh tsibah menkresellassie v dr bereket habte sellasi indicated that the absence of the treaty of judicial assistance should not limit the rights of private citizens and that in the absence of an agreement to the contrary between the two states it would be inappropriate to refuse the enforcement of a foreign judgment simply because there exists no treaty of judicial assistance yehualashet tamiru is associate at mta adjunct lecturer at aau and can be

democrats and republicans are approaching a social security fix from opposite ends of the spectrum for most retirees social security represents an indispensable financial lifeline that helps make ends meet for a significant percentage of the current labor force this statement will also hold true once they retire but when examined as a whole social security can be a complex confusing and potentially intimidating program for the american public to try to understand i can change that today we re going to break down three complex topics that ll be explained in plain english how america s top retirement program got itself into financial trouble the social security changes democrats and republicans want to make to strengthen the program why a resolution to social security s problems is a ways off social security is facing a 20 4 trillion cash shortfall since 1940 social security has been providing eligible workers with a monthly retirement benefit for the vast majority of those years the program has brought in more revenue than it s paid out in benefits where does social security get its revenue you ask approximately 90 of the money it brings in comes from the 12 4 payroll tax on wages and salaries this payroll tax is paid on earned income between 0 01 and 147 000 in 2022 although the upper limit will rise to 160 200 next year the remaining 10 of annual revenue comes from a combination of taxing social security benefits for recipients who earn above select income thresholds and the interest earned on bonds held by social security s trusts the excess revenue social security brings in most years over what it pays out in benefits is required by law to be invested in low risk special issue government bonds that pay interest the problem for social security is that numerous demographic shifts are increasing payouts at a much faster pace than revenue growth as a result social security ran a deficit in 2021 this deficit is expected to grow in size every year moving forward these demographic shifts include the ongoing retirement of baby boomers a slowdown in legal net immigration into the u s historically low birth rates lower interest rates which reduce the interest earned on the bonds the social security holds and growing income inequality according to the 2022 social security board of trustees report the program is staring down a 20 4 trillion cash shortfall between 2022 and 2096 although this is just an estimate the trustees take into account all of the demographic variables described above as well as cost of living adjustments cola passed along to beneficiaries most years so their payouts keep up with the rising price of goods and services aka inflation if nothing is done by lawmakers in washington d c to strengthen social security the trustees believe a 23 across the board cut to benefits may be necessary by 2034 for the old age and survivors insurance trust oasi to sustain payouts without any further cuts until 2096 the oasi is what pays benefits to over 48 million retired workers and roughly 5 8 million survivors of deceased workers how democrats and republicans want to strengthen social security now that you have a better understanding of why social security is in big financial trouble let s take a look at how lawmakers propose fixing the program the democrats proposal there are only two ways to approach a 20 4 trillion estimated cash shortfall raise additional revenue or cut costs democrats prefer the former the core proposal by democrats in congress is to increase payroll taxation on high earning workers as noted wages and salaries above 147 000 in 2022 are exempt from the payroll tax prior to his november 2020 election to the oval office joe biden proposed a plan that would reinstitute the 12 4 payroll tax on earned income above 400 000 meanwhile earnings between 147 000 and 400 000 would remain exempt from the payroll tax to offer some context well in excess of 1 trillion in earned income escapes social security s payroll tax every year the other social security proposal offered by democrats is to change how annual cost of living adjustments are calculated since 1975 the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers cpi w has been used to determine annual inflation and assign colas democrats prefer the consumer price index for the elderly cpi e whereas the cpi w tracks the spending habits of working age americans who aren t usually receiving a social security benefit the cpi e would specifically track the spending habits of seniors who make up the bulk of program recipients the end goal here is to increase annual colas by using an index more reflective of the inflation seniors are contending with the republicans proposal on the other side of the political aisle are republican lawmakers who collectively believe that reducing long term program outlays will strengthen social security the key change republicans would like to see implemented is a gradual increase to the full retirement age fra a person s fra is the age when they become eligible to receive 100 of their retired worker benefit from social security for anyone born in 1960 or later their fra is age 67 taking your benefit prior to reaching fra means accepting a permanent lifetime reduction i e not receiving 100 of what you d be due at fra to your monthly payout meanwhile waiting until after fra can boost your monthly payout by up to 24 to 32 depending on your birth year what the gop has proposed is gradually raising the fra to as much as 70 if the fra were raised workers would either need to wait longer to collect their full retirement benefit or claim early and accept a permanently reduced payout no matter their choice it would ultimately result in a lower lifetime benefit being paid out the other major change proposed by republicans is switching away from the cpi w to what s known as the chained consumer price index the chained cpi takes into account the idea of substitution trading down to a similar lower cost good or service in other words if the price of ground beef has risen by 60 over the past year consumers might trade down to a less expensive protein source such as pork or chicken utilizing the chained cpi as social security s inflationary measure would almost certainly result in lower annual colas which would work to reduce how much money the program pays out each year here s why a social security fix hasn t happened yet and may not for a while to be clear social security s shortcomings have never lacked for resolutions on capitol hill nevertheless social security legislation has stagnated for decades with the last major overhaul of the program occurring under president ronald reagan in 1983 the reason for this ongoing stalemate is twofold to begin with both the democrat and republican solutions work to strengthen social security which is the main problem lawmakers feel it s unnecessary to find common ground with their opposition if they have a solution that would make social security financially stronger however both solutions have their shortcomings too for example the gop proposal to raise the full retirement age would take decades to result in meaningful cost savings with the oasi expected to exhaust its excess reserves by 2034 this does the program no good in the shorter term as for the democrats plan raising the payroll tax by itself won t close the 20 4 trillion estimated cash shortfall through 2096 further it can be argued that the well to do are already paying their fair share into social security given that they wouldn t see an extra cent in benefits despite increased taxation the second reason a resolution is likely many years away has to do with the makeup of congress specifically the u s senate to amend social security 60 yes votes are needed in the senate it s been over four decades since either party had a supermajority of 60 senate seats this means democrats would need some form of republican support or vice versa to pass any legislation that s just not been possible given how ideologically far apart the two sides are if there is a silver lining here it s that lawmakers have a history of working together in the 11th hour that s what happened in 1983 and it could very well happen again the closer social security s oasi gets to exhausting its asset reserves but in the meantime expect little progress on social security legislation despite clear evidence that the program is in dire need of adjustments

a peak decline of 38 in the tech heavy nasdaq composite is the perfect excuse to pounce on these game changing stocks despite what 2021 might have led you to believe the stock market does not move up in a straight line since hitting its all time intra day high during the first week of january the benchmark s p 500 has delivered a peak to trough drop of 28 to make matters worse the bond market is enduring its worst year on record but things have been even worse for the technology driven nasdaq composite ixic 0 12 which has firmly tumbled into a bear market with a peak decline of 38 in less than a year when uncertainty arises it s not uncommon for companies sporting high valuation premiums to take it on the chin yet therein lies the opportunity just as optimism during long lived bull markets can cause equity valuations to overshoot to the upside pessimism during bear markets has been known to create amazing buying opportunities for patient investors what follows are five awe inspiring growth stocks you ll regret not buying on the nasdaq bear market dip amazon the first magnificent growth stock investors will regret not scooping up during the bear market decline is faang giant amazon amzn 0 16 though amazon s retail segment is facing all sorts of headwinds as the likelihood of a u s recession grows the company s highest margin operating segments are firing on all cylinders amazon s claim to fame has long been its clearly dominant online marketplace the company s 14 closest competitors don t even come close to the u s online retail market share amazon pulls in by itself however online retail sales produce very low margins this means amazon s primary revenue driver doesn t play a critical role in its operating cash flow generation what s key for amazon is that its high margin trio of amazon web services aws subscription services and advertising services continue to grow aws is the world s leading provider of cloud infrastructure services and enterprise cloud spending is arguably still in its very early innings meanwhile the company has used the popularity of its online marketplace as a catalyst to sign up more than 200 million prime members worldwide all three of these higher margin operating segments continue to grow sales by a double digit percentage since amazon is a company that reinvests most or all of its operating cash flow it pays to keep tabs on the company s multiple to cash flow throughout the 2010s investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times the year end cash flow to own amazon stock you can buy shares today for around eight times wall street s forecast cash flow for the company in 2025 that s inexpensive for such a game changing company lovesac a second phenomenal growth stock begging to be bought as the nasdaq plunges is furniture stock lovesac love 2 93 despite wall street beating down shares over rising inventory levels all indications and innovations continue to point to lovesac as a long term winner the key thing investors are getting with lovesac is differentiation traditional furniture retailers rely on physical stores and purchase their products from a small number of wholesalers meanwhile lovesac generates about 88 of net sales from sactionals which are modular couches that can be rearranged in dozens of ways to fit most living spaces sactionals come with over 200 cover choices can be ordered with multiple high margin add ons e g surround sound systems and the yarn used in these covers is made entirely from recycled plastic water bottles no furniture retailer can match the functionality and eco friendly aspect of lovesac s furniture to add lovesac s modestly higher price points target a more affluent consumer this makes it less likely for the company to be adversely impacted by minor economic downturns and rapidly rising inflation the other stand out catalyst is lovesac s omnichannel sales platform during the pandemic it was able to shift nearly half of its sales online having multiple avenues to retail its products beyond just physical stores has helped reduce its overhead costs and pushed the company to profitability well ahead of wall street s expectations broadcom the third awe inspiring growth stock that you ll regret not scooping up on the nasdaq bear market dip is semiconductor stock broadcom avgo 1 40 even though cyclical stocks like broadcom are almost always susceptible to economic weakness broadcom has a few factors that should help it weather a possible recession better than its peers the core growth driver for broadcom is the ongoing shift to 5g wireless infrastructure it s been about a decade since telecom providers upgraded their wireless infrastructure to support faster download speeds moving to 5g should entice businesses and consumers to trade in their older devices to take advantage of superior download speeds broadcom generates a majority of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories used in next generation smartphones another reason investors can trust broadcom is the company s historically high order backlog the company entered 2022 with 14 9 billion in orders to fulfill and per ceo hock tan was booking well into 2023 if chip demand does slow broadcom has a substantive cushion to fall back on thanks to its backlog there are also enticing opportunities for broadcom beyond its bread and butter smartphone segment for instance the pandemic has accelerated the pace at which businesses are moving data into the cloud that should sustain demand for anything and everything having to do with data centers broadcom is a manufacturer of connectivity and access chips used in data center servers cresco labs u s marijuana stock cresco labs crlbf 2 50 is a fourth stellar growth stock you ll be kicking yourself for not buying during the nasdaq bear market drop even with cannabis reform legislation failing to pass muster on capitol hill an abundance of state level legalizations is providing more than enough catalysts for multi state operators msos like cresco as of mid october cresco had 54 operating dispensaries in 10 legalized states though it s established quite a presence in medical marijuana legal florida 20 dispensaries and counting cresco s strategy of targeting limited license states such as illinois ohio pennsylvania and massachusetts has been smart limited license states purposely limit the number of retail licenses issued in total as well as to a single business in other words these are states where up and comers like cresco labs have a fair shot at building up their brands and garnering a loyal following to build on this point cresco is nearing the closure of a big time acquisition it s buying mso columbia care in an all share deal that ll boost the combined company s operating dispensaries to more than 130 and increase its presence to 18 states however it s cresco s wholesale cannabis operations that really help it stand out in an increasingly crowded cannabis market although wholesale cannabis generates lower margins than retail sales cresco has volume on its side it holds a lucrative cannabis distribution license in california and is able to place its proprietary brands in more than 575 retail locations the golden state is the nation s biggest weed market by annual sales salesforce the fifth awe inspiring growth stock you ll regret not buying on the nasdaq bear market dip is cloud based customer relationship management crm software provider salesforce crm 1 65 despite rapidly rising interest rates putting a damper on macro growth prospects for the u s economy salesforce s competitive advantages make it a no brainer buy following its sizable pullback for those unfamiliar crm software is used by consumer facing businesses to boost sales from existing customers the goal is to enhance existing customer relationships by quickly resolving issues running predictive analyses to determine which clients might buy a new product or service or leaning on crm for online marketing campaigns salesforce is the crm kingpin according to an idc report salesforce accounted for close to 24 of global crm spending in 2021 and it s consistently grown its share in each of the past five years similar to amazon s dominance salesforce possesses more crm share than its four closest competitors combined this makes it very unlikely that it ll be dethroned as the no 1 player in this sustained double digit opportunity anytime soon as i recently pointed out salesforce has done a bang up job incorporating inorganic growth into its formula for success co founder and co ceo marc benioff has overseen the acquisitions of mulesoft tableau software and slack technologies among others these deals provide new revenue channels and cross selling opportunities and help expand the salesforce ecosystem if salesforce can achieve benioff s target of 50 billion in full year sales by fiscal 2026 calendar year 2025 it ll be an incredible bargain for investors buying at today s share price

with voters focused on inflation and a possible recession the president is trying to convince the public that job gains mean better days are ahead example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington president joe biden has notched an envious record on jobs with 10 3 million gained during his tenure but voters in tuesday s midterm elections are far more focused on inflation hovering near 40 year highs that s left the president trying to convince the public that the job gains mean better days are ahead even as fears of a recession build presidents have long trusted that voters would reward them for strong economic growth but inflation has thrown a monkey wrench into the already difficult probability of democrats retaining control of the house and senate economic anxieties have compounded as the federal reserve has repeatedly hiked its benchmark interest rates to lower inflation and possibly raise unemployment mortgage costs have shot upwards while the s p 500 stock index has dropped more than 20 so far this year as the world braces for a possible downturn biden is asking voters to look beyond the current financial pain saying that what matters are the job gains that he believes his policies are fostering the government reported friday that employers added 261 000 jobs in october as the unemployment rate bumped up to 3 7 roughly 740 000 manufacturing jobs have been added since the start of biden s presidency a figure that the president says will keep rising because of his funding for infrastructure projects the production of computer chips and the switch to clean energy sources america is reasserting itself it s as simple as that biden said in a friday speech we also know folks are still struggling with inflation it s our number one priority yet the president is also warning that a republican majority in congress could make inflation worse by seeking to undo his programs and treating payments on the federal debt as a bargaining chip instead of an obligation to honor his challenge is that the party in power generally faces skeptical voters in u s midterms and inflation looms over the public mindset more than job growth if you have a job it s small comfort to know that the job market is strong if at the same time you feel like every paycheck is worth less and less anyway said pollster kristen soltis anderson inflation is such political poison because voters are reminded every day whenever they spend money that it is a problem we are experiencing as biden tries to fend off fears that inflation is causing the country to slide into a recession his chief evidence of the economy s resilience is the continued job growth as we see the economy as a whole we do not see it going into a recession white house press secretary karine jean pierre told reporters in anticipation of the latest jobs report going into the election biden and democrats are already at a disadvantage voters generally favor the party out of the white house in midterms giving republicans an automatic leg up when yale university economist ray fair looked at past elections his model forecast that democrats would get just 46 4 of the national vote largely because biden was in the oval office fair s analysis suggests that inflation basically erased the political boost that democrats could have gotten from strong economic growth during three quarters in 2021 even if the economy is top of mind for many voters the conflicting forces of past growth and high inflation cancel out each other this makes the democrats vote share roughly the same as suggested by the historical trend fair concluded but inflation compounds the obstacles for a president who has tried to convey optimism as he tours the country in the run up to the elections research in social psychology and behavioral economics generally shows that people often focus on the negatives and can block out the positives people pay more attention to bad news than to good news and are more likely to retain and recall bad news said matthew incantalupo a political scientist at yeshiva university incantalupo s research looks at how voters absorb economic news when unemployment is low as it is now he said voters generally think about jobs as a personal issue rather than a systemic one involving government policies but most think about inflation as a social problem beyond any person s control unless that individual happens to run the fed when it is high everyone experiences it at least a little bit and there really is no individual way to avoid it incantalupo said voters are going to look to government for remedies under those circumstances and in many cases that will result in them punishing incumbents even in the presence of other positive news about the economy republican candidates have specifically said biden s 1 9 trillion coronavirus relief package last year overheated the economy causing prices to rise alongside the job gains that they claim would have happened anyway as the pandemic receded they have also said that biden should have loosened restrictions on oil production in order to increase domestic output and lower gasoline prices house republican leader kevin mccarthy who could become speaker if the gop wins a house majority has hammered biden on high prices as biden has warned that republicans who deny the outcome of the 2020 election are a threat to democracy the california congressman countered that what voters care about are the costs of gas and groceries president biden is trying to divide and deflect at a time when america needs to unite because he can t talk about his policies that have driven up the cost of living mccarthy tweeted this past week the american people aren t buying it still inflation is not solely a domestic issue after russia invaded ukraine energy and food costs rose and suddenly flipped the global dynamics as inflation rose faster in parts of the world with less aggressive coronavirus relief than the u s annual inflation in the euro zone is a record 10 7 much higher than the 8 2 in the u s meanwhile growth has slowed in china the pace of world trade is slipping and saudi arabia led opec has cut oil production in order to prop up prices and because the fed is raising rates to lower domestic inflation the dollar has increased in value and essentially exported higher prices to the rest of the world this has left u s voters in the curious position of not necessarily blaming the president for inflation even as they disapprove of his economic leadership

my wife and i loved our block of small craftsman homes the moment we bought our house in 2011 but it was the front yard across the street filled with rotting lumber and stage props that really charmed us it was august and still 20 degrees too hot to think about halloween but our new neighbor had already started erecting the frame for mineshaft 2011 as a sign outside his house indicated what that fascinating mess would become how odd how fun whatever it was in this part of alhambra we had found a diverse neighborhood with its own locally sourced quirkiness fostering a community and still hanging on as the inequality and housing crises surged around us advertisement advertisement we were in with some family already in the area we knew this neighborhood would be fertile trick or treating ground thanks to an artist and set designer known for transforming his bungalow into a medieval dungeon a ufo landing site or whatever film like spectacle he dreamed up that year a neighbor told me at the time however much candy you think will work triple it she wasn t kidding this year on a strict budget of one fun size treat per child we still gave out all 1 000 pieces of candy we bought anything more generous would require a car payment sized outlay for trick or treaters almost every one of our 12 halloweens in alhambra have been similarly exhausting and exhilarating affairs that border on street festivals and it s all thanks to one gifted artist and builder on the block who decided to make our community a lot more interesting i say almost because although duane aamot hasn t technically missed a single halloween in the 27 years he s lived on the block a fact he brings up with pride he s had to dial it back twice in 2020 there was no trick or treating because of covid but he put out some props sculptures and spooky lighting just to make the neighborhood feel normal and in 2017 a bout with cancer robbed him of his strength and almost his life but not our block of its halloween aamot still managed a postcard worthy setup better than anything most people saw that night advertisement advertisement absent a pandemic or mortal threat aamot doesn t hold back his mine shaft in 2011 was a stunning old west re creation the louisiana bayou he built last year included an artificial swamp with real fish and attracted a troupe of polynesian fire dancers who entertained trick or treaters late into the night years ago as aamot tells it his work was so convincing that a priest passing through the neighborhood a catholic monastery is within easy walking distance stopped to scatter holy water and mutter a few blessings what a compliment aamot told me this year s attraction a brightly colored chocolatier featuring a walkthrough maze upbeat music and original artwork drew a few thousand people aamot estimates the crowds grew large enough to draw police and fire department presence so this guess sounds reasonable as we took stock of this year s festivities two days after halloween aamot stopped toward the end of his maze pointed to some darkened oddly shaped props and said i m going with this next year very tim burton like forced perspective not even before some halloween revelers hangovers had faded aamot was already thinking about 2023 and what a relief it was to hear that even though there s no doubt my neighbor will deliver 12 months from now it s an assurance that our neighborhood s peculiarities like those nurtured in other communities where artists can still afford to live will persist at least for now this story originally appeared in los angeles times
richmond the food and drug administration added adderall to its drug shortage website last month and doctors say virginia patients being treated for adhd are feeling the impact the leading reasons for the shortage which primarily affects immediate release adderall and similar generic versions are manufacturing delays and insufficient supplies to meet market demands according to the fda virginia patients with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have absolutely been impacted by the shortage said dr dorothy o keefe outpatient clinic director for the division of child and adolescent psychiatry in the virginia treatment center for children dr kara beatty an adult psychiatrist with her own private practice and the president of the psychiatric society of virginia said her office is getting phone calls left and right from patients who say their adderall prescriptions can t be filled stimulants such as adderall are the most commonly used medications to treat adhd in children and adults according to prescription price comparison service goodrx stimulant prescriptions dispensed in virginia rose 11 from the start of 2021 to june 30 of this year the largest increase of all controlled substances overseen by the state s prescription monitoring program according to its most recent report the active ingredients in adderall are some of the stimulants monitored in the program o keefe said child psychiatrists or pediatricians are unlikely to use stimulants for any other indication than adhd she said data is not recorded in a way to determine the exact percentage of each type of stimulant monitored by the program stated diane powers director of communications for the virginia department of health professions in an email patients treated for adhd in beatty s practice typically start off with prescriptions for adderall or ritalin another stimulant monitored in the program beatty said nationwide adderall prescriptions for patients ages 22 44 jumped 15 from 2020 to 2021 according to trilliant health a firm that provides market analytics to the health care industry other age groups remained relatively stable doctors can prescribe some controlled substances such as adderall through online telehealth services since the federal government declared a public health emergency in spring 2020 according to the u s drug enforcement agency the health emergency has been renewed several times since the pandemic began most recently last month as a result there was an uptick in online mental health care startups that began prescribing adderall beatty said mental health startup cerebral is currently being investigated by the federal government for potential violations of the controlled substances act according to cbs the virginia board of pharmacy would like to caution consumers to the risk of purchasing drugs online or through social media from rogue outlets preying on increased demand during drug shortages powers stated meaghan 43 works in insurance and was diagnosed with adhd three years ago she requested to have her last name withheld because she said there is a stigma around adhd and its treatment she knows firsthand what it s like to not be able to access her prescribed adderall for days due to shortages i m not going to accomplish what i could have the days that i did have my medication meaghan said it s life changing for a lot of people children without access to their prescribed adderall can struggle in school and social relationships o keefe said their behavior might become problematic as a result the biggest thing i would say for people with adhd besides being impulsive and wanting to do things instantly is to be able to do the time management meaghan said that s a coping mechanism a lot of people have to develop going without medication can be like an inability to function beatty said there are other types of treatments for people with adhd she said but transitioning from one to another can be frustrating some patients make the switch to ritalin or nonstimulant medications due to the shortage but o keefe said it can be a gamble whether the new medicine will be as effective if we are forced to make the change because they can t get the product that they re used to it may turn out just fine o keefe said but it may turn out that they end up with a medicine that doesn t work as well or causes more side effects patients by law can only get a 30 day supply of adderall they can have a difficult time managing insurance policies and trying to figure out which pharmacy has the drug in stock each month o keefe said meaghan s pharmacy has run out of stock of her prescription several times she said and as a result has gone days without it some people notice when she hasn t taken her medication she said i m a little quicker on responses more impulsive in my responses meaghan said i tend to get distracted easier than i would without my medication the shortage primarily affects instant release adderall according to the fda although it depends on the manufacturer and the dosage strengths some manufacturers aren t experiencing any shortage as of nov 1 according to the fda s drug shortages website we are still writing the prescriptions because it s not that nobody can get it o keefe said we don t necessarily know when i write your prescription teva pharmaceutical is the largest seller of adderall in the u s their products are estimated to be in short supply anywhere from now until december according to the fda the company has been supplying above typical forecast due to increase in market demand according to a statement on the fda s drug shortages website even though it s not a deadly consequence o keefe said it is a disruption in their lives capital news service is a program of virginia commonwealth university s robertson school of media and culture students in the program provide state government coverage for a variety of media outlets in virginia

of the 2 000 content moderators working on front line review were not impacted by the cuts mr musk posted his own comments saying he was presented no choice over what he called twitter s reduction in

an anything goes philosophy when it comes to managing content on twitter is alienating the people it needs most for it to thrive nicholas creel an assistant professor of business law at georgia college and state university said via email advertisers and twitter users alike are simply unwilling to be a part of the platform if he goes through with these changes and yet he seemingly remains committed to seeing it through he predicted the lesson here is that if company wants to be financially successful has to consider the desires of the stakeholders that are vital to its success creel advised review communication plans business leaders can benefit from twitter s very publicly unfolding situation to review their own company communication plans for when they themselves are thrust into the media spotlight carla bevins an assistant teaching professor of business communication at carnegie mellon university s tepper school of business said via email process matters while musk uses an i wing it approach the majority of other ceos employ detailed the long term company plans that involve communication professionals lawyers and advisors she noted control the narrative quickly communicating your company s responses is key in business it s essential to quickly control the narrative your company is sending out if you don t take control of the information that s being communicated from your company then there s a good chance someone else will fill that information gap and shine the spotlight on your company when you might not be ready it can be difficult to bring a situation back under control if online and social media create an alternative narrative to the one you want to share clear and continual communication is essential bevins advised be consistent musk

aftermath of the layoff of thousands of twitter workers there s a potential crisis backlash from investors that musk might be able to avoid that s according to vivek astvansh an assistant professor of marketing at indiana university s kelley school of business who studied how stock investors responded to more than 30 000 layoff announcements by u s companies between 1980 and 2020 i found that layoffs framed as proactive management do not elicit a penalty from investors proactive layoffs are those aimed at cost cutting consolidation of operations boosting efficiency or restructuring in contrast layoffs made after a drop in demand financial distress or low earnings receive a punitive reaction from investors he noted musk has cited a drop in revenue triggered by social activists pressuring advertisers as the reason for laying off employees i view this reason as forward looking and thus proactive meaning that investors may not penalize twitter astvansh observed if this happens investor reaction would be against the public sentiment that musk s heavy handedness has brought uncertainty for twitter and the tech industry he noted
soil moisture conditions in western saskatchewan are far worse than they were in the dirty thirties says a farm leader it s not just a little bit drier than the 1930s it s way drier said garner deobald president of the saskatchewan stock growers association for instance annual precipitation in swift current so far in 2022 is 300 millimetres below average which is twice as bad as the worst year in the 1930s this will be the 11th straight year of below average precipitation in the 1930s the longest streak was two consecutive years deobald said today s farmers have the know how the equipment and the crop genetics to get through these tough times but he thinks people need to understand just how bone dry it has become in that region of the prairies it should be attention getting he said it s just desperately dry no matter what happens here now at this point in time it s going to be a really difficult spring soil moisture conditions are worse than they were a year ago in the rectangle roughly defined by saskatoon west to the alberta border and south to the montana border an estimated 78 percent of the province s cropland is rated short to very short of topsoil moisture according to the province s final crop report even the regions that started the year with a surplus of moisture are now becoming very dry and producers are hoping for rain soon stated the report dated oct 20 conditions are also suboptimal in alberta where 40 percent of the cropland had poor surface soil moisture as of oct 11 according to that province s final crop report saskatchewan s crop report was published before the oct 23 snowstorm that delivered 30 centimetres of wet snow to places like moose jaw it s really good that we got this snow but i know a lot of producers would have preferred it to be rain instead said matthew struthers crop extension specialist with saskatchewan agriculture once it all melts it will probably amount to about 20 millimetres of moisture in some of the more fortunate areas which is helpful but won t break the drought conditions heading into winter it s not going to be the save all he said but i m hoping maybe this snowfall is the beginning of a break in that dry cycle many growers in western saskatchewan elected not to plant winter wheat and fall rye because their soils were too dry those who did seed winter cereals are reporting that the crop did not germinate well or at all the southwest is in a particularly precarious position this region is in desperate need of moisture and without any this fall they will need large early spring rains to ensure their soils can support germination stated the crop report farmers planting grain crops have a little more leeway than livestock producers because crops can still germinate and grow if there s a late spring rain while hay and pastureland will already be off to a poor start by then winter cereal planting is down 38 percent in the southwest the conditions in west central saskatchewan are not much better producers are praying for rain this fall to allow their soil moisture to recharge before winter arrives and the ground freezes stated the crop report a multi day soaker is needed to have enough moisture for crop germination and for the regrowth of pasture next spring without sufficient moisture many producers fear they will not be able to graze cattle on a large majority of their land stated the crop report deobald said some cattle producers have enough feed reserves to get them through the winter but those who have suffered through four to five years of drought will have to buy feed and they can t afford to do that for long the only option really is to sell cows and downsize he said deobald said the ssga believes an underlying inequity exists in canada s business risk management programs it is pushing for improvements in programs like crop insurance and agristability that would provide more support for livestock producers advertisement

husband and wife are software experts in their early 40s with no kids a great sex life and lots of time for antiquing gardening and esoteric art house interests such as kintsugi look it up dinners consist largely of vegetables hand picked from their own garden they ve been together for 14 years yet sprinkle their playful conversations with ambitious literary allusions like young lovebirds still trying to impress one another i mentioned the great sex yes because that s the pleasure perch from which the relationship begins its fatal nosedive shannon is on her computer cycling through some of jamie s favourite porn genres as they get prepped for yet another satisfying bout of coitus jamie wants to see something new he says images of fully intact and aroused men wearing women s underwear shannon a former drag bar worker who d gone through a polyam lesbian period in her 20s is the furthest thing from a prude so she duly loads up the tranny videos as jamie calls them and the evening comes alive with porn fuelled sex jamie is an affable attention seeking man child who plays guitar at parties and picks dorm room style arguments about religion and philosophy when the couple flees the city jamie tells shannon he ll take on the role of domestic house husband while she works an office job we only have shannon s side of the story but if her account is to be believed jamie never delivered she ended up making six figures while he couldn t even be counted on to do the laundry or cut up a melon i know that last detail sounds oddly specific but that fruit makes a memorable appearance in an important scene like pretty much everyone else in their lives shannon and jamie conceive of themselves as committed social progressives and so right from the beginning jamie s cross dressing takes on activist overtones including through a personal blog that he dedicates to breaking down the gender binary he creates an author account for shannon too so they can present a united blogging front against all those bigots eager to denigrate jamie s blossoming new gender bending identity in the end the bigots never really show up though jamie doesn t let that stop him from steadily taking on a victim mindset the trans community is diverse especially when it comes to attitudes toward sex as writer angus fox noted in a seven part quillette series when sons become daughters some biologically male trans identified teenagers live a sexless existence and are drawn to puberty blockers and androgynous aesthetics precisely because they seem to offer safe harbour from male sexual development in the case of middle aged men who abruptly adopt a trans identity later in life on the other hand it can be the opposite the presentation is often hyper sexualized such sexual inclinations can manifest as autogynephilia arousal at the thought or image of oneself as a woman this term doesn t appear in 18 months but much of what shannon writes about jamie is consistent with the subcategory when it comes to sex she reports he starts becoming excited by hard core female themed role play involving a strap on dildo shannon tries to be a good soldier but plainly finds these new fetishes to be off putting moreover the intimacy of sex evaporates jamie is so deeply absorbed in his cosplay fantasies that her presence in the room barely registers your hang ups aren t the kind most people have the kind that lead to interesting if controversial sex shannon writes you have the kind that kill sex making love to transgender jamie turns out to be like making dinner for an anorexic shannon also becomes concerned by the increasingly extreme measures jamie takes to present as feminine these include not only expensive hair removal treatments but also painful cinches and body clamps he obsesses endlessly over clothing makeup and hair collapsing into tears if shannon doesn t repeatedly affirm that he looks like a real woman which of course he doesn t it s only a matter of months before jamie announces that he s no longer merely a cross dresser as he d formerly described himself but is now unambiguously transgender he also wants to be addressed with female pronouns he s trying to convince himself as much as he s trying to coerce others eventually jamie abandons both his household responsibilities such as they were and his part time job teaching high school computer science so that he can dedicate himself to feminizing his appearance and writing social media posts about his gender related epiphanies he also spends a lot of time patrolling discussion groups heaping abuse on anyone he deems inadequately trans supportive as the months pass shannon notices the sloganeering activist idiom he uses online begins to creep into personal conversation so a simple request that jamie not blow their mortgage money on beauty products is thrown back in shannon s face as a bigoted attack on jamie s very existence in one especially shocking episode that took place just before the marriage collapses shannon catches jamie joining a vicious online pile on which includes rape and death threats targeting a female sexual assault survivor who d expressed anxiety about using the bathroom alongside trans women his inability to look like a real woman becomes a subject of inexhaustible emotional agony causing him to lapse into crying jags whenever some anonymous waiter or clerk seems confused about his gender presentation many of the other trans women that shannon meets at local support group meetups also seem sad in their canned rhetoric and online pronouncements they channel the language of joy liberation and solidarity all the while exalting their internally felt sense of gender identity but in truth what they really seek is the fleeting external validation that s transmitted through the gaze of credulous onlookers in many cases shannon states bluntly their elaborate faux feminine get ups look clownish but no one is allowed to say so out loud especially their partners eventually jamie remakes not only his appearance but also his past he announces that he d known he was female spirited since the age of four an oft told story about a childhood brush with an abusive boy scout field trip chaperone is rewritten to the effect that it happened because i was seen as a girl following an airport security search that s conducted respectfully by well trained staff jamie starts claiming he was transphobically harassed jamie also rewrites his sex life now claiming that his gender identity has nothing to do with sexual appetites unable to bite her tongue at this whopper shannon reminds jamie of his requests to be demeaned as a tranny during sex his inability to perform sexually unless he presents as a woman with a vagina while shannon pretends to be a man with a penis and especially his penchant for trans themed porn to which jamie replies without a hint of irony i was trying to find people like myself represented in the media lies distortions and selective memory are features of many disintegrating relationships of course but the style of conflict that shannon describes seems uniquely toxic since gender theory allows jamie to cynically escalate even the most mundane disagreement into preposterous accusations of transphobic bigotry and if that trick doesn t work he simply flees shannon s company altogether in a great flourish of tears on the claim that her words are making him feel unsafe as anyone who s followed this issue on twitter might have predicted jamie sometimes plays the suicidal ideation card as well you tell me you re sad i tell you i m sad too she writes using you as a stand in for jamie everyone considers your sadness an important civil rights issue no one gives a shit about mine at one point shannon and jamie go to therapy in the first session dr doris tells jamie that she can t wait to begin the fun part of the therapeutic process i e helping him transition in the same breath dr doris urges shannon to go get another therapist for herself since shannon s insufficiently supportive attitudes toward jamie s feminine nature present a conflict of interest what truly drives the relationship to its breaking point is shannon s eventual realization that with his slinky dresses and high heel boots jamie isn t a wannabe woman so much as an amateurish imposter what he imagines to be womanhood is in fact a male masturbation fantasy that presents women as endlessly parked in front of boudoir mirrors staring dreamily at their own decolletage as they mist themselves with bulbed perfume bottles when i began reading this book i still imagined that to call someone like jamie a woman was merely to bend the truth in the service of courtesy by the time i got through shannon s account of what she d endured at jamie s hands i realized that it s nothing more than an ordinary lie i stopped reading quillette a while ago but have been too lazy to remove the site from my feed however this article caught my attention recently the subtitle in particular in an extraordinary new book shannon thrace describes her disintegrating marriage to a man consumed by narcissism and gender dysphoria narcissism yes please gender dysphoria i thought you d never ask the article is a review of a memoir 18 months a memoir of a marriage lost to gender identity this article is a review of a review of that memoir because i doubt i ll ever read the book itself but since the connection between narcissism and gender dysphoria intrigues me i want to highlight and comment on some of jonathan kay s review let s dig right in as kay sums up the background to the story shannon the author and jamie her husband both pseudonyms were a typical loving progressive liberal couple let s pause while i allow you to count the numerous red flags not just from jamie and bask in the contentment of modern liberal narcissism but wait there s more like joshua slocum argues cluster b is a spectrum and narcissism occupies that spot at the center of the venn diagram most people can spot an over the top narcissist and the abrasive violence of an antisocial is similarly hard to miss but when it comes to garden variety compassionate narcissism that s what throws a lot of people off the scent many don t seem to realize that narcissism fits just as comfortably within the smiling artificiality of liberal suburbia as it does within an abrasive new yorker or a recidivist felon this softer more feminine version of narcissism is the one which has taken over western civilization new readers let me direct you to an article where i quoted dr hervey cleckley s portrayal of a similar relationship not with an autogynephile but with a coprophiliac here s what cleckley had to say about this particular pervert this is pretty much the definition of sexual narcissism here s another example in yet another context wholesome entertainment for the whole family in other words he crossed from simple paraphilia into full blown sexual delusion actually even that isn t quite right it isn t delusion because i m fairly confident he knows he s bulls ing to some degree perhaps it s delusion but i d put my money on good old fashioned pathological egotism and suggestion of self and others this personality transformation bears a striking resemblance to what lobaczewski called transpersonification in his context it was the transformation of seemingly ordinary people into carbon copies of the typical communist party pathocrat adopting the jargon and slogans the superior attitude the brittle pseudo moralizing here it is a typical lbgtq party pathocrat complete with affected borderline histrionics kay notes how jamie started out fairly reasonable deciding not to use the women s bathroom for example in order not to make actual women uncomfortable which sounds to me just as put on as the rest of it but that changed as the transpersonification progressed i find it amazing how effortlessly new converts seem to adopt the exact same pattern of thinking feeling and acting as if they ve downloaded a program in the matrix this sexual assault survivor is the new kulak and the sexual narcissists can scent such people s blood in the water from miles away this is induced psychopathology again it s hard to know how much of it is half consciously affected how much auto suggestion and how much genuine emotional distress big trans brother trans stalinization memory trans holed ok that last one is more disturbing than i intended maybe now we can all see how these dynamics scale up in a totalitarian regime oceania has always been a trans east asian woman trans borderline why indeed it s almost as if there s more going on here than actual sadness it s almost as if it is one giant manipulation dr josefina mengele has entered the chat this story is just one modern cliche after another bingo here s how kay ends his review live not by lies
