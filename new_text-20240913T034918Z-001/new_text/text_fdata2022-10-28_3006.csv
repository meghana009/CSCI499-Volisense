new york oct 27 efe magnate elon musk on thursday said in a twitter post that he is buying the social network for the future of civilization as barely 24 hours remain before the deadline imposed by a judge to launch legal proceedings against him if the deal is not consummated the owner of electric vehicle manufacturer tesla and space transport firm spacex directed his message to advertisers on twitter to explain the reasons that led him to buy the firm saying that he s not acquiring the company to make more money but rather because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence however musk added that twitter obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences he also said that advertising will have a relevant role in the social network s operations going forward once musk posted his statement twitter shares jumped by 1 16 percent in early trading on the new york stock exchange the mercurial mogul who is widely acknowledged to be the world s richest man said in his message that the social networks are running the risk of increasing the polarization of public opinion between the extreme right and extreme left a morass into which traditional media outlets have also fallen but he said he wants to contribute to overcoming that risk he said that under his leadership twitter will be adhering to the laws the platform aspires to be the most respected advertising platform in the world that strengthens your brand and grows your enterprise he told advertisers but he also said that ads on twitter should be able to delight entertain and inform users adding that it is essential to show twitter users advertising that is as relevant as possible to their needs low relevancy ads are spam but highly relevant ads are actually content musk wrote that twitter should be warm and welcoming to all enabling users to choose the kind of experience they want to have comparing it to going to a movie or playing a videogame depending on a person s age efe fjo mvs eat bp
updated october 27 2022 at 11 22 am et elon musk lugged a sink into twitter headquarters on wednesday entering twitter hq let that sink in he captioned the video which he posted on twitter he also renamed himself chief twit on the social network musk has been founding companies since the dawn of the internet age he s grown tesla spacex and paypal into the blue chips that they are today but the financially struggling social media company which he is expected to buy by friday needs something more to become a success story said andy wu who teaches business strategy at harvard business school musk has no experience in managing organizational change and there s definitely an embedded culture at twitter that he ll have to change in order to achieve some of his goals wu said the challenge has only grown since musk first offered to buy twitter in the spring for 54 20 a share or about 44 billion tech stocks have struggled along with the broader market it didn t help that musk openly criticized the company tried to walk away from the deal and only changed his mind after a high profile and expensive legal battle neared trial at one point twitter s stock lost a quarter of its value myself and other investors are obviously overpaying for twitter right now musk said on a call with tesla investors last week he acknowledged on thursday that there was a lot of speculation about why he was buying twitter after all his wavering it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of believes can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence he wrote in an open letter to twitter advertisers that is why i bought twitter i didn t do it because it would be easy i didn t do it to make more money he added acknowledging that failure was a very real possibility he has floated big plans for twitter he wants to slim it down while getting rid of fake accounts loosen its rules on what users can say on the platform and build it into an everything app experts say succeeding at even one of these goals would be hard enough entering twitter hq let that sink in pic twitter com d68z4k2wq7 elon musk elonmusk october 26 2022 musk revolutionized the electric car industry and privatized space throughout his career musk has chased bold sci fi like visions he fast forwarded the electric car industry and sent rockets into space people thought spacex was a crazy idea he was going to launch satellites who does that the government does that and he proved all of his skeptics wrong he launches satellites for much less money than the government said erik gordon professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the university of michigan s ross school of business he s gone through this before and landed like a cat tesla was on the edge of insolvency more than once due to manufacturing and logistics problems that piled delays on top of delays musk sunk millions of his own money into the company as it burned through cash and struggled to make deliveries in 2018 he famously slept on the floor of the tesla factory to troubleshoot the assembly line and oversee the paint shop musk is a genius at persuading the financial markets to back his risky investments said tim higgins who wrote power play tesla elon musk and the bet of the century probably the biggest contribution he had to tesla was his ability to sell his vision of the future to customers but more importantly to investors to raise the billions and billions of dollars that were needed to keep tesla afloat until it could become a viable company he said that power has gotten musk into trouble in the middle of tesla s struggles musk tweeted that he planned to take tesla private at 420 a share the stock price soared leading the securities and exchange commission to investigate whether musk had misled investors in the end musk gave up his role as chair of tesla s board and paid a 20 million fine to settle tesla paid another 20 million he also agreed to let a tesla lawyer review his tweets the company remains publicly traded am considering taking tesla private at 420 funding secured elon musk elonmusk august 7 2018 musk s fundraising magic worked with spacex too even when its rockets repeatedly blew up the falcon the dragon the super heavy rockets all exploded spectacularly on the launchpad or while attempting to land spacex has since successfully flown astronauts to the international space station in the partially re useable falcon rocket in his tweets musk put a spin on the spectacular explosions as a new approach to the staid military industrial spacecraft industry applying the software industry s iterative process to rocketry all he had to do was tweet something like oh everything is actually wonderful i couldn t be happier about all of these disasters it s going to be great and he raised lots of money higgins said he s a money raising genius musk s ability to raise money on command was also on display during his legal fight with twitter the lawsuit made public a cache of his personal text messages in which silicon valley heavyweights jockeyed to invest in twitter some consider musk a visionary others see a troll tesla is fighting a racial discrimination and harassment lawsuit that a california agency filed on behalf of 4 000 black tesla employees several women have filed lawsuits alleging tesla fostered a culture of sexual harassment at its fremont plant and other facilities also during the first months of the pandemic the fremont calif tesla factory continued operating despite orders from local public health officials to shut down to prevent the spread of covid there s a sense in which musk is like teletransported from another era of business and is just unconcerned about things you know like it s 1952 gordon said he has huge zones of non concern most companies 30 years ago didn t care about sexual harassment or racial discrimination on twitter musk readily trolls those who disagree with him or appear to be rivals his ego has been on display to his 110 million followers throughout the twitter legal saga after twitter ceo parag agrawal tweeted a detailed explanation of the company s efforts to combat spam musk responded with a poop emoji elon musk elonmusk may 16 2022 musk has pledged to loosen twitter s rules on what people can post to the platform he s said twitter was wrong to ban former president donald trump after the jan 6 attack on the u s capitol many twitter users have openly worried that the network will soon become more racist sexist and toxic musk tried to allay some of those fears in his letter to advertisers thursday twitter obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences he said twitter is a different sort of challenge for musk while many people are nervous about what sort of social network twitter will become under musk it has never been a healthy company during tesla s earnings call last week musk said twitter sort of languished for a long time but has incredible potential while twitter is often used by politicians and journalists it has fewer u s users than facebook tiktok or youtube it has struggled to attract ad dollars and to create services that users will pay for internal company documents obtained by reuters say now even heavy tweeters are using the platform less musk plans to address twitter staff on friday he s said he wants to trim their ranks dramatically time has reported that twitter employees are circulating a petition asking musk to preserve the current headcount and staff benefits layoffs would hurt twitter s ability to serve the public conversation the petition reads yet higgins the biographer expects many employees will choose not to work for musk he can be infuriating and inspiring in almost the same breath it just depends on the elon musk you get that day higgins said i have no doubt that if and when he gets into twitter he s going to anger a lot of people there and a lot of people will probably leave in addition it s going to be hard to create a social network that is truly warm and welcoming to all as musk says he wants and not the free for all hellscape he says he ll avoid that may be a very dangerous experiment according to harvard s wu social networks like parler gab and truthsocial which take a more hands off approach to content moderation have a tiny fraction of the users that mainstream platforms have people have used them to spread hate speech threaten violence and share harmful misinformation that is banned elsewhere copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

it s the night of the election polls have been closed for hours why don t americans know the winners in 2020 president donald trump proclaimed that the lack of final results on election night could be an indicator of something nefarious and used it to assert without evidence that the election was stolen we don t want them to find any more ballots at 4 o clock in the morning and add them to the list he said in reality however results released on election night are unofficial and always incomplete they inevitably change as more ballots are counted unlike in many countries elections in the u s are highly decentralized complex and feature long lists of races from president and congress all the way down to local measures and town council seats some states give local election offices several weeks before election day to process mailed ballots including checking signatures and verifying id information in other states that process can t start until election day or shortly before meaning those ballots might not get counted until the next day or even later here s why results are not always known the night of an election should we know the winners before going to bed republicans in particular have pointed to perceived delays in knowing results as a reason to be suspicious about the integrity of elections we ve got to get our elections reformed so that every arizonan whether they be democrat independent or republican when they go to bed on election night they know the winner and they re satisfied that it was a fair election we don t have that right now kari lake the trump endorsed republican candidate for governor in arizona said in august on twitter not knowing the winner on election night says nothing about the fairness of an election or the accuracy of results under arizona law all ballots including those that were mailed must be returned by 7 p m on election day but officials have 20 days to finalize their counts in nevada counties have four days to count late arriving mailed ballots and give voters two more days to fix mailed ballots that arrive in envelopes with errors or missing information this week the elections official in the county that includes reno reminded voters of that extended timeline and said final official results are unlikely until the actual canvass of the vote on nov 18 it will definitely be more than the day after the election for final results of the election said jamie rodriguez washoe county s interim registrar of voters why can t we be like france a close republican primary for u s senate in pennsylvania last may triggered comparisons to the french presidential election which had been held a few weeks earlier trump in a social media post two days after the pennsylvania primary questioned why it was taking so long to find out the winner france same day all paper had verified numbers in evening trump wrote u s is a laughing stock on elections but in france there was only one contest on the ballot presidential and parliamentary elections are held on separate dates in pennsylvania the u s senate gop primary was just one of several contests being decided including races for governor attorney general congress and state legislature u s elections also are not nationalized but rather overseen by states and run by local officials at the county or even township level the u s has some 10 000 jurisdictions charged with overseeing the voting process for presidential elections in france the ministry of interior distributes election related materials including ballots while local officials coordinate staffing of polling places france also has a constitutional council that decides election related complaints and announces results noah praetz the former elections clerk in cook county illinois said it s possible to have quick results but the u s has decided to make voting accessible to everybody and let us vote on everything he noted that ballots in the u s typically include dozens of offices in contrast to some countries where voters might simply back a party whose leadership then fills many of those positions in france voters choose from lists of local candidates usually associated with a party the candidate list gaining the most support will receive the most seats in the city and regional councils it s a fundamentally different view of democracy praetz said in addition voters in france can vote by proxy designating someone else to vote for them if they are unable to cast a ballot in person on election day which is not allowed in the u s do mail ballots affect the reporting of results they can long before the covid 19 pandemic states were expanding the use of mail ballots and early in person voting to reduce lines on election day and provide more flexibility to voters mail ballots are subject to various security checks varying by state some require voter signatures or id information to match their registration files while others require witnesses or notaries to affirm a voter s identity in most states including florida and georgia the process of validating mail ballots begins well ahead of election day providing a huge advantage in reporting results quickly that s not the case in a few political battleground states pennsylvania and wisconsin officials are not allowed to begin that work until election day while michigan officials can start just two days before this means most results being reported from these states on election night will be from in person voting on election day or during the early voting period counting votes and reporting the results take time said leigh chapman acting secretary of state in pennsylvania election officials are focused on accuracy over speed what other factors can slow results while most states require mail ballots to be received on or before election day 19 states provide a grace period as long as ballots were sent through the mail by election day such ballots in california can be received up to seven days later voters may not know the outcome of a close race for several days if a significant number of those ballots arrive at local election offices after election day this also can change results over time if democratic voters dominate mail voting while republican voters largely cast ballots in person this can mean that early results heavily favor a republican candidate who then sees that lead slip away as the late arriving mail ballots are counted would hand counting help speed up the process no hand counting of all ballots happens primarily in small towns in the northeast for places with a lot of ballots experts consider it to be more time consuming and susceptible to human error hand tallies are used in post election reviews to ensure accuracy of tabulator machines but that usually involves only a sample of ballots and is done without the time pressure of trying to report results quickly republican activists and candidates have been pushing for hand counts based largely on conspiracy theories that voting systems were manipulated to steal the 2020 election there is no evidence of widespread fraud or tampering of machines also hand counts would by themselves prolong the reporting of results perhaps by several days cobb county georgia performed a hand tally ordered by the state after the 2020 election it took hundreds of people five days to count just the votes for president on roughly 397 000 ballots a county election official estimated it would have taken 100 days to count every race on each ballot using the same procedures ___

lendingclub is reaping the benefits from the bank charter it acquired last year the online lender is holding more loans on its balance sheet and planning its next banking product for consumers san francisco based lendingclub which primarily refinances credit card debt is taking advantage of its 2021 bank acquisition as it reels in deposits high yield products and high quality held for investment loans lendingclub is also working on creating a more comprehensive checking account product and mobile banking app ceo scott sanborn said in a wednesday interview right before the company s third quarter earnings call i d say the next big thing we want to do is a checking experience that is specifically tailored for the lendingclub member sanborn said in the interview these are creditworthy people with high income high debt so a checking experience that helps them manage their spending and savings while also tracking their lending behavior or helping them save on their lending products high yield savings will be a growth engine for the company sanborn added on the wednesday evening earnings call in the third quarter deposits were up 80 year over year to 5 1 billion the deposits will help lendingclub fund the high yielding consumer loans on its balance sheet lendingclub s stock had dropped about 9 trading at 10 60 as of thursday afternoon as the federal reserve raises interest rates at a rapid clip institutional investors that previously bought loans from lendingclub face a higher cost of capital credit card rate increases lag the fed s rates and lendingclub has raised rates about 200 basis points to date the company s loans have thus become less appealing to investors seeking high returns the fintech has combated this shift by targeting more loan sales to banks which often have a slightly lower cost of capital and increasing the amount of loans it holds on its balance sheet the company held 33 of loan originations in the quarter up from 27 in q2 and well above its 20 to 25 projected range chief financial officer drew lebenne said on the earnings call that lendingclub would use the same projected range each quarter and only invest higher when opportunity allowed while rising interest rates create a tighter environment to sell loans in the marketplace sanborn added on the call that when the economic environment stabilizes higher rates will likely create an opportunity as more consumers look to refinance their debt holding more prime personal loans on its balance sheet helps lendingclub positively differentiate itself from other neobanks that don t have banking charters said wedbush equity analyst david chiaverini in a note following the earnings call the company also remixed its loan portfolio to hold more lower risk loans lebenne said on the earnings call total net revenue dipped slightly from last quarter from 330 1 million to 304 9 million net interest income increased to 123 7 million lendingclub also announced it was tightening annual revenue guidance to 1 18 billion to 1 19 billion from the previously reported 1 15 billion to 1 25 billion sanborn told american banker that the loans on the company s balance sheet represent consumers with an average fico score of 730 and income around 115 000 these consumers have higher liquidity than they did before the pandemic higher levels of prepayments and strong credit performance he said the fintech s marketplace tells a different consumer story one of the reasons we have a marketplace not just a bank is so that we can serve a broader range of consumers he said there s non bank quality loans that we make available there we do see pockets of stress we see signals that indicate that this compounding inflation we re seeing is putting a strain on people s ability to meet their obligations it s where you would expect it to be lower income less credit worthy people
municipals were steady in secondary trading while the last large deal of the week the triborough bridge and tunnel authority s 700 million of mta bridges and tunnels green bonds priced u s treasuries saw more improvements with the 10 year falling below 4 while equities ended mixed after gross domestic product and other economic data came in better than expected there has been a pullback of expectations on federal reserve tightening which has in turn resulted in ust yields falling said cooper howard a fixed income strategist focused on munis at charles schwab howard noted usts and munis have diverged over the past week with the 10 year and 30 year ust falling 28 and 12 basis points respectively and the 10 year and 30 year muni rising 25 and 35 basis points respectively per refinitiv mmd this has resulted in some underperformance on the muni side it was not necessarily too surprising because relative value was depressed with the 10 year ratio below 80 historically in october and november the 10 year muni usts ratio averages about 90 seeing some rising relative yields isn t too surprising in that sense he said municipal to ust ratios have risen this week with the 10 year approaching 90 and the 30 year topping 100 on thursday the three year was at 75 the five year at 79 the 10 year at 86 and the 30 year at 102 according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the three at 73 the five at 77 the 10 at 87 and the 30 at 102 at a 4 p m read there continue to be strong outflows from mutual funds though when looking closer at the movement of money there are still inflows into money market funds there s a lot of reallocation more towards shorter term bonds which makes sense given the shape of the yield curve much has been made about outflows from muni mutual funds he said however the outflows are occurring mostly among intermediate term and long term funds while short term mmfs are attracting assets the funds saw nearly 3 billion of inflows this week refinitiv lipper had yet to update its fund flows data as of publication this dynamic has put pressure on relative yields for short term munis which are now reading as rich relative to historical averages howard added the heavy amount of bids wanted has caused a fair amount of selling pressure and added to the volatility bids wanteds have continued to climb above 2 billion this week with wednesday s total hitting 2 375 billion as the end of october approaches howard said it s been a difficult month for municipal bond investors monthly returns are down about 1 already on the back of being down 3 84 in september and then 2 2 on august but while muni performance has been ugly it has not been as terrible as other fixed income asset classes year to date munis are down 13 02 while that s the worst performance in the history of the bloomberg municipal bond index they re outperforming both the agg and corporate bond which are down 16 7 and 20 9 respectively he said this poor performance has been rate driven and not over concerns about credit quality howard and others have noted november and december will be dictated by fed policy he believes there will be another 75 basis point rate hike at the november meeting and more guidance provide at the meeting about what the fed will do for the remainder of the year which will influence the muni market federal open market committee meetings have generally caused issuers to pull back so if there is a path of higher fed policy tighter fed policy i would suspect that there would probably be low issuance he said bond buyer

consumption an uptick in non residential fixed investment and an acceleration in government spending said mickey levy and mahmoud abu ghzalah of berenberg capital markets while this returned real gdp growth to positive territory following back to back quarterly contractions in h1 2022 and lifted the level of real gdp above that in q4 2021 the underlying details of the gdp report point to continued softening in domestic demand amid elevated but moderating inflationary pressures they said despite the rebound in headline real gdp levy and ghzalah said more nuanced gauges of domestic demand point to a broad based slowdown in real economic activity that is likely to persist as tightening financial conditions begin to bite the underlying details of the report were not very encouraging said wells fargo securities chief economist jay bryson he believes that this combination of elevated inflation which has been eroding household purchasing power as well as the aggressive pace of monetary tightening will cause the economy to slip into recession starting in the second quarter of 2023 the u s economy seems to have bounced back from those two negative gdp readings with a solid 2 6

component helped this quarter that won t remain moving forward consumer spending is softening and prices are coming down faster and business investment is weakening moya said the figure marked the end of the technical recession according to a morgan stanley research analysts the upside was driven by an increase in exports consumer spending business investment and government spending they said this was somewhat offset by a decline in residential investment and inventory investment morgan stanley research strategists expect 3q22 to mark the peak in quarterly growth as the cumulative effect of

kevin gundlach president of the south central federation of labor in madison said his office phone has been ringing constantly from workers seeking advice on unionization he estimates employees from some 20 private sector workplaces in his 11 county region around madison have sought to organize this year this is the first time we ve seen this level of interest he said there is no doubt we ve never seen this before a wave of republican laws over the past decade cratered union membership in wisconsin but recent private and public sector worker mobilization has demonstrated the staying power of organized labor labor membership in wisconsin fell dramatically after the passage of act 10 the anti public sector collective bargaining bill in 2011 with the sharpest decrease in the nation over the next decade as of 2021 wisconsin reached a new low just shy of 8 of the total workforce unionized over the past decade wisconsin unions lost 124 000 members or about a third of their ranks driven largely by the death of public sector unions i don t think any other state lost almost half their membership in one fell swoop the way that wisconsin did said university of wisconsin madison professor emeritus david nack who specializes in labor issues hundreds of union members and workers at a labor day event march from zeidler union square to henry maier festival park to listen to president joe biden speak on sept 5 2022 ricardo torres milwaukee journal sentinel hundreds of union members and workers at a labor day event march from zeidler union square to henry maier festival park to listen to president joe biden speak on sept 5 2022 ricardo torres milwaukee journal sentinel but amidst a labor shortage private and public sector workers are notching wins across the state as they organize against outsourcing budget cuts and what they consider threats to academic freedom in local schools gundlach said private sector workers are complaining of worsening conditions with the proceeds of their labor padding executive salaries and enriching corporate stock investors they re making record profits he said and they re not helping out the workers and the families within our communities gundlach was once a unionized dane county employee but act 10 changed all that stripping his union of many of its core powers and limiting its ability to bargain for raises benefits and safe working conditions the law requires a majority of all employees to vote to re certify their union each year a frustrating hurdle that caused many public sector unions to disband in madison the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme lost more than half of its membership in the past five years going from 11 062 in 2016 to just 4 848 this spring but rather than fade away some unions switched to become nontraditional employee associations while they can t collectively bargain over a contract they can speak with one voice over working conditions many county employees are now members of dane county employee group 720 a move endorsed by the dane county board which codified the right for county workers to self organize in an ordinance there continues to be friction the wisconsin state journal reported this summer that shawn tessman resigned abruptly from the county s department of human services and criticized elected officials for siding with organized employees who called into question the judgment of management privatization efforts thwarted how far act 10 goes to limit the power of organized labor in higher education is still playing out more than a decade later in oshkosh about 100 university custodians and groundskeepers faced the threat of layoffs after the uw oshkosh signaled it intended to outsource the work to a tennessee based company recruitment and retention of dedicated custodial and groundskeeping employees remains difficult in this economy chancellor andy leavitt wrote in an open letter to students and workers explaining why the university had been exploring the move to a private vendor but after students and faculty picketed and delivered multiple petitions with at least 1 000 total signatures the university administration abandoned the idea one of the forces behind the effort was a local chapter of the american federation of teachers wisconsin that doesn t have legal standing to collectively bargain for contracts for faculty members due to act 10 we have broad first amendment rights to organize and advocate for our working conditions said aft wisconsin vice president jon shelton an associate professor at uw green bay and so we ve been able to do some pretty interesting things to build power on our campuses in the past few years jon shelton professor of democracy and justice studies at the university of wisconsin green bay and vice president of higher education for the american federation of teachers wisconsin joins a protest at uw oshkosh on sept 6 2022 the protest aimed to halt the outsourcing of custodians grounds and maintenance crews faculty staff and others joined the march on campus charlie bruecker the advance titan jon shelton professor of democracy and justice studies at the university of wisconsin green bay and vice president of higher education for the american federation of teachers wisconsin joins a protest at uw oshkosh on sept 6 2022 the protest aimed to halt the outsourcing of custodians grounds and maintenance crews faculty staff and others joined the march on campus charlie bruecker the advance titan the custodians and groundskeepers had once been unionized but lost certification several years back said david siemers a uw oshkosh professor and co president of an aft wisconsin affiliated union on campus a major fear was that the workers would lose their state benefits including health care coverage if their jobs were privatized if we hadn t spoken up and if others hadn t spoken up i think they d have liked to simply wash their hands of a management problem siemers said he attributed the lack of retention to the wider problem of stagnant wages for state employees despite a multibillion dollar budget surplus the state needs to understand that it needs to pay more money in order to hire successfully siemers said another union led effort helped scuttle a similar outsourcing plan at uw river falls our locals are being creative about how to build power said shelton of uw green bay it s not like oh we can t collectively bargain in a meaningful way so let s just not do anything and wait for collective bargaining to come back what a union does is it builds power in the workplace and that s what our locals are doing threatened strike brings breakthrough in perhaps the most high profile recent example more than half of madison based uw health s 2 600 nurses threatened to strike after their quasi public employer refused to recognize their union uw health whose governing board is a mix of appointees of the legislature and governor argued that act 10 precludes it from recognizing the union after its last contract expired in 2014 uw health registered nurse tami burns said one motive for unionizing was to have more say in daily operations inside the hospital registered nurse tami burns speaks during a may 2021 press conference calling on uw health to recognize a nurses union around 2 500 nurses lost certification of their union in 2014 when their contract expired since then uw health has argued that act 10 precludes the quasi state health authority from signing a collective bargaining agreement with its workforce courtesy of seiu healthcare wisconsin registered nurse tami burns speaks during a may 2021 press conference calling on uw health to recognize a nurses union around 2 500 nurses lost certification of their union in 2014 when their contract expired since then uw health has argued that act 10 precludes the quasi state health authority from signing a collective bargaining agreement with its workforce courtesy of seiu healthcare wisconsin i mean the policies that are made are made by people who don t do the job every day she said she has worked in the vascular surgery section of university hospital in madison since 2017 she said managers have complete control over their section with nurses unable to speak up if they have concerns she said employees have no right to have an advocate in the room if they re being disciplined by a manager and if they are sanctioned and want to challenge it it s the same person who disciplines you that reviews it so i m sure you can see where that goes nowhere the end result she said is that nurses have few protections and find it difficult to have a voice in the hospital wards and to advocate on behalf of their patients that s a huge part of a nurse s job burns said it s in our code of ethics that we have to advocate for patients and it makes it really hard to do that after employees threatened a three day strike and democratic gov tony evers intervened to broker a resolution uw health administrators softened their stance asking the wisconsin employment relations commission to rule on whether the nurses can organize under act 10 private sector unionization underway unionization has increased across the nation but it s unclear whether wisconsin s private sector is following that trend the national labor relations board announced a 58 increase in petitions nationwide this summer over a nine month period but an analysis of petitions filed in wisconsin over the same period show the increase was modest 21 petitions filed compared with 17 during the same period a year earlier eight of those recent petitions were by starbucks coffee shop employees in places including madison milwaukee and appleton indeed since 2011 the rate of petitions has mostly decreased it spiked with 44 workplace petitions in 2014 but since then it has been less than 30 a year gundlach with the south central federation of labor said these figures aren t keeping pace with the activity he s seeing in his region a pro union sign is seen on the lawn of the united auto workers union building in oshkosh wis on july 15 2022 while public sector unions have been decimated by the passage in 2011 of act 10 efforts are underway around the state to create new private sector unions coburn dukehart wisconsin watch it took one group of workers six to eight months with me meeting with them for them to be willing to approach a union he said the actual vote that will occur could take a year or longer because there s a lot of organizing that gets done within the workplace before they even go public coming out of the pandemic s lockdowns has caused many workers to reassess their value as front line essential workers in services trades and manufacturing workers have a sense of the leverage and the value they have said labor economist laura dresser an associate director for the center on wisconsin strategy cows at uw madison you can see that in the high rate of churn in its state of working wisconsin report for 2022 cows sought to dispel the notion that wisconsinites are staying out of the workforce participation in the labor market is actually higher now than pre 2020 with more than two thirds of working age wisconsinites in the workforce that s several points higher than the 62 national average organizing in schools in public education wisconsin teachers unions are galvanizing members who say their academic freedom is under threat by conservative critics who want to censor their lesson plans in the superior school district parents filed a complaint over fifth graders being taught about gender identity shelton credited aft wisconsin s local in superior with organizing parents and community members to speak in defense of a 30 minute presentation used to teach fifth graders about gender identity minutes from an august 2022 school board meeting show that 30 people defended the curriculum against the six who criticized it ultimately the school board voted 5 2 to keep the curriculum in place without support oftentimes a lot of people will be afraid to teach things shelton said we think we ve really been able to impact things over the past few years in spite of the very significant legal limitations we have against us future remains unclear labor experts and leaders say there s a renewed energy across public and private labor sectors as employees increasingly push back against a long period of stagnant wages rising costs of living and shrunken benefits such as health insurance and paid time off it remains unclear whether wisconsin worker leverage is here to stay a recession could lead to higher unemployment and dilute the relatively strong position of employees but some labor experts predict the momentum will continue as more workers experience the real gains from organizing for better conditions workers are always going to advocate for equity and voice in their workplace said professor michael childers co chair of uw madison s school for workers regardless of whatever legal constructs exist to assist or thwart them jacob resneck is a report for america corps

by michael liedtke ap technology writer apple managed to boost both its sales and profit during a summertime quarter that depressed the fortunes of most other major tech companies but that doesn t necessarily mean the iphone maker will be immune to a potential recession even though apple fared reasonably well the july september results released thursday signaled that the world s most valuable company is facing some of the same economic headwinds that hammered the profits of microsoft and the corporate parents of both google and facebook apple s fiscal fourth quarter revenue rose 8 from the same time last year to 90 1 billion that was an improvement from the scant 2 uptick in revenue during its april june quarter when supply problems caused by pandemic related factory shutdowns dinged its sales the cupertino california company s profit for the most recent quarter totaled 20 72 billion or 1 29 per share up by less than 1 from the same time last year both the revenue and earnings per share were slightly above analyst estimates but on the downside sales of apple s most popular product the iphone and another big moneymaker and the services division were both lower than analysts had been anticipating a sign consumers may be cutting back amid the highest inflation in 40 years apple is facing increasingly difficult economic conditions ceo tim cook acknowledged during a thursday conference call with analysts a lot of people in a lot of places are struggling those challenges are one of the reasons apple expects its revenue growth to decelerate during the current october december period even though this year s quarter will include one more week than last year s apple s chief financial officer luca maestri warned during conference call the strong u s dollar which has lowered apple s reported sales internationally is also contributing to the anticipated slowdown investors initially reacted negatively after maestri s made that forecast driving down apple s shares by about 3 in extended trading but seemed to be feeling more optimistic about the company s prospects by the time management concluded the conference call apple s shares were up by more than 1 late thursday mirroring other once high flying stocks in tech apple s stock still has dropped almost 20 so far in 2022 the iphone still apple s marquee product 15 years after its debut accounted for most of its success during the past quarter even though the company didn t sell quite as many of the devices as analysts had hoped boosted by the release of four new models in late september iphones sales climbed 10 from the same time last year to 42 63 billion but industry analysts are starting to fret over how much longer consumers will splurge on new phones as they feel the pinch of the past year s stubbornly high inflation rates if those financial pressures persist it could cause more households to curtail their spending during the holiday shopping season especially on the kind of pricey gadgets that are apple s cornerstone that s one of the primary reasons the research firm international data corp is now expecting worldwide smartphone shipments this year to fall 6 5 from 2021 a downward revision of three full percentage points translating into about 150 million fewer devices being sold from an earlier forecast made in may apple won t suffer as much as the makers of phones running on google s android operating system idc predicted but it still will result in a significant slowdown idc projects iphone shipments will edge up by less 0 5 with the average selling price of the device hovering around 950 through the first nine months of this year iphone sales are up 6 from last year we knew apple s iphone business was slowing down but we re also starting to see that trickle into their services segment which will be one cause for concern said investing com analyst jesse cohen maestri told analysts that weaker sales of advertising and gaming were the biggest drag on the services division during the most recent quarter

all the major u s airlines have reported their third quarter earnings now and despite talks of a recession in the broad economy amid record inflation fluctuating fuel prices and hard to fix workforce challenges the commercial airline industry is still booming southwest airlines nasdaq luv shared earlier today in its third quarter report that it generated a record operating revenue of 6 2 billion which was 10 3 percent better than the third quarter of 2019 in which travel was last considered normal the resulting 277 million quarterly profit reflects a 33 percent improvement from last year following record summer leisure travel demand revenue trends remained strong in september 2022 bolstered by improving business travel trends post labor day southwest ceo bob jordan said southwest said it was on track to meet its 2022 goal of hiring 10 000 employees the carrier achieved that even with an 85 4 percent load factor which is a few points better than the 83 5 percent it had for the third quarter of 2019 despite the trend southwest reported while bookings for the final quarter of the year look strong that it continues to experience inflationary cost pressures in fourth quarter 2022 in particular with higher rates for labor benefits and airports the airline also said it expected a decrease in productivity from not having enough workers eating into its earnings in the fourth quarter still the company said it was on track to meet its 2022 goal of hiring 10 000 employees high profits not enough people this trend isn t unique to southwest the u s department of commerce gdp report published thursday also showed the u s economy grew at a 2 6 percent annual rate in july august and september compared to the first half of the year where the overall economy shrank even with the federal reserve s commitment to raising interest rates as a way to combat inflation the travel market is one of the few sectors benefiting from pent up pandemic demand but grappling to keep up because of staffing issues despite raking in 695 million of quarterly profit on a record 14 billion revenue delta air lines ceo ed bastian expressed on the airline s early october earnings call that a workforce shortage prevented the airline from realizing its full potential we continue to make good progress in clearing those bottlenecks and getting our pilots into seats and categories every week bastian said of the pilot training bottleneck our goal is to be in a position to have our network fully restored by the summer and the pilots are obviously a big part of that even united airlines nasdaq ual and american airlines nasdaq aal have shared the same sentiment especially around the training backlog when united reported a third quarter profit of 942 million on 12 88 billion in revenue its president brett hart shared that united was dedicated to hiring at least 200 pilots a month andrew nocella an executive vice president and chief commercial officer painted a more critical picture pilot recruiting training and retention we believe are real constraints for the industry for years to come nocella said american the largest operator whose revenue rose to a record 13 46 billion for the third quarter admitted that it too had its hiring challenges there are constraints out there notably pilot constraints both for the regional side and just the massive amount of training that we have to do on the mainline side said american s ceo robert isom on the company s october 20 earnings call he explained that is partly why the airline still hasn t been able to deploy its entire fleet and that it would take some time fortunately the other headwind which comes in the form of higher fuel prices following supply constraints from the disruption of the russian ukraine conflict has allowed airlines to pass through higher prices to customers who have yet to flinch for american the company said its fuel bill for the quarter more than 3 8 billion was nearly twice what it paid last year in the same period though each airline has its strategy for saving on some of its fuel prices the persistent travel demand remains in its favor as for the rest of the year the airlines are optimistic provided they can find the people they need to fulfill their planned activity

or replaying the story in its archived form does not constitute a republication of the story san francisco elon musk has taken control of twitter and ousted the ceo chief financial officer and the company s general counsel two people familiar with the deal said thursday night the people wouldn t say if all the paperwork for the deal originally valued at 44 billion had been signed or if the deal has closed but they said musk is in charge of the social media platform and has fired ceo parag agrawal cfo ned segal and general counsel vijaya gadde neither person wanted to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the deal the departures come just hours before a deadline set by a delaware judge to finalize the deal on friday she threatened to schedule a trial if no agreement was reached the major personnel moves are expected to be the first of many changes made by musk who says he can increase twitter s subscriber base and ad revenue earlier in the day musk tried to soothe leery twitter advertisers saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn t want it to become a free for all hellscape the message appeared to be aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers twitter s chief source of revenue that musk s plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users the reason i acquired twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the tesla ceo who typically projects his thoughts in one line tweets he continued there is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society musk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and twitter s dependence on it suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won t allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates but on thursday he assured advertisers he wants twitter to be the most respected advertising platform in the world the note is a shift from musk s position that twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content said pinar yildirim associate professor of marketing at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school but it s also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business putting twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers she said you do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about and the platform takes no responsibility yildirim said musk said twitter should be warm and welcoming to all and enable users to choose the experience they want to have dear twitter advertisers pic twitter com gmwhminpas elon musk elonmusk october 27 2022 i didn t do it to make money he said of the pending acquisition i did it to try to help humanity whom i love and i do so with humility recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal despite our best efforts is a very real possibility friday s deadline to close the deal was ordered by the delaware chancery court in early october it is the latest step in a battle that began in april with musk signing a deal to acquire twitter then tried to back out of it leading twitter to sue the tesla ceo to force him to go through with the acquisition if the two sides don t meet friday s deadline the next step could be a november trial that could lead to a judge forcing musk to complete the deal but musk has been signaling that the deal is going through he strolled into the company s san francisco headquarters wednesday carrying a porcelain sink changed his twitter profile to chief twit and tweeted entering twitter hq let that sink in and overnight the new york stock exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of twitter before the opening bell friday in anticipation of the company going private under musk a sign is pictured outside the twitter headquarters in san francisco wednesday oct 26 a court has given elon musk until friday to close his april agreement to acquire the company after he earlier tried to back out of the deal photo godofredo a vásquez associated press musk is expected to speak to twitter employees directly friday if the deal is finalized according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company s culture and operations twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed musk s arrival and messaging top sales executive sarah personette the company s chief customer officer said she had a great discussion with musk on wednesday and appeared to endorse his thursday message to advertisers our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged personette tweeted thursday looking forward to the future musk s apparent enthusiasm about visiting twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions the building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there entering twitter hq let that sink in pic twitter com d68z4k2wq7 elon musk elonmusk october 26 2022 the washington post reported last week that musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of twitter s 7 500 workers when he becomes owner of the company the newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation musk has spent months deriding twitter s spam bots and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about twitter s problems and how to fix them but he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform thursday s note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue especially a need for twitter to provide more relevant ads which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users personal information yildirim said that unlike facebook twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see musk s message suggests he wants to fix that she said there is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society elon musk insider intelligence principal analyst jasmine enberg said musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of twitter s ad business because twitter s revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy months of uncertainty surrounding musk s proposed takeover changing consumer behaviors and the fact that there s no other revenue source waiting in the wings even slightly loosening content moderation on the platform is sure to spook advertisers many of whom already find twitter s brand safety tools to be lacking compared with other social platforms enberg said

updated october 27 2022 at 11 22 am et elon musk lugged a sink into twitter headquarters on wednesday entering twitter hq let that sink in he captioned the video which he posted on twitter he also renamed himself chief twit on the social network musk has been founding companies since the dawn of the internet age he s grown tesla spacex and paypal into the blue chips that they are today but the financially struggling social media company which he is expected to buy by friday needs something more to become a success story said andy wu who teaches business strategy at harvard business school musk has no experience in managing organizational change and there s definitely an embedded culture at twitter that he ll have to change in order to achieve some of his goals wu said the challenge has only grown since musk first offered to buy twitter in the spring for 54 20 a share or about 44 billion tech stocks have struggled along with the broader market it didn t help that musk openly criticized the company tried to walk away from the deal and only changed his mind after a high profile and expensive legal battle neared trial at one point twitter s stock lost a quarter of its value myself and other investors are obviously overpaying for twitter right now musk said on a call with tesla investors last week he acknowledged on thursday that there was a lot of speculation about why he was buying twitter after all his wavering it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of believes can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence he wrote in an open letter to twitter advertisers that is why i bought twitter i didn t do it because it would be easy i didn t do it to make more money he added acknowledging that failure was a very real possibility he has floated big plans for twitter he wants to slim it down while getting rid of fake accounts loosen its rules on what users can say on the platform and build it into an everything app experts say succeeding at even one of these goals would be hard enough entering twitter hq let that sink in pic twitter com d68z4k2wq7 elon musk elonmusk october 26 2022 musk revolutionized the electric car industry and privatized space throughout his career musk has chased bold sci fi like visions he fast forwarded the electric car industry and sent rockets into space people thought spacex was a crazy idea he was going to launch satellites who does that the government does that and he proved all of his skeptics wrong he launches satellites for much less money than the government said erik gordon professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the university of michigan s ross school of business he s gone through this before and landed like a cat tesla was on the edge of insolvency more than once due to manufacturing and logistics problems that piled delays on top of delays musk sunk millions of his own money into the company as it burned through cash and struggled to make deliveries in 2018 he famously slept on the floor of the tesla factory to troubleshoot the assembly line and oversee the paint shop musk is a genius at persuading the financial markets to back his risky investments said tim higgins who wrote power play tesla elon musk and the bet of the century probably the biggest contribution he had to tesla was his ability to sell his vision of the future to customers but more importantly to investors to raise the billions and billions of dollars that were needed to keep tesla afloat until it could become a viable company he said that power has gotten musk into trouble in the middle of tesla s struggles musk tweeted that he planned to take tesla private at 420 a share the stock price soared leading the securities and exchange commission to investigate whether musk had misled investors in the end musk gave up his role as chair of tesla s board and paid a 20 million fine to settle tesla paid another 20 million he also agreed to let a tesla lawyer review his tweets the company remains publicly traded am considering taking tesla private at 420 funding secured elon musk elonmusk august 7 2018 musk s fundraising magic worked with spacex too even when its rockets repeatedly blew up the falcon the dragon the super heavy rockets all exploded spectacularly on the launchpad or while attempting to land spacex has since successfully flown astronauts to the international space station in the partially re useable falcon rocket in his tweets musk put a spin on the spectacular explosions as a new approach to the staid military industrial spacecraft industry applying the software industry s iterative process to rocketry all he had to do was tweet something like oh everything is actually wonderful i couldn t be happier about all of these disasters it s going to be great and he raised lots of money higgins said he s a money raising genius musk s ability to raise money on command was also on display during his legal fight with twitter the lawsuit made public a cache of his personal text messages in which silicon valley heavyweights jockeyed to invest in twitter some consider musk a visionary others see a troll tesla is fighting a racial discrimination and harassment lawsuit that a california agency filed on behalf of 4 000 black tesla employees several women have filed lawsuits alleging tesla fostered a culture of sexual harassment at its fremont plant and other facilities also during the first months of the pandemic the fremont calif tesla factory continued operating despite orders from local public health officials to shut down to prevent the spread of covid there s a sense in which musk is like teletransported from another era of business and is just unconcerned about things you know like it s 1952 gordon said he has huge zones of non concern most companies 30 years ago didn t care about sexual harassment or racial discrimination on twitter musk readily trolls those who disagree with him or appear to be rivals his ego has been on display to his 110 million followers throughout the twitter legal saga after twitter ceo parag agrawal tweeted a detailed explanation of the company s efforts to combat spam musk responded with a poop emoji elon musk elonmusk may 16 2022 musk has pledged to loosen twitter s rules on what people can post to the platform he s said twitter was wrong to ban former president donald trump after the jan 6 attack on the u s capitol many twitter users have openly worried that the network will soon become more racist sexist and toxic musk tried to allay some of those fears in his letter to advertisers thursday twitter obviously cannot become a free for all hellscape where anything can be said with no consequences he said twitter is a different sort of challenge for musk while many people are nervous about what sort of social network twitter will become under musk it has never been a healthy company during tesla s earnings call last week musk said twitter sort of languished for a long time but has incredible potential while twitter is often used by politicians and journalists it has fewer u s users than facebook tiktok or youtube it has struggled to attract ad dollars and to create services that users will pay for internal company documents obtained by reuters say now even heavy tweeters are using the platform less musk plans to address twitter staff on friday he s said he wants to trim their ranks dramatically time has reported that twitter employees are circulating a petition asking musk to preserve the current headcount and staff benefits layoffs would hurt twitter s ability to serve the public conversation the petition reads yet higgins the biographer expects many employees will choose not to work for musk he can be infuriating and inspiring in almost the same breath it just depends on the elon musk you get that day higgins said i have no doubt that if and when he gets into twitter he s going to anger a lot of people there and a lot of people will probably leave in addition it s going to be hard to create a social network that is truly warm and welcoming to all as musk says he wants and not the free for all hellscape he says he ll avoid that may be a very dangerous experiment according to harvard s wu social networks like parler gab and truthsocial which take a more hands off approach to content moderation have a tiny fraction of the users that mainstream platforms have people have used them to spread hate speech threaten violence and share harmful misinformation that

by saleha mohsin bloomberg us officials have been forced to scale back a plan to impose a cap on russian oil prices following skepticism by investors and growing risk in financial markets brought on by crude volatility and central bank efforts to tame inflation instead of strangling the kremlin s oil revenues by imposing a strict lid on prices that would have been observed by a broad buyer s cartel of nations the us and european union are likely to settle for a more loosely policed cap at a higher price than once envisioned with just group of seven nations and australia committed to abide by it according to people familiar with the matter south korea has also privately told g 7 nations it plans to comply the people said g 7 officials are seeking to bring new zealand and norway on board as well but it s clear that india and china russia s most important trade partners will not participate the people said under an earlier iteration of the us plan which has been spearheaded internally and externally by treasury secretary janet yellen a price cap in the range of 40 to 60 per barrel was under consideration with some officials eager to keep the limit as close to the lower end as possible to achieve the key objective of reducing russia s cash flow but now officials involved in the plans are discussing a cap at the higher end of that range and above even though some eu officials believe that would allow the kremlin to continue to gain sizable revenue from sales the people familiar with the matter asked not to be identified because the russia price cap s terms are still in development the white house and the administration are staying the course on implementing an effective strong price cap on russian oil in coordination with the g 7 and other partners a spokeswoman for the white house s national security council adrienne watson said in a statement it is the most effective way to ensure that oil continues to flow into the market at lower prices and hit hard at putin s revenue to fund his war in response to a request for comment a senior treasury official said that the us has never discussed a range for the price cap with allies russia took in an estimated 15 billion from oil sales in september helping to fuel its war machine in ukraine a flow of money that us and european leaders have sought to curb ever since russian president vladimir putin ordered his invasion but in a global market dominated by countries without democratic governments led by saudi arabia the mechanics of a price cap designed by consumers and aimed at a single producer threaten to be too complicated to achieve brent crude the global benchmark traded around 96 a barrel wednesday it rose to over 139 in early march following russia s invasion extreme price gyrations this year have cut liquidity in commodity markets which has in turn fueled further price swings the average delivery price for urals crude a major russian export was 63 a barrel for the past three years and 64 over five years according to data from price reporting agency argus media it has averaged about 74 this month as of the end of last week the shift in us thinking on a price cap comes after washington spent months pressuring the europeans to amend their sanctions on russian oil the development is likely to add to eu frustrations with some officials noting that they believe the us has placed more emphasis on bolstering global oil supplies and hasn t always been as prepared as europe to take an economic hit to punish russia the treasury department says that setting a higher price cap could make the initiative more likely to succeed in keeping russian oil on the market while still curbing moscow s revenue putin has said russia won t sell oil to anyone who participates in the us eu price cap a threat us officials once regarded as hollow but that is now seen as viable the senior treasury official contended that the biden administration has always been aware that putin could retaliate energy prices especially for oil and gasoline are playing an outsize role in us midterm elections on nov 8 that will decide control of congress president joe biden has sought to curb a spike in prices for us motorists that followed russia s invasion including through a record release from us oil reserves and public pressure on opec and refiners doubts about a russian oil price cap emerged from the start of yellen s efforts and they were amplified after the opec cartel which includes russia on oct 5 announced a surprise production cut of 2 million barrels per day some us officials feared the move would undermine any price cap and biden publicly accused the saudi government of throwing its lot in with the kremlin the price cap in its final form is expected to be announced before dec 5 when eu sanctions are set to go into effect on services such as insurance brokerage and financial assistance involved in transporting russian oil to international customers the biden administration sees the price cap contributing to stability in markets by assuring that russian oil can continue to flow and allowing developing nations to make purchases at a discounted level according to the senior treasury official the agency has also sought to ensure that the private sector has a clear understanding of how the price cap will operate on a technical level through listening sessions and guidance issued on the treasury department website the official said but officials involved in developing the price cap were already worried that it could backfire producing even more volatility in global oil prices speaking broadly about the global economy yellen on monday warned of a dangerous and volatile environment developing across the global economy including a surge in energy prices and turbulence in financial markets she did not refer specifically to a price cap in those comments in such a situation she said financial stability risks could materialize in the us yellen was a top official at the federal reserve during the global financial crisis which still haunts policymakers today the price cap mechanism adopted by the eu would require third country buyers of russian oil to agree to pay less than the cap in order to ship and insure their cargo with europe based companies us and eu officials believe that approach would work because a key cog in cargo insurance is the international group of p i clubs which covers 90 of the world s ships many of the group s clubs are based in london with european entities or reinsurance partners meaning they fall under eu regulations companies that insure russian oil cargoes at prices above the cap would be subject to the eu s new sanctions they include a ban on shipping and a provision that would ban vessels from accessing european services for all oil regardless of origin if a tanker transports russian crude sold above the cap that clause is intended as an incentive for buyers to adhere to the cap however some industry experts believe that leverage is insufficient as russia could access alternative ships and insurance services as well as retaliate by declining to export to customers abiding by the cap exxon mobil corp officials set out similar considerations to the eu in a presentation in august according to people with knowledge of the matter the eu s price cap plan is conditioned on the g 7 adopting it failure by the g 7 to reach its own agreement would currently see an outright ban on russian oil services which the eu adopted in june come into force the us has pushed for the cap in part because officials feared that the eu s ban would lead to a spike in global oil prices the us had also privately discussed with allies using enforcement tools such as secondary sanctions alongside the cap according to people familiar with talks that took place earlier this year but us deputy treasury secretary wally adeyemo has publicly ruled out that option adding to skepticism that the price cap scheme will work one eu official said it was hard to see the cap working without an enforcement mechanism not least because key buyers such as india china and turkey were highly unlikely to sign up for any agreement no decision is expected before the us elections the eu aims to establish a price cap around nov 25 about 10 days before the bloc s new sanctions kick in on services for russian oil shipments by saleha mohsin alberto nardelli and ewa krukowska with assistance from jennifer jacobs josh wingrove and christopher condon 2022 bloomberg l p

quite what hudson wanted yet the dealer was asking only slightly above sticker price and hudson felt in no position to walk away she s back in business with her own van it could have been worse hudson made her purchase just as the prices of both new and used vehicles have been inching down from their eye watering record highs and more vehicles are gradually becoming available at dealerships hudson s van likely would have cost even more a few months ago not that anyone should expect prices to fall anywhere near where they were before the pandemic recession struck in early 2020 the swift recovery from the recession left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand price skyrocketed and they ve scarcely budged since prices on new and used vehicles remain 30 to 50 above where they were when the pandemic erupted the average used auto cost nearly 31 000 last month the average new 47 000 with higher prices and loan rates combining to push average monthly payments on a new vehicle above 700 millions of buyers have been priced out of the new vehicle market and are now confined to used vehicles the high prices are yielding substantial profits for most automakers despite sluggish sales on tuesday for example general motors reported that its third quarter net profit jumped more than 36 thanks in part to sales of pricey pickup trucks and large suvs still as hudson discovered many vehicles are becoming slightly more affordable signs first emerged weeks ago in the 40 million sales a year used market as demand waned and inventories rose prices eased from their springtime heights carmax said it sold nearly 15 000 fewer vehicles last quarter than it had a year earlier the ceo of the used vehicle company based in richmond virginia pointed to inflation higher borrowing rates and diminished consumer confidence a buyer s strike is how adam joans an auto analyst at morgan stanley characterized the sales drops a dynamic that typically foretells lower prices and indeed the average used vehicle price in september was down 1 from its may peak according to edmunds com at autonation the nation s largest dealership chain sales of used vehicles and profit per vehicle both dropped last quarter ceo mike manley noted that while the supply of vehicles remains low used auto prices are declining our analysis shows that we are coming off the high values that we saw before manley told analysts thursday ivan drury director of insights at edmunds cautioned that it will take years for used prices to fall close to their pre pandemic levels since 2020 automakers haven t been leasing as many cars thereby choking off one key source of late model used vehicles similarly rental companies haven t been able to buy many new vehicles so eventually they are selling fewer autos into the used market that s crimped another source of vehicles and because used cars aren t sitting long on dealer lots demand remains strong enough to prop up prices when auto prices first soared two years ago lower income buyers were elbowed out of the new vehicle market eventually many of them couldn t afford even used autos people with subprime credit scores 620 or below bought only 5 of new vehicles last month down from nearly 9 before the pandemic that indicated that many lower income households could no longer afford vehicles said j d power vice president tyson jominy higher borrowing rates have compounded the problem in january 2020 shortly before the pandemic hit used vehicle buyers paid an average of 8 4 annual interest according to edmunds monthly payments averaged 412 by last month the average rate had reached 9 2 and because prices had risen for over two years the average payment had jumped to 567 the 1 average drop in used prices will help financially secure buyers with solid credit scores who can qualify for lower loan rates but for those with poor credit and lower incomes any price drop will be wiped out by higher borrowing costs the new vehicle market by contrast has become an option mainly for affluent buyers automakers are increasingly deploying scarce computer chips to make costly loaded out versions of pickups suvs and other outsize vehicles typically with relatively low gas mileage last month the average price of a new vehicle was down slightly from august but remained more than 11 000 above its level in january 2020 glenn mears who runs five dealerships south of canton ohio says the federal reserve s interest rate hikes by contributing to pricier auto loans are slowing his showroom traffic we can feel some pullback he said analysts generally say that with shortages of computer chips and other parts still hobbling factories new vehicle prices won t likely fall substantially but further modest price drops may be likely the availability of vehicles on u s dealer lots improved to nearly 1 4 million vehicles last month up from 1 million for most of the year cox automotive reported before the pandemic normal supply was far higher around 4 million so historically speaking inventory remains tight and demand still high like hudson many buyers are still stuck paying sticker price or above it s extraordinarily expensive these days said jominy who estimates that there are still 5 million u s customers waiting to buy new vehicles despite recent stock market declines many such buyers have built up wealth especially in their homes and are rewarding themselves with high end autos in the san francisco bay area for example notes inder dosanjh who runs a 20 dealership group that includes general motors ford acura volkswagen and stellantis brands many people have received substantial pay raises there s just a lot of money out there he said in its earnings report tuesday gm noted that its customer demand is holding up though gm and other automakers would like to produce more vehicles at the moment they are benefiting from slower production which typically means higher prices and profits john lawler ford s chief financial officer noted wednesday that near record new vehicle prices were starting to decline and consumer appetites are starting to change demand for midrange vehicles he said has begun to outpace more profitable autos loaded with options next year could be a turning point suggested jeff windau an analyst at edward jones with the economy likely to weaken and possibly enter a recession prices could fall as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they re willing to bite off from a payment perspective
packages move along a conveyor belt at an amazon com warehouse in sacramento amazon is expecting 140 billion to 148 billion in fourth quarter revenue far short of analysts average estimate of 156 billion amazon com shocking wall street has projected the slowest holiday quarter growth in the company s history the shares plunged about 13 in extended trading the seattle based company which reaped record profits during the pandemic said sales during the current period will rise just 2 to 8 as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty any figure in that range would be the slowest increase ever for amazon s peak season which usually finds warehouse employees rushing to get orders out on time and the e commerce giant s other businesses aren t riding to the rescue amazon web services the cloud computing division and the advertising unit each reported muted third quarter revenue growth by their lofty standards advertisement we re taking actions to tighten our belt chief financial officer brian olsavsky said thursday on a call with journalists after the results were released olsavsky said amazon would pause hiring in some businesses and wind down products and services in areas where the company determines its money would be better spent elsewhere the world s largest online retailer had spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre pandemic habits amazon delayed warehouse openings froze hiring in its retail group and shut down experimental projects some investors had hoped the company s commanding market share in the u s and europe the massive scale of its logistics business and the cost cutting would insulate amazon from slowing consumer spending advertisement the forecast suggests that isn t the case and amazon joined other previously high flying tech giants such as alphabet and microsoft in reporting disappointing results asked about how the upcoming shopping season olsavsky said amazon is optimistic about the holiday but we re realistic that various forces are weighing on people s wallets amazon projected that revenue would be 140 billion to 148 billion in the fourth quarter far short of analysts average estimate of 156 billion some independent sellers on amazon s website who account for a majority of unit sales are bracing for a rough holiday season adobe forecast that u s e commerce sales in november and december will rise just 2 5 from the prior year advertisement in the period ended sept 30 revenue increased 15 to 127 1 billion amazon said in a statement analysts had projected sales of 127 6 billion profit was 28 cents a share compared with 31 cents a year earlier adjusting for a 20 to 1 stock split that took effect in june amazon said changes in foreign exchange rates primarily a strengthening u s dollar that made the company s sales in other currencies less lucrative reduced its revenue during the quarter by about 5 billion the company expects those headwinds to continue through the current period contributing to the weak guidance despite chief executive officer andy jassy s pledge to cut costs amazon s expenses jumped almost 18 to 125 billion it was the fifth consecutive quarter the company s expenses have increased faster than revenue growth the number of full and part time employees rose 5 to more than 1 54 million advertisement business amazon union push at moreno valley warehouse stalls a group of amazon workers in california have withdrawn a petition to hold a union election but it s a temporary setback the workers say the core e commerce business has come under pressure from changing shopping habits from the boom seen over the pandemic and a consumer with less disposable income said matt britzman an analyst at hargreaves lansdown clearly amazon went too big too soon on its expansion plans and it s had to put the brakes on and then some to try and get costs back under control technology and content expenses a rough proxy for the company s spending on research and development as well as aws surged 35 the biggest jump since 2018 that partly reflects bigger stock payouts amazon is making to recruit and retain employees in a competitive market for technologists still amazon returned to profitability after two quarters of losses posting 2 9 billion in net income the prior losses reflected declines in the value of the company s roughly 17 stake in rivian automotive the electric automaker s shares are down sharply following a november initial public offering but have steadied in recent months advertisement sales at aws increased 27 to 20 5 billion analysts on average projected 21 billion according to data compiled by bloomberg it was the cloud unit s slowest year over year growth since amazon began breaking out the division s performance going back to 2014 the backlog of cash that businesses and governments have committed to spending on the cloud unit in the future climbed to 104 billion though amazon executives said business customers had also asked the company for help lowering their bills for the service advertising unit revenue rose 25 to 9 5 billion roughly half the growth rate it has posted on average since amazon began reporting the division s results online store revenue rose 7 1 to 53 5 billion advertisement the shares fell to a low of 87 59 in extended trading after closing at 110 96 in new york the stock has dropped 33 this year bloomberg staff writer spencer soper contributed to this report

loading error loading elon musk attempted to soothe leery twitter advertisers thursday a day before a deadline to close out on his 44 billion acquisition of the social media platform saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn t want it to become a free for all hellscape the message appears aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers twitter s chief source of revenue that musk s plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users advertisement the reason i acquired twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the tesla ceo who typically projects his thoughts in one line tweets he continued there is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society musk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and twitter s dependence on it suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won t allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates but on thursday he assured advertisers he wants twitter to be the most respected advertising platform in the world the note is a shift from musk s position that twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content said pinar yildirim associate professor of marketing at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school advertisement but it s also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business putting twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers she said you do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about and the platform takes no responsibility yildirim said musk said twitter should be warm and welcoming to all and enable users to choose the experience they want to have i didn t do it to make money he said of the pending acquisition i did it to try to help humanity whom i love and i do so with humility recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal despite our best efforts is a very real possibility friday s deadline to close the deal was ordered by the delaware chancery court in early october it is the latest step in a battle that began in april with musk signing a deal to acquire twitter then tried to back out of it leading twitter to sue the tesla ceo to force him to go through with the acquisition if the two sides don t meet friday s deadline the next step could be a november trial that could lead to a judge forcing musk to complete the deal advertisement but musk has been signaling that the deal is going through he strolled into the company s san francisco headquarters wednesday carrying a porcelain sink changed his twitter profile to chief twit and tweeted entering twitter hq let that sink in and over night the new york stock exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of twitter before the opening bell friday in anticipation of the company going private under musk musk is expected to speak to twitter employees directly friday if the deal is finalized according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company s culture and operations twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed musk s arrival and messaging top sales executive sarah personette the company s chief customer officer said she had a great discussion with musk on wednesday and appeared to endorse his thursday message to advertisers our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged personette tweeted thursday looking forward to the future advertisement musk s apparent enthusiasm about visiting twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions the building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there the washington post reported last week that musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of twitter s 7 500 workers when he becomes owner of the company the newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation musk has spent months deriding twitter s spam bots and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about twitter s problems and how to fix them but he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform thursday s note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue especially a need for twitter to provide more relevant ads which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users personal information yildirim said that unlike facebook twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see musk s message suggests he wants to fix that she said advertisement insider intelligence principal analyst jasmine enberg said musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of twitter s ad business because twitter s revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy months of uncertainty surrounding musk s proposed takeover changing consumer behaviors and the fact that there s no other revenue source waiting in the wings even slightly loosening content moderation on the platform is sure to spook advertisers many of whom already find twitter s brand safety tools to be lacking compared with other social platforms enberg said
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video results released on election night are unofficial and always incomplete they inevitably change as more ballots are counted washington it s the night of the election polls have been closed for hours why don t americans know the winners in 2020 president donald trump proclaimed that the lack of final results on election night could be an indicator of something nefarious and used it to assert without evidence that the election was stolen we don t want them to find any more ballots at 4 o clock in the morning and add them to the list he said in reality however results released on election night are unofficial and always incomplete they inevitably change as more ballots are counted unlike in many countries elections in the u s are highly decentralized complex and feature long lists of races from president and congress all the way down to local measures and town council seats some states give local election offices several weeks before election day to process mailed ballots including checking signatures and verifying id information in other states that process can t start until election day or shortly before meaning those ballots might not get counted until the next day or even later here s s why results are not always known the night of an election should we know the winners before going to bed republicans in particular have pointed to perceived delays in knowing results as a reason to be suspicious about the integrity of elections we ve got to get our elections reformed so that every arizonan whether they be democrat independent or republican when they go to bed on election night they know the winner and they re satisfied that it was a fair election we don t have that right now kari lake the trump endorsed republican candidate for governor in arizona said in august on twitter not knowing the winner on election night says nothing about the fairness of an election or the accuracy of results under arizona law all ballots including those that were mailed must be returned by 7 p m on election day but officials have 20 days to finalize their counts in nevada counties have four days to count late arriving mailed ballots and give voters two more days to fix mailed ballots that arrive in envelopes with errors or missing information this week the elections official in the county that includes reno reminded voters of that extended timeline and said final official results are unlikely until the actual canvass of the vote on nov 18 it will definitely be more than the day after the election for final results of the election said jamie rodriguez washoe county s interim registrar of voters why can t we be like france a close republican primary for u s senate in pennsylvania last may triggered comparisons to the french presidential election which had been held a few weeks earlier trump in a social media post two days after the pennsylvania primary questioned why it was taking so long to find out the winner france same day all paper had verified numbers in evening trump wrote u s is a laughing stock on elections but in france there was only one contest on the ballot presidential and parliamentary elections are held on separate dates in pennsylvania the u s senate gop primary was just one of several contests being decided including races for governor attorney general congress and state legislature u s elections also are not nationalized but rather overseen by states and run by local officials at the county or even township level the u s has some 10 000 jurisdictions charged with overseeing the voting process for presidential elections in france the ministry of interior distributes election related materials including ballots while local officials coordinate staffing of polling places france also has a constitutional council that decides election related complaints and announces results noah praetz the former elections clerk in cook county illinois said it s possible to have quick results but the u s has decided to make voting accessible to everybody and let us vote on everything he noted that ballots in the u s typically include dozens of offices in contrast to some countries where voters might simply back a party whose leadership then fills many of those positions in france voters choose from lists of local candidates usually associated with a party the candidate list gaining the most support will receive the most seats in the city and regional councils it s a fundamentally different view of democracy praetz said in addition voters in france can vote by proxy designating someone else to vote for them if they are unable to cast a ballot in person on election day which is not allowed in the u s do mail ballots affect the reporting of results they can long before the covid 19 pandemic states were expanding the use of mail ballots and early in person voting to reduce lines on election day and provide more flexibility to voters mail ballots are subject to various security checks varying by state some require voter signatures or id information to match their registration files while others require witnesses or notaries to affirm a voter s identity in most states including florida and georgia the process of validating mail ballots begins well ahead of election day providing a huge advantage in reporting results quickly that s not the case in a few political battleground states pennsylvania and wisconsin officials are not allowed to begin that work until election day while michigan officials can start just two days before this means most results being reported from these states on election night will be from in person voting on election day or during the early voting period counting votes and reporting the results take time said leigh chapman acting secretary of state in pennsylvania election officials are focused on accuracy over speed what other factors can slow results while most states require mail ballots to be received on or before election day 19 states provide a grace period as long as ballots were sent through the mail by election day such ballots in california can be received up to seven days later voters may not know the outcome of a close race for several days if a significant number of those ballots arrive at local election offices after election day this also can change results over time if democratic voters dominate mail voting while republican voters largely cast ballots in person this can mean that early results heavily favor a republican candidate who then sees that lead slip away as the late arriving mail ballots are counted would hand counting help speed up the process no hand counting of all ballots happens primarily in small towns in the northeast for places with a lot of ballots experts consider it to be more time consuming and susceptible to human error hand tallies are used in post election reviews to ensure accuracy of tabulator machines but that usually involves only a sample of ballots and is done without the time pressure of trying to report results quickly also hand counts would by themselves prolong the reporting of results perhaps by several days cobb county georgia performed a hand tally ordered by the state after the 2020 election it took hundreds of people five days to count just the votes for president on roughly 397 000 ballots a county election official estimated it would have taken 100 days to count every race on each ballot using the same procedures

the swift recovery from the short recession of early 2020 left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand prices skyrocketed and have barely budged example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video detroit all summer long aleen hudson kept looking for a new minivan or suv for her growing passenger shuttle service she had a good credit rating and enough cash for a down payment yet dealerships in the detroit area didn t have any suitable vehicles or they d demand she pay 3 000 to 6 000 above the sticker price months of frustration left her despondent i was depressed hudson said i was angry too a breakthrough arrived in late september when a dealer called about a 2022 chrysler pacifica at 41 000 it was hardly a bargain and it wasn t quite what hudson wanted yet the dealer was asking only slightly above sticker price and hudson felt in no position to walk away she s back in business with her own van it could have been worse hudson made her purchase just as the prices of both new and used vehicles have been inching down from their eye watering record highs and more vehicles are gradually becoming available at dealerships hudson s van likely would have cost even more a few months ago not that anyone should expect prices to fall anywhere near where they were before the pandemic recession struck in early 2020 the swift recovery from the recession left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand price skyrocketed and they ve scarcely budged since prices on new and used vehicles remain 30 to 50 above where they were when the pandemic erupted the average used auto cost nearly 31 000 last month the average new 47 000 with higher prices and loan rates combining to push average monthly payments on a new vehicle above 700 millions of buyers have been priced out of the new vehicle market and are now confined to used vehicles the high prices are yielding substantial profits for most automakers despite sluggish sales on tuesday for example general motors reported that its third quarter net profit jumped more than 36 thanks in part to sales of pricey pickup trucks and large suvs still as hudson discovered many vehicles are becoming slightly more affordable signs first emerged weeks ago in the 40 million sales a year used market as demand waned and inventories rose prices eased from their springtime heights carmax said it sold nearly 15 000 fewer vehicles last quarter than it had a year earlier the ceo of the used vehicle company based in richmond virginia pointed to inflation higher borrowing rates and diminished consumer confidence a buyer s strike is how adam joans an auto analyst at morgan stanley characterized the sales drops a dynamic that typically foretells lower prices and indeed the average used vehicle price in september was down 1 from its may peak according to edmunds com at autonation the nation s largest dealership chain sales of used vehicles and profit per vehicle both dropped last quarter ceo mike manley noted that while the supply of vehicles remains low used auto prices are declining our analysis shows that we are coming off the high values that we saw before manley told analysts thursday ivan drury director of insights at edmunds cautioned that it will take years for used prices to fall close to their pre pandemic levels since 2020 automakers haven t been leasing as many cars thereby choking off one key source of late model used vehicles similarly rental companies haven t been able to buy many new vehicles so eventually they are selling fewer autos into the used market that s crimped another source of vehicles and because used cars aren t sitting long on dealer lots demand remains strong enough to prop up prices when auto prices first soared two years ago lower income buyers were elbowed out of the new vehicle market eventually many of them couldn t afford even used autos people with subprime credit scores 620 or below bought only 5 of new vehicles last month down from nearly 9 before the pandemic that indicated that many lower income households could no longer afford vehicles said j d power vice president tyson jominy higher borrowing rates have compounded the problem in january 2020 shortly before the pandemic hit used vehicle buyers paid an average of 8 4 annual interest according to edmunds monthly payments averaged 412 by last month the average rate had reached 9 2 and because prices had risen for over two years the average payment had jumped to 567 the 1 average drop in used prices will help financially secure buyers with solid credit scores who can qualify for lower loan rates but for those with poor credit and lower incomes any price drop will be wiped out by higher borrowing costs the new vehicle market by contrast has become an option mainly for affluent buyers automakers are increasingly deploying scarce computer chips to make costly loaded out versions of pickups suvs and other outsize vehicles typically with relatively low gas mileage last month the average price of a new vehicle was down slightly from august but remained more than 11 000 above its level in january 2020 glenn mears who runs five dealerships south of canton ohio says the federal reserve s interest rate hikes by contributing to pricier auto loans are slowing his showroom traffic we can feel some pullback he said analysts generally say that with shortages of computer chips and other parts still hobbling factories new vehicle prices won t likely fall substantially but further modest price drops may be likely the availability of vehicles on u s dealer lots improved to nearly 1 4 million vehicles last month up from 1 million for most of the year cox automotive reported before the pandemic normal supply was far higher around 4 million so historically speaking inventory remains tight and demand still high like hudson many buyers are still stuck paying sticker price or above it s extraordinarily expensive these days said jominy who estimates that there are still 5 million u s customers waiting to buy new vehicles despite recent stock market declines many such buyers have built up wealth especially in their homes and are rewarding themselves with high end autos in the san francisco bay area for example notes inder dosanjh who runs a 20 dealership group that includes general motors ford acura volkswagen and stellantis brands many people have received substantial pay raises there s just a lot of money out there he said in its earnings report tuesday gm noted that its customer demand is holding up though gm and other automakers would like to produce more vehicles at the moment they are benefiting from slower production which typically means higher prices and profits john lawler ford s chief financial officer noted wednesday that near record new vehicle prices were starting to decline and consumer appetites are starting to change demand for midrange vehicles he said has begun to outpace more profitable autos loaded with options next year could be a turning point suggested jeff windau an analyst at edward jones with the economy likely to weaken and possibly enter a recession prices could fall as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they re willing to bite off from a payment perspective
kevin gundlach president of the south central federation of labor in madison said his office phone has been ringing constantly from workers seeking advice on unionization he estimates employees from some 20 private sector workplaces in his 11 county region around madison have sought to organize this year this is the first time we ve seen this level of interest he said there is no doubt we ve never seen this before a wave of republican laws over the past decade cratered union membership in wisconsin but recent private and public sector worker mobilization has demonstrated the staying power of organized labor labor membership in wisconsin fell dramatically after the passage of act 10 the anti public sector collective bargaining bill in 2011 with the sharpest decrease in the nation over the next decade as of 2021 wisconsin reached a new low just shy of 8 of the total workforce unionized over the past decade wisconsin unions lost 124 000 members or about a third of their ranks driven largely by the death of public sector unions i don t think any other state lost almost half their membership in one fell swoop the way that wisconsin did said university of wisconsin madison professor emeritus david nack who specializes in labor issues hundreds of union members and workers at a labor day event march from zeidler union square to henry maier festival park to listen to president joe biden speak on sept 5 2022 ricardo torres milwaukee journal sentinel hundreds of union members and workers at a labor day event march from zeidler union square to henry maier festival park to listen to president joe biden speak on sept 5 2022 ricardo torres milwaukee journal sentinel but amidst a labor shortage private and public sector workers are notching wins across the state as they organize against outsourcing budget cuts and what they consider threats to academic freedom in local schools gundlach said private sector workers are complaining of worsening conditions with the proceeds of their labor padding executive salaries and enriching corporate stock investors they re making record profits he said and they re not helping out the workers and the families within our communities gundlach was once a unionized dane county employee but act 10 changed all that stripping his union of many of its core powers and limiting its ability to bargain for raises benefits and safe working conditions the law requires a majority of all employees to vote to re certify their union each year a frustrating hurdle that caused many public sector unions to disband in madison the american federation of state county and municipal employees afscme lost more than half of its membership in the past five years going from 11 062 in 2016 to just 4 848 this spring but rather than fade away some unions switched to become nontraditional employee associations while they can t collectively bargain over a contract they can speak with one voice over working conditions many county employees are now members of dane county employee group 720 a move endorsed by the dane county board which codified the right for county workers to self organize in an ordinance there continues to be friction the wisconsin state journal reported this summer that shawn tessman resigned abruptly from the county s department of human services and criticized elected officials for siding with organized employees who called into question the judgment of management privatization efforts thwarted how far act 10 goes to limit the power of organized labor in higher education is still playing out more than a decade later in oshkosh about 100 university custodians and groundskeepers faced the threat of layoffs after the uw oshkosh signaled it intended to outsource the work to a tennessee based company recruitment and retention of dedicated custodial and groundskeeping employees remains difficult in this economy chancellor andy leavitt wrote in an open letter to students and workers explaining why the university had been exploring the move to a private vendor but after students and faculty picketed and delivered multiple petitions with at least 1 000 total signatures the university administration abandoned the idea one of the forces behind the effort was a local chapter of the american federation of teachers wisconsin that doesn t have legal standing to collectively bargain for contracts for faculty members due to act 10 we have broad first amendment rights to organize and advocate for our working conditions said aft wisconsin vice president jon shelton an associate professor at uw green bay and so we ve been able to do some pretty interesting things to build power on our campuses in the past few years jon shelton professor of democracy and justice studies at the university of wisconsin green bay and vice president of higher education for the american federation of teachers wisconsin joins a protest at uw oshkosh on sept 6 2022 the protest aimed to halt the outsourcing of custodians grounds and maintenance crews faculty staff and others joined the march on campus charlie bruecker the advance titan jon shelton professor of democracy and justice studies at the university of wisconsin green bay and vice president of higher education for the american federation of teachers wisconsin joins a protest at uw oshkosh on sept 6 2022 the protest aimed to halt the outsourcing of custodians grounds and maintenance crews faculty staff and others joined the march on campus charlie bruecker the advance titan the custodians and groundskeepers had once been unionized but lost certification several years back said david siemers a uw oshkosh professor and co president of an aft wisconsin affiliated union on campus a major fear was that the workers would lose their state benefits including health care coverage if their jobs were privatized if we hadn t spoken up and if others hadn t spoken up i think they d have liked to simply wash their hands of a management problem siemers said he attributed the lack of retention to the wider problem of stagnant wages for state employees despite a multibillion dollar budget surplus the state needs to understand that it needs to pay more money in order to hire successfully siemers said another union led effort helped scuttle a similar outsourcing plan at uw river falls our locals are being creative about how to build power said shelton of uw green bay it s not like oh we can t collectively bargain in a meaningful way so let s just not do anything and wait for collective bargaining to come back what a union does is it builds power in the workplace and that s what our locals are doing threatened strike brings breakthrough in perhaps the most high profile recent example more than half of madison based uw health s 2 600 nurses threatened to strike after their quasi public employer refused to recognize their union uw health whose governing board is a mix of appointees of the legislature and governor argued that act 10 precludes it from recognizing the union after its last contract expired in 2014 uw health registered nurse tami burns said one motive for unionizing was to have more say in daily operations inside the hospital registered nurse tami burns speaks during a may 2021 press conference calling on uw health to recognize a nurses union around 2 500 nurses

agreement with its workforce courtesy of seiu healthcare wisconsin i mean the policies that are made are made by people who don t do the job every day she said she has worked in the vascular surgery section of university hospital in madison since 2017 she said managers have complete control over their section with nurses unable to speak up if they have concerns she said employees have no right to have an advocate in the room if they re being disciplined by a manager and if they are sanctioned and want to challenge it it s the same person who disciplines you that reviews it so i m sure you can see where that goes nowhere the end result she said is that nurses have few protections and find it difficult to have a voice in the hospital wards and to advocate on behalf of their patients that s a huge part of a nurse s job burns said it s in our code of ethics that we have to advocate for patients and it makes it really hard to do that after employees threatened a three day strike and democratic gov tony evers intervened to broker a resolution uw health administrators softened their stance asking the wisconsin employment relations commission to rule on whether the nurses can organize under act 10 private sector unionization underway unionization has increased across the nation but it s unclear whether wisconsin s private sector is following that trend the national labor relations board announced a 58 increase in petitions nationwide this summer over a nine month period but an analysis of petitions filed in wisconsin over the same period show the increase was modest 21 petitions filed compared with 17 during the same period a year earlier eight of those recent petitions were by starbucks coffee shop employees in places including madison milwaukee and appleton indeed since 2011 the rate of petitions has mostly decreased it spiked with 44 workplace petitions in 2014 but since then it has been less than 30 a year gundlach with the south central federation of labor said these figures aren t keeping pace with the activity he s seeing in his region a pro union sign is seen on the lawn of the united auto workers union building in oshkosh wis on july 15 2022 while public sector unions have been decimated by the passage in 2011 of act 10 efforts are underway around the state to create new private sector unions coburn dukehart wisconsin watch it took one group of workers six to eight months with me meeting with them for them to be willing to approach a union he said the actual vote that will occur could take a year or longer because there s a lot of organizing that gets done within the workplace before they even go public coming out of the pandemic s lockdowns has caused many workers to reassess their value as front line essential workers in services trades and manufacturing workers have a sense of the leverage and the value they have said labor economist laura dresser an associate director for the center on wisconsin strategy cows at uw madison you can see that in the high rate of churn in its state of working wisconsin report for 2022 cows sought to dispel the notion that wisconsinites are staying out of the workforce participation in the labor market is actually higher now than pre 2020 with more than two thirds of working age wisconsinites in the workforce that s several points higher than the 62 national average organizing in schools in public education wisconsin teachers unions are galvanizing members who say their academic freedom is under threat by conservative critics who want to censor their lesson plans in the superior school district parents filed a complaint over fifth graders being taught about gender identity shelton credited aft wisconsin s local in superior with organizing parents and community members to speak in defense of a 30 minute presentation used to teach fifth graders about gender identity minutes from an august 2022 school board meeting show that 30 people defended the curriculum against the six who criticized it ultimately the school board voted 5 2 to keep the curriculum in place without support oftentimes a lot of people will be afraid to teach things shelton said we think we ve really been able to impact things over the past few years in spite of the very significant legal limitations we have against us future remains unclear labor experts and leaders say there s a renewed energy across public and private labor sectors as employees increasingly push back against a long period of stagnant wages rising costs of living and shrunken benefits such as health insurance and paid time off it remains unclear whether wisconsin worker leverage is here to stay a recession could lead to higher unemployment and dilute the relatively strong position of employees but some labor experts predict the momentum will continue as more workers experience the real gains from organizing for better conditions workers are always going to advocate for equity and voice in their workplace said professor michael childers co chair of uw madison s school for workers regardless of whatever legal constructs exist to assist or thwart them jacob resneck is a report for america corps

in nearly a decade the penalty for missing earnings estimates this season is the worst in about a decade according to wells fargo companies reporting disappointing results averaged a loss of 456 basis points while those reporting an earnings beat averaged a gain of 91 basis points according to analyst christopher harvey taken together large cap companies have averaged a loss of 49 basis points this earnings season with roughly two thirds of the s p 500 having reported so far while large cap firms are not in dire shape post earnings reactions suggest some of our early season concerns are being realized harvey wrote in a friday note the bottom line is that investors have been significantly less tolerant of eps misses with the average penalty for missing 456bps the worst we have seen in nearly a decade the particularly high number of earnings misses this season points to further lower revisions of earnings per share estimates according to wells fargo the firm recommends investors

putin russia battling western domination as ukraine war grinds on a picture taken on october 27 2022 shows the russian controlled azov sea port city of mariupol in southeastern ukraine moscow russia president vladimir putin said thursday that the war in ukraine was part of russia s wider struggle against western domination and warned that the world is probably entering the most dangerous decade since the end of world war ii the russian leader showed no sign of backpedalling on the eight month old invasion of ukraine and indeed painted the current situation as part of the decline of western dominance in global affairs putin s comments on the global situation at the annual valdai discussion club meeting were answered indirectly by the us defense department s release of its formal national defense strategy in which it painted moscow as an acute threat to western values putin s reckless war of choice against ukraine the worst threat to european security since the end of world war two has made that very clear for the whole world said us defense secretary lloyd austin tectonic shifts the heady rhetoric took place as fighting ground on in ukraine s east and south with neither side claiming significant gains the historical period of undivided dominance of the west in world affairs is coming to an end said putin the unipolar world is becoming a thing of the past while the west was still desperately trying to govern humanity it was not able to most peoples of the world no longer want to put up with it he said the ukraine offensive he said was simply part of the tectonic shifts of the entire world order russia is not challenging the elites of the west russia is just trying to defend its right to exist he said more dirty bomb talk putin said using nuclear weapons in ukraine would make no sense at all to us either in political or military terms but moscow again raised the allegation that ukraine planned to use a dirty bomb a crude small nuclear weapon in the war it filed a complaint thursday with the un security council demanding an international investigation into the united states military biological activities in ukraine the us rejected the accusation while the un said it was not aware of any such program in ukraine after a closed door un security council meeting russian ambassador vassily nebenzia said they were serious about the dirty bomb allegation we would be happy to be mistaken but we cannot simply ignore this he said these allegations are very serious and may lead to very very unfortunate consequences he said the international atomic energy agency iaea the un s nuclear watchdog said it would carry out an independent verification in ukraine this week inspecting the locations that moscow tied to its allegations iaea chief rafael grossi who attended the security council meeting said they would work to detect any diversion of nuclear material under safeguards any undeclared production or processing of nuclear material at the two locations and assure that there are no undeclared nuclear material and activities the agency said it had inspected one of the two locations a month ago and no undeclared nuclear activities or materials were found there new worries on grain exports both ukraine and the united states raised fresh concerns about the pace of grain exports from ukraine vital to the world but which ukraine says are being held up by russian ship inspections on wednesday after meeting with guinea bissau president umaro sissoco embalo who represented the economic community of west african states ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky said there was a backup of 175 ships waiting to pick up and deliver grain zelensky said the backup was a deterioration of access to food for millions of people in africa asia and europe in ottawa on thursday us secretary of state antony blinken said russia would face great anger if it backs out of the pact to permit ukraine grain stocks to be delivered to global markets the 120 day pact expires on november 19 and the backup of the ships and uncertainty over whether it will be renewed has already caused prices of some food products to rise the idea that russia would now say it doesn t want to continue it it wants to turn it off i think will be met with great anger by countries around the world who are benefiting from ukrainian grain blinken said i think it s profoundly in everyone s interest to make sure that this grain can continue to move out of ukraine and certainly we will do everything we can to sustain the agreement he said
example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video musk says he s buying the san francisco company because he believes it s important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square san francisco elon musk attempted to soothe leery twitter advertisers thursday a day before a deadline to close out on his 44 billion acquisition of the social media platform saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn t want it to become a free for all hellscape the message appears aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers twitter s chief source of revenue that musk s plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users the reason i acquired twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the tesla ceo who typically projects his thoughts in one line tweets he continued there is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society musk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and twitter s dependence on it suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won t allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates but on thursday he assured advertisers he wants twitter to be the most respected advertising platform in the world the note is a shift from musk s position that twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content said pinar yildirim associate professor of marketing at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school but it s also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business putting twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers she said you do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about and the platform takes no responsibility yildirim said musk said twitter should be warm and welcoming to all and enable users to choose the experience they want to have i didn t do it to make money he said of the pending acquisition i did it to try to help humanity whom i love and i do so with humility recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal despite our best efforts is a very real possibility friday s deadline to close the deal was ordered by the delaware chancery court in early october it is the latest step in a battle that began in april with musk signing a deal to acquire twitter then tried to back out of it leading twitter to sue the tesla ceo to force him to go through with the acquisition if the two sides don t meet friday s deadline the next step could be a november trial that could lead to a judge forcing musk to complete the deal but musk has been signaling that the deal is going through he strolled into the company s san francisco headquarters wednesday carrying a porcelain sink changed his twitter profile to chief twit and tweeted entering twitter hq let that sink in and overnight the new york stock exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of twitter before the opening bell friday in anticipation of the company going private under musk musk is expected to speak to twitter employees directly friday if the deal is finalized according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company s culture and operations twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed musk s arrival and messaging top sales executive sarah personette the company s chief customer officer said she had a great discussion with musk on wednesday and appeared to endorse his thursday message to advertisers our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged personette tweeted thursday looking forward to the future musk s apparent enthusiasm about visiting twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions the building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there the washington post reported last week that musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of twitter s 7 500 workers when he becomes owner of the company the newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation musk has spent months deriding twitter s spam bots and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about twitter s problems and how to fix them but he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform thursday s note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue especially a need for twitter to provide more relevant ads which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users personal information yildirim said that unlike facebook twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see musk s message suggests he wants to fix that she said insider intelligence principal analyst jasmine enberg said musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of twitter s ad business because twitter s revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy months of uncertainty surrounding musk s proposed takeover changing consumer behaviors and the fact that there s no other revenue source waiting in the wings

quarter of 2021 benefited from 259 million of lp income or a 39 6 annualized return the decrease in lp income was partially offset by the impact of reinvesting at higher rates and a higher yield on variable rate securities the lower contribution from lps in this year s third quarter was driven by lower returns on private equity funds and fewer sales of underlying real estate properties in the 2022 period income from lps including from private equity and other funds is generally reported on a three month lag total invested assets of 50 7 billion decreased 12 from dec 31 2021 primarily due

financial measures the hartford uses non gaap financial measures in this press release to assist investors in analyzing the company s operating performance for the periods presented herein because the hartford s calculation of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies investors should be careful when comparing the hartford s non gaap financial measures to those of other companies definitions and calculations of other financial measures used in this press release can be found below and in the hartford s investor financial supplement for third quarter 2022 which is available on the hartford s website annualized investment yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments this non gaap measure is calculated as a the annualized net investment income on a consolidated p c or group benefits level excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments divided by b the monthly average invested assets at amortized cost excluding repurchase agreement and securities lending collateral derivatives book value and limited partnerships and other alternative investments the company believes that annualized investment yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternative investments provides investors with an important measure of the trend in investment earnings because it excludes the impact of the volatility in returns related to limited partnerships and other alternative investments annualized investment yield is the most directly comparable gaap measure a reconciliation of the annualized investment yield before tax to annualized investment yield excluding limited partnerships and other alternatives investments before tax for the quarterly periods ended september 30 2022 and 2021 is provided in the

equity excluding aoci after tax by b common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares the company provides this measure to enable investors to analyze the amount of the company s net worth that is primarily attributable to the company s business operations the company believes that excluding aoci from the numerator is useful to investors because it eliminates the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period primarily based on changes in interest rates book value per diluted share is the most directly comparable u s gaap measure a reconciliation of book value per diluted share to book value per diluted share excluding aoci is provided in the table below as of sept 30 2022 dec 31 2021 change book value per diluted share 38 99 51 36 24 per diluted

of aoci 13 64 0 89 nm book value per diluted share excluding aoci 52 63 49 64 6 core earnings the hartford uses the non gaap measure core earnings as an important measure of the company s operating performance the hartford believes that core earnings provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of the company s ongoing businesses because it reveals trends in our insurance and financial services businesses that may be obscured by including the net effect of certain items therefore the following items are excluded from core earnings certain realized gains and losses some realized gains and losses are primarily driven by investment decisions and external economic developments the nature and timing of which are unrelated to the insurance and underwriting aspects of our business accordingly core earnings excludes the effect of all realized gains and losses that tend to be highly variable from period to period based on capital market conditions the hartford believes however that some realized gains and losses are integrally related to our insurance operations so core earnings includes net realized gains and losses such as net periodic settlements on credit derivatives these net realized gains and losses are directly related to an offsetting item included in the income statement such as net investment income restructuring and other costs costs incurred as part of a restructuring plan are not a recurring operating expense of the business loss on extinguishment of debt largely consisting of make whole payments or tender premiums upon paying debt off before maturity these losses are not a recurring operating expense of the business gains and losses on reinsurance transactions gains or losses on reinsurance such as those entered into upon sale of a business or to reinsure loss reserves are not a recurring operating expense of the business integration and other non recurring m a costs these costs including transaction costs incurred in connection with an acquired business are incurred over a short period of time and do not represent an ongoing operating expense of the business change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business these changes in loss reserves are excluded from core earnings because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition deferred gain resulting from retroactive reinsurance and subsequent changes in the deferred gain retroactive reinsurance agreements economically transfer risk to the reinsurers and including the full benefit from retroactive reinsurance in core earnings provides greater insight into the economics of the business change in valuation allowance on deferred taxes related to non core components of before tax income these changes in valuation allowances are excluded from core earnings because they relate to non core components of before tax income such as tax attributes like capital loss carryforwards results of discontinued operations these results are excluded from core earnings for businesses sold or held for sale because such results could obscure the ability to compare period over period results for our ongoing businesses in addition to the above components of net income available to common stockholders that are excluded from core earnings preferred stock dividends declared which are excluded from net income available to common stockholders are included in the determination of core earnings preferred stock dividends are a cost of financing more akin to interest expense on debt and are expected to be a recurring expense as long as the preferred stock is outstanding net income loss and net income loss available to common stockholders are the most directly comparable u s gaap measures to core earnings core earnings should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss or net income loss available to common stockholders and does not reflect the overall profitability of the company s business therefore the hartford believes that it is useful for investors to evaluate net income loss net income loss available to common stockholders and core earnings when reviewing the company s performance a reconciliation of net income loss to core earnings for the quarterly periods ended september 30 2022 and 2021 is included in this press release a reconciliation of net income loss to core earnings for individual reporting segments can be found in this press release under the heading the hartford financial services group inc consolidating income statements and in the hartford s investor financial supplement for the quarter ended september 30 2022 core earnings margin the hartford uses the non gaap measure core earnings margin to evaluate and believes it is an important measure of the group benefits segment s operating performance core earnings margin is calculated by dividing core earnings by revenues excluding buyouts and realized gains losses net income margin calculated by dividing net income by revenues is the most directly comparable u s gaap measure the company believes that core earnings margin provides investors with a valuable measure of the performance of group benefits because it reveals trends in the business that may be obscured by the effect of buyouts and realized gains losses as well as other items excluded in the calculation of core earnings core earnings margin should not be considered as a substitute for net income margin and does not reflect the overall profitability of group benefits therefore the company believes it is important for investors to evaluate both core earnings margin and net income margin when reviewing performance a reconciliation of net income margin

underwriting gain loss is a before tax non gaap measure that represents earned premiums less incurred losses loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses net income loss is the most directly comparable gaap measure underwriting gain loss is influenced significantly by earned premium growth and the adequacy of the hartford s pricing underwriting profitability over time is also greatly influenced by the hartford s underwriting discipline as management strives to manage exposure to loss through favorable risk selection and diversification effective management of claims use of reinsurance and its ability to manage its expenses the hartford believes that the measure underwriting gain loss provides investors with a valuable measure of profitability before tax derived from underwriting activities which are managed separately from the company s investing activities a reconciliation of net income to underwriting results for the quarterly periods ended september 30 2022

current accident year change in loss reserves upon acquisition of a business the most directly comparable gaap measure is net income loss the company believes underlying underwriting gain loss is important to understand the company s periodic earnings because the volatile and unpredictable nature i e the timing and amount of catastrophes and prior accident year reserve development could obscure underwriting trends the changes to loss reserves upon acquisition of a business are also excluded from underlying underwriting gain loss because such changes could obscure the ability to compare results in periods after the acquisition to results of periods prior to the acquisition as such trends are valuable to our investors ability to assess the company s financial performance a

financial measure of the loss ratio for the group benefits segment represents the ratio of group life benefits losses and loss adjustment expenses excluding those related to buyout premiums and to excess mortality divided by premiums and other considerations excluding buyout premiums excess mortality includes both claims where covid 19 is specifically listed as the cause of death and indirect impacts of the pandemic such as causes of death due to patients deferring regular treatments of chronic conditions the company believes that the group life loss ratio excluding excess mortality provides investors with an important measure of the trend in the group life business because it excludes the impact of volatile and unpredictable mortality arising from the covid 19 pandemic the most directly comparable u s gaap measure is the group life loss ratio calculated as the ratio of group life benefits losses and loss adjustment expenses excluding those related to buyout premiums to

fishing regulators and the seafood industry are grappling with the possibility that some once profitable species that have declined with climate change might not come back several marketable species harvested by u s fishermen are the subject of quota cuts seasonal closures and other restrictions as populations have fallen and waters have warmed in some instances such as the groundfishing industry for species like flounder in the northeast the changing environment has made it harder for fish to recover from years of overfishing that already taxed the population officials in alaska have canceled the fall bristol bay red king crab harvest and winter snow crab harvest dealing a blow to the bering sea crab industry that is sometimes worth more than 200 million a year as populations have declined in the face of warming waters the atlantic cod fishery once the lifeblood industry of new england is now essentially shuttered but even with depleted populations imperiled by climate change it s rare for regulators to completely shut down a fishery as they re considering doing for new england shrimp two men embroiled in lake erie fishing tournament scandal enter pleas to charges the northern shrimp once a seafood delicacy has been subject to a fishing moratorium since 2014 scientists believe warming waters are wiping out their populations and they won t be coming back so the regulatory atlantic states marine fisheries commission is now considering making that moratorium permanent essentially ending the centuries old harvest of the shrimp it s a stark siren for several species caught by u s fishermen that regulators say are on the brink others include softshell clams winter flounder alaskan snow crabs and chinook salmon exactly how many fisheries are threatened principally by warming waters is difficult to say but additional cutbacks and closures are likely in the future as climate change intensifies said malin pinsky director of the graduate program in ecology and evolution at rutgers university this pattern of climate change and how it ripples throughout communities and coastal economies is something we need to get used to pinsky said many years are pushing us outside of what we have experienced historically and we are going to continue to observe these further novel conditions as years go by while it s unclear whether climate change has ever been the dominant factor in permanently shutting down a u s fishery global warming is a key reason several once robust fisheries are in increasingly poor shape and subject to more aggressive regulation in recent years warming temperatures introduce new predators cause species to shift their center of population northward or make it harder for them to grow to maturity scientists said giant 6 000 pound sunfish sets world record as largest bony fish report in the case of the northern shrimp scientists and regulators said at a meeting in august that the population has not rebounded after nearly a decade of no commercial fishing regulators will revisit the possibility of a permanent moratorium this winter said dustin colson leaning a fishery management plan coordinator with the atlantic states commission another approach could be for the commission to relinquish control of the fishery he said the shrimp prefer cold temperatures yet the gulf of maine is warming faster than most of the world s oceans scientists say warming waters have also moved new predators into the gulf but in maine where the cold water shrimp fishery is based fishermen have tried to make the case that abundance of the shrimp is cyclical and any move to shutter the fishery for good is premature i want to look into the future of this it s not unprecedented to have a loss of shrimp we went through it in the 50s we went through it in the 70s we had a tough time in the 90s said vincent balzano a shrimp fisherman from portland they came back another jeopardized species is winter flounder once highly sought by southern new england fishermen the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has described the fish as significantly below target population levels on georges bank a key fishing ground scientists with university of rhode island and rhode island department of environmental management wrote that the fish have struggled to reach maturity due to increased predation related to warming winters in a report last year me lobster fishermen s lawsuit against whale protection rule expedited by federal court on the west coast chinook salmon face an extinction risk due to climate change noaa has reported drought has worsened the fish s prospects in california at the southern end of its range scientists have said fishermen on the east coast from virginia to maine have dug softshell clams from tidal mud for centuries and they re a staple of seafood restaurants they re used for chowder and fried clam dishes and are sometimes called steamers but the clam harvest fell from about 3 5 million pounds in 2010 to 2 1 million pounds in 2020 as the industry has contended with an aging workforce and increasing competition from predators such as crabs and worms scientists have linked the growing predator threat to warming waters the 2020 haul in maine which harvests the most clams was the smallest in more than 90 years and the 2021 catch still lagged behind typical hauls from the 2000s which were consistently close to 2 million pounds or more predicting what the clam harvest will look like in 2022 is difficult but the industry remains threatened by the growing presence of invasive green crabs said brian beal a professor of marine ecology at the university of maine at machias the crabs which eat clams are native to europe and arrived in the u s about 200 years ago and have grown in population as waters have warmed there seem to have been relative to 2020 a ton more green crabs that settled beal said that s not a good omen one challenge of managing fisheries that are declining due to warming waters is that regulators rely on historical data to set quotas and other regulations said lisa kerr a senior research scientist with the gulf of maine research institute in portland maine scientists and regulators are learning that some fish stocks just aren t capable of returning to the productivity level of 40 years ago she said click here to get the fox news app back then u s fishermen typically caught more than 100 million pounds of atlantic cod per year now they usually catch less than 2 million pounds as overfishing and environmental changes have prevented the population from returning to historical levels the future of managing species that are in such bad shape might require accepting the possibility that fully rebuilding them is impossible kerr said it s really a resetting of the expectations she said we re starting to see targets that are more in line but under a lower overall target
the salata institute for climate and sustainability s event the future is now harvard takes on the climate challenge included panelists from across the university jean salata is a climate optimist enough to often elicit a gentle eyeroll from his wife melanie i am very optimistic and as i was joking last night my wife would say that i m delusional salata said wednesday despite that optimism salata ceo of one of asia s largest private equity firms baring private equity asia isn t kidding himself about the complexities of the climate crisis he knows it is a multifaceted global issue that will affect the world his children and grandchildren inherit but he decided that his best shot for making a real difference was to find a place with robust resources deep talent and the right leaders and then just step back and he said that is what he did i m optimistic that we can make a difference salata said at the kickoff event of the new institute that bears his and melanie s name it s not going to be easy we re not going to do it alone we can galvanize all the resources that the university has to be a beacon to the rest of the world almost like a call to action of why this is important and how we together are going to solve this problem several speakers at wednesday s event the future is now harvard takes on the climate challenge cited harvard s broad interdisciplinary breadth and leadership in higher education as reasons why it is imperative the university engage fully on the problem they said the new salata institute for climate and sustainability will fill an important role in the array of research teaching and other activities related to climate change taking place on harvard s campuses indeed a recent report commissioned by james stock vice provost for climate and sustainability concluded that despite the abundance of climate change related courses events research opportunities internships and other types of engagement already offered at the university there remains a huge desire for more the salata institute which stock will head seeks to play a unifying catalyzing role that ultimately brings a university wide focus to a massive complex and existential dilemma that has at times driven researchers scholars and students nearly to the point of throwing up their hands in resignation i m optimistic that we can make a difference it s not going to be easy we re not going to do it alone said jean salata at the kickoff event of the new salata institute even that distress however points to the importance of an all encompassing approach according to daniel schrag the sturgis hooper professor of geology and director of the harvard university center for the environment during a panel discussion on wednesday afternoon at radcliffe s knafel center schrag recounted a discussion with matthew potts plummer professor of christian morals about his freshman seminar apocalyptic grief love loss and the end of the world and the importance of dealing not just with facts and policy but also with hope despair and other emotions in the face of war pandemic the climate crisis and problems that at times seem ready to overwhelm us schrag said that often during discussions of the geologic timescale of the changes we are making it can take 100 000 years for carbon we re putting in the atmosphere to be removed by natural processes students nearly despair over the possibility of finding a solution and though every day we delay makes the problem worse it is also true he said that it s never going to be too late it s never too late for us to act on climate system there s no threshold beyond which we shouldn t act we have an obligation to keep working to solve this problem whatever the impacts are schrag said we have an obligation to continue to work on the social justice issues associated with this problem whatever impacts happen the panel moderated by jody freeman archibald cox professor of law and director of the energy and environmental law program also included caroline buckee professor of epidemiology bridget long dean of the graduate school of education naomi oreskes henry charles lea professor of the history of science robert stavins a j meyer professor of energy economic development and director of the harvard project on climate agreements and michael toffel the senator john heinz professor of environmental management at harvard business school panelists described a range of different impacts in their disciplines as well as activity going on at harvard in those areas long said climate change is an important issue in america s schools both as a subject for instruction and a factor affecting learning a 100 degree heat wave last spring struck while schools including many without air conditioning were in session in addition she said schools are an important institution because while decentralized they stretch across america penetrating every community they are enormous consumers of electricity cover some 2 million acres of land and operate approximately 7 million buses making the choices of education leaders important in enacting solutions while interdisciplinarity is important the event also offered a snapshot of climate science and policy the good news stavins said is that governments around the world have committed to address the problem with those representing 97 percent of global admissions signed onto the paris accord the bad news is that their commitments to reduce emissions are nowhere close to what will be needed to keep warming to 1 5 degrees celsius over preindustrial levels a threshold below which experts believe the worst effects of climate change can be averted efforts he said are turning to how to raise those levels of commitment schrag and oreskes said that the science has moved past the now settled debate over the problem s roots in fossil fuel burning to advances in attribution science which determine how much climate change influences weather events and in forecasting what shifts to expect though the scientific debate over climate change has been settled for some time oreskes said it isn t over in many parts of the country misinformation and disinformation are still a problem and another significant hurdle is the fact that fossil fuel extraction provides lots of jobs and though there are promises of retraining people holding those jobs only have to look to america s rust belt to see how well they were kept in the past we can have the best science in the world but if people don t accept it and act on it it doesn t matter oreskes said stock who offered closing remarks said the new institute will be operating at a time of transformational change both in the climate and in society as energy source transitions and other climate related changes accelerate the

it s rare for regulators to completely shut down a fishery but they re considering doing just that in at least one instance and warming waters are the culprit portland maine fishing regulators and the seafood industry are grappling with the possibility that some once profitable species that have declined with climate change might not come back several marketable species harvested by u s fishermen are the subject of quota cuts seasonal closures and other restrictions as populations have fallen and waters have warmed in some instances such as the groundfishing industry for species like flounder in the northeast the changing environment has made it harder for fish to recover from years of overfishing that already taxed the population officials in alaska have canceled the fall bristol bay red king crab harvest and winter snow crab harvest dealing a blow to the bering sea crab industry that is sometimes worth more than 200 million a year as populations have declined in the face of warming waters the atlantic cod fishery once the lifeblood industry of new england is now essentially shuttered but even with depleted populations imperiled by climate change it s rare for regulators to completely shut down a fishery as they re considering doing for new england shrimp the northern shrimp once a seafood delicacy has been subject to a fishing moratorium since 2014 scientists believe warming waters are wiping out their populations and they won t be coming back so the regulatory atlantic states marine fisheries commission is now considering making that moratorium permanent essentially ending the centuries old harvest of the shrimp it s a stark siren for several species caught by u s fishermen that regulators say are on the brink others include softshell clams winter flounder alaskan snow crabs and chinook salmon exactly how many fisheries are threatened principally by warming waters is difficult to say but additional cutbacks and closures are likely in the future as climate change intensifies said malin pinsky director of the graduate program in ecology and evolution at rutgers university this pattern of climate change and how it ripples throughout communities and coastal economies is something we need to get used to pinsky said many years are pushing us outside of what we have experienced historically and we are going to continue to observe these further novel conditions as years go by while it s unclear whether climate change has ever been the dominant factor in permanently shutting down a u s fishery global warming is a key reason several once robust fisheries are in increasingly poor shape and subject to more aggressive regulation in recent years warming temperatures introduce new predators cause species to shift their center of population northward or make it harder for them to grow to maturity scientists said in the case of the northern shrimp scientists and regulators said at a meeting in august that the population has not rebounded after nearly a decade of no commercial fishing regulators will revisit the possibility of a permanent moratorium this winter said dustin colson leaning a fishery management plan coordinator with the atlantic states commission another approach could be for the commission to relinquish control of the fishery he said the shrimp prefer cold temperatures yet the gulf of maine is warming faster than most of the world s oceans scientists say warming waters have also moved new predators into the gulf but in maine where the cold water shrimp fishery is based fishermen have tried to make the case that abundance of the shrimp is cyclical and any move to shutter the fishery for good is premature i want to look into the future of this it s not unprecedented to have a loss of shrimp we went through it in the 50s we went through it in the 70s we had a tough time in the 90s said vincent balzano a shrimp fisherman from portland they came back another jeopardized species is winter flounder once highly sought by southern new england fishermen the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has described the fish as significantly below target population levels on georges bank a key fishing ground scientists with university of rhode island and rhode island department of environmental management wrote that the fish have struggled to reach maturity due to increased predation related to warming winters in a report last year on the west coast chinook salmon face an extinction risk due to climate change noaa has reported drought has worsened the fish s prospects in california at the southern end of its range scientists have said fishermen on the east coast from virginia to maine have dug softshell clams from tidal mud for centuries and they re a staple of seafood restaurants they re used for chowder and fried clam dishes and are sometimes called steamers but the clam harvest fell from about 3 5 million pounds 1 6 million kilograms in 2010 to 2 1 million pounds 950 000 kilograms in 2020 as the industry has contended with an aging workforce and increasing competition from predators such as crabs and worms scientists have linked the growing predator threat to warming waters the 2020 haul in maine which harvests the most clams was the smallest in more than 90 years and the 2021 catch still lagged behind typical hauls from the 2000s which were consistently close to 2 million pounds 907 000 kilograms or more predicting what the clam harvest will look like in 2022 is difficult but the industry remains threatened by the growing presence of invasive green crabs said brian beal a professor of marine ecology at the university of maine at machias the crabs which eat clams are native to europe and arrived in the u s about 200 years ago and have grown in population as waters have warmed there seem to have been relative to 2020 a ton more green crabs that settled beal said that s not a good omen one challenge of managing fisheries that are declining due to warming waters is that regulators rely on historical data to set quotas and other regulations said lisa kerr a senior research scientist with the gulf of maine research institute in portland maine scientists and regulators are learning that some fish stocks just aren t capable of returning to the productivity level of 40 years ago she said back then u s fishermen typically caught more than 100 million pounds 45 4 million kilograms of atlantic cod per year now they usually catch less than 2 million pounds 907 000 kilograms as overfishing and environmental changes have prevented the population from returning to historical levels the future of managing species that are in such bad shape might require accepting the possibility that fully rebuilding them is impossible kerr said

increase of 14 6 from quarter 2 2022 the combination of price increases a stronger u s dollar market demand and some delayed shipments due to material availability continue to contribute to the record high backlog as costs stabilized margins recovered from the second quarter furthermore historically high production volumes are having a positive impact on margins said richard vollering chief financial officer of hammond power solutions industry demand has continued to show strength as shown by the backlog growth but the pace of growth is slowing with the backlog increase from the second quarter at 14 6 down from the 26 6 increase experienced between the first and the second quarter nevertheless our backlog is now extending well into 2023 once again growth is across all channels in the quarter but most notably in the u s distributor and o e m channels our cash position and balance sheet have continued to strengthen over the first nine months of 2022 providing a solid foundation to grow organically and through acquisition into 2023 and beyond the company experienced an increase in its gross margin rate for quarter 3 2022 which was 29 2 compared to a quarter 3 2021 gross

of which affected quarter 3 2022 sales and will continue to be reflected in future quarter sales in the third quarter some material input costs have stabilized while others continue to increase due to underlying inflation while there remains higher than normal volatility in costs we have seen a positive impact on margins in the quarter total selling and distribution expenses were 16 433 in quarter 3 2022 or 11 0 of sales versus 11 433 in quarter 3 2021 or 12 0 of sales an increase of 5 000 and a decrease of 1 0 of sales year to date selling and distribution expenses were 46 192 or 11 2 of sales in 2022 compared to 31 900 or 12 1 in 2021 an increase of 14 292 or a decrease of 0 9 of sales the year over year increase in selling and distribution expenses is a result of higher variable freight

in 2021 an increase of 15 670 or 143 3 the improvement in the year to date earnings is a result of the increased sales and higher gross margin dollar contribution partially offset by greater selling

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net

musk says he s buying the san francisco company because he believes it s important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video san francisco elon musk attempted to soothe leery twitter advertisers thursday a day before a deadline to close out on his 44 billion acquisition of the social media platform saying that he is buying the platform to help humanity and doesn t want it to become a free for all hellscape the message appears aimed at addressing concerns among advertisers twitter s chief source of revenue that musk s plans to promote free speech by cutting back on moderating content will open the floodgates to more online toxicity and drive away users the reason i acquired twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner without resorting to violence musk wrote in an uncharacteristically long message for the tesla ceo who typically projects his thoughts in one line tweets he continued there is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society musk has previously expressed distaste for advertising and twitter s dependence on it suggesting more emphasis on other business models such as paid subscriptions that won t allow big corporations to dictate policy on how social media operates but on thursday he assured advertisers he wants twitter to be the most respected advertising platform in the world the note is a shift from musk s position that twitter is unfairly infringing on free speech rights by blocking misinformation or graphic content said pinar yildirim associate professor of marketing at the university of pennsylvania s wharton school but it s also a realization that having no content moderation is bad for business putting twitter at risk of losing advertisers and subscribers she said you do not want a place where consumers just simply are bombarded with things they do not want to hear about and the platform takes no responsibility yildirim said musk said twitter should be warm and welcoming to all and enable users to choose the experience they want to have i didn t do it to make money he said of the pending acquisition i did it to try to help humanity whom i love and i do so with humility recognizing that failure in pursuing this goal despite our best efforts is a very real possibility friday s deadline to close the deal was ordered by the delaware chancery court in early october it is the latest step in a battle that began in april with musk signing a deal to acquire twitter then tried to back out of it leading twitter to sue the tesla ceo to force him to go through with the acquisition if the two sides don t meet friday s deadline the next step could be a november trial that could lead to a judge forcing musk to complete the deal but musk has been signaling that the deal is going through he strolled into the company s san francisco headquarters wednesday carrying a porcelain sink changed his twitter profile to chief twit and tweeted entering twitter hq let that sink in and overnight the new york stock exchange notified investors that it will suspend trading in shares of twitter before the opening bell friday in anticipation of the company going private under musk musk is expected to speak to twitter employees directly friday if the deal is finalized according to an internal memo cited in several media outlets despite internal confusion and low morale tied to fears of layoffs or a dismantling of the company s culture and operations twitter leaders this week have at least outwardly welcomed musk s arrival and messaging top sales executive sarah personette the company s chief customer officer said she had a great discussion with musk on wednesday and appeared to endorse his thursday message to advertisers our continued commitment to brand safety for advertisers remains unchanged personette tweeted thursday looking forward to the future musk s apparent enthusiasm about visiting twitter headquarters this week stood in sharp contrast to one of his earlier suggestions the building should be turned into a homeless shelter because so few employees actually worked there the washington post reported last week that musk told prospective investors that he plans to cut three quarters of twitter s 7 500 workers when he becomes owner of the company the newspaper cited documents and unnamed sources familiar with the deliberation musk has spent months deriding twitter s spam bots and making sometimes contradictory pronouncements about twitter s problems and how to fix them but he has shared few concrete details about his plans for the social media platform thursday s note to advertisers shows a newfound emphasis on advertising revenue especially a need for twitter to provide more relevant ads which typically means targeted ads that rely on collecting and analyzing users personal information yildirim said that unlike facebook twitter has not been good at targeting advertising to what users want to see musk s message suggests he wants to fix that she said insider intelligence principal analyst jasmine enberg said musk has good reason to avoid a massive shakeup of twitter s ad business because twitter s revenues have taken a beating from the weakening economy months of uncertainty surrounding musk s proposed takeover changing consumer behaviors and the fact that there s no other revenue source waiting in the wings

joining us with me on the call this morning are dave foulkes brunswick s ceo and ryan gwillim cfo before we begin with our prepared remarks i would like to remind everyone that during this call our comments will include certain forward looking statements about future results please keep in mind that our actual results could differ materially from these expectations for details on these factors to consider please refer to our recent sec filings and today s press release all of these documents are available on our website at brunswick com during our presentation we will be referring to certain non gaap financial information reconciliations of gaap to non gaap financial measures are provided in the appendix to this presentation and the reconciliation sections of the unaudited consolidated financial statements accompanying today s results i will now turn the call over to dave dave foulkes thanks neha and good morning everyone we delivered a record third quarter with 1 7 billion in net sales and almost 280 million of adjusted operating earnings continuing our trend of exceptional resilient performance in a challenging macroeconomic and supply environment these results were achieved despite an extremely difficult end to the quarter for many of our florida employees and locations as a result of the impacts of hurricane ian all our divisions contributed to the strong performance with many new products sustained cost control and a continued focus on operational efficiency together with the benefits of capacity investments and aces initiatives driving growth across our businesses consumer demand for our products remains resilient with boat field inventory levels getting healthier but remaining nearly 40 lower at the end of the quarter versus the same time in 2019 our boat and engine production levels remain generally on track and the percentage of our boat production that is already retail sold continues to be high especially for our fiberglass brands with no evidence of wholesale cancellations mercury continues to capture market share with gains likely to accelerate in the coming quarters due to major new product launches and the completion of the capacity increase in the fond du lac wisconsin production facility in the coming months p a sales benefited from acquisitions completed in 2021 while freedom boat club saw significant overall and same store membership sales increases in the quarter as the economic outlook continues to create overall market and sector dislocation we executed 140 million of share repurchases in the third quarter bringing our year to date share repurchases to 360 million and we plan to continue an aggressive repurchase schedule as we close out the year prior to discussing business segment performance i ll share an update on hurricane ian at the end of september southwest florida experienced ian as a category 4 hurricane brunswick has a strong presence in florida with multiple manufacturing sites distribution locations and freedom boat club locations we closed our florida boat manufacturing facilities for the last week of the third quarter to prepare for and ride out the hurricane the facilities incurred minimal damage allowing for manufacturing and shipping operations to resume in the following weeks only one distribution location remains out of operation many dealer locations in florida stopped receiving product ahead of the hurricane and some dealer locations in the most impacted areas incurred significant damage to property and inventory freedom boat club operations in southwest florida was significantly impacted by ian with over 100 boats sustaining major damage and five locations unlikely to open until 2023 members of the most impacted locations are able to pause their memberships until 2023 as they manage through this difficult period and we restore operations from an employee standpoint approximately 20 of our employee base resides in florida some in the most impacted areas were significantly personally impacted brunswick is providing critical relief supplies and aid to employees and their communities as they rebuild and recover including through activation of a brunswick employee relief fund we estimate an approximately 25 million full year revenue impact to brunswick as a result of the disruption to our facilities teams and customers caused by hurricane ian with more than half of that impact in the quarter in the medium term following rebuilding and insurance recoveries we may receive orders for boats to replace those lost in this event turning to other external factors despite an improving overall trend in supply delivery and cost inflation compared with the worst period of supply chain constraints we continue to manage through some discrete but impactful shortages most recently due primarily to continued labor shortages at some of our u s supply facilities this quarter the propulsion business was notably impacted by a couple of suppliers issues which slowed production of some products and led to nearly 2 500 midrange outboard engines awaiting one component for completion at the close of the period a situation we expect to resolve in q4 despite these challenges the propulsion business delivered outstanding performance which i will speak to further in a few moments consumer boating activity remains strong with a warmer september in many parts of the u s extending the boating season while buying activity in the year round markets remain strong the boating season in the northern markets is coming to a close and with the uncertain economic conditions and higher interest rates we expect to see some buyers in these markets deferring late season and off season purchases until the start of the 2023 season this impacts mainly aluminum products from a dealer standpoint while our channel partners have shared concerns related to macro factors inventory refill remains their core focus and they re excited about our many new products so we continue to see forward orders and backlogs in line with historical levels turning now to segment performance during the quarter let me highlight again that we delivered a record third quarter with each of our segments driving quarterly top line improvement versus 2021 our propulsion business continues to deliver exceptional results with 14 top line growth versus third quarter 2021 enabled by higher sales volume resulting from strong global demand capacity increases and market share gains during the quarter mercury marine gained 100 basis points of outboard propulsion retail market share in the u s and continues to capture upward share in international markets as recently seen in the cannes boat show where mercury had a record 65 outboard share on the water as i mentioned the outboard engine capacity expansion at the fond du lac wisconsin facility is on track to come fully online towards the end of the year our parts and accessories businesses delivered strong sales growth led by benefits from acquisitions completed in 2021 solid engine p a sales and strong oem sales from navico group on an organic basis p a segment sales in the third quarter grew 1 compared with 2021 excluding currency navico group experienced retail point of sale activity above 2021 levels during the quarter but continue to see slowness in retailer and distributor restocking which impacted wholesale sales our boat business posted another robust quarter with top line growth of 27 and double digit adjusted operating margins for the second consecutive quarter each product category posted solid top line growth despite our florida boat manufacturing facilities being closed for the last week of the quarter due to hurricane ian additionally our aluminum fishing and recreational fiberglass brands delivered operating margin expansion compared to prior year finally freedom boat club had record same store membership sales increases in the quarter despite its southwest florida operation being significantly impacted by hurricane ian freedom continues on its growth trajectory in the u s and europe and now has more than 360 locations nearly 54 000 membership agreements covering 84 000 members network wide and a fleet size above 5 000 boats all while generating exceptionally strong synergy sales across our marine portfolio i will now provide an overview of sales performance by region on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions in the third quarter all regions delivered substantial sales growth versus third quarter 2021 with broad based gains across the business segments overall international sales and u s sales were each up 13 versus the prior year quarter additionally on a year to date basis sales have increased 11 compared to 2021 on a constant currency basis excluding acquisitions with growth across all business segments finally we anticipate further propulsion share gains across the regions as we re able to service a backlog of demand in high horsepower outboard nodes enabled by the additional capacity coming online by the end of this year from an industry view u s third quarter retail unit sales improved sequentially from the first half of the year the main powerboat segment was down 5 versus the third quarter of 2021 on a year to date basis the main powerboat segment was down 14 versus 2021 and about 7 versus 2019 outboard engine industry data remains favorable as the third quarter of 2022 increased 10 over third quarter of prior year mercury performance during this period was very strong as we gained overall market share in each of the last three months and over 400 basis points in our 200 horsepower and greater outboard engines over a 3 year period brunswick s retail unit performance in the third quarter was broadly consistent with the overall market performance with outperformance in recreational fiberglass products and premium pontoons and underperformance in value aluminum while lower contented value boats mainly from smaller manufacturers have regained share lost in 2019 and 2020 we continue to focus successfully on margin maintenance and expansion and have shifted production to higher margin product lines at the recent expense of some unit share of value aluminum product i ll now turn the call over to ryan for additional comments on our financial performance ryan gwillim thanks dave good morning everyone brunswick delivered an outstanding third quarter with record sales operating earnings and eps for any third quarter on record when compared to prior year third quarter net sales were up 19 with adjusted operating margins of 16 4 up 90 basis points operating earnings on an as adjusted basis increased by 26 and adjusted diluted eps of 2 67 increased by 29 all segments delivered sales growth resulting from solid demand new product performance and pricing implemented since the third quarter of 2021 partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates the impact from hurricane ian and supply chain challenges the strong operating earnings growth was also enabled by these factors together with benefits from cost containment measures tempered slightly by continued elevated material and freight inflationary pressures and spending on growth initiatives including capacity expansion aces and new products note that changes in foreign currency exchange rates were more unfavorable than anticipated resulting in a high single digit million dollar earnings headwind in the quarter with the p a segment most impacted on a year to date basis brunswick has also delivered record results including over 5 2 billion of net sales almost 850 million of operating earnings and 8 02 of adjusted diluted eps you ll note that we continue to show comparisons to 2019 on these two slides to highlight the strong growth cagrs over the last three years and the record performance of the business versus the third quarter of last year which was the previous best third quarter in company history turning to our segments our propulsion business delivered yet another quarter of outstanding top line earnings and operating margin performance revenue increased 14 versus the third quarter of 2021 as higher sales volumes were driven by strong global demand capacity increases and market share gains around the globe operating margins of 20 were up 210 basis points and operating earnings were up 27 each enabled by increased sales and lower operating expenses partially offset by investments in capacity and product development as a reminder the previously discussed capacity expansion at the fond du lac wisconsin facility will add more than 50 capacity in the 175 horsepower and higher categories which will be critical in driving future top line and earnings growth together with market share gains this expansion will also enable the production of new outboard engine products and if you join us in florida for our investor event on november 16 i m guessing you may get to see these in action our parts and accessories business saw a 19 increase in sales due in large part to the 2021 acquisitions of navico relion and semahtronix excluding the impact of acquisitions and currency organic p a revenues were up 1 against a very strong 2021 comparison and were up significantly versus the third quarter of 2019 u s engine p a and sales to oems were up again quarter over quarter while sales in our lower margin distribution businesses continued to be negatively impacted by third party product availability and hurricane ian which constrained sales at the end of the quarter p a sales to retail and external distribution outlets including sales from navico remain depressed at these channels further slowed restocking levels despite point of sale retail demand remaining healthy operating earnings were down very slightly against q3 of 2021 given all the factors previously mentioned with the sales benefits being offset by the negative currency impacts and continued material and freight inflation our boat segment had another fantastic quarter delivering strong top line and earnings together with double digit operating margins despite continued supply chain disruption and having to shut down their three main florida facilities for the last week of the quarter to support our employees as hurricane ian made landfall the boat segment reported a 27 increase in net sales segment operating earnings and margin growth were enabled by the increased sales volumes together with operational efficiencies and positive mix partially offset by inefficiencies resulting from supply chain disruptions inflationary pressures and the loss of production from hurricane ian the entire enterprise continues to benefit from the strong synergies across our portfolio with an average of 25 000 of content per boat now sourced from other brunswick brands freedom boat club which is included in business acceleration contributed approximately 7 of the boat segment s revenue during the quarter however as dave discussed earlier freedom had its southwest florida operations materially impacted by ian and we ll be working diligently for several quarters to rebuild boat and slip availability in the affected locations while working with our members to protect their memberships while they sort their recovery from the storm turning to pipelines we produced more boats in the third quarter than we did in the third quarter of 2021 allowing for healthier inventory levels in the hands of our dealers however supply chain inefficiencies continued to result in delayed components preventing us from maximizing production across our footprint as of the end of the third quarter there were approximately 12 000 units in dealer pipeline inventories around the world down 39 from the same time of the year in 2019 this translates to just over 19 weeks of inventory on hand measured on a trailing 12 month basis which is significantly lower than where inventories typically stand at this point of the year the inventory position in the u s is even lower with just over 7 000 units available or 16 weeks on hand we anticipate end of the year pipelines to remain thousands of units and several weeks on hand below historical averages we thought it would be also helpful to dive a bit further into pipeline levels focusing on the current availability of fiberglass product versus aluminum product in the u s at the end of the third quarter there were approximately 5 000 units of aluminum product in the hands of u s dealers or 19 weeks on hand which although trending healthier remains almost 40 lower from the same level in 2019 the primary retail season for these products is materially complete with our dealers for these boats mainly in northern markets focused now on winterizing product and getting their inventory position ready for the 2023 selling season however the pipeline for our fiberglass product which mixes up in terms of price and margin remains at significantly lower levels in 2019 there are nearly 2 000 fiberglass boats in u s dealer inventory almost 60 lower than in 2019 which as you may remember included the period where we were purposefully minimizing boston whaler pipeline ahead of product launches planned for early 2020 the percent of sea ray and boston whaler models already retail sold coming out of our facilities remains elevated and there is no reasonable scenario by which we have normalized level of fiberglass products in dealer inventories during the 2023 retail selling season finally note that we have completed our model year 2023 dealer meetings with strong wholesale orders continuing for the upcoming year moving to our outlook for the remainder of the year we believe our continued strong operating performance will deliver a record year despite the continuing unfavorable fx environment inflation and supply chain headwinds our updated guidance anticipates a full year eps of approximately 10 per share which would be more than 20 ahead of 2021 on revenue of approximately 6 9 billion which would be more than 15 better than 2021 the change in the eps midpoint versus july is related to the unfavorable changes in fx rates and the impact of hurricane ian partially offset by continued accelerated share repurchases note that the updated guidance for both revenue and eps would land ahead of the midpoint of our initial full year guidance from january i ll finish my comments this morning by highlighting certain p l cash flow and capital strategy assumptions that have changed versus our prior guidance we have mentioned foreign currency exchange rates several times on the call and we now anticipate a 45 million to 50 million full year earnings headwind due to the changes in fx rates primarily related to the strong u s dollar note that changes in fx rates impact all facets of our results including a negative sales impact in excess of 175 million for the full year we continue to plan on taking advantage of the current market and sector value dislocation by increasing our planned share repurchases for the year we have repurchased 360 million of shares year to date and now anticipate repurchasing 450 million of shares for the full year an increase of 50 million from our previous estimate this will result in our average diluted shares outstanding for the year to decrease to approximately 75 million shares our operating performance together with continued capital strategy execution will result in an all time high of more than 550 million of capital returned to shareholders in 2022 through share repurchases and dividends alone lastly we remain keenly focused on generating free cash flow with the decrease in our full year estimate to approximately 250 million being a direct result of higher raw material and wip inventory balances needed for production continuity the impacts of changes in fx on our international earnings and slightly lower full year earnings we anticipate working capital usage to moderate as we work through 2023 with free cash flow improving accordingly i will now turn the call back to dave for concluding remarks dave foulkes thanks ryan closing out q3 we ve already received almost 90 awards recognizing exceptional product business and individual performance across our enterprise and i wanted to share a few highlights earlier this month brunswick was named by forbes to the list of world s best employers for the third consecutive year brunswick ranked in the top 15 of all recognized organizations and ranked in the top 10 companies in the world within the engineering and manufacturing category recently we were named the most innovative marine company in 2022 by soundings trade only magazine the third time in the last four years that we ve received this recognition additionally aine denari our boat group president was named by boating industry magazine as its 2022 mover and shaker of the year this is the third consecutive year that brunswick has won or had a finalist for this honor and finally mercury marine accepted a business friend of the environment award from wisconsin s chamber of commerce and manufacturers association the award is an acknowledgment of mercury s continued sustainability leadership particularly recognizing progress in adopting renewable sources of energy implementing energy efficiency production processes using recycled aluminum in its die casting operations and using returnable and reusable packaging the third quarter was also characterized by a number of business expansions and important new product releases last week mercury opened its new purpose built and highly automated distribution center to further expand its industry leading parts and accessories business the new 512 000 square foot facility is strategically located near indianapolis indiana a major transportation hub and will significantly improve p a delivery times to domestic and international customers at the end of the quarter the navico group launched a significantly enhanced version of its fathom e power system an integrated lithium ion auxiliary power management system that delivers reliable power and unparalleled performance for the marine and rv sectors replacing conventional combustion engine generators the fathom system offers advanced digital controls and monitoring of power consumption expect to see these systems on a number of boats at 2023 boat shows also earlier this month we launched the heyday h20 surf boat that builds on the success of the multi award winning h22 heyday has been the fastest growing wake surf brand and the 2023 h20 which features a mercury marine engine and navico group controls and displays is designed to capitalize on that momentum sea ray also launched its brand new slx 260 surf this is sea ray s first crossover wake surfing and cruising boat model that also features mercury marine s new forward facing bravo surf drive technology combined with navico group s surf controls and display finally freedom boat club continues to expand locations and added locations in new countries in europe as well as new u s locations during the quarter before i close i d like to remind you about our november 16 event for the investment community which we are hosting at our famous lake x test facility outside orlando in florida we ll be demonstrating an unparalleled array of recently released products and technologies from across our businesses and showing some very exciting unreleased products that support our next wave and aces strategies thank you for joining the call that concludes our prepared remarks we ll now open the line for questions question and answer session operator our first question today is from kevin heenan of jpmorgan please proceed with your question kevin heenan hi thanks for taking my question i guess just on the propulsion segment can you elaborate on your confidence in the accelerating market share gains you see in the coming quarters between the new product launches and capacity expansion what s the latest on the competitive environment that you see today how do you feel pricing wise relative to peers and looking to next year just relative to the 8 multiyear growth you ve laid out how best to think about propulsion relative to that given the benefits you see landing in the fourth quarter of this year thanks dave foulkes thanks kevin we re very confident in continued market share gains by mercury we just yesterday heard that at the fort lauderdale boat show that just started yesterday mercury has something around 56 share of engines on transfers which is about 3 points up from last year and that is ahead of some imminent major product launches in the high horsepower categories that we re very excited about so mercury s expansion is going extremely well internally in terms of getting everything ready and i think production will be up about something like 14 in q4 versus where it was last year on a unit basis and also getting the supply base ready obviously that s they re both major tasks but i think mercury as usual that it s doing a super job and we have a lot of customers waiting in the wings to take that product so momentum is incredibly strong you saw a 65 share of can 56 share of floats on and those are new boats new models and ahead of major new product launches and the new capacity available so we re very excited i think that obviously conditions next year overall economic conditions are uncertain but mercury s growth is really very secular and people are still looking for the best product what we re seeing in the market right now is premium products and fiberglass holding up very well being very resilient and that s where most of mercury s high horsepower engines go so i would say our confidence remains extremely high kevin heenan great and just as a follow up ryan as you think about the different moving pieces in the macro backdrop i guess how best to think about the progression of your ebit margin on a consolidated basis next year relative to the targets you laid out in march would you expect to continue to move forward at the ebit margin level and maybe some of the puts and takes to consider by the segments next year thanks ryan gwillim yes kevin that s a good question obviously we re putting together as we speak our plans for next year through the budgeting process that we go through annually i ll tell you there s a range of scenarios for next year they focus primarily on a flattish market that is kind of a unit flattish market i would tell you margin growth continues to be something that we focus on year in and year out both on the cost side which i think you ve seen margins continue to expand this year despite headwinds such as fx and tariffs i would tell you that the plan today would be to continue margin growth each year of the plan to 2025 whether that s 10 20 basis points or more is kind of dependent on a lot of the external factors fx being really the main one at the current moment but we would not anticipate a plan where margins would go backwards in any year kevin heenan great very helpful thanks guys operator the next question is from james hardiman of citi please proceed with your question james hardiman hi good morning so i was going to start with maybe i was going to start with maybe an unfair question but maybe you just answered it marinemax said they expected the industry to be down mid single digits somewhere between five and 10 next year sounds like you think that that is too bearish of an outlook maybe just sort of initial thoughts there dave foulkes yes i think we re exploring a range of scenarios james to be honest that span up to flat to slightly down obviously we ll be preparing our cost structure for a more bearish scenario but in terms of core planning if you think last year industry was down 8 9 something percent something like that this year it s probably going to be down mid teens based on where we are in the year right now retailers in the year right now so on a compounded basis down more than 20 so i think preparing for reasonably flat market still seems about the right thing for us it s certainly a bifurcated market with stronger premium and stronger fiberglass versus alumina but i think it depends where the market ends up this year most of it is done but i think compounded 20 down seems like a good place to start for our next year but as i said we will certainly be preparing our cost structure for something that is not as positive as that james hardiman that makes a lot of sense and then sort of along those lines i mean a lot of uncertainty here as we close out 2022 how does that make you think about sort of the fourth quarter shipment strategy right you talked about some customers are likely deferring into next year we re going to be in our seasonally slow period how do you think then with all of those unknowns in mind how you want to finish the year in terms of weeks on hand inventory or total inventories how are you targeting that for year end 22 dave foulkes yes for year end 2022 as you saw pipelines continue to be down significantly so we don t see a case to moderate wholesale right now given the fact that we have dealers continuing to look for product and continuing to place orders so i think we ll be looking at the end of the year how we more about how we plan production for 2023 than how we close out 2022 we re not currently planning to sell wholesale shipments in this year and certainly one of the things that we didn t specifically mention about the pipeline is the incredible freshness of it right now there is almost no 2022 model year product anywhere in any pipeline it s all 23 model year product so dealers don t have any aging inventory at all everything is very fresh and very relevant as they go into 2023 and obviously all we re shipping right now is 2023 model year products so what we will be shipping is very healthy very contemporary inventory and dealers really don t have anything that s aging so james hardiman got it thanks dave operator the next question is from xian siew of bnp paribas please proceed with your question xian siew hi guys thanks for the question so a big part of the story is the p a business and how it s kind of resilient even as industry boat sales are low but you took down the margin guide for this year for p a i mean it sounds like a lot of it is transitory but maybe can you parse out how much of the cut is transitory factors and what gives you confidence in the underlying business and margins ryan gwillim it s a great question it s one we obviously anticipated being able to discuss a little bit listen it s really two main factors one is fx and unfortunately the fx impact on p a can t be understated it s just a big number it is over half of our fx impact for the year on the earnings and sales side and so that is really causing some pain it is upwards to 80 or more basis points of the decline this year if you think of the p a segment down 200 basis points from last year which is the guide so that s about half of it is fx the lion s share of the rest is just a mix issue it s obviously with the navico business semahtronix and relion coming on in the fourth quarter of last year those are businesses with very strong gross margins but cost structures that we need to get after and we are getting after to get those operating margins up to where the legacy p a business is so you saw the announcement in august the change over the name and the combination of a lot of cost items that is not complete there s more underway that will be coming so i would consider right now almost the trough margins for kind of the navico group and we look forward to continued growth and expansion even starting in the fourth quarter the last thing i would say is supply chains really really hampered p a it s just taken longer to get product the freight is more expensive and that s shown through with some of the margin pressure on the cost side xian siew okay got it that s really helpful and then maybe on the revenue side are there any other kind of data points i guess you talked about the retail sell through but any other data points showing maybe boat usage remains strong and consumers are not deferring any maintenance i m trying to think more about the p a maybe as trips for a member in freedom is still high or content per new boat is not coming down just any color on the p a drivers especially dave foulkes yes i think i think you pointed to a couple of engine p a sales i think on a constant currency basis up versus last year i think that s normally a good indicator of healthy boating participation freedom members are using their boats very happily so we re excited about that and membership growth continues there so we don t really have any indicators of kind of diminishing participation at the moment we re in a part of the season where in the northern markets the season is coming to a close so we ll get a good idea about winterization efforts maybe through there but the two metrics that you alluded to i think both indicate continued strong participation xian siew okay got it very helpful thank you guys operator the next question is from craig kennison of robert w baird please proceed with your question craig kennison hi good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to go back to the first question asked on the fond du lac capacity expansion and really ask it in a different way in a flat marine market which you described how many more engine units would you expect to sell due to the share gain you noted the repower market opportunity and some international opportunities as well dave foulkes yes i don t know if we ve ever specifically disclosed like unit share opportunity but the capacity expansion does double the potential output so i would say for mercury share gain and aup associated with horsepower increases have really been a huge driver of mercury s continued growth and success versus specifically bulk market expansion and we would continue to believe that to be the case craig so i would say unit production will be substantially higher i don t think we ve quoted a number yet but aup will also be higher as we migrate to higher and higher horsepower the new products that we re shortly introducing are in that category we think they re very attractive we think that they will accelerate our share gains so we re very confident in substantial growth next year even in a flat boating market ryan gwillim craig the one addition i ll put out there and these numbers we ve given over time but those three markets if you consider saltwater commercial and repower those global markets are multiple billions of dollars and so if we get our fair share like we think we will you can kind of back into what you think from a dollar wise or share wise where we can get to craig kennison thanks and just to follow up on the engine side as it relates to currency to what extent is currency a disadvantage competitively for you given some competitors are based in japan dave foulkes we re continuing to we re really pricing for our technology and product features craig so we continue to price at a premium across most of our product line to manufacturers and we have not so far seen any evidence of any abnormal behavior in market pricing craig kennison great thank you operator the next question is from mike swartz of truist securities please proceed with your question mike swartz hi good morning maybe to start off with i think dave you made some commentary coming out of the recent dealer meetings from a number of your brands just around strong order patterns maybe give us a little context or a little bit of color on what exactly that means dave foulkes yes what it means is we have kind of a trimester system of ordering where three times in the year the dealers place orders and we go through it s important to do that after the dealer meetings so the dealers experience the new products that are going to be delivered so i think it was 60 new products that we planned to launch or have already launched the majority of already this year they were extremely well received and so they are driving order patterns consistent with prior years and consistent with what we expect so we have no indication of dealers in showing any kind of hesitancy with wholesale ordering pattern in this particular round of ordering which would essentially support year round markets plus stocking for the seasonal markets so that s really the context if you like mike swartz got you okay that s helpful and then maybe ryan second question on propulsion just the 20 margin this quarter maybe help us think about going forward is that the right run rate were there some mix positives that you had in the quarter that we shouldn t expect to get any color on that would be helpful ryan gwillim well i have to be careful because i know my president and cfo of mercury are probably listening to this call but yes i mean they still lever if you look at our leverage change in sales over change in earnings they still lever up north of 20 and so there s certainly a case that that is achievable more often than not there were no kind of odd one offs really in the quarter there s always puts and takes i will tell you that the expansion project is close to completion efficiency is probably improving better than we anticipated and the output is strong you combine that with the fact that the mix of products continues to mix up to high horsepower which is our newer products which have more costs taken out of them from the design process and you just kind of get a steady stream of margin growth there s a reason they ve grown margins annually every year for the last decade and we plan to continue that trend over the next couple of years mike swartz great thank you operator the next question is from fred wightman of wolfe research please proceed with your question fred wightman hi guys can you touch on the european business and just the outlook there i think that was up 15 in the quarter and you ve heard some pretty scary macro commentary from other parts of the consumer landscape so how should we think about that chunk of the business going forward dave foulkes yes fred actually it s surprisingly strong definitely strength in the mediterranean markets prepared with some comparative softness in kind of scandinavia and some of the northern markets but in aggregate remarkably resilient i would say both on the engine side and the boat side so we did a little promotional activity in the scandinavian marketplace but really that s pretty much all we ve done and sales continue to be pretty good in fact remarkably resilient so we re really not seeing although it s different country by country and i m talking about europe as opposed to markets like anzp anzp is strong as well but really probably more resilient than we might have expected ryan gwillim it s also one of the places fred that has not gotten their lion s share of engine products that they would like and with the new capacity again coming online we would anticipate our ability to satisfy more oems and repower in europe in 2023 fred wightman understood and then ryan you touched on the 2025 targets a little bit earlier but have you changed your thinking about some of those downside scenarios that you touched on i think it was a 6 and 8 number that you put out there any change to those figures based on what you saw for march ryan gwillim no fred no change whatsoever and just to remind everyone that s been around us for a while we do these three and now four year plans and they re never linear but the results are never perfect on a page we re still very confident that we can get to where we told the world we d be in 25 it may be a little bit bumpier in the front due to macro things that are out of our control but we are still very much in support of our 2025 targets fred wightman great thank you operator the next question is from scott stember of mkm partners please proceed with your question scott stember good morning and thanks for taking my questions you guys made some comments that i guess for things like aluminum fish you would expect some people to delay their purchases or placing orders have you actually seen that cancellation activity or is this just something you re looking for dave foulkes yes we haven t really seen any cancellations what we have seen is that the aluminum fishing is probably the slowest part of the market right now across if you look across ssi data and our data you ll see pontoon actually remains strong but aluminum fishing is the weaker part of the market now that tends to be a more northern kind of upper midwest product and that is obviously the most seasonal part of our market so if you look at how you think about interest rates at the moment up until about two or three months ago interest rates on boat loans were roughly where they were in 2019 over the last two or three months it declined about 150 basis points so that obviously is a factor to consider on the positive side gas prices have dropped well below the high so that s positive but i m just as we work through explanation for what is why is aluminum fishing a little softer you can imagine most people in that part of the market would be potentially buying a product that they would use for a few weeks and then put away in storage for five or six months before they use it again at the beginning of the year that might have made sense when they thought that they might not get a product in 2020 in the next year in the next season but i think given improving pipelines and more product availability i think some people are clearly going to make the decision that product is likely to be available in the following season and they may not choose to make the investment to put something away for five months so that is i think a partial explanation of why aluminum fishing in the markets is a little softer scott stember okay and just one quick follow up you talked about 23 i guess an assumption of a flattish market for new boat sales but what about propulsion p a and just consumables in general how would you expect that to perform dave foulkes it depends a little bit on what the weather patterns look like in the following year but we have seen usage patterns in 2022 much like 2021 so i don t think there s a lot of reason to suppose that they would be significantly different we ve seen through pretty much every downturn that people continue to use that product so we would expect that to continue next year we would also expect to see strong freedom participation so yes no indications really i think that things will be a lot different next year scott stember got it thank you operator the next question is from joe altobello of raymond james please proceed with your question joe altobello hi guys good morning just want to go back to p a for a second sales up 1 organic in the quarter i think back in july you described the month of july as extremely robust so it sounds like that business slowed a little bit throughout the quarter i guess first is that accurate and then second why are retailers and distributors slowing the pace of restocking is it just macro concerns if it s not participation dave foulkes maybe i ll talk about the last part and maybe ryan can talk about the first part ryan gwillim sure yes dave foulkes so i think what we ve seen is that and that we ve seen obviously as we ve looked at the results from other p a companies recently similar patents where some of the big box and online retailers some of the larger distributors during the period where a maximum supply chain disruption really stocked up assuming that there would be discontinuities in supply and now they are preparing themselves for just as we would for more adverse conditions in the marketplace and so destocking to where they more reasonable levels that they believe relevant going forward now obviously over time retail and wholesale are going to have to come into balance so what we are seeing is where we have visibility which is mostly through the major retailers retail sales are up but generally wholesale is trailing retail and i would say it s in the kind of 5 to 10 range so wholesale is kind of 5 to 10 behind where retail is and retail is positive and i think it s just retailers preparing for the potential of lower demand going forward ryan gwillim and then joe i ll give you the i mean there s really no magic here that s we do tend to try to avoid small sample sizes and maybe the july comment could have been one of those but there really wasn t a pickup or a slowdown there are definitely if you remember the spring there was a little bit of slowness and as we came into july it had picked up and so you saw a sequential growth just kind of from june and into july and august this is a business that when it s doing really well you have to separate a little bit at some of the recent times where we ve had some explosions in of sales in certain quarters but it s still up 30 ish percent from 2019 it s still large numbers if you kind of go back even further so no slowness in the back half of the quarter this is a business that kind of tumbled around slightly up given consistent participation and that s really where we landed on a constant currency basis joe altobello okay that s very helpful and just maybe a follow up on the boat side is it still your expectation that you ll be refilling the channel throughout 2023 dave foulkes i think so but it will obviously change by segment it s as ryan said it s hard to imagine a reasonable scenario where we would be able to refill the fiberglass pipeline in 2023 so that will almost certainly extend to 2024 depending on what the market conditions over the longer term look like i think there is a scenario where we could refill the aluminum pipeline through 2023 probably not in the first half but maybe in the second half joe altobello got it okay thank you guys operator the next question is from eric wold of b riley securities please proceed with your question eric wold thanks good morning two kind of quick follow ups i guess one on the p a segment obviously ryan you stressed just how much fx has been impacting on the top line and the bottom line this year and expectations that likely continues what can you do if anything to kind of offset that have you taken price to try to offset is that something you kind of really don t want to necessarily do in this environment ryan gwillim we can and have taken price eric i think there is a kind of a level where you don t want to go too far away and have people delay a service or not by the things that drive the business so we have taken price one thing that we should mention we have a very active hedging practice here that the company and it s very programmatic we are believe it or not the fx impact would be double what it is without our hedging impact and that includes actually those of you that dive deep into our financials will see this we did some cross currency swaps that netted us about 50 million to help offset it s not a p l event it s not a free cash flow event but it s obviously cash in the door so the treasury team does a fantastic job of doing hedging and we ll continue that practice but this is we re in unparalleled times where the dollar is so strong and 30 of our sales are outside the u s and a good portion of those are denominated in non u s currencies so we re doing the best we can within the guidelines but and taking price but there s only so much we can do without disturbing the underlying market eric wold that makes sense and then a follow up question i know you kind of talked about the projection on the targets for 2025 maybe the trajectory changes a bit in terms of being more bumpy upfront do you think that the inputs or the assumptions or drivers sort of need to change as well in terms of what gets you there maybe more acquisitions than not or something else or do you think the original kind of assumptions around that are intact it s just the trajectory that you may need to change dave foulkes i don t think we need to change anything fundamentally the path to 2025 assumed about 70 of revenue growth was organic including acquisitions that we d already completed like navico and about 30 would be from additional acquisitions and i that still seems reasonable i think a lot of the secular growth expectations remain in place particularly for propulsion we haven t really had an opportunity to talk about it much but navico group is doing very well particularly penetration into non marine markets for example which is also part of the thesis and boat group if anything is ahead of schedule so i would say a lot of the inputs remain strong we continue to look at m a but obviously at the moment and then if you think about 2025 targets including the 10 billion of revenue but also including the kind of roughly 70 of eps obviously 450 million of share repurchases is very helpful for the eps portion of that 2025 target so yes we re definitely adjusting capital strategy a bit but i would say that that is more adjusting to the environment and where we can get the maximum return as opposed to any fundamental change in the path operator at this time we would like to turn the call back to dave for some concluding remarks dave foulkes thank you all for joining us and for the great questions really appreciate them as you ve seen despite the very dynamic environment and the recent added challenges of hurricane ian our businesses continue to perform very well there s no change to our thesis overall we had really strong margins in the quarter and notably boat group well into the double digits again so our margins are really holding up well despite fx and slightly lower revenue which i think is a testament to the work we ve already done on our cost structure continue to do and prepares us extremely well for a range of scenarios next year we re also making real progress with the strategic initiatives to support the 2025 plan including the capacity expansions the new distribution center new product introductions we mentioned returning record levels of capital to shareholders particularly through accelerated share repurchases i just want to remind you once again please join our investor event at lake x in november you will not be disappointed by the experiences that we re going to have on display there of recently released products and some exciting unreleased products and technologies this afternoon i m heading down to fort lauderdale the show seems to have opened

again shrugged off troubles in us big tech land and concentrated more on higher commodity prices with the us dollar falling on wednesday night and a growing feeling across the globe central banks will now begin easing the pace of rate hikes metals and oil prices surged the materials sector closed up 1 7 and energy 2 4 the top five index winners were all miners dominated by gold fourteen of the top twenty asx300 gainers were miners sticking with the big end of capitalisation the other point of focus yesterday were the banks anz bank anz reported a 16 profit increase on last year and increased its dividend and fell 3 3 the stock had been up 18 since mid june movements in the other banks were mixed and the sector closed down 0 4 macquarie group mqg reports today the only other sectors to close in the red yesterday were communication services 0 7 and utilities 0 1 all other sectors rose by modest amounts the asx200 muddled its way to a 60 point gain by midday but faded thereafter perhaps the most pleasing result was a 0 6 gain for technology when the nasdaq had fallen 2 on wednesday night has the tech sector finally let go of the nasdaq s apron we did see further 9 point falls in the aussie two and ten year yields yesterday us yields fell on wednesday night as well but wall street was dominated by big plunges in big tech on earnings results it did not get any better last night on the economic front there is a growing shift towards forecasting a 50 point rate hike from the rba next week and to lower 2023 gdp forecasts economists were caught out by this month s 25 point hike when 50 was heavily backed with philip lowe now worried about the economic impact of too hard too fast that would suggest going back up to a 50 point hike would be a truss flip but as barrenjoey puts it the facts have changed in reference to the cpi the cpi came in at 7 4 and the rba is forecasting 7 75 by year end personally my tip on cup day is to back 25 oh the pain following on from a 9 fall for google on result and 7 for microsoft meta reported in wednesday night s aftermarket and initially fell 15 last night that became 25 in the day session in this morning s aftermarket amazon has reported and is down 17 i sense a pattern with each successive result release the other mega techs which themselves had already fallen fall further is there any saviour apple dow has reported this morning and is only down 1 5 having fallen 3 in the day session we recall the dow closed flat on wednesday night despite a 125 point drag from microsoft with google not a dow stock last night the dow

last night with the ten year falling 8 point to below 4 and the two year falling 6 points this despite the first estimate of us september quarter gdp coming in at 2 6 when 2 3 was forecast the us

the swift recovery from the short recession of early 2020 left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand prices skyrocketed and have barely budged example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video detroit all summer long aleen hudson kept looking for a new minivan or suv for her growing passenger shuttle service she had a good credit rating and enough cash for a down payment yet dealerships in the detroit area didn t have any suitable vehicles or they d demand she pay 3 000 to 6 000 above the sticker price months of frustration left her despondent i was depressed hudson said i was angry too a breakthrough arrived in late september when a dealer called about a 2022 chrysler pacifica at 41 000 it was hardly a bargain and it wasn t quite what hudson wanted yet the dealer was asking only slightly above sticker price and hudson felt in no position to walk away she s back in business with her own van it could have been worse hudson made her purchase just as the prices of both new and used vehicles have been inching down from their eye watering record highs and more vehicles are gradually becoming available at dealerships hudson s van likely would have cost even more a few months ago not that anyone should expect prices to fall anywhere near where they were before the pandemic recession struck in early 2020 the swift recovery from the recession left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand price skyrocketed and they ve scarcely budged since prices on new and used vehicles remain 30 to 50 above where they were when the pandemic erupted the average used auto cost nearly 31 000 last month the average new 47 000 with higher prices and loan rates combining to push average monthly payments on a new vehicle above 700 millions of buyers have been priced out of the new vehicle market and are now confined to used vehicles the high prices are yielding substantial profits for most automakers despite sluggish sales on tuesday for example general motors reported that its third quarter net profit jumped more than 36 thanks in part to sales of pricey pickup trucks and large suvs still as hudson discovered many vehicles are becoming slightly more affordable signs first emerged weeks ago in the 40 million sales a year used market as demand waned and inventories rose prices eased from their springtime heights carmax said it sold nearly 15 000 fewer vehicles last quarter than it had a year earlier the ceo of the used vehicle company based in richmond virginia pointed to inflation higher borrowing rates and diminished consumer confidence a buyer s strike is how adam joans an auto analyst at morgan stanley characterized the sales drops a dynamic that typically foretells lower prices and indeed the average used vehicle price in september was down 1 from its may peak according to edmunds com at autonation the nation s largest dealership chain sales of used vehicles and profit per vehicle both dropped last quarter ceo mike manley noted that while the supply of vehicles remains low used auto prices are declining our analysis shows that we are coming off the high values that we saw before manley told analysts thursday ivan drury director of insights at edmunds cautioned that it will take years for used prices to fall close to their pre pandemic levels since 2020 automakers haven t been leasing as many cars thereby choking off one key source of late model used vehicles similarly rental companies haven t been able to buy many new vehicles so eventually they are selling fewer autos into the used market that s crimped another source of vehicles and because used cars aren t sitting long on dealer lots demand remains strong enough to prop up prices when auto prices first soared two years ago lower income buyers were elbowed out of the new vehicle market eventually many of them couldn t afford even used autos people with subprime credit scores 620 or below bought only 5 of new vehicles last month down from nearly 9 before the pandemic that indicated that many lower income households could no longer afford vehicles said j d power vice president tyson jominy higher borrowing rates have compounded the problem in january 2020 shortly before the pandemic hit used vehicle buyers paid an average of 8 4 annual interest according to edmunds monthly payments averaged 412 by last month the average rate had reached 9 2 and because prices had risen for over two years the average payment had jumped to 567 the 1 average drop in used prices will help financially secure buyers with solid credit scores who can qualify for lower loan rates but for those with poor credit and lower incomes any price drop will be wiped out by higher borrowing costs the new vehicle market by contrast has become an option mainly for affluent buyers automakers are increasingly deploying scarce computer chips to make costly loaded out versions of pickups suvs and other outsize vehicles typically with relatively low gas mileage last month the average price of a new vehicle was down slightly from august but remained more than 11 000 above its level in january 2020 glenn mears who runs five dealerships south of canton ohio says the federal reserve s interest rate hikes by contributing to pricier auto loans are slowing his showroom traffic we can feel some pullback he said analysts generally say that with shortages of computer chips and other parts still hobbling factories new vehicle prices won t likely fall substantially but further modest price drops may be likely the availability of vehicles on u s dealer lots improved to nearly 1 4 million vehicles last month up from 1 million for most of the year cox automotive reported before the pandemic normal supply was far higher around 4 million so historically speaking inventory remains tight and demand still high like hudson many buyers are still stuck paying sticker price or above it s extraordinarily expensive these days said jominy who estimates that there are still 5 million u s customers waiting to buy new vehicles despite recent stock market declines many such buyers have built up wealth especially in their homes and are rewarding themselves with high end autos in the san francisco bay area for example notes inder dosanjh who runs a 20 dealership group that includes general motors ford acura volkswagen and stellantis brands many people have received substantial pay raises there s just a lot of money out there he said in its earnings report tuesday gm noted that its customer demand is holding up though gm and other automakers would like to produce more vehicles at the moment they are benefiting from slower production which typically means higher prices and profits john lawler ford s chief financial officer noted wednesday that near record new vehicle prices were starting to decline and consumer appetites are starting to change demand for midrange vehicles he said has begun to outpace more profitable autos loaded with options next year could be a turning point suggested jeff windau an analyst at edward jones with the economy likely to weaken and possibly enter a recession prices could fall as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they re willing to bite off from a payment perspective

when news broke on october 13 that five individuals had been killed in their northeast raleigh neighborhood by a teenaged gunman i m sure we all shared feelings of shock horror and concern for the victims families friends and neighbors shortly afterwards many turned their thoughts from the tragedy itself to its potential implications for politics and public policy an understandable reaction yes but also one fraught with peril what responsible people did next was to keep those thoughts to themselves until they knew more about the details of the raleigh shooting alas joe biden wasn t one of those people in an official white house statement the president expressed his grief and sympathy then quickly pivoted to politics we must pass an assault weapons ban he insisted the american people support this commonsense action to get weapons of war off our streets house democrats have already passed it the senate should do the same send it to my desk and i ll sign it by assault weapons biden wasn t referring to machine guns which are for the most part already illegal for private citizens to own he was talking about standard issue semiautomatic rifles that fire one round per trigger pull there are tens of millions of these rifles in the united states they account for a tiny percentage of deaths by firearm even if it were politically possible to ban the sale of new ones it would be practically impossible to confiscate all the rifles already in existence and doing so would still have only a miniscule effect on homicides and assaults the vast majority of which are committed with handguns or other weapons most importantly such a ban would have had absolutely no effect on the raleigh shootings the teenager in question used a shotgun he also carried a handgun and hunting knife if the president had resisted his immediate urge to politicize the tragedy he d have avoided jamming another foot in his already overstuffed mouth if he d waited for the release of the police report perhaps he wouldn t have applied his stock answer to what proved to be the wrong question such stock answers don t work anyway studies recently published in social science quarterly and the british journal of political science show that when politicians talk up gun control after well publicized shootings they only reinforce preexisting public views for or against biden is hardly the only politician who demeans and coarsens our public discourse by speaking out loud what ought to be kept in one s head donald trump does it virtually every day even north carolina gov roy cooper who during much of his political career was known for and served well by a judicious use of words has taken to uttering sweeping generalizations and insults in his role as chairman of the democratic governors association for example cooper told a reporter last week that the majority of the republican party has decided that they are ok with an autocracy as long as their guy is in charge criticizing trump and his henchmen for their false and reckless claims about the 2020 election is entirely appropriate but cooper s claim that most republicans support autocracy is also false and reckless as well as in obvious tension with the recent behavior of democratic officeholders including the governor himself keep in mind that president biden believes he has the unilateral power to transfer hundreds of billions of dollars in student loan debt to federal taxpayers cooper believed he had the unilateral power during the covid 19 pandemic to decide which businesses would be allowed to operate both cited vague passages of laws that were clearly never intended to grant a single individual such powers neither should be lecturing the rest of us about autocracy reserve is to civilized society what oil is to an engine indispensable without its lubrication there is friction heat and eventually catastrophic failure most of our stray thoughts and feelings merit neither vocalizing nor analyzing that goes double for politicians john hood is a john locke foundation board member his latest books mountain folk and forest folk combine epic fantasy with early american history

the swift recovery from the short recession of early 2020 left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand prices skyrocketed and have barely budged example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video detroit all summer long aleen hudson kept looking for a new minivan or suv for her growing passenger shuttle service she had a good credit rating and enough cash for a down payment yet dealerships in the detroit area didn t have any suitable vehicles or they d demand she pay 3 000 to 6 000 above the sticker price months of frustration left her despondent i was depressed hudson said i was angry too a breakthrough arrived in late september when a dealer called about a 2022 chrysler pacifica at 41 000 it was hardly a bargain and it wasn t quite what hudson wanted yet the dealer was asking only slightly above sticker price and hudson felt in no position to walk away she s back in business with her own van it could have been worse hudson made her purchase just as the prices of both new and used vehicles have been inching down from their eye watering record highs and more vehicles are gradually becoming available at dealerships hudson s van likely would have cost even more a few months ago not that anyone should expect prices to fall anywhere near where they were before the pandemic recession struck in early 2020 the swift recovery from the recession left automakers short of parts and vehicles to meet demand price skyrocketed and they ve scarcely budged since prices on new and used vehicles remain 30 to 50 above where they were when the pandemic erupted the average used auto cost nearly 31 000 last month the average new 47 000 with higher prices and loan rates combining to push average monthly payments on a new vehicle above 700 millions of buyers have been priced out of the new vehicle market and are now confined to used vehicles the high prices are yielding substantial profits for most automakers despite sluggish sales on tuesday for example general motors reported that its third quarter net profit jumped more than 36 thanks in part to sales of pricey pickup trucks and large suvs still as hudson discovered many vehicles are becoming slightly more affordable signs first emerged weeks ago in the 40 million sales a year used market as demand waned and inventories rose prices eased from their springtime heights carmax said it sold nearly 15 000 fewer vehicles last quarter than it had a year earlier the ceo of the used vehicle company based in richmond virginia pointed to inflation higher borrowing rates and diminished consumer confidence a buyer s strike is how adam joans an auto analyst at morgan stanley characterized the sales drops a dynamic that typically foretells lower prices and indeed the average used vehicle price in september was down 1 from its may peak according to edmunds com at autonation the nation s largest dealership chain sales of used vehicles and profit per vehicle both dropped last quarter ceo mike manley noted that while the supply of vehicles remains low used auto prices are declining our analysis shows that we are coming off the high values that we saw before manley told analysts thursday ivan drury director of insights at edmunds cautioned that it will take years for used prices to fall close to their pre pandemic levels since 2020 automakers haven t been leasing as many cars thereby choking off one key source of late model used vehicles similarly rental companies haven t been able to buy many new vehicles so eventually they are selling fewer autos into the used market that s crimped another source of vehicles and because used cars aren t sitting long on dealer lots demand remains strong enough to prop up prices when auto prices first soared two years ago lower income buyers were elbowed out of the new vehicle market eventually many of them couldn t afford even used autos people with subprime credit scores 620 or below bought only 5 of new vehicles last month down from nearly 9 before the pandemic that indicated that many lower income households could no longer afford vehicles said j d power vice president tyson jominy higher borrowing rates have compounded the problem in january 2020 shortly before the pandemic hit used vehicle buyers paid an average of 8 4 annual interest according to edmunds monthly payments averaged 412 by last month the average rate had reached 9 2 and because prices had risen for over two years the average payment had jumped to 567 the 1 average drop in used prices will help financially secure buyers with solid credit scores who can qualify for lower loan rates but for those with poor credit and lower incomes any price drop will be wiped out by higher borrowing costs the new vehicle market by contrast has become an option mainly for affluent buyers automakers are increasingly deploying scarce computer chips to make costly loaded out versions of pickups suvs and other outsize vehicles typically with relatively low gas mileage last month the average price of a new vehicle was down slightly from august but remained more than 11 000 above its level in january 2020 glenn mears who runs five dealerships south of canton ohio says the federal reserve s interest rate hikes by contributing to pricier auto loans are slowing his showroom traffic we can feel some pullback he said analysts generally say that with shortages of computer chips and other parts still hobbling factories new vehicle prices won t likely fall substantially but further modest price drops may be likely the availability of vehicles on u s dealer lots improved to nearly 1 4 million vehicles last month up from 1 million for most of the year cox automotive reported before the pandemic normal supply was far higher around 4 million so historically speaking inventory remains tight and demand still high like hudson many buyers are still stuck paying sticker price or above it s extraordinarily expensive these days said jominy who estimates that there are still 5 million u s customers waiting to buy new vehicles despite recent stock market declines many such buyers have built up wealth especially in their homes and are rewarding themselves with high end autos in the san francisco bay area for example notes inder dosanjh who runs a 20 dealership group that includes general motors ford acura volkswagen and stellantis brands many people have received substantial pay raises there s just a lot of money out there he said in its earnings report tuesday gm noted that its customer demand is holding up though gm and other automakers would like to produce more vehicles at the moment they are benefiting from slower production which typically means higher prices and profits john lawler ford s chief financial officer noted wednesday that near record new vehicle prices were starting to decline and consumer appetites are starting to change demand for midrange vehicles he said has begun to outpace more profitable autos loaded with options next year could be a turning point suggested jeff windau an analyst at edward jones with the economy likely to weaken and possibly enter a recession prices could fall as consumers become more focused on their financial situation and what they re willing to bite off from a payment perspective

the findings including encouraging preliminary efficacy data in various tumor types were presented during the 34th eortc nci aacr symposium planegg munich germany accesswire october 27 2022 morphosys ag fse mor nasdaq mor today announced that preliminary results from the ongoing phase 1 2 study nct04104776 of tulmimetostat cpi 0209 monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with advanced cancers showed responses or disease stabilization in five cohorts with evaluable patients tulmimetostat is an oral investigational next generation selective dual inhibitor of ezh2 and ezh1 designed to improve on first generation ezh2 inhibitors via increased potency longer residence time on target and a longer half life the data were presented during poster sessions at the 34th symposium on molecular targets and cancer therapeutics hosted by the european organisation for research and treatment of cancer eortc the national cancer institute nci and the american association for cancer research aacr in barcelona spain these early data support further investigation into the broad therapeutic potential of tulmimetostat in heavily pretreated patients with advanced cancers said charles drescher m d gynecologic oncologist and medical director for gynecologic cancer research at the swedish cancer institute in seattle washington advanced cancer patients who have progressed following prior therapies have significant treatment needs that might benefit from a targeted approach with an ezh2 inhibitor we look forward to learning more as the trial progresses at data cutoff july 16 2022 51 of 52 patients enrolled in the phase 2 expansion phase of the trial had received at least one dose of tulmimetostat in the following cohorts metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer lymphoma bap1 mutated mesothelioma arid1a mutated ovarian clear cell carcinoma arid1a mutated endometrial carcinoma and arid1a mutated urothelial and other metastatic solid tumors at trial entry 68 of patients had been treated with at least three prior lines of therapy patients received oral tulmimetostat 350 mg once daily of the 10 evaluable patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma four had a partial response and three had stable disease of the eight evaluable patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer five had stable disease of the four evaluable patients with endometrial carcinoma two had partial responses one of whom later achieved a complete response after data cutoff and two had stable disease two of the three evaluable patients with peripheral t cell lymphoma had complete responses for the nine evaluable patients with mesothelioma there were two partial responses and four disease stabilizations the safety profile of tulmimetostat was consistent with the mechanism of action of ezh2 inhibition the most frequent treatment emergent adverse events aes determined to be possibly related to tulmimetostat included thrombocytopenia 47 1 diarrhea 37 3 nausea 29 4 anemia 27 5 fatigue 25 5 neutropenia 17 6 dysgeusia 17 6 alopecia 15 7 and vomiting 15 7 treatment emergent aes led to dose reductions in 16 patients 31 4 and to dose interruptions in 33 patients 64 7 seven patients 13 7 discontinued treatment due to aes tulmimetostat was designed to target both ezh2 related tumor progression and the redundant actions of ezh1 with high potency and durability along with additional pharmacokinetic advances over prior ezh2 inhibitors offering the potential for enhanced anti tumor activity across numerous cancer types said tim demuth m d ph d morphosys chief research and development officer preliminary data from the ongoing phase 2 trial showing anti tumor activity across multiple cancers support our aspiration to uncover the full potential of ezh2 inhibition these results are an important step toward demonstrating proof of concept as we continue investigating tulmimetostat at multiple doses to identify the optimal efficacy safety profile also presented were updated results from the phase 1 dose escalation portion of the trial in which 41 patients were treated with oral tulmimetostat ranging from 50 mg to 375 mg daily at study entry 15 patients had arid1a alterations across multiple tumor types and all patients with mesothelioma had bap1 alterations one dose limiting toxicity of grade 4 thrombocytopenia was observed which occurred at the highest dose the disease control rate complete and partial responses disease stabilizations at 375 mg was 66 7 disease control was noted across doses except at 137 5 mg three of six patients in the 100 mg cohort had disease stabilization of the seven patients in the 225 mg cohort four had disease stabilization and one with bap 1 mutated mesothelioma had a partial response another partial response was noted in arid1a mutated endometrial carcinoma at 375 mg these initial results support patient selection based on arid1a and bap1 in the ongoing phase 2 expansion study about morphosys at

increase of 14 6 from quarter 2 2022 the combination of price increases a stronger u s dollar market demand and some delayed shipments due to material availability continue to contribute to the record high backlog as costs stabilized margins recovered from the second quarter furthermore historically high production volumes are having a positive impact on margins said richard vollering chief financial officer of hammond power solutions industry demand has continued to show strength as shown by the backlog growth but the pace of growth is slowing with the backlog increase from the second quarter at 14 6 down from the 26 6 increase experienced between the first and the second quarter nevertheless our backlog is now extending well into 2023 once again growth is across all channels in the quarter but most notably in the u s distributor and o e m channels our cash position and balance sheet have continued to strengthen over the first nine months of 2022 providing a solid foundation to grow organically and through acquisition into 2023 and beyond the company experienced an increase in its gross margin rate for quarter 3 2022 which was 29 2 compared to a quarter 3 2021 gross

of which affected quarter 3 2022 sales and will continue to be reflected in future quarter sales in the third quarter some material input costs have stabilized while others continue to increase due to underlying inflation while there remains higher than normal volatility in costs we have seen a positive impact on margins in the quarter total selling and distribution expenses were 16 433 in quarter 3 2022 or 11 0 of sales versus 11 433 in quarter 3 2021 or 12 0 of sales an increase of 5 000 and a decrease of 1 0 of sales year to date selling and distribution expenses were 46 192 or 11 2 of sales in 2022 compared to 31 900 or 12 1 in 2021 an increase of 14 292 or a decrease of 0 9 of sales the year over year increase in selling and distribution expenses is a result of higher variable freight

it s rare for regulators to completely shut down a fishery but they re considering doing just that in at least one instance and warming waters are the culprit portland maine fishing regulators and the seafood industry are grappling with the possibility that some once profitable species that have declined with climate change might not come back several marketable species harvested by u s fishermen are the subject of quota cuts seasonal closures and other restrictions as populations have fallen and waters have warmed in some instances such as the groundfishing industry for species like flounder in the northeast the changing environment has made it harder for fish to recover from years of overfishing that already taxed the population officials in alaska have canceled the fall bristol bay red king crab harvest and winter snow crab harvest dealing a blow to the bering sea crab industry that is sometimes worth more than 200 million a year as populations have declined in the face of warming waters the atlantic cod fishery once the lifeblood industry of new england is now essentially shuttered but even with depleted populations imperiled by climate change it s rare for regulators to completely shut down a fishery as they re considering doing for new england shrimp the northern shrimp once a seafood delicacy has been subject to a fishing moratorium since 2014 scientists believe warming waters are wiping out their populations and they won t be coming back so the regulatory atlantic states marine fisheries commission is now considering making that moratorium permanent essentially ending the centuries old harvest of the shrimp it s a stark siren for several species caught by u s fishermen that regulators say are on the brink others include softshell clams winter flounder alaskan snow crabs and chinook salmon exactly how many fisheries are threatened principally by warming waters is difficult to say but additional cutbacks and closures are likely in the future as climate change intensifies said malin pinsky director of the graduate program in ecology and evolution at rutgers university this pattern of climate change and how it ripples throughout communities and coastal economies is something we need to get used to pinsky said many years are pushing us outside of what we have experienced historically and we are going to continue to observe these further novel conditions as years go by while it s unclear whether climate change has ever been the dominant factor in permanently shutting down a u s fishery global warming is a key reason several once robust fisheries are in increasingly poor shape and subject to more aggressive regulation in recent years warming temperatures introduce new predators cause species to shift their center of population northward or make it harder for them to grow to maturity scientists said in the case of the northern shrimp scientists and regulators said at a meeting in august that the population has not rebounded after nearly a decade of no commercial fishing regulators will revisit the possibility of a permanent moratorium this winter said dustin colson leaning a fishery management plan coordinator with the atlantic states commission another approach could be for the commission to relinquish control of the fishery he said the shrimp prefer cold temperatures yet the gulf of maine is warming faster than most of the world s oceans scientists say warming waters have also moved new predators into the gulf but in maine where the cold water shrimp fishery is based fishermen have tried to make the case that abundance of the shrimp is cyclical and any move to shutter the fishery for good is premature i want to look into the future of this it s not unprecedented to have a loss of shrimp we went through it in the 50s we went through it in the 70s we had a tough time in the 90s said vincent balzano a shrimp fisherman from portland they came back another jeopardized species is winter flounder once highly sought by southern new england fishermen the national oceanic and atmospheric administration has described the fish as significantly below target population levels on georges bank a key fishing ground scientists with university of rhode island and rhode island department of environmental management wrote that the fish have struggled to reach maturity due to increased predation related to warming winters in a report last year on the west coast chinook salmon face an extinction risk due to climate change noaa has reported drought has worsened the fish s prospects in california at the southern end of its range scientists have said fishermen on the east coast from virginia to maine have dug softshell clams from tidal mud for centuries and they re a staple of seafood restaurants they re used for chowder and fried clam dishes and are sometimes called steamers but the clam harvest fell from about 3 5 million pounds 1 6 million kilograms in 2010 to 2 1 million pounds 950 000 kilograms in 2020 as the industry has contended with an aging workforce and increasing competition from predators such as crabs and worms scientists have linked the growing predator threat to warming waters the 2020 haul in maine which harvests the most clams was the smallest in more than 90 years and the 2021 catch still lagged behind typical hauls from the 2000s which were consistently close to 2 million pounds 907 000 kilograms or more predicting what the clam harvest will look like in 2022 is difficult but the industry remains threatened by the growing presence of invasive green crabs said brian beal a professor of marine ecology at the university of maine at machias the crabs which eat clams are native to europe and arrived in the u s about 200 years ago and have grown in population as waters have warmed there seem to have been relative to 2020 a ton more green crabs that settled beal said that s not a good omen one challenge of managing fisheries that are declining due to warming waters is that regulators rely on historical data to set quotas and other regulations said lisa kerr a senior research scientist with the gulf of maine research institute in portland maine scientists and regulators are learning that some fish stocks just aren t capable of returning to the productivity level of 40 years ago she said back then u s fishermen typically caught more than 100 million pounds 45 4 million kilograms of atlantic cod per year now they usually catch less than 2 million pounds 907 000 kilograms as overfishing and environmental changes have prevented the population from returning to historical levels the future of managing species that are in such bad shape might require accepting the possibility that fully rebuilding them is impossible kerr said
