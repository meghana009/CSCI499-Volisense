by egon von greyerz specie gold and silver coin is the most perfect medium because it will preserve its own level because having intrinsic and universal value it can never die in our hands and it is the surest resource of reliance in time of war thomas jefferson since no current president or prime minister nor any central bank chairman understands what money is or the relevance of gold we turn above back to history and thomas jefferson america s third president for a proper definition jefferson also understood that paper is poverty it is only the ghost of money and not money itself as the world economy goes towards an inflationary depression exacerbated not only by epic debts and deficits but now also by war the significance of gold takes on a whole different dimension so let s dissect jefferson s statement gold will preserve its own level gold is constant purchasing power as such gold doesn t go up in real terms an ounce of gold today buys a good suit for a man just like it did in roman times the graph below shows gold as constant purchasing power at the 100 line whilst all the currencies are crashing to the bottom all currencies are continuing to lose value against real money although it never takes place in a straight line with higher interest rates inflation higher deficits debts poverty cost of wars and increasing pressures in the financial system the currency debasement will now accelerate gold is not an investment gold is eternal money as such gold maintains its real value whereas paper money loses all its value over time for 5000 years gold has outlived all other forms of money including paper money we must remember that every paper currency in history has gone to zero with no exception the current monetary system is currently taking its last breaths with the dollar and most currencies having lost 99 since the fed was founded in 1913 and 98 since nixon closed the gold window in 1971 it is guaranteed that the remaining 1 2 will be lost in the next few years but as i often point out a loss of the remaining 1 2 means a 100 fall from today anyone who doesn t understand that is guaranteed to lose all his paper wealth within the next 5 10 years and possibly sooner intrinsic and universal value it can never die in our hands throughout history gold has never and will never become worthless gold is nature s money and eternal crypto currencies have for many become a religion or cult for the ones who got in early there were spectacular gains to be made i do see that the blockchain could be useful technology but it could never be real money so cryptos have nothing to do with real money gold also they do not serve as a true form of wealth preservation bitcoin halving and luna dying in investors hands and crashing to zero is certainly not conducive to protecting your wealth i am sure that central banks around the world will introduce central bank digital currencies cbdcs but these new currencies are just another form of fiat money as such they can and will be created in unlimited amounts and lose most of their value over time just like paper money the one advantage for governments is of course the ability to track all transactions in their desire to control us all in a dystopian 1984 scenario but totalitarian societies do not survive since they are both against the laws of nature and human nature nevertheless they can create a very unpleasant period for many people the wef s world economic forum objective to create a society in which everybody will be poor and happy is total nonsense which would fail miserably just as a totalitarian society yes the wef has a lot of billionaires and political leaders who love mixing with each other under the command of their leader klaus schwab also a billionaire but the wef will collapse as the billionaires lose most of their wealth and the trudeaus of this world are thrown out in the greatest wealth transfer in history surest resource of reliance in time of war in every crisis in history gold has always been money both for nations and individuals since gold is universal money it is the best medium of exchange for people fleeing from a war torn country since wars also often produce inflation and debasement of paper money gold is the surest resource and is accepted in all countries so why is gold not going up and why don t more people buy gold if it is so cheap i get these questions regularly all the ingredients are certainly in place for gold to go up inflation inflation is increasing rapidly and most certainly soon reaching into the teens in many countries having experienced inflation in the 1970s in the uk i know how quickly it can accelerate between 1974 and 1981 uk inflation stayed above 10 peaking at 24 the average during that period was around 15 at an annual inflation rate of 15 prices double every 5 years we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us i would be surprised if inflation in many countries in the west doesn t reach the 15 level commodity shortages there is a global shortage of commodities prices already started to rise in april 2020 the gsci commodity index has gone up 232 since april 2020 since the ukrainian crisis started on february 20 this year commodity prices are up 18 the un food agency stated already in the autumn of 2021 that the situation of food shortages was catastrophic and that was before the cut off of major supplies from ukraine and russia growth of global debt money supply global debt is growing exponentially and has trebled in this century growth in debt and money supply above gdp growth has over time a direct impact on inflation rates most of the money created since the great financial crisis 2006 9 has not reached consumers but gone into asset markets like stocks bonds and property that has kept the velocity of money at very low levels and until recently not affected consumer prices but that is all about to change with rapid inflation increases to follow nobody owns gold so if gold is the best performing asset class in this century why are only 0 5 of world financial assets invested in physical gold the simple answer is that most investors neither understand nor follow gold which is why it is so cheap virtually no investor is aware that gold has been the best performing asset class in the last 22 years but as inflation continues to rise institutional investors in particular will be required to buy inflation protection stocks bonds and property have become bubble assets with a massive downside risk and offering zero inflation protection many investors will therefore turn to physical gold and precious metals mining stocks the total value of the 33 biggest mining stocks is only 210 billion with only 6 worth more than 10 billion global stock market capitalisation is just over 90 trillion so gold mining stocks represent only 0 2 of that and if we add the total value of physical gold for private investment total investable gold assets amount to 2 5 trillion with global financial investment assets at 220 trillion the physical gold investment market is only just over 1 of global assets what is clear is that the total sums in gold mining stocks or physical gold is minuscule compared to global financial investments so when institutional and other investors move into the gold market and increase their holdings from 0 5 to 1 of world financial assets that would involve a 1 1 trillion investment in gold and gold mining stocks which at today s prices would represent 50 of that market globally and if the gold investments went from 0 5 to 1 5 of global assets that would mean buying all the gold available in the world for investment it is self evident that those quantities would not be available the only way to satisfy increasing demand in the gold sector would be at a much higher price which could easily be 10x higher than current prices gold on the cusp of a major move gold went up 25x in the 1970s and then paused for almost 20 years as stock markets moved up substantially gold then bottomed in 1999 2000 at 250 since then gold has outperformed stocks and most other asset markets measured against paper money gold went up around 8x since between 1999 and the 2011 12 peak it feels like gold has corrected for a very long time since the 2011 2 peak but if we look at the annual chart of gold in dollars below we find that the correction only lasted for 3 years in 2013 to 2015 studying the chart closely we find that between 2001 and today there have only been three down years red bars so what we are looking at is a very strong performance already and that is before we will see the effect of all the positive factors for gold mentioned above to measure gold in debasing fiat money does not serve much purpose if i say that gold will go to 25 000 it is meaningless if we don t relate the price to inflation or purchasing power i stated many years ago that gold will go to at least 10 000 in today s money and that is still a realistic forecast bearing in mind all the positive factors for gold currently or expressed more correctly the negative factors for fiat money and for the world so when will gold go up then having been properly invested in physical gold for ourselves and our investors since early 2002 we never worry about the shorter term gold is for long term wealth preservation and not for short term gratification still i know that many gold investors as opposed to wealth preservationists are still impatient short term gold could be finishing a corrective move this week or in the next few weeks 1 800 is support but as we know support lines are often tested in order to drive out the longs so whatever happens in the short term is of little significance long term i have not changed my mind that gold will reach levels which few can imagine gold as cheap as in 1971 and 2000 finally my favourite chart which shows that gold is a cheap today relative to us money supply as in 1971 when the price was 35 and in 2000 when gold was 290

leaders at ginnie mae and the federal housing finance agency gave hints at what lies ahead for their organizations when speaking at the mortgage bankers association conference this week on the heels of the announcement of the biden administration s housing supply initiative which mentions ginnie mae twice its newly installed president said her company is receiving unprecedented attention from the white house for its role in the housing market the president s talking about ginnie mae and the housing supply and this has not ever happened before mccargo said on may 17 at the mortgage bankers association s secondary and capital markets conference we haven t really had in my view and in my 25 plus years of being in this business this kind of level of focus on housing and the housing ecosystem and all the moving parts from the white house level and the cabinet secretary that i ve seen with this one president biden s plan calls for the increased securitization of federal housing administration title 1 manufactured housing loans through ginnie mae it also requests the exploration of a permanent funding mechanism for loans originated via the federal financing bank s risk sharing program with state and local housing finance agencies through ginnie mae s securitization platform in addition ginnie mae has a prominent mention in the department of housing and urban development s four year strategic plan the reason we are so prominently discussed in hud s strategic plan for the first time in our 54 years that ginnie mae has been around is because secretary fudge really recognizes how incredibly complex and integral what we do is to everything else mccargo said the concrete objectives in hud s plan for her agency are around an equitable housing finance system and all the ways that we can make sure that the government programs that support the most underserved of people and markets have the access tools and capacity to really make sure that those lending products and programs are available she continued when asked about the possibility that ginnie mae might harmonize its liquidity standards with the conforming market mccargo said it is working with the federal housing finance agency to align and rationalize policies but she added that as a guarantor ginnie mae has a different business model from fannie mae and freddie mac it and fhfa will seek alignment where possible but might diverge where necessary in april ginnie mae and the fhfa had a joint listening session on liquidity standards the fhfa s acting director sandra thompson speaking later in the session agreed that communication with ginnie mae is important if there is an issue at fannie or freddie with servicing and servicing gets pulled that s an issue of default for ginnie mae thompson said and we re talking about the same group of servicers and many of the same sellers a collaborative approach is the responsible way to go she said collaboration is also important to the future of the preferred stock purchase agreement amendments that thompson suspended last september but she admitted no discussions on that topic have taken place thompson meets with fudge along with treasury secretary janet yellen and securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler on a quarterly basis thompson actually speaks with yellen at least monthly we just haven t started those conversations about this specific issue thompson said but i would say though that the business requirements that we put on pause are things that we believe can be handled through normal supervision and we do handle them through normal supervision the fhfa is always looking at risks and performance at fannie mae and freddie mac we ll have to have those conversations with treasury but you know again we talk to treasury all the time on lots of different things thompson said while not directly addressing biden s supply plan thompson said we re always looking for ways to be helpful because this issue is nationwide it s in almost every single part of our country it s just a really tough environment now but i think the enterprises are really looking for ways they can be helpful in this space she said

s hoppers have become all too familiar with the fragility of supply chains in america the latest product missing from supermarket shelves is infant formula whereas previous shortages affecting everything from cars to couches presented an inconvenience a lack of nourishment for babies creates serious health risks so the administration has swung into action on may 16th the food and drug administration fda said america would loosen restrictions on imports of formula two days later president joe biden invoked the defence production act to boost domestic production listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element there are several explanations for the shortage the biggest problem has been a halt to production at a facility in michigan since february when officials began investigating infections in four babies possibly caused by its milk based powder a lack of packaging delays to the import of ingredients and staffing vacancies have also contributed to the headache as much as 43 of formula products were out of stock across america in early may according to datasembly a data firm some politicians and analysts have also pointed to two deeper problems in the american economy supposedly exposed by the shortages corporate concentration and price gouging the former is a valid concern the latter is a distraction just four companies abbott gerber perrigo and reckitt benckiser make nearly all of america s formula the production stoppage occurred at a factory owned by abbott which controls around 40 of the market it is an illustration of how reduced competition seen in about three quarters of american industries over the past 30 years can serve the economy poorly concentration in the formula market has been exacerbated by regulation about 98 of formula consumed in america is made domestically because of the fda s stringent approval process for foreign factories and more than half is purchased through a nutrition programme for low income families which in turn buys from a single supplier in each state in 2007 when california switched its contract from abbott to mead johnson now owned by reckitt abbott s market share there fell from 90 to 5 while mead s rose from 5 to 95 on may 13th a group of democratic senators called for an antitrust review of the industry if that were to happen it would not solve the shortages at hand but it could put the market on sounder footing more dubious are claims about the severity of price gouging mr biden has asked the federal trade commission to investigate whether unscrupulous profiteers were scooping up formula in shops and reselling it for hugely marked up prices and there have indeed been instances of such anti social behaviour but for some in the democratic party these allegations about pricing now fit into a broader narrative that corporate greed lies at the root of high inflation elizabeth warren a democratic senator from massachusetts and several colleagues introduced a bill on may 12th that would prohibit price gouging during all abnormal market disruptions they cited a study by the economic policy institute a left wing think tank which argued that fatter profit margins have driven more than half of price rises since 2020 mr biden has also seized on greed as an explanation for high prices on may 13th he tweeted that making the wealthiest companies pay their fair share would bring down inflation in theory the fiscal drag that would come from higher taxes without any offsetting increase in government spending could reduce inflation as well as growth but if corporate greed explains high inflation why did so many prices only start to soar well after the pandemic began it is not as if companies just discovered a love of profits jeff bezos the owner of amazon was right to criticise mr biden s tweet as misdirection accusing him of trying to muddy the water in the debate over prices indeed something far more basic explains the run up in inflation a surge in stimulus fuelled demand compounded by disruptions to supply for individual products the signal sent by higher prices is the most effective way to bring supply and demand back into balance in the case of baby formula it encourages domestic companies to make more and foreign producers to run the gauntlet of approvals much like formula itself higher prices can play a part in healthy development for more expert analysis of the biggest stories in economics business and markets sign up to money talks our weekly newsletter
asked what companies should do with spare capital 41 per cent of managers want them to strengthen their balance sheets up from 34 per cent a month earlier buybacks or capital expenditure are very much on the outer the proportion of fundies expecting a stronger economy set an all time low while the proportion expecting stagnation rose from 66 per cent a month ago to 77 per cent the highest since august 2008 global profit expectations are at levels not seen since the height of the covid 19 panic in april 2020 and before that the collapse of lehman brothers asset allocations to equities have fallen across the board but what fund managers want more of are defensives healthcare stocks commodities consumer staple stocks real estate investment trusts and utilities are popular while tech emerging markets and european equities are on the outer even bank of america s ultra bearish chief strategist michael hartnett sees the case for a rally given sentiment can t get much lower indeed tuesday night delivered another night of gains on wall street taking gains over the last four trading days to a touch over 4 per cent advertisement but for hartnett any rally would be a bear market rally that s because one signal from the survey stands out as being very different from previous bear markets the expected path of us interest rates we have not seen full capitulation among investors hartnett argues because the majority 78 per cent in fact expect short term interest rates will rise not fall put another way investors are so convinced that the us federal reserve will need to do more to fight inflation that the prospect of a fed put that moment when the fed has historically stepped in to provide support to equities is getting further away hartnett says the survey data suggests respondents see a fed put occurring when the s p 500 index hits 3529 points down from last month s prediction of a fed put at 3637 clearly these levels are illustrative only no survey or strategist could ever hope to be that accurate but hartnett s point is that investors believe the market can fall at least a further 12 per cent before the fed steps in which means stocks prone to imminent bear rally but ultimate lows not yet reached advertisement hartnett and other strategists such as credit suisse strategy guru zoltan pozsar argue that the fed will need to break the us sharemarkets and or the us consumer to engineer the sort of economic shock required to tame runaway inflation pozsar even says that positive signs the strong cash buffers held by households and businesses sharemarket rallies and economic growth could force the fed to go even harder to tighten financial conditions fed chairman jerome powell appeared to back this point on tuesday night at a business event on wall street declaring the central bank would go hard until it saw inflation not just lower but firmly in retreat what we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way and we re going to keep pushing until we see that he said if that involves moving past broadly understood levels of neutral we won t hesitate at all to do that the obvious danger of such an aggressive approach is that the us slides into recession which would have global ramifications advertisement but the jury is still out on whether that occurs and there are some on wall street who believe equity investors might have become overly worried jpmorgan strategist marko kolanovic calculates us equity markets are pricing in a 70 per cent chance of a us recession in the near term but that is much higher than the 50 per cent chance ascribed by the investment grade debt market the 30 per cent chance priced in by the high yield debt market and the 20 per cent chance in rate markets either equity markets prove right and a recession takes place inducing much bigger declines in bond yields or rate markets prove right and a recession is avoided inducing a recovery in equity markets kolanovic says

as parents and caregivers continue to face bare or sparsely stocked shelves of baby formula as the shortage wears on local providers say there are resources to help families it s terrifying for parents dr gretchen pianka a pediatrician at central maine pediatrics in lewiston said tuesday one of the most fundamental things is being able to feed your baby like many other consumer goods baby formula has been affected by pandemic related supply chain disruptions making the situation worse for u s consumers in february manufacturer abbott laboratories issued a voluntary recall of products made at its michigan plant including similac alimentum and elecare the sturgis michigan site is the largest baby formula manufacturing plant in the country maine s baby formula supply was down about 34 earlier this month according to the washington post and datasembly which tracks retail information advertisement on monday the u s food and drug administration said it had reached an agreement with abbott to reopen the shuttered michigan plant but it could take another two months before supplies begin to increase there are a number of reasons why a parent chooses to formula feed pianka said some mothers breastfeed but need formula to supplement their milk supply others use formula exclusively often because a mother is unable to or chooses not to breastfeed or because the baby has specific medical conditions such as allergies or milk protein sensitivity pianka said she s definitely noticed an uptick in calls to her practice from parents looking for help or advice particularly from parents who depend on specialty formulas for babies with allergies or sensitivities families are anxious she said the good news is there are options out there for parents who are unable to find formula on store shelves want to make sure that an alternative formula is appropriate for their baby or have any other concerns or questions pianka said their first call should be to their child s pediatrician the pediatrician knows those babies best and there isn t a one size fits all type thing she said advertisement if a baby has allergies or gastrointestinal issues they have likely already been seen by an allergist or gastroenterologist who can also help answer any questions or even reach out to a representative from the manufacturer to determine if an alternative product is appropriate those practices will sometimes also have samples of some of those specialty formulas that could help hold parents over for a few days their other call should be to their local women infants and children nutrition program office which provides nutrition education and resources for pregnant postpartum and breastfeeding women infants and children up to the age of 5 who meet income guidelines the maine wic program served nearly 17 000 people last year according to federal data but all families regardless of if they qualify can give their local wic office a call said katherine lary who serves as the program director for western maine community action wic program the program which has offices in auburn and wilton served over 3 100 women infants and children in androscoggin franklin and oxford counties last month including 221 babies who received formula in some capacity lary said they are only at 50 capacity meaning that there are as many as 3 000 people who qualify for wic services but are not utilizing them advertisement the formula shortage has hit low income families in particular about half of baby formula sold in the u s is purchased by food assistance program recipients according to the washington post lary said the phones are always ringing at her office but we re definitely seeing an increase in phone calls she said she said that people are calling saying that they ve tried to find formula at a few different stores without luck and need some help for what to do next we do have a supply of a variety of different formulas on hand it s not enough to provide a family with all of their needs for the course of the month but we re at least able to get them you know a handful of cans to get them started she said if they still have trouble finding formula they can give wic another call we re not going to leave them high and dry with the caveat lary said wic could also run out advertisement that s why we try to do our best to make sure that we give you know enough to get people at least a good week or so of not having to stress but then you know make sure that we still have enough stock so we can continue to help all those babies under normal circumstances lary said her office doesn t necessarily have a large supply of formula but because wic is a federal program and can contact vendors directly they ve been able to up their supply recently so that they can make sure the parents who need formula can get it even when stores stock might be low we ve definitely got more on hand than we ever normally would in addition to providing formula lary said her office can connect parents to a number of resources in house or make referrals to other providers she said wic encourages mothers to breastfeed if they can there are breastfeeding peer counselors and certified location consultants there to work with mothers who are interested in breastfeeding for other parents for whom breastfeeding is not an option for whatever reason we re going to make sure that she feels supported in her decision to use formula as well lary said advertisement we do our best to really make sure that moms remain calm and understand that they re feeling a lot of mixed emotions and fears and concerns she said we really like to make sure that they know they re heard and that we re supporting them the only thing parents shouldn t do make their own formula do not make your own baby formula those are dangerous pianka said to learn more about wic or to find your local wic office visit www maine gov wic or call 287 3991 send questions

elon musk gave his strongest hint yet that he would walk away from buying twitter after tweeting the deal cannot move forward unless his conditions are met the tesla chief executive offered to buy the site for 35billion in april but is now warring with its chief executive parag agrawal over the number of fake accounts on the social media platform twitter says 5 per cent of its 229million accounts are bots but musk thinks the true figure is much higher at around 20 per cent conditions tesla boss elon musk pictured offered to buy twitter for 35bn in april but is now warring with chief exec parag agrawal over the number of fake accounts the billionaire tweeted my offer was based on twitter s sec filings being accurate yesterday twitter s chief executive publicly refused to show proof of less than 5 per cent this deal cannot move forward until he does musk shocked the business world last month after striking a lightning quick deal to buy twitter for 54 20 a share but doubts over the deal started to emerge on friday after musk said his acquisition was temporarily on hold until he could see more detail on how twitter arrived at its estimate for the number of fake accounts on monday musk told a miami tech conference that an agreement at a lower price wouldn t be out of the question but twitter is trying to force the deal through at the original price in an sec filing submitted hours after musk s tweet yesterday the social media platform said it is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price if musk does back out he would have to pay twitter an 800million termination fee a fraction of his approximate 212billion net worth twitter could also sue for damages musk is either regretting his original offer and will stump up the 800million fee to exit the deal or re negotiate on price predict analysts daniel ives analyst at wedbush securities said that the chances of a deal ultimately getting done is not looking good now he added it s likely a 60 per cent chance from our view musk ultimately walks from the deal and pays the breakup fee social media consultant and industry analyst matt navarra tweeted that musk is stalling the deal as a pretext to renegotiating the price regulatory filings show musk mulled over taking twitter private as early as march 27 more than a week before his initial 9 2 per cent stake was disclosed and more than two weeks before he publicly declared his bid shares in twitter are now considerably lower than when musk made the deal for 54 20 a share in april they closed in new york on monday at 37 39 but were up 1 1 per cent at 37 80 yesterday if musk does walk away from the deal then the stock could fall even further to less than 30 a share given how shaky stock markets are right now says ives

pump prices are setting new record highs again this week with the oregon average climbing above 5 a gallon for the first time ever the major driver is the high cost of crude oil which is above 110 per barrel for the week the national average for regular jumps 15 cents to 4 52 a gallon the oregon average soars 21 cents to 5 06 the national and oregon averages continue to set new record highs almost daily eclipsing the recent record highs set in march the high cost of oil the key ingredient in gasoline is driving these high pump prices for consumers and unfortunately there s no relief in sight says marie dodds public affairs director for aaa oregon idaho even the annual seasonal demand dip for gasoline during the lull between spring break and memorial day which would normally help lower prices is having no effect this year on average about 53 of what we pay for in a gallon of gasoline is for the price of crude oil 12 is refining 21 distribution and marketing and 15 are taxes according to the u s energy information administration crude oil prices remain elevated due to the russian invasion of ukraine russia is one of the top three oil producers in the world behind the u s and saudi arabia and about 25 of europe s oil is imported from russia tight global oil supplies made worse by the lack of product coming out of russia have put upward pressure on crude prices a year ago crude was around 66 per barrel compared to 112 today meanwhile the switch to the more expensive summer blend of gasoline which usually adds seven to ten cents per gallon depending on the market is happening now this switchover should be complete nationwide by early june this summer blend switch is an annual event it is unrelated to the biden administration s announcement a few weeks ago to allow the higher ethanol e15 gas blend to remain on sale throughout the summer until september demand for gasoline in the u s decreased slightly from 8 86 million b d to 8 7 million b d total domestic gasoline stocks decreased by 3 6 million bbl to 225 million bbl last week according to the u s energy information administration eia typically lower demand would put downward pressure on pump prices however crude prices remain volatile and as they surge pump prices follow suit pump prices will likely face upward pressure as oil prices stay above 105 per barrel source aaa
triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox tesla ceo elon musk promised that taking over twitter would enable him to rid the social media platform of its annoying spam bots now he s arguing without presenting any evidence that there might be just too many of those automated accounts for the 44 billion deal to move ahead the sharp turnaround by the world s richest man makes little sense except as a method to scuttle or renegotiate a deal that s becoming increasingly costly for musk experts said and while such hardball tactics aren t uncommon in corporate mergers the way it s happening in a highly public seemingly erratic conversation on the very platform musk wants to buy has little precedent in effect musk is negotiating the future of twitter on twitter that s the hook he s trying to grab onto as the reason for him to potentially walk away or negotiate the price down lower said brian quinn an associate law professor at boston college he is torpedoing the deal trying to talk down the deal musk took to twitter early tuesday to say his deal to buy the company can t move forward unless the company shows public proof that fewer than 5 of the accounts on the social media platform are fake or spam that followed a friday tweet that said the deal was on hold pending more bot details causing twitter stock to plunge by nearly 10 and monday comments at a miami conference suggesting he wanted a lower price for the company experts say musk can t unilaterally place the deal on hold although that hasn t stopped him from acting as though he can if he walks away he could be on the hook for a 1 billion breakup fee musk also spent much of monday in a back and forth with twitter ceo parag agrawal who posted a series of tweets explaining his company s effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5 of twitter accounts are fake it s a message that twitter has been disclosing to the u s securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low in his tweet tuesday musk said that 20 fake spam accounts while 4 times what twitter claims could be much higher my offer was based on twitter s sec filings being accurate he added yesterday twitter s ceo publicly refused to show proof of 5 this deal cannot move forward until he does that kind of language makes no sense quinn said the disclosures he s complaining about are the same disclosures the company has filed at the sec for quite a bit of time there s nothing new here quinn said in the run up to the transaction the company gave him the opportunity to engage in due diligence and kick the tires and look around he waived due diligence and said no i don t want to see any more twitter declined to comment getting cold feet about mergers is nothing new it sometimes leads prospective buyers to look for changed conditions that can get them out of a deal or offering price it was the covid 19 pandemic in part that led french luxury powerhouse lvmh the parent company of louis vuitton and other apparel and wine brands to say it was abandoning a planned takeover of u s jeweler tiffany co in 2020 tiffany sued to enforce the deal and lvmh lashed back in the end the famed jeweler agreed to a slightly reduced buyout price the twitter sale agreement allows musk to get out of the deal if there is a material adverse effect caused by the company it defines that as a change that results in an adverse impact on twitter s business or financial conditions chester spatt a finance professor at carnegie mellon university and a former sec chief economist said musk could claim that twitter gave him wrong information about the number of spam bots even if the excuse doesn t hold up it can serve as a negotiating tactic with the corporate board that s trying to sell the company in a merger situation a material adverse change is often the key to your ability to renegotiate the deal spatt said correct or not musk s latest complaint about the bot count hits upon a sore point for twitter which has long faced criticism about the lack of transparency around its bot numbers in the aftermath of revelations about russian use of social media to meddle in the 2016 u s presidential election a group led by university of southern california researcher emilio ferrara estimated in 2017 that between 9 and 15 of twitter s active english language accounts were bots in a blog post soon after twitter complained that such outside research is often inaccurate and methodologically flawed ferrara said that twitter has taken a frivolous approach to this issue especially compared to peers such as facebook twitter shares have dropped below the price they traded at before musk unveiled his bid tesla shares are also down since the twitter bid which affects musk s ability to raise money for the acquisition it s quite natural for the buyer to want to cut a better deal spatt said twitter could take musk to court and argue that the sale contract remain in force but could face significant legal fees spatt said the whole string of musk tweets will likely draw scrutiny from the sec which will probably look at whether any false or misleading statements were made spatt said the sec doesn t want to see manipulation of the public markets he said their role is trying to help ensure that investors are getting a fair deal to make sure the information out there is accurate however musk has made his statements in the open and although he may be negotiating that way the sec is more concerned with hidden aspects of a deal spratt said the bot problem also reflects a longtime fixation for musk who as one of twitter s most active celebrity users is prone to having fake accounts mimicking his name and likeness to promote cryptocurrency scams and he seems to think it s a problem for most other twitter users as well as advertisers who sell ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect will see them twitter claims that 95 of daily active users are real unique humans he tweeted tuesday does anyone have that experience at a miami technology conference monday musk estimated that at least 20 of twitter s 229 million accounts are spam bots a percentage he said was at the low end of his assessment it was at the same all in summit that musk gave the strongest hint yet that he would like to pay less for twitter than the 44 billion he agreed to last month the chances of a deal ultimately getting done is not looking good now wedbush securities analyst dan

last two years well before musk made his offer in april over that same period twitter has also expressed uncertainty in its bot count conceding that the estimate may be low

vol 46 no 19 friday may 13 2022 musk wars with twitter over his buyout deal on twitter the associated press print front page email this story you have entered an invalid email address to required from required message you have entered an invalid email address from email required message required tesla ceo elon musk promised that taking over twitter would enable him to rid the social media platform of its annoying spam bots now he s arguing without presenting any evidence that there might be just too many of those automated accounts for the 44 billion deal to move ahead the sharp turnaround by the world s richest man makes little sense except as a method to scuttle or renegotiate a deal that s becoming increasingly costly for musk experts said and while such hardball tactics aren t uncommon in corporate mergers the way it s happening in a highly public seemingly erratic conversation on the very platform musk wants to buy has little precedent in effect musk is negotiating the future of twitter on twitter that s the hook he s trying to grab onto as the reason for him to potentially walk away or negotiate the price down lower said brian quinn an associate law professor at boston college he is torpedoing the deal trying to talk down the deal musk took to twitter early tuesday to say his deal to buy the company can t move forward unless the company shows public proof that fewer than 5 of the accounts on the social media platform are fake or spam that followed a friday tweet that said the deal was on hold pending more bot details causing twitter stock to plunge by nearly 10 and monday comments at a miami conference suggesting he wanted a lower price for the company experts say musk can t unilaterally place the deal on hold although that hasn t stopped him from acting as though he can if he walks away he could be on the hook for a 1 billion breakup fee musk also spent much of monday in a back and forth with twitter ceo parag agrawal who posted a series of tweets explaining his company s effort to fight bots and how it has consistently estimated that less than 5 of twitter accounts are fake it s a message that twitter has been disclosing to the u s securities and exchange commission for years while also cautioning that its estimate might be too low in his tweet tuesday musk said that 20 fake spam accounts while 4 times what twitter claims could be much higher my offer was based on twitter s sec filings being accurate he added yesterday twitter s ceo publicly refused to show proof of 5 this deal cannot move forward until he does that kind of language makes no sense quinn said the disclosures he s complaining about are the same disclosures the company has filed at the sec for quite a bit of time there s nothing new here quinn said in the run up to the transaction the company gave him the opportunity to engage in due diligence and kick the tires and look around he waived due diligence and said no i don t want to see any more twitter declined to comment getting cold feet about mergers is nothing new it sometimes leads prospective buyers to look for changed conditions that can get them out of a deal or offering price it was the covid 19 pandemic in part that led french luxury powerhouse lvmh the parent company of louis vuitton and other apparel and wine brands to say it was abandoning a planned takeover of u s jeweler tiffany co in 2020 tiffany sued to enforce the deal and lvmh lashed back in the end the famed jeweler agreed to a slightly reduced buyout price the twitter sale agreement allows musk to get out of the deal if there is a material adverse effect caused by the company it defines that as a change that results in an adverse impact on twitter s business or financial conditions chester spatt a finance professor at carnegie mellon university and a former sec chief economist said musk could claim that twitter gave him wrong information about the number of spam bots even if the excuse doesn t hold up it can serve as a negotiating tactic with the corporate board that s trying to sell the company in a merger situation a material adverse change is often the key to your ability to renegotiate the deal spatt said twitter shares have dropped below their trading price before musk unveiled his bid tesla shares are also down since the twitter bid which affects musk s ability to raise money for the acquisition it s quite natural for the buyer to want to cut a better deal spatt said twitter could take musk to court and argue that the sale contract remain in force but that would cost the company big legal fees spatt said the whole string of musk tweets will likely draw scrutiny from the sec which will probably look at whether any false or misleading statements were made spatt said the sec doesn t want to see manipulation of the public markets he said their role is trying to help ensure that investors are getting a fair deal to make sure the information out there is accurate however musk has made his statements in the open and although he may be negotiating that way the sec is more concerned with hidden aspects of a deal spratt said the bot problem also reflects a longtime fixation for musk who as one of twitter s most active celebrity users is prone to having fake accounts mimicking his name and likeness to promote cryptocurrency scams and he seems to think it s a problem for most other twitter users as well as advertisers who sell ads on the platform based on how many real people they expect will see them twitter claims that 95 of daily active users are real unique humans he tweeted tuesday does anyone have that experience at a miami technology conference monday musk estimated that at least 20 of twitter s 229 million accounts are spam bots a percentage he said was at the low end of his assessment it was at the same all in summit that musk gave the strongest hint yet that he would like to pay less for twitter than the 44 billion he agreed to last month the chances of a deal ultimately getting done is not looking good now wedbush securities analyst dan ives who covers both twitter and tesla said in a research note he estimated that there s 60 chance that musk ends up walking away from the deal and paying the 1 billion breakup fee musk s offer to buy twitter for 54 20 per share was made public on april 14 twitter shares closed tuesday at 38 32 up 2 5 to finance the acquisition musk pledged some of his tesla shares which have slumped in price by about a third since the deal was announced in tweets on monday agrawal acknowledged that twitter isn t perfect at catching bots he wrote that every quarter the company has made the estimate of less than 5 spam our estimate is based on multiple human reviews of thousands of accounts that are sampled at random consistently over time agrawal wrote estimates for the last four quarters were all well under 5 he wrote the error margins on our estimates give us confidence in our public statements each quarter twitter has put the under 5 estimate in its quarterly filings with the sec for at least the last two years well before musk made his offer in april over that same period twitter has also expressed uncertainty in its bot count conceding that the estimate may be low ap writer kelvin chan in london contributed to this report

hydrogen and cleantech innovation strategy to compliment our development stage pl gold mine restart plan a new green energy transition vision the adoption of net zero 2050 co2 reduction commitments by canada and many other countries has signaled a modern era green energy transition as a result green or renewable energy alternatives to replace reduce fossil fuel energy are growing rapidly in addition to co2 reduction initiatives recent geopolitical events have highlighted the need for energy security and in particular green energy security these events are forecast to result in a fundamental change in the future production and consumption of energy our strategy is to position minnova as a green energy industry leader through development of biomass gasification related technologies the first step in our green energy strategy was the announcement of the intent to acquire a proprietary biomass gasification technology see press release 2021 12 13_nr pdf minnovacorp ca since then minnova has rapidly advanced our strategy for minnova renewable energy based on discussions with industry producers equipment suppliers and consumers policy makers and investors the next significant milestone is site selection for future commercial development we are pleased to announce that the first site for a biomass gasification demonstration unit will be swan river manitoba following detailed analysis and discussions we have arranged for initial feedstock supply and a well located site to develop a demonstration unit key selection criteria included abundant supply of sustainable forest and agricultural biomass residues existing infrastructure that will facilitate rapid development and future expansion an existing natural gas pipeline for possible injection and finally a supportive local community on that point we have received a formal support letter and endorsement from the swan river council who commented we are confident that the abundant forest and agricultural biomass supply and other development considerations including competitive utilities skilled labor force and the availability of pro business fiscal incentives and regulations that our region is uniquely positioned to support the project to fruition the demonstration unit will be design and built on a mobile platform for future marketing of our technology with on site small scale production the demonstration unit will operate for up to 6 months and produce a marketable syngas rich in hydrogen 50 the syngas will be marketed as is and be purified to upgrade it to a pure hydrogen product it is anticipated that multiple feedstocks will be tested to refine and confirm syngas quality and yield and enhance the gasification unit design in preparation for a phase 1 commercial scale operation targeting initial production of up to 1 4 mln kg of pure hydrogen per year following the completion of the demonstration unit it can be relocated to other sites in canada and the united states with abundant sustainable biomass supply to demonstrate our technology s ability to replace or reduce existing fossil fuel use with green hydrogen minnova renewable energy also continues to advance its strategy internationally site selection initiatives are ongoing in other jurisdictions with abundant biomass residues and favourable green energy market support engagement with potential feedstock suppliers in costa rica and romania has been well received and biomass gasification test work in underway to collect required data to incorporate into future commercial plant design both locations represent excellent targets for large scale sustainable green hydrogen and or green ammonia production with significant local industrial demand and access to north american and european

pugs can no longer be considered typical dogs because they are so much more likely to suffer from breathing eye and skin disorders than other breeds vets warn vets compared the risks of 40 common conditions in pugs with other dog breeds pugs were 54x more likely to have brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome they were also 13x more likely to suffer from corneal ulceration almost 11x more likely to have skin fold dermatitis and twice as likely to have overgrown nails with their squashed little noses and wrinkled faces pugs have become a favourite with dog lovers and celebrities but a new study has warned that the breed now suffers from such severe health conditions that it can no longer be considered a typical dog pugs are significantly more likely to suffer from breathing eye and skin disorders than other breeds according to vets from the royal veterinary college the widely differing health profiles between pugs and other dogs in the uk suggest that the pug has diverged to such an extent from mainstream dog breeds that the pug breed can no longer be considered as a typical dog the researchers wrote in their study published in canine medicine and genetics pugs are significantly more likely to suffer from breathing eye and skin disorders than other breeds according to vets from the royal veterinary college which conditions are pugs at high risk for 54x more likely to have brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome 51x more likely to have narrow nostrils 13x more likely to have corneal ulceration 11x more likely to have skin fold dermatitis 2 5x more likely to be obese 2x more likely to have overgrown nails advertisement pugs short faced brachycephalic characteristics did not evolve naturally and are instead the result of selective breeding this facial structure puts them at high risk for a range of health conditions including breathing eye and skin disorders pugs have become phenomenally popular in the uk over recent decades the research team led by dr dan o neill explained the breed has a flat faced look that many humans find highly attractive and cute but this flat face is also linked to several serious health problems consequently there is growing concern about the welfare issues associated with the popularity and health issues of pugs in the study the researchers compared the risks of 40 common conditions in pugs with other dog breeds the team analysed the records of 16 218 pugs and 889 326 non pug breeds taken from the vetcompass database their analysis revealed that pugs were at increased risk for 23 out of 40 common disorders pugs were 54 times more likely to have brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome a condition affecting the upper airway and 51 times more likely to have narrow nostrils the breed was also 13 times more likely to suffer from corneal ulceration and almost 11 times more likely to have skin fold dermatitis additionally pugs were found to be 2 5 times more likely to suffer from obesity and twice as likely to have overgrown nails pugs were 54 times more likely to have brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome a condition affecting the upper airway and 51 times more likely to have narrow nostrils stock image what is brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome boas is the term given to the effects that the shortened head of these animals has on the passage of air through the upper airways the signs can range from mild snoring to severe breathing problems animals suffering from boas can struggle to breathe during exercise and even collapse due to lack of air the reliance of dogs on panting to cool themselves also makes animals suffering from boas very susceptible to overheating and developing potentially serious breathing difficulties in hot conditions advertisement however it wasn t all doom and gloom pugs were found to be at lower risk of developing several other conditions including heart murmurs lipoma and aggression the study provides a broad evidence base on the positive and negative aspects of the health of pugs the researchers concluded disease predispositions were more common than disease protections confirming the hypothesis that there are many critical health related welfare challenges to overcome for pugs the study comes shortly after researchers revealed that pugs are among the dog breeds with the shortest life expectancy vets from the royal veterinary college assessed 30 563 dogs from 18 breeds to see how life expectancy varies between pooches their results reveal that while the average life expectancy for dogs in the uk is 11 2 years this varies massively between breeds jack russell terriers had the greatest life expectancy from age 0 at 12 7 years followed by border collies 12 1 years and springer spaniels 11 92 years at the other end of the scale four flat faced breeds were found to have the shortest life expectancies french bulldogs were only expected to live 4 5 years from age 0 followed by english bulldogs at 7 4 years pugs at 7 7 years and american bulldogs 7 8 years dr kendy tzu yun teng who led the study said the dog life tables offer new insights and ways of looking at the life expectancy in pet dogs advertisement they are also strong evidence of compromised health and welfare in short flat faced breeds such as french bulldog and bulldog

to howard mackey managing director of municipal bonds at nw financial in hoboken n j the market has been very weak for a few weeks and steadily declining and last week the slide continued mackey said on monday both the bid side in the secondary and the new issue market is suffering he said noting that from what we are hearing the bid response is weak in the secondary market and spreads continue to widen even on high grade paper in addition volume is lacking there s just not a lot of activity and refundings have gone away because of the dramatic rise in interest rates he said record outflows over the past several weeks have also added to the volatility in the municipal market and have been daunting to raise cash institutional investors and in particular have had to sell bonds but in the weak market mackey said adding to the challenging market is the summer reinvestment s arrival in june we have slowed down so much but the summer season probably will not help the market at this point mackey said for new issues where some money is available institutional buyers require higher rates and higher spreads to the mmd than we have seen in the last few months mackey said noting that new issues have to be priced accordingly to sell that trend has also occurred in the taxable muni market where refundings have dried up because rates were high mackey added a lot depends on what happens at the next federal open market committee meeting in june mackey said it s not a rosy picture and the fed has pretty much been driving the market more so than the inflationary news he said supply chain issues and the war are not the key issues for fixed income investors it s really how the fed is going to react while rising rates are more attractive to new bond buyers it has unnerved investors who were fully invested before the fed pivot said ubs strategists thomas mcloughlin kathleen mcnamara theodore galgano alina golant jeannine lennon and david perlman they noted that mutual fund flows tend to influence prices in the broader municipal market and this year has been no exception yields though are more attractive to income buyers and the ratio to municipals to taxable alternatives makes tax exempt bonds now appear very attractive to crossover investors the ubs strategists said they still anticipate market technicals to improve next month which may provide an impetus for fund outflows to moderate and less market turbulence tax exempt bonds have posted losses for four straight months and the price weakness has now extended into the first half of may they said on a year to date basis munis have registered total return losses that closely align with those seen on an index of u s treasury securities 10 persistent mutual fund outflows which have undermined the ability of portfolio managers to become active buyers has aggravated the negative performance they said the investment company institute has reported net cash outflows from muni mutual funds for 16 consecutive weeks totaling roughly 58 9 billion this has placed downward pressure on prices ubs said they expect outflows will continue until treasury market volatility subsides and buyers take notice of better

still spending which may mean that despite inflation and an economic slowdown recession may be avoided analysts said a solid retail sales report and key earnings from home depot and walmart painted a picture of a strong u s consumer that could probably tolerate rising food and energy prices a little while longer said edward moya senior market analyst at oanda the problem with a strong consumer outlook is that it also means the fed tightening won t have to ease up anytime soon this positive consumer news likely won t alter the plans for a 50 basis point rate hike at the next federal open market committee meeting he said the report showed strength noted grant thornton chief economist diane swonk which only reinforces the fed s resolve to raise rates rapidly since the fed is actively attempting to slow inflation there are no doves left at the fed she said with many officials noting unemployment will have to rise to beat down inflation this year and next today s retail sales report will only reinforce the argument for more aggressive rate hikes swonk said powell would not take 75 basis points off the table in a recent interview on monetary policy also released tuesday april industrial production rose 1 1 supply chains are not fixed and could worsen in coming months and the labor market is still tight but for now the industry is returning to some semblance of normal said wells fargo securities senior economist tim quinlan and economist shannon seery continued strength in production in the face of persistent supply issues is still encouraging and demonstrates increased activity amid an easing of some constraints they said also released tuesday the national association of home builders wells fargo housing market index dropped to 69 in may from 77 in april suggesting a slowing housing market as rising mortgage costs more expensive building material prices low inventory and consistent demand make homes less affordable the housing market was among the largest winners from ultra low rates it is now among the most vulnerable to a correction with rates rising said swonk and grant thornton economist yelena maleyev not surprisingly markets that saw the greatest in migration and housing appreciation during the pandemic experienced the hottest inflation cooling those markets is key to taming inflation recession is not looming said nick reece senior analyst and portfolio manager at merk investments llc incoming economic data shows deceleration but the overall picture is still historically inconsistent with imminent recession he said the data he looks for includes inversion in the 10 year 30 month yield curve which hasn t happened also the 10 year 2 year has steepened as interest rates climbed he said rather than steepening with falling interest rates which is typically the recession warning sign but the 10 2 likely will flatten and eventually invert before recession reece said in general the data suggests we remain in an ongoing albeit mild expansion he said while recession risk is definitely elevated the evidence is not beyond a reasonable doubt that the economy will go into recession over the next six months more medium term i e 6 24

by anneken tappe cnn business hindsight is 20 20 even for the federal reserve the us central bank is in the midst of a whatever it takes moment when it comes to inflation but if fed officials had known how high inflation would rise they would have changed their course on policy earlier fed chairman jerome powell said tuesday in hindsight it would have been better to raise rates earlier powell said in an interview at the wall street journal s future of everything event the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point earlier this month following a smaller rate hike in march in order to get a handle on the highest inflation in 40 years it also announced the unwinding of its massive balance sheet we know that this is a time for us to be tightly focused on the time ahead and getting inflation back down to 2 powell said no one should doubt our resolve in doing that what we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way and to get there interest rates will have to rise further even if that means going beyond the level that is understood as neutral commonly thought to be around 2 5 former fed chair ben bernanke on monday criticized powell s fed for acting too slowly why did they delay their response i think in retrospect yes it was a mistake he said during an interview with cnbc powell pushed back against that sentiment on tuesday saying that the bank is moving rather quickly compared with previous decades he also reiterated that more half percentage point increases were on the table for this year s policy meetings last summer when powell categorized rising inflation as transitory and mostly related to the pandemic economic data looked very different he said the data changed pretty thoroughly in october and we responded to that powell added i don t know that financial conditions tightened more quickly than this in a very long time but quickly means something else in the world of monetary policy a central bank s tools are blunt and actions take time to take effect monetary policy works through expectations powell said it s been good to see financial markets reacting powell and his colleagues are attempting a soft landing bringing inflation down and normalizing policy without hampering economic growth too much sometimes the landing is just perfect and sometimes it s just a little bumpy he said but this time there could be some pain involved america s job market for example is still very strong but could face some wobbles if the fed doesn t stick the landing on the whole however the us economy its labor market and growth expectations are strong powell added that said he acknowledged that the war in ukraine and pandemic shutdowns in china are affecting domestic growth and the fed needs to remain watchful cnn business nicole goodkind contributed to this report the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

aaron morrison the associated press new york the foundation started by organizers of the black lives matter movement is still worth tens of millions of dollars after spending more than 37 million on grants real estate consultants and other expenses according to tax documents filed with the irs in a new 63 page form 990 shared exclusively with the associated press the black lives matter global network foundation inc reports that it invested 32 million in stocks from the 90 million it received as donations amid racial justice protests in 2020 that investment is expected to become an endowment to ensure the foundation s work continues in the future organizers say it ended its last fiscal year from july 1 2020 to june 30 2021 with nearly 42 million in net assets the foundation had an operating budget of about 4 million according to a board member the tax filing shows that nearly 6 million was spent on a los angeles area compound intended for use as a campus for a black artists fellowship this is the blm foundation s first public accounting of its finances since incorporating in 2017 as a fledgling nonprofit it had been under the fiscal sponsorship of a well established charity and wasn t required to publicly disclose its financials until it became an independent 501 c 3 nonprofit in december 2020 the tax filing suggests the organization is still finding its footing it currently has no executive director or in house staff it comes across as an early startup nonprofit without substantial governance structure in place that got a huge windfall said brian mittendorf a professor of accounting at ohio state university who focuses on nonprofit organizations people are going to be quick to assume that mismatch reflects intent he added whether there s anything improper here that is another question but whether they set themselves up for being criticized i think that certainly is the case because they didn t plug a bunch of those gaps the blm movement emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17 year old trayvon martin in florida but it was the 2014 death of michael brown at the hands of police in ferguson missouri that made the slogan black lives matter a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives when foundation leaders revealed the windfall of donations in the aftermath of protests in 2020 over george floyd s murder at the hands of minneapolis police local chapter organizers and families of police brutality victims reacted angrily until then the foundation had not been transparent with the most devoted blm organizers many of whom accused national leaders of shutting them out of decisions on how financial resources would be allocated in a recent ap interview blm co founder patrisse cullors acknowledged the foundation was ill prepared to handle the moment the tax filing lists cullors as an uncompensated founder and executive director she resigned last year for all the questions raised about its oversight the blm foundation s tax filing shows its stewards haven t squandered donations nearly 26 million or 70 of its expenses in the last fiscal year were grants twelve chapters including those in boulder colorado boston washington d c detroit los angeles gary indiana and philadelphia received pledges for grants of up to 500 000 each the family foundations created in honor of trayvon martin oscar grant and george floyd each received contributions of 200 000 the michael o d brown we love our sons daughters foundation run by michael brown jr s mother lezley mcspadden was approved for a larger grant of 1 4 million mcspadden is happy to have the blm foundation s support a brown foundation representative said this 990 reveals that the blm foundation is the largest black abolitionist nonprofit organization that has ever existed in the nation s history what we re doing has never been done before said shalomyah bowers who serves as the foundation s board secretary earlier this month the foundation announced bowers as one of three members of its board of directors he serves with board chair cicley gay a communications professional with more than 20 years of experience in nonprofit and philanthropic organizations and d zhane parker a member of blm s los angeles chapter whose work focuses on the impact of mass incarceration on families to get here the foundation has relied on a small grouping of consultants some of whom have close ties to founders and other blm organizers for example the tax filing shows the foundation paid nearly 970 000 to trap heals llc a company founded by damon turner who fathered a child with cullors and 840 000 to cullors protection llc a security firm run by paul cullors patrisse s brother bowers who has previously served as deputy executive director is founder and president of a firm that received the lion s share of money spent on consultants in the last fiscal year bowers consulting provided much of the foundation s operational support including staffing fundraising and other key services and was paid more than 2 1 million according to the tax filing the foundation s reliance on consultants is not unusual for newer nonprofits mittendorf said but having clear policies around business transactions could reduce any appearance of impropriety he said the tax filing indicates the foundation has a conflict of interest policy and bowers said the last blm board approved the contract with his firm when he was not a board member the foundation will launch a transparency and accountability center on its website to make its financial documents available for public inspection bowers said

the union government on tuesday announced some relaxations in the wheat export ban hours after the us urged countries not to restrict the supply the relaxation was announced by the union commerce ministry amid reports of at least 4 000 trucks loaded with wheat stranded at kandla port in gujarat over the weekend in the absence of clarity following the surprise announcement of the export ban on saturday the indian government had earlier promised to supply wheat to the world to address the shortfall because of the russia ukraine conflict advertisement the confusion in kandla was reminiscent of the chaos that followed demonetisation in 2016 and the lockdown in 2020 joe biden pti photo while the commerce ministry s media release did not detail the reasons for announcing relaxations in the wheat export ban announcement of may 13 congress veteran and former union minister of state for commerce and industry jairam ramesh was quick to draw a connection with the us nudge first grab headlines by announcing big wheat exports to replace ukraine then declare ban on wheat exports because of domestic price situation thereafter relax ban because usa is unhappy with it all within a span of 5 days no surprise from the vishwaguru of masterstrokes he tweeted first grab headlines by announcing big wheat exports to replace ukraine then declare ban on wheat exports because of domestic price situation thereafter relax ban because usa is unhappy with it all within a span of 5 days no surprise from the vishwaguru of masterstrokes jairam ramesh jairam_ramesh may 17 2022 on monday briefing the media in new york on global food security us ambassador to the united nations linda thomas greenfield had said we re encouraging countries not to restrict exports because we think any restrictions on exports will exacerbate the food shortages she was responding to a question on whether the us had a reaction to india s decision to limit exports of wheat thomas greenfield added india will be one of the countries participating in our meeting at the security council and we hope that they can as they hear the concerns being raised by other countries that they would reconsider that position she was referring to an open debate that the us is calling in the united nations security council on thursday on conflict and food security on tuesday the indian government said overseas wheat shipments awaiting customs clearance would be allowed wheat exports to egypt will also be allowed it has been decided that wherever wheat consignments have been handed over to customs for examination and have been registered into their customs systems either on may 13 2022 or earlier would be allowed to be shipped out the government said india banned wheat exports just days after it forecast record shipments of 10 million tonnes this year as a scorching heat wave curtailed output sending domestic prices to record highs the government said it would only allow exports backed by letters of credit or payment guarantees issued before may 13 the provision has created uncertainty given that of some 2 2 million tonnes of wheat at ports or in transit traders said they only had letters of credit for 400 000 tonnes the export ban also trapped about 1 8 million tonnes of grain at ports potentially forcing traders to incur heavy losses from selling onto a weaker domestic market india s decision to restrict the export of wheat came as a surprise because several ministers of the modi government had earlier said that new delhi was prepared to help meet the shortfall in foodgrains the world was facing because of the conflict russia and ukraine together account for more than a quarter of the world s wheat exports and the conflict has disrupted this supply prime minister narendra modi himself had said on april 13 that he had told us president joe biden that india was ready to send food relief to countries if the world trade organisation wto permits addressing the inaugural function of the hostel and education complex of the shri annapurnadham trust at adalaj modi had said a war like situation has developed and everybody is securing its stocks in such a situation the world is staring at a new problem as food stocks have started declining during my discussion with the us president yesterday i assured him to send food relief to countries if the wto accords permission we are ready to send the relief from tomorrow itself we already have enough food for our people but our farmers seem to have made arrangements to feed the world due to the blessings of maa annapurna however we have to work according to the laws of the world so i don t know when the wto will give permission nearly a fortnight later external affairs minister s jaishankar said at the raisina dialogue that india can make a difference today by stepping in in terms of export of agricultural commodities especially wheat we are trying to see how we can supply more wheat to meet global shortfalls there are of course some constraints which is what we have in terms of public stocks there are wto limits on trading with those stocks but this is a very unusual situation and we hope that the wto will look at it in that manner if we can contribute today to alleviate food shortages whether it s government purchases expanding the markets helping the world food programme i think this is a very big contribution that we can make and we are prepared to make that the government drew flak from the opposition for the confusion created by the surprise ban leader of the opposition in

rochester for anders and allison nygren keeping their son leighton fed should not be this hard but a shortage of baby formula that has hit the nation has the couple concerned the shortage really didn t hit rochester until about three four weeks ago anders nygren said you walk in and there s absolutely nothing on the shelves you then start searching online and everything says sold out i mean it s not a pleasant experience the struggles are not limited to rochester or even minnesota the shortage began after the food and drug administration cited unsafe practices committed by abbott nutrition laboratories where baby formula products resulted in the deaths of two infants due to a rare bacterial illness since the fda shut down production at the abbott plant where the illness was traced back to formula shortages have become all too common on store shelves while stores carrying baby formula continue to be bare across the country families with infants have turned to community pages on social media platforms to assist one another in finding and providing formula to each other when they can advertisement the nygrens of rochester are one of those couples like many they ve turned to facebook communities to give and receive assistance in finding the right baby formula for their 7 month old son and to help other families with the same problem the speed at which this crisis came upon their family has worried nygren and others the nygrens typically shop at big box stores such as target or walmart for their son s formula looking for the formula that best suits their son s needs even if big box stores such as target walmart and hy vee have some formula in stock it may not meet the needs of some families for the most part you get your child on a certain type of formula and you get what works for them anders nygren said adding that a gentle stomach formula works best for their son our formula is enfamil neuropro that s what we found works best for him and we haven t been able to find that in stores for a while requests for help in finding baby formula for the nygren s has not been limited to the rochester area allison nygren has heard from people all over the country on facebook in need of help finding and receiving baby formula amid the shortage the couple usually purchases several months worth of dry formula at a time so when the crisis hit the nygrens were willing to share some of what they had i even have had somebody message me from washington d c allison nygren said i had someone begging for it and i had already given it away to somebody in the local community i had another woman reach out to me her sister came all the way from iowa last weekend and they hit up all of the surrounding towns and everything on the way to rochester through the drive up looking for a formula for their child and they could not find it anywhere advertisement residents in rochester and surrounding towns have had trouble finding any baby formula at all four hy vee locations as well as both walmart and target locations according to messages on various facebook community groups some residents have gone out of their way to the hy vees in kasson and austin minnesota as well as walmart to find baby formula ending with the same results in a written statement a hy vee corporate spokesperson said we continue to see sporadic outages of some baby formula brands across our stores due to the national shortage we are working with our supplier partners to ensure we obtain as much product as possible for our customers in the meantime we continue to work with state and industry officials to keep them updated on our supply availability so we can best meet the needs of our customers throughout the midwest with baby formula being limited on store shelves prices for available formula at stores have gone up even with formula in short supply financial support to acquire formula is available in the rochester area and around the state wendy o leary services manager for minnesota wic women infants and children said the organization is providing updated information for olmsted county residents and other minnesotans residents where to find baby formula or formula related products the organization also helps with financial assistance for those in need we ve added as many alternatives to our list as we can to increase the chances that families find a formula in the store that they can purchase with their benefit o leary said there is a huge list of allowed formula substitutes which can help guide families who cannot find their usual formula brand in the store we are in contact with vendors and stores to find out what samples are available and then can also help guide clients as to where the best location might be for them to find the formula that they need the list for baby formula alternatives and services can be found on the minnesota department of health website as the baby formula shortage grows more dire manufacturers have stated they will increase productivity at their manufacturing plants reckitt benckiser based out of norwich united kingdom has increased production by 30 and plans to increase shipments to the united states according to a report by reuters one reckitt plant in the united states where production will pick up rapidly is located in wanamingo minn and will be allowing unlimited overtime for plant employees who will work to make up for the supply shortage advertisement though there are signs the baby formula shortage will decline as the summer goes on there is still a six week period where supply chains will remain limited with certain types of formula that has the nygrens and other families worried we ll probably start seeing more posts on facebook and people looking for formulas here in the next week or two i don t know about other people but when we see formula on the shelves we try to buy for the full month but it s just not there anymore anders nygren said and people who typically have had some sort of supply start running out and then they re gonna either try to find it online or go on to social media and try to find it there
bloomberg the us has lost its ability to build big projects and produce goods venture capitalist marc andreessen lamented tuesday during an appearance at a technology conference in washington hosted by autonomous vehicle software company applied intuition the billionaire investor cited examples of major accomplishments from an earlier era like the hoover dam the golden gate bridge and the manhattan project and said that the us which has always prided itself on production has let its advantages atrophy in recent decades it s a thesis that andreessen who co founded the venture firm andreessen horowitz has been speaking and writing about since the first few months of the covid 19 pandemic when he saw that the country was struggling to provide enough protective equipment to health care workers the problem he said is that a cultural political change has led to a vetocracy or a set of systems in which a lot of people have the ability to say no he cited stymied examples such as san francisco s inability to build significant numbers of new residential units in a housing crunch and the glacial pace of california s expensive high speed rail project if this were china that train would be running today he said it s astonishing to me andreessen s comments come two years after he published his manifesto it s time to build which hit on many of the same themes and was broadly influential in silicon valley andreessen generally believes that freer markets would often solve america s problems for example while most insurance covered health care services remain exorbitantly expensive andreessen said laser eye surgery has gotten cheaper and better over time because it s elective and therefore something consumers pay for directly an argument that competition drives innovation and better services as for the recent slump in technology stocks he said it s too soon to tell what the effect will be on the silicon valley startup scene the past three years have been a surprising time for tech the pandemic instead of killing startups boosted them it s maybe the weirdest thing we ve ever seen he said the pandemic was fantastic which is just not supposed to happen now that some venture investors are getting spooked by the volatility in the public markets andreessen said he s seen some startup fundraising deals stall out while others are continuing on as though nothing has changed in the next six months the longevity of the slump will become clearer for now i have no idea which way this goes he said 2022 bloomberg l p

by david shepardson washington reuters investigators looking into the crash of a china eastern airlines nyse jet are examining the actions of the crew on the flight deck with no evidence found of a technical malfunction two people briefed on the matter said in mainland china s deadliest aviation disaster for 28 years the boeing nyse 737 800 crashed in the mountains of southern guangxi on march 21 after a sudden plunge from cruising altitude killing all 123 passengers and nine crew the pilots did not respond to repeated calls from air traffic controllers and nearby planes during the rapid descent authorities have said on tuesday the wall street journal said flight data from one of the black boxes indicated that someone in the cockpit intentionally crashed the plane citing people familiar with the preliminary assessment of u s officials one source told reuters that investigators were looking at whether the crash was a voluntary act involving crew inputs to the controls though that does not necessarily mean the dive was intentional the cockpit voice recorder was damaged during the crash and it is unclear whether investigators have been able to retrieve any information from it boeing co the maker of the jet and the u s national transportation safety board ntsb declined to comment and referred questions to chinese regulators the civil aviation administration of china caac which is leading the investigation did not respond immediately to a request for comment screenshots of the wall street journal story appeared to have been censored both on china s weibo nasdaq social media platform and the wechat messaging app on wednesday the hashtag topics china eastern and china eastern black boxes are banned on weibo which cited a breach of laws and users are unable to share posts on the incident in wechat groups in an april 11 response to internet rumors of a deliberate crash the caac said the speculation had gravely misled the public and interfered with the accident investigation work on wednesday a woman who had lost her husband in the crash asked to be identified only by her surname wen said she had not seen the wall street journal report but hoped the results of the investigation would be released soon wen added that she and other members of victims families had signed an agreement with china eastern that included a clause on compensation but declined to say how much was offered china eastern did not immediately respond to a request for comment the wall street journal said the airline had said in a statement that no evidence had emerged that could determine if there were any problems with the aircraft no technical recommendations the 737 800 is a widely flown predecessor to boeing s 737 max but lacks the systems linked to fatal 737 max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that brought a lengthy grounding of the max china eastern grounded its entire fleet of 737 800 planes after the crash but resumed flights in mid april a decision widely seen at the time as ruling out any immediate new safety concerns over boeing s most widely used model in a summary of an unpublished preliminary crash report last month chinese investigators did not point to any technical recommendations for the 737 800 which has been in service since 1997 with a strong safety record according to experts in a may 10 interview with reuters ntsb chair jennifer homendy said board investigators and boeing had traveled to china to assist the chinese investigation which had not found any safety issues requiring urgent action homendy said if the board had any safety concerns it would issue urgent safety recommendations the ntsb assisted chinese investigators with the review of black boxes at its u s laboratory in washington at china s request despite political tension between the countries caac said the ntsb confirmed that it did not release information about the china eastern crash to media the state owned global times said shares of boeing closed up 6 5 a final report into the causes of the crash could take two years or more to compile chinese officials have said analysts blame most crashes on a cocktail of human and technical factors deliberate crashes are exceptionally rare globally in march 2015 a germanwings co pilot deliberately flew an airbus a320 into a french mountainside killing all 150 on board french investigators found the 27 year old was suffering from a suspected psychotic depressive episode concealed from his employer they later called for better mental health guidelines and stronger peer support groups for pilots

chair jerome powell on tuesday underscored the federal reserve s determination to keep raising interest rates until there is clear evidence inflation is steadily falling a high stakes effort that carries the risk of causing an eventual recession washington ap chair jerome powell on tuesday underscored the federal reserve s determination to keep raising interest rates until there is clear evidence inflation is steadily falling a high stakes effort that carries the risk of causing an eventual recession the fed s increases in its benchmark short term rate typically lead in turn to higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses including for mortgages auto loans and credit cards what we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way powell said in remarks to a wall street journal conference and we re going to keep pushing until we see that the fed chair who was confirmed last week by the senate to a second four year term suggested that the fed would consider raising rates even faster if price increases fail to moderate what we need to see powell said is clear and convincing evidence that inflation pressures are abating and inflation is coming down and if we don t see that then we ll have to consider moving more aggressively if we do see that then we can consider moving to a slower pace and he said the fed wouldn t hesitate to push its benchmark rate to a point that would slow the economy if needed while it is unclear what level that might be fed officials peg it at about 2 5 to 3 roughly triple its current setting powell s remarks tuesday followed other statements he has made that have indicated the fed is implementing a series of rate hikes that could amount to the fastest tightening of credit in more than 30 years at a meeting earlier this month the fed raised its key rate by a half point double the usual increase for the first time since 2000 to a range of 0 75 to 1 and at a news conference after the meeting powell suggested that fed officials would continue to raise its rate by a half point at both its june and july meetings the fed chair appeared unconcerned tuesday about the stock market s sharp decline over the past six weeks those declines partly reflect concern on wall street that the fed s efforts to rein in inflation which has reached 40 year highs could weaken the economy so much as to trigger a recession stock prices also often fall as interest rates rise increasing the return from bonds when asked if the fed s rate hikes could disrupt financial markets without necessarily bringing down inflation powell responded i don t see that happening the interest rate or yield on the two year treasury note has risen steadily since the start of the year which powell pointed to as a sign that wall street expects the fed to keep tightening credit such expectations should help slow borrowing and spending and cool the economy it s been good to see financial markets reacting in advance of upcoming rate hikes powell said that s what we need the s p 500 a broad market index has tumbled about 15 from its january peak that s just short of the 20 decline that marks a bear market yet many economists say powell is unlikely to let market disruptions change the fed s path given that inflation has soared to such high levels and is causing hardships for millions of households the markets are orderly they re functioning powell said there are some volatile days and volatile markets but so far i see us as getting through this fairly well the fed chair also suggested more explicitly than before that the central bank s efforts to bring down inflation may result in some people losing their jobs pushing up the unemployment rate powell said the fed s goal was to cool off consumer and business spending and bring it more into line with the restrained supply of goods and workers that in turn should tame inflation the fed hopes to accomplish that powell said while keeping the job market strong but that doesn t mean the unemployment rate would necessarily stay at 3 6 where it is now he said you d still have quite a strong labor market if unemployment were to move up a few ticks he said copyright 2024 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast written or redistributed

while most of the market has been mired in a brutal correction energy stocks have had a very mild pullback investors should consider buying a high quality energy stock like ovintiv ovv occidental petroleum oxy and vaalco energy egy as the underlying fundamentals keep improving over the last month we have experienced a major selloff across nearly every asset class the s p 500 is down by 9 4 while bonds are also down evidenced by the 6 drop in the ishares 20 yr treasury bond etf tlt in the commodity complex the picture is more mixed gold is down by 8 there is also weakness in industrial metals with copper down by 15 and underperformance in steel and iron ore stocks one exception is crude oil which is higher over the last month crude oil s strength is impressive given that china s economy is shut down and speaks to its bullish fundamentals when this returns it could be the next catalyst for oil prices even with some increased recession concerns travel demand and miles driven remain strong on the supply side companies continue to pay off debt or buy back shares rather than invest in new production advertisement article continues below this ad until we see a meaningful response on the supply side investors should continue buying the dip in energy stocks here are 3 to consider ovintiv ovv occidental petroleum oxy and vaalco energy egy ovintiv ovv ovv is a north american independent oil and gas e p with core assets in the permian eagle ford montney and duvernay resources these are considered to be the shale properties with the most favorable drilling economics thus it s not surprising that ovv has been one of the best performing stocks over the past year with a 73 gain following the buyout of newfield exploration ovv is one of the largest upstream companies in north america it also has a nice mix of oil and gas as both assets are quite strong on a year over year basis its primary sources of production are the montney in british columbia and alberta anadarko basin in oklahoma and the permian basin in new mexico advertisement article continues below this ad over the past year the company has aggressively reduced costs and paid off debt which has put it in a much stronger financial position the company is also returning cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends it recently announced a 25 increase in its dividend and boosted its buyback to 1 billion in 2022 which equates to 9 of its total market cap it s also projected to earn about 2 5 billion in free cash flow in 2022 which could increase with higher oil and natural gas prices ovv has an overall grade of b translating into a buy rating in our powr ratings system the company has a value grade of b which isn t surprising with a forward p e of 3 4 and low amounts of debt click here to see ovv s complete powr ratings including component grades for growth and momentum occidental petroleum oxy oxy is a north american independent oil and gas exploration and production company it operates through three segments oil gas chemical and marketing and midstream in addition to oil and gas the company also produces basic chemicals petrochemicals and specialty chemicals advertisement article continues below this ad oxy has been one of the big turnaround stories of this energy bull market as the company was flirting with bankruptcy early in 2020 due to its heavy debt load and purchase of devon energy now this aggressiveness is paying off as the price of oil and natural gas rocket higher maybe the ultimate validation is that warren buffett has been an aggressive buyer of the stock currently berkshire owns 15 of the company about 7 5 billion which makes it the ninth largest holding for buffett and it fits with his other investments in energy as he bought utilities and midstream assets in 2020 with his purchase of dominion energy d adding to its positive momentum oxy has been on an impressive streak of reporting blowout earnings in its last quarter it topped analysts earnings expectations for the fourth straight quarter with 2 12 in eps vs 1 97 per share revenue also topped expectations at 8 5 billion vs 8 3 billion these figures were major improvements of last year s q1 which had a 0 15 per share loss and 5 4 billion in revenue of course these figures should improve next quarter due to higher prices it s also the largest holder of land in the permian basin which makes its outlook particularly appealing for investors who believe the energy bull market is in its early innings advertisement article continues below this ad the powr ratings also reflect this positive outlook the company has an overall grade of b translating to a buy rating oxy s momentum grade of a is consistent with the stock s strong performance even amid a volatile market environment and the recent pullback in oil prices click here to see the complete powr ratings for oxy including grades for growth and value vaalco energy inc egy egy is an independent oil and gas explorer developer and producer the company holds the etame production sharing contract in the etame marin block in the republic of gabon and has interests in the undeveloped offshore block in equatorial guinea given its foreign and offshore locations egy is certainly a higher risk investment than oxy or ovv further it has a higher cost of production and many of its untapped reserves are only viable at higher prices advertisement article continues below this ad thus the stock will likely outperform its peers if oil and gas prices plateau at even higher levels but will likely underperform if oil prices can t sustain average prices over 100 per barrel however the company is very profitable at current prices in its last earnings report the company made 77 6 million in revenue and produced about 8 050 barrels per day and 45 million in ebitda next year the company is projected to earn 88 million in net income which makes its current market cap of 342 million quite attractive equally important management discussed some operational improvements that could lead to more production and lower costs in the coming quarters it also was able to increase the amount of its sec approved reserves by 250 and expects about a 38 increase in the number of barrels produced on an annual basis this combination of rising oil prices and increased production is leading to an earnings boom and a strong bull market in the stock the powr ratings are also bullish on the stock as it has a b rating which translates to a buy b rated stocks have posted an average annual

the film and television industry in recent years companies struggling to meet a growing demand for streaming content have been increasingly drawn to the area in and around new york city a region brimming with actors and skilled union labor new facilities that have opened in the last year in hudson county new jersey and in westchester county new york are frequently booked solid and more studios are in the works one study estimated that the newark project could bring as many as 600 long term jobs and a constellation of new business opportunities to the city the state s largest with a population of 312 000 and a median household income of less than 38 000 the bigger idea is that newark becomes a hub for creativity said john schreiber president and ceo of the new jersey performing arts center a cultural anchor in newark recently named the developer for most of the site great point studios plans to build the production hub for use mainly by lionsgate a company that created 26 oscar nominated films the year after it purchased the starz cable operation in 2016 great point s chair robert halmi jr said he was still confident about the future of streaming in spite of last month s news that netflix had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade a dip that sent stocks tumbling industrywide out of fear that the model s rapid growth was unsustainable the appetite for original streaming content halmi said is here to stay and soundstages where shows can be filmed indoors against a green screen or using led technology are at a premium we can t build studios fast enough he said several large soundstages opened in the last year across the hudson river from new york city in kearny and jersey city dozens of productions including award winning movies like west side story joker and army of the dead filmed there bayonne s planning board has given the go ahead for a 1 5 million square foot production facility 1888 studios on the site of an old texaco oil refinery plans are in the works for a studio in west orange where inventor thomas edison created the country s first movie studio and a netflix spokesperson confirmed that the company still intended to submit a bid next month to buy a roughly 300 acre parcel at fort monmouth a defunct army base on the jersey shore we already had the resources in new jersey the human resources said andrew muscato a movie producer who lives in jersey city where he made parts of the greatest beer run ever a war drama based on a memoir that is expected to air on apple tv later this year the announcement of more production facilities feels like the last piece of the puzzle muscato said it is great point s second major production hub in the region lionsgate yonkers an even bigger facility in westchester county new york opened in january in 2017 before new jersey reauthorized tax breaks for the industry directors making feature films spent 10 million statewide and television series creators spent 38 million last year feature films pumped 194 million into the economy and television shows contributed 247 million according to the state s motion picture and television commission the industry has erupted here said steven gorelick executive director of the commission no one could have envisioned this progress this quickly newark s six soundstages will each be at least 20 000 square feet a size considered large enough to lure business from popular production hubs in georgia new mexico and california that has been new jersey gov philip d murphy s goal for years he traveled to california in 2019 to generate interest in new jersey among hollywood leaders two years later he signed a law that offered corporations that relocate or expand in new jersey 14 billion in tax breaks the legislation significantly increased the pool of tax cuts available through 2034 to companies that build studios or film in the state last spring after georgia passed a law restricting voter access the governor openly tried to poach production business away from georgia when activists were calling for companies like netflix disney and warner bros to boycott studios there more recently murphy noted that georgia was likely to ban abortion if the supreme court as expected overturned a woman s right to end a pregnancy providing even more reason for producers and directors to look for alternatives outside of that state georgia is going the wrong way on the values that are dear to a lot of the talent and the people behind the talent murphy said it has been decades since the neighborhood around the housing complex seth boyden court was considered a desirable place to live construction officials said one challenge during the demolition had been relocating the roughly 20 homeless people who returned nightly to the complex s buildings vacant since 2015 but its location a baseball throw away from the airport and less than 15 miles from new york city is ideal for the actors directors and crew members who will eventually work at lionsgate newark halmi said a lot of the talent live in manhattan he said a lot of the talent want to sleep in manhattan in addition to the movie studios the city has authorized a separate company boraie development to build 200 units of housing for older people on 4 acres of the site and as many as 200 market rate apartments nearby victor cirilo director of newark s housing authority said we think that we re really going to be able to bring this neighborhood back to life cirilo said newark s downtown has been booming for years but neighborhoods farther from the city s corporate heart like the dayton street area where the studios are planned continue to struggle in addition to the hoped for influx of money the new facility in conjunction with the arts center is expected to offer internships and educational programming to city students bill good a senior organizer with the greater newark hud tenants coalition said projects like lionsgate newark that are shiny and brand new often ignore the true needs of the current residents of newark developers he said should be required to replicate the same number of low income housing units lost when seth boyden closed 530 newark is in desperate need of low income housing good said it should be one for one replacement he stressed that he was not opposed to development or the new jobs the project could generate but said that preserving low income housing was equally vital an economic impact study done for the performing arts center estimated that lionsgate newark would create 500 to 600 permanent on site jobs and bring as much as 800 million in economic activity much of the direct spending is likely to be spent outside of new jersey initially the analysis by jll a real estate services company found but newark and essex county new jersey could over time develop the cottage industries needed to retain a portion of that financial boon leading to an estimated 180 million in state tax revenue over 20 years according to the report at least some of the new jobs will be for production assistants entry level workers hustling to break in to a notoriously competitive business over the last two years jody brockway a former vice president of movies and miniseries at nbc who now runs p a bootcamp a job training company has led seven weekend long classes for would be production assistants in new jersey often in advance of large shoots you work your way in and work your way up brockway said the pay is low but can lead to more permanent jobs either producing future shows or in the vast array of ancillary businesses once you have a studio she said now you re building sets now you re hiring carpenters you re hiring painters you re hiring people to wire everything baraka who grew up on the other side of nearby weequahic park said he expected the project to invigorate an overlooked corner of the city
ai generated fashion models could bring more diversity to the industry or leave it with less a model presents a creation by gefferson vila nova during the sao paulo fashion week 2024 spfw at the iguatemi shopping mall in sao paulo brazil 13 april 2024 spfw continues through 14 april with a total of 27 shows epa london based model alexsandrah has a twin but not in the way you d expect her counterpart is made of pixels instead of flesh and blood the virtual twin was generated by artificial intelligence and has already appeared as a stand in for the real life alexsandrah in a photo shoot alexsandrah who goes by her first name professionally in turn receives credit and compensation whenever the ai version of herself gets used just like a human model alexsandrah says she and her alter ego mirror each other even down to the baby hairs and it is yet another example of how ai is transforming creative industries and the way humans may or may not be compensated proponents say the growing use of ai in fashion modeling showcases diversity in all shapes and sizes allowing consumers to make more tailored purchase decisions that in turn reduces fashion waste from product returns and digital modeling saves money for companies and creates opportunities for people who want to work with the technology but critics raise concerns that digital models may push human models and other professionals like makeup artists and photographers out of a job unsuspecting consumers could also be fooled into thinking ai models are real and companies could claim credit for fulfilling diversity commitments without employing actual humans fashion is exclusive with limited opportunities for people of color to break in said sara ziff a former fashion model and founder of the model alliance a nonprofit aiming to advance workers rights in the fashion industry i think the use of ai to distort racial representation and marginalize actual models of color reveals this troubling gap between the industry s declared intentions and their real actions women of color in particular have long faced higher barriers to entry in modeling and ai could upend some of the gains they ve made data suggests that women are more likely to work in occupations in which the technology could be applied and are more at risk of displacement than men in march 2023 iconic denim brand levi strauss co announced that it would be testing ai generated models produced by amsterdam based company lalaland ai to add a wider range of body types and underrepresented demographics on its website but after receiving widespread backlash levi clarified that it was not pulling back on its plans for live photo shoots the use of live models or its commitment to working with diverse models we do not see this ai pilot as a means to advance diversity or as a substitute for the real action that must be taken to deliver on our diversity equity and inclusion goals and it should not have been portrayed as such levi said in its statement at the time the company last month said that it has no plans to scale the ai program the associated press reached out to several other retailers to ask whether they use ai fashion models target kohl s and fast fashion giant shein declined to comment temu did not respond to a request for comment meanwhile spokespeople for nieman marcus h m walmart and macy s said their respective companies do not use ai models although walmart clarified that suppliers may have a different approach to photography they provide for their products but we don t have that information nonetheless companies that generate ai models are finding a demand for the technology including lalaland ai which was co founded by michael musandu after he was feeling frustrated by the absence of clothing models who looked like him one model does not represent everyone that s actually shopping and buying a product he said as a person of color i felt this painfully myself musandu says his product is meant to supplement traditional photo shoots not replace them instead of seeing one model shoppers could see nine to 12 models using different size filters which would enrich their shopping experience and help reduce product returns and fashion waste the technology is actually creating new jobs since lalaland ai pays humans to train its algorithms musandu said and if brands are serious about inclusion efforts they will continue to hire these models of color he added london based model alexsandrah who is black says her digital counterpart has helped her distinguish herself in the fashion industry in fact the real life alexsandrah has even stood in for a black computer generated model named shudu created by cameron wilson a former fashion photographer turned ceo of the diigitals a uk based digital modeling agency wilson who is white designed shudu in 2017 described on instagram as the the world s first digital supermodel but critics at the time accused wilson of cultural appropriation and digital blackface wilson took the experience as a lesson and transformed the diigitals to make sure shudu who has been booked by louis vuitton and bmw didn t take away opportunities but instead opened possibilities for women of color alexsandrah for instance has modeled in person as shudu for vogue australia and writer ama badu came up with shudu s backstory and portrays her voice for interviews alexsandrah said she is extremely proud of her work with the diigitals which created her own ai twin it s something that even when we are no longer here the future generations can look back at and be like these are the pioneers but for yve edmond a new york city area based model who works with major retailers to check the fit of clothing before it s sold to consumers the rise of ai in fashion modeling feels more insidious edmond worries modeling agencies and companies are taking advantage of models who are generally independent contractors afforded few labor protections in the us by using their photos to train ai systems without their consent or compensation she described one incident in which a client asked to photograph edmond moving her arms squatting and walking for research purposes edmond refused and later felt swindled her modeling agency had told her she was being booked for a fitting not to build an avatar this is a complete violation she said it was really disappointing for me but absent ai regulations it s up to companies to be transparent and ethical about deploying ai technology and ziff the founder of the model alliance likens the current lack of legal protections for fashion workers to the wild west that s why the model alliance is pushing for legislation like the one being considered in new york state in which a provision of the fashion workers act would require management companies and brands to obtain models clear written consent to create or use a model s digital replica specify the amount and duration of compensation and prohibit altering or manipulating models digital replica without consent alexsandrah says that with ethical use and the right legal regulations ai might open up doors for more models of color like herself she has let her clients know that she has an ai replica and she funnels any inquires for its use through wilson who she describes as somebody that i know love trust and is my friend wilson says they make sure any compensation for alexsandrah s ai is comparable to what she would make in person edmond however is more of a purist we have this amazing earth that we re living on and you have a person of every shade every height every size why not find that person and compensate that person

t hit rochester until about three four weeks ago anders nygren said you walk in and there s absolutely nothing on the shelves you then start searching online and everything says sold out i mean it s not a pleasant experience the struggles are not limited to rochester or even minnesota the shortage began after the food and drug administration cited unsafe practices committed by abbott nutrition laboratories where baby formula products resulted in the deaths of two infants due to a rare bacterial illness since the fda shut down production at the abbott plant where the illness was traced back to formula shortages have become all too common on store shelves while stores carrying baby formula continue to be bare across the country families with infants have turned to community pages on social media platforms to assist one another in finding and providing formula to each other when they can advertisement the nygrens of rochester are one of those couples like many they ve turned to facebook communities to give and receive assistance in finding the right baby formula for their 7 month old son and to help other families with the same problem the speed at which this crisis came upon their family has worried nygren and others the nygrens typically shop at big box stores such as target or walmart for their son s formula looking for the formula that best suits their son s needs even if big box stores such as target walmart and hy vee have some formula in stock it may not meet the needs of some families for the most part you get your child on a certain type of formula and you get what works for them anders nygren said adding that a gentle stomach formula works best for their son our formula is enfamil neuropro that s what we found works best for him and we haven t been able to find that in stores for a while requests for help in finding baby formula for the nygren s has not been limited to the rochester area allison nygren has heard from people all over the country on facebook in need of help finding and receiving baby formula amid the shortage the couple usually purchases several months worth of dry formula at a time so when the crisis hit the nygrens were willing to share some of what they had i even have had somebody message me from washington d c allison nygren said i had someone begging for it and i had already given it away to somebody in the local community i had another woman reach out to me her sister came all the way from iowa last weekend and they hit up all of the surrounding towns and everything on the way to rochester through the drive up looking for a formula for their child and they could not find it anywhere advertisement residents in rochester and surrounding towns have had trouble finding any baby formula at all four hy vee locations as well as both walmart and target locations according to messages on various facebook community groups some residents have gone out of their way to the hy vees in kasson and austin minnesota as well as walmart to find baby formula ending with the same results in a written statement a hy vee corporate spokesperson said we continue to see sporadic outages of some baby formula brands across our stores due to the national shortage we are working with our supplier partners to ensure we obtain as much product as possible for our customers in the meantime we continue to work with state and industry officials to keep them updated on our supply availability so we can best meet the needs of our customers throughout the midwest with baby formula being limited on store shelves prices for available formula at stores have gone up even with formula in short supply financial support to acquire formula is available in the rochester area and around the state wendy o leary services manager for minnesota wic women infants and children said the organization is providing updated information for olmsted county residents and other minnesotans residents where to find baby formula or formula related products the organization also helps with financial assistance for those in need we ve added as many alternatives to our list as we can to increase the chances that families find a formula in the store that they can purchase with their benefit o leary said there is a huge list of allowed formula substitutes which can help guide families who cannot find their usual formula brand in the store we are in contact with vendors and stores to find out what samples are available and then can also help guide clients as to where the best location might be for them to find the formula that they need the list for baby formula alternatives and services can be found on the minnesota department of health website as the baby formula shortage grows more dire manufacturers have stated they will increase productivity at their manufacturing plants reckitt benckiser based out of norwich united kingdom has increased production by 30 and plans to increase shipments to the united states according to a report by reuters one reckitt plant in the united states where production will pick up rapidly is located in wanamingo minn and will be allowing unlimited overtime for plant employees who will work to make up for the supply shortage advertisement though there are signs the baby formula shortage will decline as the summer goes on there is still a six week period where supply chains will remain limited with certain types of formula that has the nygrens and other families worried we ll probably start seeing more posts on facebook and people looking for formulas here in the next week or two i don t know about other people but when we see formula on the shelves we try to buy for the full month but it s just not there anymore anders nygren said and people who typically have had some sort of supply start running out and then they re gonna either try to find it online or go on to social media and try to find it there

the u s is pulling out all the stops in a widespread government effort to alleviate growing pressure from a nationwide baby formula shortage pandemic related supply chain pressures were exacerbated when the country s largest formula producer abbott abt had to shut down a plant in sturgis michigan in february and recall several products in light of reports of infant sicknesses the subsequent investigation by the food and drug administration fda and centers for disease control and prevention cdc show that while samples of the bacteria of concern cronobacter sakazakii were found in some parts of the plant there isn t enough data to link the four cases including two deaths to abbott s product but government officials have said current testing and the database for the specific bacteria are limited which is something the fda is hoping to be able to change amid the shutdown occurred the company took 20 products off the shelves including those used by nearly 5 000 infants as well as some older children and adults with rare metabolic diseases according to the white house since then other companies have begun to increase formula production rickett benckiser said it has increased

the u s is pulling out all the stops in a widespread government effort to alleviate growing pressure from a nationwide baby formula shortage pandemic related supply chain pressures were exacerbated when the country s largest formula producer abbott abt had to shut down a plant in sturgis michigan in february and recall several products in light of reports of infant sicknesses the subsequent investigation by the food and drug administration fda and centers for disease control and prevention cdc show that while samples of the bacteria of concern cronobacter sakazakii were found in some parts of the plant there isn t enough data to link the four cases including two deaths to abbott s product but government officials have said current testing and the database for the specific bacteria are limited which is something the fda is hoping to be able to change amid the shutdown occurred the company took 20 products off the shelves including those used by nearly 5 000 infants as well as some older children and adults with rare metabolic diseases according to the white house since then other companies have begun to increase formula production rickett benckiser said it has increased

the great baby formula airlift of 2022 will soon be underway after 40 percent of popular brands were out of stock by late april swiss manufacturer nestle which owns gerber announced it will fly extra baby formula to the united states fda rules effectively prevented the importation of foreign made products and were only suspended on monday cargo planes are fast not cheap and american parents will likely pay a premium but the market is finally solving the shortage once the government freed it to do so dave brat dean of liberty university s business school asserted the free market in itself can solve this in a week still red tape will continue hampering the supply of baby formula for months the largest u s baby formula factory has been offline since february after fda inspectors shut it down tuesday the manufacturer abbott announced a consent decree with the fda whose inspectors found bacteria in the plant although it was found in no product and linked to no illnesses to reopen america s largest formula factory once a court approves the deal abbott plans to resume operations within two weeks although it will take six to eight weeks to reach the shelves nearly four months after the plant was shut down we discover we re still at least two months away on thursday former white house press secretary jen psaki her last day was friday assured america that the biden administration has been working urgently to solve the shortage for months yet questions abound what took so long to reopen the plant were they cleaning the factory with toothbrushes how did it take the fda nearly four months to reach an agreement why did the fda wait until the crisis was severe before relaxing guidelines on foreign imports click like if you are pro life to like the lifenews facebook page the administration is understandably eager to pin the blame on somebody else fundamentally we are here because a company was not able to guarantee that its plant was safe argued transportation secretary pete buttigieg the government does not make baby formula nor should it he got one thing right government has no business wrecking the economy but brat said the baby formula is far from a free market enterprise baby formula produced overseas is subject to tariffs up to 17 5 percent state contracts under special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic which often include hefty rebates to the government impose monopoly pricing on nearly two thirds of all infant formula sales that s in addition to exclusive regulation by the fda and additional inspections like the one which has snarled abbott s production for months it s called economic capture said brat james buchanan won a nobel prize for studying the obvious that government wants to grow itself the free market system is an information puzzle explained brat which is impossible for our finite human minds to analyze how should limited goods with alternative uses be best distributed based upon each individual s preferences and available production capacity like a super computer prices solve the puzzle for us without any one person having to understand the solution if you let the free market system work one company s failure isn t going to mess up the entire country on the other hand what you expect from central planners is a loss of rationality persistent government interference is sure to snarl the economy given his economic philosophy argued brat biden s demoralized answer makes sense oh if only we were better mind readers all of human history has been run by pharaohs kings despots tyrants and central planners and all of human history was marked by 500 a year gets to live on he added that s all of human history except for this miracle of free markets it s no accident that free markets developed under the influence of christianity in the bible we find respect for private property justice under the law and enforcement of contracts principles which allow markets to function and flourish so it should come as no surprise that in an increasingly post christian society free markets are increasingly under attack the indisputable superiority of free market principles has spread the bible s wisdom to all corners of the globe but now an anti christian ideology marxism seeks to impose state supervision on all economic activity in elevating the state to the place of god it denies the well known limits of human reason and presumes to play god in circumstances beyond its control its legacy is spiritual poverty and mass graves when asked whether the administration could have acted sooner president joe biden seemed unaware that the economy works better when government gets out of the way if we d been better mind readers i guess we could have was his downtrodden reply but we moved as quickly as the problem became apparent to us and we have to move with caution as well as speed comprehending basic economic principles does not require telepathy nor does answering the question and what happens then yet the biden administration is like a kindergartner piloting a spaceship giddy with power but unaware of how anything works so invariably they wind up pressing the ominous red button biden s woebegone formula response typifies his response to every other economic issue inflation debt the labor shortage he assumes the problem is everything except the government and realizes belatedly government is usually the problem in her last press briefing as his spokeswoman psaki blamed inflation on the pandemic and impact on supply chains and then the uptick in the pandemic with delta and finally the invasion of ukraine by russia brat s response was simple no f in economics for psaki the only cause of inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon you printed too much money according to the economist john taylor said brat the federal funds rate should be 6 5 percent to avoid inflation but it s currently at 1 percent hiking interest rates is how paul volcker solved inflation under president reagan increase the federal funds rate increase the interest rate take a mini recession he argued that s going to be some pain but if you don t get rid of inflation the house is out of the barn lifenews note joshua arnold writes for the family research council
lee vining calif about five hours north of los angeles and five hours east of san francisco lies california s mono county a picturesque region known for its towering snow capped mountains and close proximity to yosemite national park it s also known for gas prices that are so high aaa headquarters in florida uses it to comfort other people complaining about their fuel costs i always say thank god you don t live in mono county said aaa spokesman andy gross the average price for a gallon of regular gas in the county topped 6 75 this week the highest county average nationwide with some stations charging as much as 7 19 in mid may while people in more populous areas like los angeles county are paying an average of 6 06 they have more options to shop around than the 13 000 people who live in mono county the county pronounced moh no is also at the extreme end of the colliding crises facing most americans inflation driving up prices on basic goods a severe housing shortage that forces many of its workers to commute as much as two hours a day and the spiraling fuel costs that compound everything sierra chaltry drives 80 miles roundtrip five days a week to get from her home in the small community of virginia lakes to her part time job at epic cafe in june lake it s probably costing me around 200 a week said the 29 year old who has been looking for housing in june lake for eight years without luck a recent search on zillow for houses for sale in june lake turned up two listings a mansion for 10 million and a 10th of an acre of land for 129 000 there were no rentals listed housing is impossible chaltry said there is nothing that you can rent around here that is reasonably priced i live 45 minutes away because that was the only thing that i could find coping cheap meals at home and essential drives only to help offset the gas prices chaltry is eating out less buying cheaper ingredients for home cooking and cutting down on optional drives lauren seymore a 35 year old emergency room nurse said she was lucky enough to find a small house in june lake for 950 a month through friends when she moved to the area from oregon in november but that means she s commuting an hour to work in bishop just south of the county line and where gas is slightly more affordable still seymore estimates spending 150 to fill her tank every week the gas prices are excruciating she said adding that the mounting costs led her to buy a hybrid car this month she d also like to move to bishop but zillow has just four places listed for rent in town including a 500 square foot studio apartment going for 1 950 a month as hard as the numbers are to swallow most mono county residents wouldn t live anywhere else their backyard is the eastern sierra a wonderland for anyone who likes hiking mountaineering skiing or fishing californians arrive in droves in the summer and annual visitation is in the millions it takes a bit of traveling to get here but that s the way we like it the county s website says because once you re out here you ll start to remember what beauty looks like increasingly the region is vulnerable to climate change one week a snowstorm can close u s highway 395 the major roadway linking the towns days later a wildfire can trigger evacuations nearby between the whims of the weather and gas prices oil companies living in mono county can be challenging it s also what gives its residents a special grit a put your head down and get on with it attitude that s what linda and dave dore have done since the pandemic when they had to pivot their full service restaurant a half dozen times to what it is today a takeaway cafe in june lake the hits definitely keep coming said the 62 year old linda dore gas prices are a huge concern the housing market is another huge concern the american dream to have a little ma and pa business is really a struggle how many billions do they need household income in working class mono county with its small businesses and service industry jobs sits well below the statewide median meanwhile some of the world s leading oil giants reported record profits for the first three months of this year profits for exxon mobil shell and more also rose by billions despite significant costs of exiting operations and or investments in russia amid war in ukraine here we are struggling to even work enough to get enough gas even go to work dore said i mean it s definitely how many billions do they need the average u s gas price hit a record high tuesday and then wednesday and again thursday and again friday the average price for regular gas in the u s reached 4 43 a gallon on friday according to aaa dore had three stations to choose from last week near her house in lee vining the mobil charging 6 69 for a gallon of regular the shell charging 6 99 a gallon or the chevron charging 7 19 i feel helpless sometimes what can we do she said we try to write to our congressmen and blah blah blah and all that but i just feel like especially these little towns rural america they don t really get heard very much others just accept the price as the cost of living in paradise i m not angry about it said mark grundon a climbing guide living in mono city who drives more than six hours to get to his job at yosemite during the winter months when the nearest road to the park is closed because of snow and ice grundon stays at yosemite for three nights and drives more than six hours back to be with his wife norma and daughter isabella the other four nights of the week i ve kind of gotten used to it he said of the gas prices many in the county stopped wondering long ago why prices are always highest where they live i remember in the old days in the 60s when we d all say oh gosh bridgeport gas is 40 cents and it s 30 cents in la how can people pay that said bob gardner a mono county supervisor and resident of june lake it s always been an issue he said he s not sure why that is except that mono county is a harder to get to though towns within 50 miles have prices nearly 2 cheaper shelley channel who has owned the shell station in lee vining for more than 40 years said his prices are based on the market and his unique location his business is heavily dependent on tourist traffic to yosemite which can only be reached from mono county half the year because of winter road closures when the eastern entrance to yosemite closes in the fall our business goes down 80 sometimes more he said we just sit here and wait until late spring when yosemite national park opens up again his prices not only allow him to stay in business but keep six employees in jobs year round he said gardner with the board of supervisors said gas prices in the region might have finally reached a tipping point adding that the board may start looking at ways of easing the financial pain in the region such as subsidies when inflation is running over 8 percent that s different than it s been in the past he said so maybe it takes some extraordinary measures to try to address that to help families be able to survive and pay their rent and put food on the table more coverage of the economy from usa today

new york ny with a made for television flourish newark mayor ras baraka climbed into an excavator earlier this year and punched the machine s metal claw through a crumbling brick wall of the city s first public housing site the long abandoned apartment complex would be replaced he promised with something better on tuesday officials announced a grand new vision for the 15 acre lot the mounds of rubble at the center of a blighted neighborhood less than 2 miles from newark liberty international airport will be replaced by a 100 million television and movie production hub featuring six large soundstages there will be space for set building postproduction editing crew trucks and catering services when the facility opens in march 2024 officials said the project has been held out primarily as an economic catalyst for newark a poor but growing city about 13 miles west of midtown manhattan but it also offers perhaps the most visible sign yet of new jersey s emerging relevance in the film and television industry in recent years companies struggling to meet a growing demand for streaming content have been increasingly drawn to the area in and around new york city a region brimming with actors and skilled union labor new facilities that have opened in the last year in hudson county new jersey and in westchester county new york are frequently booked solid and more studios are in the works one study estimated that the newark project could bring as many as 600 long term jobs and a constellation of new business opportunities to the city the state s largest with a population of 312 000 and a median household income of less than 38 000 the bigger idea is that newark becomes a hub for creativity said john schreiber president and ceo of the new jersey performing arts center a cultural anchor in newark recently named the developer for most of the site great point studios plans to build the production hub for use mainly by lionsgate a company that created 26 oscar nominated films the year after it purchased the starz cable operation in 2016 great point s chair robert halmi jr said he was still confident about the future of streaming in spite of last month s news that netflix had lost subscribers for the first time in a decade a dip that sent stocks tumbling industrywide out of fear that the model s rapid growth was unsustainable the appetite for original streaming content halmi said is here to stay and soundstages where shows can be filmed indoors against a green screen or using led technology are at a premium we can t build studios fast enough he said several large soundstages opened in the last year across the hudson river from new york city in kearny and jersey city dozens of productions including award winning movies like west side story joker and army of the dead filmed there bayonne s planning board has given the go ahead for a 1 5 million square foot production facility 1888 studios on the site of an old texaco oil refinery plans are in the works for a studio in west orange where inventor thomas edison created the country s first movie studio and a netflix spokesperson confirmed that the company still intended to submit a bid next month to buy a roughly 300 acre parcel at fort monmouth a defunct army base on the jersey shore we already had the resources in new jersey the human resources said andrew muscato a movie producer who lives in jersey city where he made parts of the greatest beer run ever a war drama based on a memoir that is expected to air on apple tv later this year the announcement of more production facilities feels like the last piece of the puzzle muscato said it is great point s second major production hub in the region lionsgate yonkers an even bigger facility in westchester county new york opened in january in 2017 before new jersey reauthorized tax breaks for the industry directors making feature films spent 10 million statewide and television series creators spent 38 million last year feature films pumped 194 million into the economy and television shows contributed 247 million according to the state s motion picture and television commission the industry has erupted here said steven gorelick executive director of the commission no one could have envisioned this progress this quickly newark s six soundstages will each be at least 20 000 square feet a size considered large enough to lure business from popular production hubs in georgia new mexico and california that has been new jersey gov philip d murphy s goal for years he traveled to california in 2019 to generate interest in new jersey among hollywood leaders two years later he signed a law that offered corporations that relocate or expand in new jersey 14 billion in tax breaks the legislation significantly increased the pool of tax cuts available through 2034 to companies that build studios or film in the state also on artdaily new director announced for hm queen sonja art foundation last spring after georgia passed a law restricting voter access the governor openly tried to poach production business away from georgia when activists were calling for companies like netflix disney and warner bros to boycott studios there more recently murphy noted that georgia was likely to ban abortion if the supreme court as expected overturned a woman s right to end a pregnancy providing even more reason for producers and directors to look for alternatives outside of that state georgia is going the wrong way on the values that are dear to a lot of the talent and the people behind the talent murphy said it has been decades since the neighborhood around the housing complex seth boyden court was considered a desirable place to live construction officials said one challenge during the demolition had been relocating the roughly 20 homeless people who returned nightly to the complex s buildings vacant since 2015 but its location a baseball throw away from the airport and less than 15 miles from new york city is ideal for the actors directors and crew members who will eventually work at lionsgate newark halmi said a lot of the talent live in manhattan he said a lot of the talent want to sleep in manhattan in addition to the movie studios the city has authorized a separate company boraie development to build 200 units of housing for older people on 4 acres of the site and as many as 200 market rate apartments nearby victor cirilo director of newark s housing authority said we think that we re really going to be able to bring this neighborhood back to life cirilo said newark s downtown has been booming for years but neighborhoods farther from the city s corporate heart like the dayton street area where the studios are planned continue to struggle in addition to the hoped for influx of money the new facility in conjunction with the arts center is expected to offer internships and educational programming to city students bill good a senior organizer with the greater newark hud tenants coalition said projects like lionsgate newark that are shiny and brand new often ignore the true needs of the current residents of newark developers he said should be required to replicate the same number of low income housing units lost when seth boyden closed 530 newark is in desperate need of low income housing good said it should be one for one replacement he stressed that he was not opposed to development or the new jobs the project could generate but said that preserving low income housing was equally vital an economic impact study done for the performing arts center estimated that lionsgate newark would create 500 to 600 permanent on site jobs and bring as much as 800 million in economic activity much of the direct spending is likely to be spent outside of new jersey initially the analysis by jll a real estate services company found but newark and essex county new jersey could over time develop the cottage industries needed to retain a portion of that financial boon leading to an estimated 180 million in state tax revenue over 20 years according to the report at least some of the new jobs will be for production assistants entry level workers hustling to break in to a notoriously competitive business over the last two years jody brockway a former vice president of movies and miniseries at nbc who now runs p a bootcamp a job training company has led seven weekend long classes for would be production assistants in new jersey often in advance of large shoots you work your way in and work your way up brockway said the pay is low but can lead to more permanent jobs either producing future shows or in the vast array of ancillary businesses once you have a studio she said now you re building sets now you re hiring carpenters you re hiring painters you re hiring people to wire everything baraka who grew up on the other side of nearby weequahic park said he expected the project to invigorate an overlooked corner of the city bringing a project of this magnitude into newark is a monumental victory he said this article originally appeared in with a made for television flourish newark mayor ras baraka climbed into an excavator earlier this year and

soundstages will each be at least 20 000 square feet a size considered large enough to lure business from popular production hubs in georgia new mexico and california that has been new jersey gov philip d murphy s goal for years he traveled to california in 2019 to generate interest in new jersey among hollywood leaders two years later he signed a law that offered corporations that relocate or expand in new jersey 14 billion in tax breaks the legislation significantly increased the pool of tax cuts available through 2034 to companies that build studios or film in the state last spring after georgia passed a law restricting voter access the governor openly tried to poach production business away from georgia when activists were calling for companies like netflix disney and warner bros to boycott studios there more recently murphy noted that georgia was likely to ban abortion if the supreme court as expected overturned a woman s right to end a pregnancy providing even more reason for producers and directors to look for alternatives outside of that state georgia is going the wrong way on the values that are dear to a lot of the talent and the people behind the talent murphy said it has been decades since the neighborhood around the housing complex seth boyden court was considered a desirable place to live construction officials said one challenge during the demolition had been relocating the roughly 20 homeless people who returned nightly to the complex s buildings vacant since 2015 but its location a baseball throw away from the airport and less than 15 miles from new york city is ideal for the actors directors and crew members who will eventually work at lionsgate newark halmi said a lot of the talent live in manhattan he said a lot of the talent want to sleep in manhattan in addition to the movie studios the city has authorized a separate company boraie development to build 200 units of housing for older people on 4 acres of the site and as many as 200 market rate apartments nearby victor cirilo director of newark s housing authority said we think that we re really going to be able to bring this neighborhood back to life cirilo said newark s downtown has been booming for years but neighborhoods farther from the city s corporate heart like the dayton street area where the studios are planned continue to struggle in addition to the hoped for influx of money the new facility in conjunction with the arts center is expected to offer internships and educational programming to city students bill good a senior organizer with the greater newark hud tenants coalition said projects like lionsgate newark that are shiny and brand new often ignore the true needs of the current residents of newark developers he said should be required to replicate the same number of low income housing units lost when seth boyden closed 530 newark is in desperate need of low income housing good said it should be one for one replacement he stressed that he was not opposed to development or the new jobs the project could generate but said that preserving low income housing was equally vital an economic impact study done for the performing arts center estimated that lionsgate newark would create 500 to 600 permanent on site jobs and bring as much as 800 million in economic activity much of the direct spending is likely to be spent outside of new jersey initially the analysis by jll a real estate services company found but newark and essex county new jersey could over time develop the cottage industries needed to retain a portion of that financial boon leading to an estimated 180 million in state tax revenue over 20 years according to the report at least some of the new jobs will be for production assistants entry level workers hustling to break in to a notoriously competitive business over the last two years jody brockway a former vice president of movies and miniseries at nbc who now runs p a bootcamp a job training company has led seven weekend long classes for would be production assistants in new jersey often in advance of large shoots you work your way in and work your way up brockway said the pay is low but can lead to more permanent jobs either producing future shows or in the vast array of ancillary businesses once you have a studio she said now you re building sets now you re hiring carpenters you re hiring painters you re hiring people to wire everything baraka who grew up on the other side of nearby weequahic park said he expected the project to invigorate an overlooked corner of the city bringing a project of this magnitude into newark is a monumental victory he said this article originally appeared in the new york times
new york ny blue chip treasures from one of manhattan s most acrimonious billionaire divorces on monday night helped sotheby s achieve what it called a record total sale for a private collection of art at auction 922 million with fees sotheby s sold its second cache of trophy name modern and contemporary works owned by real estate magnate harry macklowe and his former wife linda an honorary trustee of the metropolitan museum of art for 246 1 million the first installment of the sale in november raised 676 1 million from 35 lots topped by works by mark rothko 82 5 million and alberto giacometti 78 4 million as is the nature of sequels the second macklowe sale comprising 30 lots wasn t quite in that league but works by rothko at 48 million gerhard richter at 30 2 million and andy warhol at 18 7 million pushed the final total which sotheby s said eclipsed the sale of the peggy and david rockefeller collection in 2018 for 835 1 million before inflation at christie s monday s sale estimated to raise at least 168 million kick started the second of two weeks of marquee auctions of modern and contemporary art there were a few noteworthy lots that exceeded expectations such as a 1961 orange and yellow de kooning that sold for 17 8 million over a high estimate of 10 million and sigmar polke s the copyist which sold for 6 million over a high estimate of 4 million either art is one of the few assets that seem to have a good immunological protection against recession or inflation is much stronger than we think said loic gouzer a former prominent christie s specialist the art market feels very close to the spare parts market good works are hard to find and very expensive for more than 50 years the macklowes had acquired prime examples of works by canonical white male artists such as warhol richter rothko and cy twombly traditionally viewed as blue chip investments more recently however much of the energy and money in the market has shifted toward younger emerging names particularly female artists and artists of color we ve been thinking about where we are with white male artists said suzanne gyorgy global head of citi private bank art advisory and finance then the macklowe sale came along and did extraordinarily well also on artdaily impressive results for moore chagall and nakashima in back to back freeman s auctions gyorgy said the macklowe sale showed there was still plenty of demand for works by museum validated names provided they were of a plus quality there are collectors out there who want the best of the best and are still upgrading their

by the feuding couple s inability to agree how to divide their holdings justice laura drager of new york supreme court decided that the collection then valued at more than 700 million should be sold

passion she had hoped to keep the major pieces of art but because most of their assets were tied up in the art collection that proved impossible linda macklowe s incomparable eye was on display again
