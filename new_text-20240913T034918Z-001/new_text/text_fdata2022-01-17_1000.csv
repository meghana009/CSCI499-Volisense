the decision by provincial governments across the country to reopen schools to in person learning amid a tsunami of omicron infections is criminally reckless and must be resisted the cross canada educators rank and file safety committee cersc urges all educators support staff students and parents to organize mass walkouts and strike action to close schools immediately as part of a global covid 19 elimination strategy to save lives educators across canada must take their place in the global eruption of opposition to the ruling class policy of mass infection and death thousands of teachers and students in the united states have refused to return to school since the beginning of the new year with job actions and major protests in cities like chicago new york oakland california and detroit in france a nationwide teachers strike opposing the right wing macron government s policy of letting the virus run rampant took place last thursday hundreds of thousands of teachers in france joined last thursdays national strike against the right wing macron government s ruinous mishandling of the pandemic pictured above parents teachers and students demonstrate outside a suburban paris hospital with banners that read covid at school equals hospitalized parents left and overcrowded classes equals saturated hospitals right ap photo michel euler these struggles arise amid unprecedented levels of infection and hospitalizations case numbers and hospitalizations in every canadian province have reached or will soon reach record levels the number of daily deaths is rapidly rising towards their previous peaks even though the vast majority of people have received vaccinations globally around 15 million people are getting infected every week in reopening schools under these life threatening conditions governments are prioritizing corporate profits over human lives the trudeau federal government which fully supports the back to school drive and the provincial governments see schools not as facilities to educate young people but as warehouses to detain them so that their parents can be freed up to go to work generating corporate profits for big business and the super rich faced with the choice of letting millions get infected by a potentially deadly disease or adopting lifesaving lockdowns that would interrupt the flow of cash into the bank accounts of the major corporations and the stock market canadian governments at all levels prefer mass infection and death this is the only conclusion one can draw from reviewing the school reopening rules in british columbia alberta ontario and quebec they include provisions to merge classes into groups of up to 50 or 60 to compensate for mass staff absences to ask untrained parents to keep an eye on students and to stop reporting school infections to parents never mind the public at large quebec even refuses to give teachers n95 masks which are critical to prevent airborne transmission if there is anything more contemptible than the politicians and media talking heads advocating this strategy with lies about omicron being mild and schools not being vectors of covid transmission it is the trade union bureaucrats ridiculous claims that in person learning can be made safe amid a raging pandemic no education union has opposed the return to class across canada and organized opposition to the back to school campaign instead they have complained that governments did not involve them enough in drafting the rules that will guarantee mass infection the hospitalization of thousands of students and educators and the deaths of many of their own members throughout the pandemic they have sabotaged every attempt by education workers and parents to fight for workplace safety and a zero covid policy hundreds of thousands of educators parents and working people across the country are rightly outraged by the total indifference shown by the political establishment for the wellbeing of teachers who are supposed to prepare our young people to contribute to society and the youth our hope for a better future but merely complaining about the irresponsibility of the pro big business politicians and their union lackeys is insufficient if the looming catastrophe is to be averted the ruling elite has a consciously worked out policy which is to let everybody get infected to protect bay street and the corporate elite s bottom line this policy has already officially claimed the lives of over 31 000 canadians the working class must respond with a no less thoroughly worked out policy that gives unconditional priority to its interests for the protection of workers health and very lives and an end to the pandemic over any and all economic considerations this must begin with the understanding that only a mass worker led movement can force the immediate closure of schools and all nonessential production as part of a comprehensive plan of public health measures to suppress transmission of the virus and bring cases down to zero this movement should fight for workers to be paid full wages by the pandemic profiteers throughout a lockdown of two to three months which scientists have shown would suffice to suppress all covid 19 infections the virus is a global problem which is why educators in canada must unify their struggle with their colleagues in the us europe and around the world by building the international workers alliance of rank and file committees they must also recognize that ending covid 19 is above all a political rather than a medical problem scientists have a clear understanding of the public health measures needed to suppress the virus and avoid thousands more preventable deaths but their implementation conflicts with the capitalist profit system and the interests of its political representatives to wage this political struggle educators need their own organizations built independently of and in opposition to the pro capitalist unions the cersc calls for the establishment of rank and file safety committees in every school university and college to organize mass strikes to halt in person learning and fight for a global program of covid 19 elimination we pledge to do all we can to assist educators and school support staff to build such committees and encourage everyone wishing to take up this urgent fight to contact us today by emailing

the dynamic us equity duse story officially begins in 1989 however its origins date back to the 1970s bill fouse and tom loeb the two co founders of mellon capital predecessor firm prior to joining newton investment management pioneered the practical application of economic theory and are credited with creating the first equity index strategy in the mid 1980s mellon capital also developed expertise in global tactical asset allocation gtaa and calculating valuations or premia for global stock and bond indices duse was an outgrowth of these competencies the catalyst came from an index client that had grown disenchanted with traditional active equity management and asked if there was an alternative method to generate alpha the challenge then as it is now was to produce an excess return over the s p 500 utilizing asset allocation concepts while maintaining a similar level of market risk duse sought to utilize the market structure as highlighted by the capital asset pricing model capm to generate excess returns conceptually the idea was to blend index exposures in the s p 500 stocks long us treasuries bonds and cash while also allowing for modest leverage we believed the approach would generate more consistent returns over the s p 500 than was possible with traditional active strategies that rely on stock picking modern portfolio theory in practice the investment process relies on forward looking asset premia risk and correlations to determine the optimal allocation to stocks bonds and cash and the appropriate level of leverage the first question we ask is are stocks attractive the second question is are stocks attractive relative to bonds if the answer to both questions is yes we overweight stocks usually 15 20 next we blend in an allocation to bonds and cash for diversification and additional sources of alpha put succinctly the process encompasses our proprietary expected return calculation for stocks bonds and cash asset premia our proprietary expected risk calculation for each asset class and their correlations mean variance optimization to arrive at the optimal allocation highest sharpe ratio the optimal portfolio is the ideal blend of stocks bonds cash that offers the highest return per unit of risk in the illustration below this optimal portfolio lies on the efficient frontier at the point of tangency 1 the tangent portfolio however has a notable limitation in that both the expected return and risk are typically lower than a 100 stock portfolio given duse s objective to outperform stocks this limitation would be a non starter this is where leverage comes in by allowing a modest amount of leverage we can move up the capital market line 2 the straight line connecting cash and the point of tangency to construct a portfolio that has a similar risk as stocks but also offers the opportunity for excess returns above stocks sample efficient frontier leverage in duse is modest the leverage is used prudently to move up the capital market line when risky assets stocks and bonds are attractive or underpriced we allow up to 50 leverage and often do not use the full amount furthermore leverage is obtained through listed and exchange traded index futures and index option contracts 3 there is no direct borrowing finally the equity leverage is implemented through s p 500 options only thus during a market correction the options reduce the equity overweight as the options exposure shrinks to zero nonetheless for some investors the use of leverage understandably conjures up nightmares of outsized losses duse s intelligent design and multi tiered risk control have yielded robust downside protection over its 32 year live history the strategy s risk mitigation factors include tail risk mitigation through use of options multiple risk models employing fundamental macro and credit market data long us treasury bonds as a defensive hedge extensive scenario analysis stress testing over its full history duse has produced a compelling 90 down capture versus a 106 up capture when launched in 1989 most agreed that duse was an innovative yet unconventional approach today interestingly not much has changed in harmony with its design based on sound and well recognized financial theory the return stream has exhibited low correlation to more traditional active approaches that engage in security selection or factor tilts at the end of the day investors care about alpha and duse has delivered since its launch in september 1989 the strategy has produced an annualized alpha net of fees of 2 8 moreover the realized returns and risk over this period resemble the conceptual diagram of the capm diagram shown above proof statement past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results

gips in the back of this presentation see additional information in disclosure statements while duse was originally designed to outperform the s p 500 through client demand we continue to expand the dynamic equity platform to include other equity markets the requirements to expand duse to additional equity indexes are fairly basic we must be able to evaluate the premium of the underlying equity market e g using consensus earnings estimates and company level fundamentals determine the risk and correlation profile have access to a reasonably liquid futures market and be able to buy options for leverage and tail risk protection today the dynamic equity platform covers a wide spectrum of equity markets including global equities style indexes value and growth and most recently us small cap stocks we can also implement dynamic equity as a pure overlay effectively porting the excess return stream over any market exposure with over usd 18 billion in assets under management as of august 31 2021 the dynamic equity platform is gaining traction in the marketplace as investors search for reliable and uncorrelated alpha that can be deployed at scale finally we must recognise the implications that digitalisation has on sustainability the consideration of environmental social and governance esg factors can be a useful tool to achieve a more holistic picture of companies there are various esg issues that are prevalent in the technology sector in particular around social media cyber security and as mentioned data privacy in addition many of the large technology companies have voting structures that can be detrimental to shareholders all of these risks must be monitored we look for businesses that will survive and thrive for not just the next few years but for the next few decades and the focus on sustainability has led to new business opportunities a good example of this is a global leader in industrial software the company essentially creates a digital representation of a physical asset for industrial businesses this virtual model is able to study the asset and suggest potential improvements thereby improving the efficiency of industrial processes not only does this

the oil sector has been hogging the investment limelight after a spectacular recovery that has set the sector as one of the top performers in 2021 however it s natural gas bulls who have been having a real ball with natural gas trading at their highest levels since 2014 outpacing oil and many other commodities the natural gas sector is off to another good start with natural gas prices henry hub up 20 to 4 19 mmbtu since the beginning of the year thanks to robust demand natural gas prices have popped nearly 10 over the past few days after updated weather forecasts called for freezing temps in the northeast for the duration of january the forecast comes on the back of winter storms hitting the east coast over the weekend driving algonquin city gate nat gas prices as high as 24 mmbtu many new england states have turned to burning oil to keep grids operational through inclement weather due to their limited access to domestic gas supplies the heating demand outlook for eastern third of the u s has strengthened materially for this weekend and for the last week of january again capital s john kilduff has said last week the u s energy information administration eia on thursday reported a pull of 179 bcf natural gas from underground inventories for the week ended jan 7 the largest inventory draw so far this winter low temperatures and high natural gas prices are a boon to majors like royal dutch shell nyse rds a and bp plc nyse bp who produce liquified natural gas in trinidad and sell into the new england market meanwhile domestic natural gas producer anterocorp nyse ar was recently upgraded to buy at bmo as discounted valuation and rising natural gas prices are expected to drive shares 50 higher while chesapeake nasdaq chk was recently initiated buy at baml with 30 upside wood mackenzie has released its global gas and lng 2022 report here are some of its interesting predictions 1 prices to fall if nord stream 2 is commissioned a severe shortage of natural gas declining wind power output nuclear outages and cold weather have conspired to hand europe one of its worst energy crises on record yet europe s energy woes keep getting worse at every turn european natural gas prices hit a new record high on tuesday after a pipeline that brings russian gas to germany switched flows to the east while u s ships carrying liquefied natural gas lng destined for the european market are diverting to asia where prices are even higher westward gas flows through the 2 607 mile long yamal europe pipeline one of the major routes for russian gas to europe have been gradually falling since but have lately reversed direction a move the kremlin says has no political implications related a copper crisis threatens the energy transition some western politicians contend that russia is using its natural gas as a weapon in the political tussle tied to ukraine as well as delays in the certification of another controversial pipeline nord stream 2 russia of course has denied any connection there is absolutely no connection to nord stream 2 this is a purely commercial situation kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call on tuesday the nord stream project aims to establish a reliable supply of russian natural gas to central europe to do this the gazprom owned nord stream company would connect russia to germany via pipelines running through the baltic sea several eu nations have objected to the pipeline seeing it as against the organization s interests woodmac says that at current levels of russian exports and considering normal weather conditions european storage inventories will fall below 15 billion cubic meters bcm by the end of march a record low prices will eventually come down as the winter is through but requirements to refill storage facilities will be high some 20 25 bcm more than last year the commissioning of nord stream 2 might well be the only option to refill storage and avoid a repeat of last year s winter crisis normal winter weather including in asia and visibility on nord stream 2 commissioning would push prices down although demand for storage and high carbon prices will maintain prices above us 15 per metric million british thermal units mmbtu but a cold winter in europe and asia alongside continued uncertainty about commissioning of nord stream 2 could see prices increase further throughout 2022 get ready for another bumpy year ahead 2 global gas demand will remain resilient woodmac says natural gas demand is likely to remain resilient in the short term with signs of demand destruction limited so far lng demand in asia has continued to increase as most supply is priced at legacy oil indexed contracts currently trading at half the value of asian lng spot prices the prospects are less bright in the european market with gas demand in industry and power down 4 since the summer compared to the past five years but woodmac vice president massimo di odoardo says that eventually higher prices will put pressure on demand for instance in asia the rationale to switch from coal to gas will diminish as higher spot lng prices will translate into higher oil indexed contract prices meanwhile investment in renewables and batteries is likely to continue increasing limiting the headroom for gas demand to grow policymakers in europe will look to accelerate the shift away from natural gas as the recent eu proposal to support biomethane and hydrogen suggests 3 more lng projects advertisement wood mackenzie has predicted that lng projects will continue seeing plenty of momentum as lng prices are expected to be structurally higher and oil indexation on the rise the analyst expects 79 million tonnes per annum mmtpa of additional lng to take the final investment decision fid over the next two years including 33 mmtpa in north america 16 mmtpa in qatar and 20 mmtpa in russia woodmac notes that the oil majors have so far remained on the sidelines but some action is likely in 2022with several expected to conclude negotiations with qatarenergy to secure a slice of the north field east development totalenergies nyse tte might well acquire a share of novatek s arctic lng 1 project similar to what it did at arctic 2 and yamal and it is also possible that the majors will continue to secure offtake deals with third party projects in north america on both the eastern and western seaboards woodmac says that natural gas will continue being a pillar of oil majors energy transition strategies but their optionality for investments in brownfield and greenfield equity projects remains limited for now by alex kimani for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

how the 25 wealthiest americans can pay little to no federal income taxes the world s 10 richest billionaires have doubled their wealth since the covid 19 pandemic started in early 2020 with inequality now reaching outrageous levels according to anti poverty charity oxfam at the same time the bottom 99 of humanity including middle and lower income households lost income during the crisis due to layoffs economic uncertainty and increased caretaking due to closed schools and illnesses caused by covid 19 the group said in a new report women and people of color are among those who bore the brunt of the economic impact of the crisis the study noted the world s 10 richest men saw their wealth double from 700 billion to 1 5 trillion during the pandemic a rate of 15 000 per second oxfam said nine of the 10 are americans including tech titans such as tesla founder elon musk and amazon founder jeff bezos who are worth 264 billion and 187 billion respectively the stock market s strong performance during the pandemic with equities hitting record highs in recent weeks has helped buoy the fortunes of the nation s richest people the gap between the rich and the poor was increasing even before the pandemic started said irit tamir director of oxfam s private sector development but the pandemic supercharged this in a whole host of ways in oxfam s view rising inequality poses risks to billions of people across the world who aren t sharing in the same gains in wealth and may be cut off from equal access to health care vaccines and economic opportunity inequality between rich and poor countries is expected to grow for the first time in a generation oxfam said with poor countries facing higher death rates from covid 19 due to lack of vaccine access we are in an even more outrageous situation than we were last year or the year before tamir said oxfam is releasing the report to coincide with the world economic forum s davos conference which will be virtual this year the group s annual report has long highlighted widening inequality yet those trends have only accelerated in recent years it s not only the nation s billionaires that have enjoyed huge growth in their fortunes the number of households in the u s with wealth of more than 50 million surged more than 70 to 63 505 from 2016 to 2021 oxfam found their combined wealth jumped more than 50 to 12 8 trillion wealth is begetting wealth and it becomes exponential tamir said i fear by next year those numbers will only continue to increase and that gap will only widen a new gilded age the widening gap between the richest americans and everyone else has been well documented prompting some lawmakers to propose a wealth tax that would impact the nation s billionaires yet the proposal has stalled even as 6 in 10 americans say they believe the rich don t pay enough in taxes according to pew the globe s 2 750 billionaires are now wealthier than half the planet according to a recent report from a group founded by economist thomas piketty the wealth gap is roughly as wide as it was more than a century ago when the gilded age led to massive disparities between rich and poor the report found although the u s is a wealthy nation overall that hasn t protected the poorest americans from falling behind the poor in other nations for instance 50 of the poorest americans possess less wealth than the poorest half of china s citizens piketty s researchers found oxfam said its findings should serve as an argument for a wealth tax on billionaires with the new tax revenue invested in the health and education of children inequality isn t good for anybody it s not good for the rich either tamir said citing that the report s forward is written by disney heiress abigail disney who has become a de facto spokeswoman for higher taxes on the rich and better wages for workers in the forward disney wrote that she believes inequality is widening after years of weakened support for unions and changes in regulations that were meant to protect ordinary americans lawmakers have cut taxes on the richest earners since the 1980s with the idea they would use the extra income to create jobs and economic opportunity yet research has found that hasn t happened and the tax cuts only helped the rich society was riddled with cracks when we started this pandemic cracks which have widened into fault lines disney wrote there is more than enough money to solve most of the world s problems it s just being held in the hands of millionaires and billionaires who aren t paying their fair share

neoliberalism buried in its own cradle where it came from â chile chile buries its own brainchild â neoliberalism chile is revisiting the plan which was conceived by salvador allende but then trampled as a result of the us instigated coup gabriel boric brings hope back to chile chile has held landmark presidential elections the country of salvador allende pablo neruda luis corvalan and victor jara the symbols of the revolution of the 1970s returns with the election of president gabriel boric boric is only 36 years old but he has defeated not only the followers of dictator augusto pinochet but also the pseudo socialists from the socialist party who would always be opposed to the right while walking the path of anti popular neoliberalism his rival was jose antonio kast the son of a wehrmacht soldier who had fled germany in the post war years according to kast there was no coup d etat in 1973 it was the people who got allende out boric won eleven percent of the vote against his opponent in the second round gaining 55 87 percent of the vote kast gained 44 13 percent of the vote and his 3 65 million supporters show that boric will have a hard time proving that chile was bidding a farewell to the pinochet regime in one of his speeches chile s new leader said that the country was the grave of neoliberalism and pledged to tax the rich chile as a laboratory of neoliberalism latin america has become a test ground for chicago boys chile was one of the first that got to taste the free market after pinochet s bloody regime came to power the country abandoned principles of state economic planning as it could allegedly take the nation to totalitarianism chile also rejected the state social security system including the pension system chile s private pension funds belong to us companies all natural resources were privatized chile is the only country in the world that has privatized water sources however taxation for multinational i e american companies was super soft the dismantling of the state and its withdrawal from the social sphere contributed to the growth of the gap between the richest and the poorest according to the oecd organization for economic co operation and development chile has the worst income and wealth taxes in the world during the covid 19 pandemic chile had to face a plethora of difficulties in terms of decrease in the income of the population omnipresent unemployment inability to recover at public expense two million strong protests in 2019 a new generation of politicians has come to the fore they have formed the i approve dignity coalition the main forces of which are the broad front movement and the chilean communist party what boric offers boric proposes a tax reform that will increase the tax burden for the super rich by collecting an additional five percent of gdp it will be used to expand the participation of the state in providing social security to the population in addition a progressive income tax is introduced the burden of tax collection is put on the vat which will be increased exemptions and subsidies for fuel and other sectors such as stock trading will be lifted licensing fees will be introduced in mining the most lucrative sector of the chilean economy the national development bank will be created a state owned lithium company will be established a network of private medical companies will be abolished to create a universal health care system the development of public schools and housing was announced globalists are not going to like the new chile thus the new president is going to terminate the long 48 year reign of the fascist pinochet regime which has given chile s economy and natural resources to the mercy of globalist companies the president will have to lead the creation of a new constitution the work on which began following a referendum in october 2020 the referendum confirmed the desire of the majority of the population to bury the 1990 magna carta written by the pinochet regime the agreement on a new redistribution of power is not going to come easy the left have a simple majority in parliament and globalists own and control the country s wealth they will resist a situation in which as boric put it hope defeated fear fits into a series of significant changes in chile the backyard of the united states the state of affairs in latin america after the fall of leftist governments in brazil argentina bolivia and so on has been gradually changing in the opposite direction the victories of alberto fernandez in argentina pedro castillo in peru xiomara castro in honduras luis arce in bolivia show that the leftist forces are coming back to power on the continent to displace the dominance of the united states washington may have to pay more attention to its own borders rather than to the borders in eastern europe

carter was the son of john carter and elizabeth hill carter and grandson of robert king carter he was born in 1732 probably at shirley the charles city county plantation where his parents lived while his father was secretary of the colony and a member of the governor s council carter s father died in july 1742 and several years later his mother married bowler cocke who moved from henrico county to shirley plantation carter was educated at the gloucester county grammar school of william yates a clergyman who later briefly served as president of the college of william and mary and at the college he then assumed management of corotoman the lancaster county plantation that he had inherited from his father carter resided there for two decades and supervised that and his other properties on the northern neck and elsewhere he purchased nanzatico a 2 200 acre king george county plantation from his financially strapped cousin charles carter following the deaths of his mother and bowler cocke in 1771 carter made extensive repairs and renovations to the main house at shirley and moved there permanently about 1775 carter s success as a planter and entrepreneur made him one of the wealthiest men in virginia at the time of his death in 1806 his will enumerated more than 13 000 acres in thirteen virginia counties and at least 710 slaves in addition to his extensive landholdings carter operated a large mill near corotoman lent substantial sums of money to other planters and provided in his will for investing some assets in bank stocks or similar securities he was also a sometime administrator and trustee of the complicated estate left by his brother in law the councillor william byrd 1728 1777 although carter s uncle landon carter characterized him as an inefficient plantation manager the uncle s pessimistic frame of mind and negative assessments of nearly everyone suggest that the criticism was overstated carter became a justice of the peace in lancaster county on july 17 1761 and served until he moved to charles city county he was aof christ church parish for several years before leaving lancaster county and on the eve of the revolution he was a member of the board of visitors of the college of william and mary carter served in the house of burgesses representing lancaster county continuously from 1758 until the revolution he gradually emerged late in the 1760s as a reasonably responsible member who was routinely appointed to the committees on privileges and on propositions and grievances and for religion throughout the imperial crises of the 1760s and early 1770s carter supported virginia protests of parliamentary measures lancaster freeholders elected him to the county committee in february 1775 and to the revolutionary conventions that met in august 1774 and in march july and december 1775 in september 1775 he angered landon carter by endorsing nonimportation of british goods but opposing the termination of exportation to great britain and its caribbean colonies he argued that exports were needed to provide money for the war and to enable virginians to pay their debts although carter was not elected in april 1776 to the fifth and final revolutionary convention probably because by then he had moved to shirley on june 29 1776 that convention elected him to the council of state he declined the appointment and never took the oath of office sometime in the mid 1750s carter married his first cousin mary walker carter daughter of charles carter who represented king george county in the house of burgesses for many years they had two daughters and six sons including one set of twins before her death on january 30 1770 late in november of that year he married ann butler moore of their eight daughters and seven sons four children died in infancy and one was stillborn as had been the case in his generation and the generations of his parents and grandparents nearly all of the carter children who lived to adulthood married into respected virginia families the best known example was the marriage in 1793 of his and ann butler moore carter s eldest daughter ann hill carter to henry light horse harry lee carter remained active in the affairs of the church and attended annual episcopal church conferences in virginia from 1789 to 1793 as a lay delegate from westover parish carter died at shirley on june 28 1806 his will directed that he be buried near the bodies of his parents probably at shirley or in the graveyard of the westover parish church without any funeral pomp and nothing but the burial service be read over my grave by the parson of the parish should we be so fortunate as to have one among us

mergers and acquisitions involving japanese firms hit a high of 4 280 in 2021 as companies moved to invest in growth areas in hopes of overcoming changes in the business environment caused by global warming and the covid 19 pandemic according to preliminary data the trend underlines efforts among corporations to streamline their operations due to the global health crisis along with an overall shift to decarbonization according to recof corp a leading m a advisory company which collated m a data from publicly available information the figure for m as in 2021 was up 550 or 14 7 percent from the previous year and exceeded the previous record set in 2019 though the pace of deal making initially started off sporadically the yearly total turned out to be highest ever due to a spike in companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint restaurant operators and travel agency operators which both were especially hard hit by the pandemic also resorted to m as while many large corporations sold off subsidiaries to offset shrinking domestic customer demand businesses that excel in state of the art technologies to promote digital transformation were purchased companies also moved to improve their organizational structures to respond to new listing standards for the tokyo stock exchange that are scheduled to take effect from april the start of the new fiscal year management is increasingly pressed to adopt tactics that are more appealing to shareholders noted yuko yoshitomi president of recof data corp a recof group company responsible for data analysis the tendency for firms to rely on m as to sell off unprofitable sectors and for other reasons seems destined to continue decarbonization health crisis according to recof m a transactions totaled 16 484

the huge carbon footprint associated with asphalt mixture production as a pressing business challenge eneos is also expected to relinquish jx nippon exploration and production u k ltd a london based affiliated company involved in crude oil production in north sea oilfields for 190 billion yen eneos likewise has it sights set on acquiring japan renewable energy corp for 200 billion yen as the latter plays a leading role in providing electricity generated from solar power and other kinds of renewable energy eneos is urgently shedding its oil related businesses because it expects domestic oil demand to halve by no later than 2040 as electric vehicles by then are expected to replace those powered by gasoline engines japan petroleum exploration co japex has also exited from its shale gas

via mergers and acquisitions mitsubishi chemical holdings corp the nation s largest chemical company announced in december it will separate its petroleum chemistry and carbon divisions by as early as fiscal 2023 the petrochemistry department deals in ethylene and other plastic materials whereas the carbon section mainly manufactures coke for use in steel production both sectors handle important base materials and play key roles in mitsubishi chemical the company s domestic petrochemistry department which is based in the mizushima district of okayama prefecture and ibaraki prefecture s kashima region produces 733 000 tons of ethylene annually one of the highest outputs among all such enterprises in japan although mitsubishi chemical has long underpinned japan s heavy and chemical industry it is no longer price competitive in the international market major capital investments will become unavoidable amid global moves toward decarbonization given the huge volume of carbon dioxide generated in production processes say experts who note that the carbon business faces the same challenges as the petrochemistry sector for that reason mitsubishi chemical is planning to concentrate its resources on high growth businesses for example it decided to expand its acrylic resin division although acrylic resin uses petroleum as an ingredient the material has applications in things like liquid crystal screens mitsubishi chemical boasts an exclusive production technique for acrylic and holds a 40 percent share in the global market jean marc gilson president of mitsubishi chemical told a news conference in december that business integration and reorganization in japan s petrochemistry and carbon communities will be inevitable as the industry leader he promised mitsubishi chemical will take the initiative in such reform this article was written by satoshi shinden and takuro chiba

us listed chinese companies and unlisted domestic enterprises make a beeline for hk the new year is truly in and has presented a new dilemma or two to capital hunting chinese firms to list or not to list and if the decision is to list will an overseas float produce a bigger bang for the buck or a domestic public issue and those already listed overseas have another issue to contend with should they delist and make a fresh ipo back home ever since ride hailing giant didi s fortunes suddenly reversed last year more and more companies are finding themselves on the horns of a similar ipo dilemma didi s ipo on the new york stock exchange on june 30 pulled in over 4 billion the highest amount raised by any chinese internet driven company in 2021 and the second largest ipo of all us listed chinese companies next only to alibaba s 21 8 billion on the nyse in september 2014 however on dec 3 didi announced it will delist from the nyse and start preparations for a float on the hong kong stock exchange instead the souring environment in the us stock market has been one of the reasons for didi s heading home a day before didi s delisting announcement the us securities and exchange commission adopted final amendments to its rules implementing the holding foreign companies accountable act of 2020 under the revised version us listed companies will have to get their audit reports inspected by us regulators and abide by more local accounting rules otherwise they will be delisted from the us exchanges in three years a company s audit reports include all the work records like data on operations and capital exchanges chinese companies are now allowed to provide documents and materials related to securities activities to overseas institutions without the permission of chinese regulators of course the door is not shut for outbound chinese companies the china securities regulatory commission issued a statement on dec 24 to publicly solicit opinions on relevant systems and rules for overseas listings the country s top securities watchdog said in the statement that chinese companies are allowed to list overseas 20 days after filing the necessary documents with the csrc variable interest entity or vie structure companies that meet the compliance requirements can list overseas after the required documentation work is completed in china but the complexity and uncertainty have already cast a long dark shadow on chinese companies us listing plans in all 42 chinese companies completed us ipos in 2021 up 20 percent from the level of the covid savaged 2020 but crucially only four made their ipos in the united states in the second half of last year as per data provided by deloitte a global provider of audit consulting tax and advisory services at the same time hong kong emerged as the preferred destination of ipo bound chinese firms five of the top 10 ipos in hong kong last year were by chinese companies that were hitherto listed in the us these firms and unicorn companies accounted for over 90 percent of the top 10 ipo proceeds according to ey another global provider of audit consulting tax and advisory services given that the going is no longer smooth for us listed chinese companies their return to china may be a major theme in hong kong ipos this year stock market insiders said according to david chin china country head at ubs a swiss financial services giant there are about 240 chinese companies listed in the us at present their total market capitalization could be around hk 9 2 trillion 1 44 trillion some 17 of these have already completed their secondary listing in hong kong accounting for 69 percent of the hk 9 2 trillion mentioned earlier in this sense the challenge facing us listed chinese companies has been addressed to a great extent meanwhile there are another 50 companies that have not been listed in hong kong but meet the requirements to go public in the city said chin these companies account for another 30 percent of the hk 9 2 trillion market cap they may choose to float on the hong kong bourse this year if they do that would mark the easiest and possibly the smoothest transition these companies could take considering the us regulators hardening stance he said for the rest 170 us listed chinese companies which account for less than 2 percent of the total market cap of their kind they do not meet the listing rules in hong kong for the time being chin said there are two possible ways out for such companies they can either hope for the hong kong bourse loosening its listing policies this year or delist in the first place and restructure later so that only part of their business can be listed in hong kong or the star market of the shanghai bourse felix fei ey assurance partner said new economy companies in the tmt technology media and telecom biotechnology and healthcare sectors will likely be the main players seeking hong kong ipos this year in anticipation of the return of some us listed chinese companies they will also become the driver of the hong kong s economy next year he said in an interview with reuters in late december gordon tsang partner of the hong kong based stevenson wong co law firm said the third and fourth quarters of this year will witness the highest number of returns of us listed chinese companies to the hong kong stock exchange or the chinese mainland s a share market in a sense the way has been paved already for the return of overseas listed chinese companies secondary listing regulations were revised in hong kong in november the stock exchange of hong kong ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of hong kong exchanges and clearing ltd operator of the hong kong bourse said in an announcement that non innovative companies without a weighted voting rights structure will be allowed to have secondary listings in hong kong the minimum market cap for a secondary listing in hong kong has also been lowered under the revised regime which took effect on jan 1 chinese issuers without a wvr structure can seek a secondary offering if their market cap reaches hk 3 billion with a track record of good regulatory compliance for five full financial years on a qualifying exchange such as the nasdaq for those with a market cap of at least hk 10 billion the compliance period will be shortened to two full financial years prior to the revised policies such secondary listing applicants to the hong kong exchange were required to ensure their respective market cap reached hk 40 billion at the time of listing if not a minimum market cap of hk 10 billion combined with a minimum hk 1 billion of revenue for the most recent audited financial year sufficed james wang head of equity capital market for goldman sachs in asia ex japan said that hong kong has a large base of international investors and issuers the wave of returning us listed chinese companies will rise in hong kong in the coming months while more and more chinese companies will also seek ipos in hong kong but they would face challenges on their way for instance the less than stellar record of the hong kong bourse in 2021 is causing concern to ipo aspirants market insiders said the exchange recorded 94 ipos last year with total financing coming to hk 323 7 billion according to ey the two key local gauges fell 35 percent and 19 percent year on year respectively the hang seng index dropped 14 percent in 2021 and the hang seng tech index touched a historic low by shedding more than 30 percent the lower liquidity of the hong kong stock exchange may delay us listed chinese companies plans to return home said lu jie head of investments for china at robeco a global asset management firm the average daily turnover of the securities market in hong kong was hk 166 7 billion last year according to data from hong kong exchanges and clearing ltd lawrence lau ey assurance partner admitted that hong kong s ipo activities will continue to develop vigorously but investors still need to keep an eye out for a few objective factors including the persisting upside risk of global inflation the potential fluctuations in overseas stock markets due to the us fed s tightening cycle process and the potential pressure on overseas capital outflows due to fed s potential cuts in government backed debt purchases and interest rate hikes china us relations and the challenges of the geopolitical landscape also add uncertainties to the investment arena lau said

henrico county va officials with henrico county public schools hcps said sunday that the district will continue to require all students staff and visitors to wear face masks following gov glenn youngkin s executive orderthat would end the statewide covid 19 mask mandate in k 12 schools beginning jan 24 officials said that masks would be required for students except during mealtime when outdoors with physical distancing or when participating in designated athletic activities hcps said mask use was a critical component of the division s layered prevention measures which reduce the spread of illness in our schools and increase the division s ability to offer in person instruction as mandated by state law in fact the school system pointed to sb 1303 which requires all public school divisions to provide such in person instruction in a manner in which it adheres to the maximum extent practicable to any currently applicable mitigation strategies for early childhood care and education programs and elementary and secondary schools to reduce the transmission of covid 19 that have been provided by the federal centers for disease control and prevention the cdc continues to recommend using masks in schools and that federal law requires the use of face coverings on school buses district officials wrote while the hcps school board and administration said that they respect that parents make decisions for their families they noted school leaders must make decisions for the collective safety of nearly 49 000 students and 10 000 employees and fulfill hcps responsibility to provide in person instruction school board chairwoman marcie shea wrote hcps takes the responsibility to support in person teaching and learning very seriously masks as part of layered mitigation strategies are currently necessary to accomplish this shea wrote my board colleagues and i will always consider the latest health guidance and data to make decisions in the best interest of the henrico community in an email sunday evening officials with chesterfield county public schools said they would will review updated guidelines from the state when they are available and then update staff and families no later than sunday jan 23 the governor has directed the superintendent of public instruction to issue guidance to school divisions the email reads chesterfield schools awaits the referenced guidance from the superintendent of public instruction rps_schools will maintain its 100 mask mandate for students staff and visitors jason kamras jasonkamras january 15 2022 richmond schools superintendent jason kamras tweeted saturday afternoon rps_schools will maintain its 100 mask mandate for students staff and visitors wtvr political analyst there s some wiggle room on masks in virginia schools dr bob holsworth a political analyst for wtvr cbs 6 said the decision to require masks will ultimately fall to local school districts says he s getting rid of all state mask mandates but local school districts still have the opportunity and the power to put their own in holsworth said in fact holsworth pointed out that almost immediately after the order was issued kamras posted on twitter his district would keep its mask mandate i think there s some wiggle room here because the governor basically admits that he s going to allow the localities to do that holsworth explained i think a lot of people who voted for him did not know that perhaps and then secondly they said they re going to try to take some action to provide what they said the schools are going to have to provide some opportunities for the parents who don t want their kids to be wearing masks but what that is is very unclear right now youngkin we said all along that we were going to stand up for parents school districts across virginia were taking stock sunday of the implications of youngkin s executive order that seeks to end mask mandates in schools with some school systems saying they will continue to require masks shortly after youngkin took office as virginia s 74th governor saturday he issued nine executive orders one of which ends the statewide covid 19 mask mandate in k 12 schools beginning jan 24 in an interview with fox news sunday youngkin said he will consider all options to preserve an opt out for parents from local school mask mandates amid resistance from some school districts and some democrats who say state law requires virginia to follow federal guidance that recommends masks in schools carl tobias a law professor of the university of richmond told the richmond times dispatch that any challenge to the governor s order will likely end up in the courts we said all along that we were going to stand up for parents youngkin said in the interview with fox news sunday in virginia it is clear under law that parents have a fundamental right to make decisions for their children s upbringing their education and their care youngkin said and so we are providing parents an opt out we re providing them the ability to make the right decision for their child with regard to their child s well being we are going to use all the authority that i have to consider all options to protect that right he said the governor s order says no parent who opts their child out of a local school mask mandate shall be required to provide a reason or make any certification concerning their child s health or education youngkin has said he is vaccinated and got a booster shot but that he opposes mandates another of his executive orders rescinds the covid vaccination requirement for state workers

for months former president donald j trump has been grumbling quietly to friends and visitors to his palm beach mansion about a rival republican power center in another florida mansion some 400 miles to the north gov ron desantis a man mr trump believes he put on the map has been acting far less like an acolyte and more like a future competitor mr trump complains with his stock rising fast in the party the governor has conspicuously refrained from saying he would stand aside if mr trump runs for the republican nomination for president in 2024 the magic words trump has said to several associates and advisers that long stewing resentment burst into public view recently in a dispute over a seemingly unrelated topic covid policies after mr desantis refused to reveal his full covid vaccination history the former president publicly acknowledged he had received a booster last week he seemed to swipe at mr desantis by blasting as gutless politicians who dodge the question out of fear of blowback from vaccine skeptics mr desantis shot back on friday criticizing mr trump s early handling of the pandemic and saying he regretted not being more vocal in his complaints

on monday as the united states recorded one million covid 19 cases three times higher than the peak of previous waves the dow jones industrial average closed up by 400 points setting a new all time record the rally continued tuesday as the us crossed another grim milestone 100 000 hospitalizations from the pandemic eclipsing the level of the surge over the summer child hospitalizations have also reached an all time high throughout 2021 as 478 000 americans died the dow logged 70 closing records in its third straight year of annual double digit increases if you looked at new all time highs last year one trader told yahoo finance there were actually more new all time highs than in the entire 70s and 2000s combined those two decades and just as deaths were higher in 2021 than in 2020 so were returns on the stock market the dow rose 18 percent in 2021 compared to 7 percent in 2020 two years into the covid 19 pandemic the correspondence between mass infection and stock prices is well established the markets fall when they suspect measures will be taken to stop the spread of covid 19 and they rise when the disease is allowed to spread unchecked last month was the most concrete example in early december fears that the new more contagious omicron variant would lead to emergency school and business closures led to a sustained fall on wall street that fall ended on december 21 when us president biden speaking before the end of the trading day went on national television to declare that his administration is making sure that covid 19 no longer closes businesses or schools since then the dow has surged more than 2 000 points hitting record after record even as cases hospitalizations and deaths have soared the subordination of public health to the demands of wall street has been the single constant element of us government policy since the very beginning of the pandemic during the initial weeks of the spread of covid 19 donald trump sought to play it down as he later told journalist bob woodward i still like playing it down because i don t want to create a panic he added the panic trump was concerned about was a panic on wall street jared kushner who organized the white house s pandemic response had according to the financial times argued that testing too many people or ordering too many ventilators would spook the markets and so we just shouldn t do it but as trump was playing down the pandemic members of congress adjusted their own stock portfolios to minimize the impact on their own wealth when the truth inevitably became impossible to conceal by that time a massive bailout in the form of the cares act of march 2020 had already been prepared more than 1 4 trillion of the 2 3 trillion cares act consisted of bailouts to business with the overwhelming majority going to large and well connected enterprises the cares act also facilitated a massive monetary intervention by the federal reserve that totaled over 4 trillion as a result the fed balance sheet rose from 4 1 trillion in february 2020 to more than 8 7 trillion today 1 4 trillion of which has been handed out since the inauguration of biden once the bailout was secured the demand was raised for the end of the limited measures put in place in the initial wave of the pandemic all the measures necessary to fight covid 19 and in particular the shutdown of non essential businesses and the closure of schools to in person learning cut across the interests of the market an entirely false narrative was created with the assistance of the media that somehow these measures were not necessary and particularly under biden that vaccines by themselves could stop the pandemic the results were predictable mass death on the one hand and massive enrichment of the oligarchy on the other hundreds of thousands of people are dead and billionaires in the us are now 2 1 trillion wealthier than they were before the pandemic began the pandemic response of both trump and biden was built upon the reaction of the obama and bush administrations to the 2008 financial crisis when a similar bailout of wall street though on a somewhat smaller scale was organized while more than 10 million households lost their homes america s billionaires emerged from the crisis wealthier than ever before as the economists raphaële chappe and mark blyth wrote in foreign affairs late last year the us has severed any remaining ties between financial markets and the real economy the us has created a monetary policy regime that has untethered the fate of economic elites who derive most of their income from state protected financial assets from that of ordinary people who rely on low and precarious wages such a regime offers permanent protections to those with high incomes from financial assets america s ruling elite knows that whatever happens the government and federal reserve will ensure that there is no reduction in share values but there is another factor at work it is a dirty secret of american politics that the rise in life expectancy has been identified over the past two decades as a major problem in 2020 a year in which 373 000 americans died from covid 19 us life expectancy at birth fell by 1 8 years from 78 8 years to 77 0 according to federal mortality data released last month in 2020 alone the covid 19 pandemic eliminated the entire increase in us life expectancy since 2002 that is all the progress made over the course of a fifth of a century the reduction of life expectancy is producing substantial demographic shifts with the share of the working age population rising in relationship to the elderly seventy five percent of those who have died have been those above the retirement age of 65 and 93 percent have been over the age of 50 from the standpoint of sections of the ruling class there is a silver lining to this massive death toll economic military and political strategists have worried for decades that as the baby boomers began to retire the balance between the working age population which generates surplus value and the retired who do not would shift cutting into profits this prompted demands for slashing costly medical procedures and the curtailment of medicare and medicaid excerpted how american capitalism profits on death courtesy wsws org

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news berkeley lab report outlines systemic changes needed to advance equity in electric utility regulation by poring over the line items on your monthly electricity bill may not sound like an enticing way to spend an afternoon but the way electricity bills are structured has a significant impact on equitable energy access and distribution for example fixed fees can have a disproportionate impact on low income households and combined with other factors low income households and households of color are far more likely to report losing home heating service according to recent federal data advancing equity in utility regulation a new report published by the u s department of energy s doe s lawrence berkeley national laboratory berkeley lab makes a unifying case that utilities regulators and stakeholders need to prioritize energy equity in the deployment of clean energy technologies and resources equity in this context is the fair distribution of the benefits and burdens of energy production and consumption the report outlines systemic changes needed to advance equity in electric utility regulation by providing perspectives from four organizations portland general electric a utility company the national consumer law center a consumer advocacy organization and the partnership for southern equity and the center for biological diversity social justice and environmental organizations while government and ratepayer funded energy efficiency programs have made strides towards equity by enabling low income households to access energy efficiency measures that has not yet extended in a major way to other clean energy technologies said lisa schwartz a manager and strategic advisor at berkeley lab and technical editor of the report states and utilities can take the lead to make sure the clean energy transition does not leave behind low income households and communities of color decarbonization and energy equity goals are not mutually exclusive and in fact they need to go hand in hand energy bills and electricity rates are governed by state laws and utility regulators whose mission is to ensure that utility services are reliable safe and fairly priced public utility commissions also are increasingly recognizing equity as an important goal tool and metric while states can use existing authorities to advance equity in their decision making several including illinois maine oregon and washington have enacted legislation over the last couple of years to more explicitly require utility regulators to consider equity the infrastructure investments that utility companies make today and regulator decisions about what goes into electricity bills will have significant impacts for decades to come schwartz said solutions recommended in the report include considering energy justice goals when determining the public interest in regulatory decisions allocating funding for energy justice organizations to participate in utility proceedings supporting utility programs that increase deployment of energy efficiency and solar for low income households and accounting for energy inequities and access in designing electricity rates the report is part of the future of electric utility regulation series that started in 2015 led by berkeley lab and funded by doe to encourage informed discussion and debate on tackling the toughest issues related to state electric utility regulation an advisory group of utilities public utility commissioners consumer advocates environmental and social justice organizations and other experts provides guidance taking stock of past and current energy inequities one focus of the report is electricity bills in addition to charges based on usage electricity bills usually also have a fixed basic customer charge which is the minimum amount a household has to pay every month to access electricity the fixed charge varies widely from 5 to more than 20 in recent years utility companies have sought sizable increases in this charge to cover more costs this fixed charge means that no matter what a household does to use energy more efficiently or to conserve energy there is always a minimum cost moreover low income households often live in older poorly insulated housing current levels of public and utility funding for energy efficiency programs fall far short of the need the combined result is that the energy burden or percent of income needed to keep the lights on and their homes at a healthy temperature is far greater for lower income households while all households require basic lighting heating cooling and refrigeration low income households must devote a greater proportion of income to maintain basic service explained john howat and jenifer bosco from the national consumer law center and co authors of berkeley lab s report their analysis of data from the most recent u s energy information administration s residential energy consumption survey shows households with income less than 20 000 reported losing home heating service at a pace more than five times higher than households with income over 80 000 households of color were far more likely than those with a white householder to report loss of heating service in addition low income households and households of color are more likely to have to choose between paying their energy bill or paying for other necessities such as healthcare or food moreover while many of the infrastructure investment decisions that utilities make such as whether and where to build a new power plant often have long term environmental and health consequences impacted communities often are not at the table despite bearing an inequitable proportion of the negative impacts of environmental injustices related to fossil fuel based energy production and climate change marginalized communities remain virtually unrepresented in the energy planning and decision making processes that drive energy production distribution and regulation wrote chandra farley ceo of resolve and a co author of the report engaging impacted communities each of the perspectives in the report identify a need for meaningful engagement of underrepresented and disadvantaged communities in energy planning and utility decision making connecting the dots between energy racial injustice economic disinvestment health disparities and other associated equity challenges becomes a clarion call for communities that are being completely left out of the clean energy economy wrote farley who previously served as the just energy director at partnership for southern equity we must prioritize the voices and lived experiences of residents if we are to have more equity in utility regulation and equitably transform the energy sector in another essay in the report nidhi thaker and jake wise from portland general electric identify the importance of collaborating directly with the communities they serve in 2021 the oregon legislature passed oregon hb 2475 which allows the oregon public utility commission to allocate ratepayer funding for organizations representing people most affected by a high energy burden enabling them to participate in utility regulatory processes the report explains why energy equity requires correcting inequities resulting from past and present failures as well as rethinking how we achieve future energy and decarbonization goals equity in energy requires adopting an expansive definition of the public interest that encompasses energy climate and environmental justice energy equity also means prioritizing the deployment of distributed energy resources and clean energy technologies in areas that have been hit first and worst by the existing fossil fuel economy wrote jean su energy justice director and senior attorney at the center for biological diversity this report was supported by doe s grid modernization laboratory

representative image pti data provided by the reserve bank of india tells us that the capital account of the country has been negative over the last three years this means that the amount of capital coming inward is less than the amount of capital that has gone out of the country indeed the negative account has been greater during the months of the corona crisis however that does not explain the capital flight from the country because other countries were equally affected by the pandemic at the same time therefore the flight of capital from corona affected india to another corona affected country cannot be because of the pandemic there is a need for the reserve bank of india to work out policies to prevent this capital flight because just as a family becomes poorer when an earning member of the family leaves similarly the flight of capital from the country will make india poorer despite this hard reality a committee established by the rbi has been giving four arguments to allow the free movement of capital to and from indian to foreign countries the first argument given by the committee is that the free movement of capital will increase the availability of capital in the country it will encourage foreign investors to invest in india however this alleged benefit is disproved by the rbi s own data that shows that the capital account has been continuously negative in the last two years the free movement of capital is leading to the flight of capital from and not the other way around the second argument given by the committee is that the free movement of capital will reduce the cost of capital this too is not correct because the outward flow of capital is reducing the availability of capital in india and accordingly the cost of capital in india is rising not falling the third argument is that it will make it possible for indian companies to borrow in foreign countries and diversify their borrowing this is correct however the fact that more capital is going out of the country means that diversification is not proving helpful in attracting foreign capital the fourth argument is that the free movement of capital will allow indian investors to diversify their investment portfolios at present an indian investor may be investing in property and in the sharemarket in india after free movement of capital indian investors can invest in property in new york and in shares in the new york stock exchange this benefit is correct however this is only beneficial to the richer sections of society because they alone have the capacity to invest in foreign countries outward foreign investment can prove beneficial for them but not for india the arguments given by the committee of the bri in favour of the free movement of capital are certainly not beneficial for the country contrary to the rbi s harmful policies the international monetary fund has advocated that developing countries should consider imposing restrictions on the free movement of capital to foreign countries in situations such as the corona pandemic they have referred to the experience of korea and peru which have imposed such restrictions with beneficial results the free movement of capital could be much more harmful in the present situation the united states federal reserve board has adopted an easy money policy in the last few years it has made available loans at an interest rate of 0 to 0 25 per cent per year it is profitable for investors to borrow in the united states and invest that money in india at these low interest rates the us federal reserve board has indicated that it is soon going to backtrack from the easy money and is likely to reduce the money supply and that will in turn lead to an increase in the interest rate if the interest rates in the us increase it will no longer be beneficial for foreign investors toborrowintheusandinvest in india because they have to pay a high rate of interest in the us on the contrary such an increase in interest rates in the us may lead to them to withdraw their money from india and repatriateittotheus therefore there is a need for the rbi to reconsider its policy urgently in view of the impending increase in the interest rates in the us economy the policy of the rbi is also against its own recommendations the committee has said that it is necessary to contain the fiscal deficit along with allowing the free movement of capital we know very well that the fiscal deficit of our country is increasing rapidly since the corona pandemic on the one hand the rbi is saying that the free movement of capital should not be allowed if fiscal deficit is not controlled but on the other hand it has increased the limit of the money that an indian national can remit foreign countries for investment under the liberalised remittance scheme despite the increase in the fiscal deficit an article in the journal of indian association of social science institutions has given four reasons for the flight of capital from india the first is corruption the cost of doing business in the country is higher if there is corruption and foreign investors do not want to invest here the second is the increase in government debt this means that 1 the government will have to borrow more money 2 the reserve bank will have to adopt an easy money policy to make available the money that is borrowed by the government 3 this will lead to inflation and to the devaluation of the indian rupee and 4 reduce the value of the investment that the foreign investors may have made in india leading to loss for them the third is the negative capital account a negative capital account leads to more outflow somewhat like herd immunity one foreign investor follows the other in taking capital out of india because a negative capital account leads to devaluation the fourth is the adoption of free trade the reason is that if our economy is not competitive then we will lose our ground in the global market and this will lead to capital flight i would like to add a fifth reason which is social conflict in the country the social atmosphere has become so negative that foreign investors may not like to come the time is at hand

when pursuing their higher education the majority of malawians get obsessed on securing employing upon their graduation instead of aiming for entrepreneurship which if deliberate steps are taken to strengthen and stimulate it can help create job opportunities this is what has been observed by renowned and successful malawian engineering entrepreneur simbi phiri during his interview on cruise 5 a one on one panel discussion programme on zodiak broadcasting station simbi whose business interest is based in south africa contends that it is the norm for most highly educated malawians to opt being employed rather than take the risk of being independent by venturing into serious entrepreneurship he hinted that entrepreneurship is what the financial authorities can consider supporting to encourage more highly educated experts to venture and grow their entrepreneur businesses so that can sustain on their own into bigger industries so that they keep the country s economy stable simbi believes that most malawians have the wrong mentality and perception that entrepreneurship is an option for those who failed to attain higher education yet they fail to see the bigger picture based on how and why malawians of asian origin do their businesses which is mostly family controlled the indians businesses simbi said are controlling the economy which is second to the corporate world indians educate their children and once they graduate they run their family businesses simbi said hinting that malawian small and medium entrepreneurs who didn t undergo higher education cannot be expected to compete at par with the malawians of asian origin he gave an example of shoddy and mediocre road construction projects which the country is given to commission but in under two years they develop potholes with some of the bridges getting washed away he attributed the inefficiencies due to lack of rigorous inspection on the part of the government hinting that it borders on corruption where a contractor is asked by procurement authorities to build a 3km stretch of a road at us 1 million which is the cost of building just a kilometre of a standard road as of today s estimate he suggested that if a foreign company is contracted to construct a road or any other project it should be mandated to subcontract to other local contractors consultant engineers inspectors construction material suppliers etc who should be recapitalized by the government to procure the right equipment to independently and efficiently carry out their part of the project he said going forward such local construction contractors can further be recapitalized to meet the required engineering grade which can assist them to be at par with foreign companies for them to bid for and successfully deliver larger projects he gave an example of his khato civils which he bought off from an italian family when it was on a grade 4 on south africa s high engineering standard and within a reasonable period it managed to attain the highest grade 9 this simbi said this was due to khato civils being subcontracted by reputable construction companies and the proceeds from such projects khato civils managed to acquire bigger assets both in equipment and human capital which earned it to be at par with construction giants such as group 5 last month the government emphasized the need for equitable awarding of contracts to see to it that 60 of contracts should be awarded to malawians with the remaining 40 for international investors for purposes of equitable wealth distribution this followed the furore that was created when mota engil was seen as dominating in being awarded construction contracts that led to the anti corruption bureau acb to cancel a staggering k48 billion contract that was awarded to the portuguese company to upgrade the marka bangula railway line the procurement process was challenged as it bordered on some alleged corrupt dealings and thus the acb suspended awarding of the contact just a few days after ministry of transport and public works published a notification for intention to award mota engil the portuguese company emerged as the successful bidder at the lowest price of k48 244 861 524 98 against two other bidders china railway at k59 906 673 465 11 and china civil engineering s k79 766 540 032 76 thus simbi s suggestion that this kind of scenario where foreign companies seem to be favoured at the expense of local contractors shouldn t happen if local entrepreneurs can be constantly recapitalized to acquire proper equipment and human capital to compete favourably on the market such local contractors once they win and successfully carry out more bigger projects would be able to repay the loans government shall provide them as recapitalization in the us president barack obama inherited financial crisis on wall street that throughly infected the broader economy in which over half of that country s 25 largest financial institutions had either failed merged or restructured to avoid bankruptcy this is contained in his book barack obama a promised land 2020 by penguin random house llc in which he narrates that he inherited an economy whose stock market lost 40 of its value followed by foreclosure filings on 2 3 million homes household wealth was more than 5 times the percentage loss that occurred in the aftermath of the 1929 market crisis obama s administration needed a stimulus package which he pushed to be enacted into law as american recovery investment act in less than a month he took office and by the summer of 2009 the economy stabilized in that short time some of the corporate companies that were recapitalized through the american recovery investment act managed to repay the loans back to government obama had steered america from economic disaster that eventually led unemployment insurance payments keeping families afloat tax cuts for small businesses allowed more workers on their payroll companies that were on the threat of closing were still operating while mortgage refinancing kept people from losing their homes this is almost what simbi is hinting at in suggesting that the government can refinance entrepreneur businesses to be kept afloat and earn a status of being given contracts from the same government or the corporate world in order to inculcate malawians to think outside the box rather than being obsessed at getting employed we have too many brains which goes into government for employment which should have aimed at being entrepreneurs he said last month fdh holdings plc launched fdh graduate start ups through which new graduates are encouraged to conceptualize their ideas and engage with the financial institution for possible refinancing the programme started with graduates of malawi university of business applied sciences mubas formerly the polytechnic of malawi who were engaged to present their real time business ideas and plans for possible injection of working capital the students who formed nine real time companies pitched their business ideas to a panel of 7 executive management of fdh holdings which identified 5 for further nurturing and assessment to qualify for refinancing this fdh initiative is first of its kind in the financial services industry as well as the corporate world that was born following a symposium mubas faculty of education and media studies had that impressed fdh bank s then acting md george chitera when he attended it as guest of honour chitera then impressed on the rest of the fdh holdings management team which resolved to gather the students again for the real time presentations named fdh graduate start ups in august last year malawi university of science and technology must partnered with technical entrepreneurial vocational education and training authority teveta to identify and train community innovations that can be commercialized the initiative which must vice chancellor address malata said is aimed at producing skilled workforce that will support and advance the mw2063 industrialisation agenda is to encourage scientific innovation and technology as a vehicle for advancing creativity and design must has a design lab that is training these young innovators from various rural communities whose innovations shall be patented for commercial purposes this is where the government comes in to recapitalize such business concepts as well as helping to create markets for the products simbi said it s high time malawi became a producing country by investing into food processing as opposed to exporting food produce and importing the proceeded food such as cooking oil butter first line medicine and many others including toothpicks relying of foreign investors and imports is what simbi said contributes to constant scarcity of forex saying if government contracts are given to local contractors and entrepreneurs the money remains in the country and there is a long chain of beneficiaries through subcontracting something he said is inevitable in any industry thus simbi reiterated that people should stop the obsession they have of eyeing to be employed rather than aiming to utilize what they learnt in their academic pursuits to manage their entrepreneurial concepts he said he has never been employed after finishing school here in malawi and relocated to his mother s country of birth botswana where he worked as a partner in an engineering company before relocating to johannesburg where he was a partner in consultant company let engineering he then bought off khato civils and together with his wife brought it to become one of the top engineering companies which can ably tender and successfully complete a project worth over zar5 billion he maintains that malawians have the

mercenary and was revived by an ancient egyptian moon god in terms of powers the character bears a lot of similarities with batman he employs expert martial arts skills combined with high tech gadgets to take on foes but in some storylines he has exhibited superhuman strength and endurance during different phases of the moon spector also represents a big step forward for representation in the mcu as the character in the comics is both jewish and suffers from dissociative identity disorder that also means marc isn t the only one wearing the cape moon knight has a long history in marvel comics first appearing in werewolf by night another title soon to be adapted on disney and eventually crossing paths with the likes of spider man the avengers and other marvel superheroes what do we know about moon knight on disney the disney series featuring moon knight was announced three years ago at san diego comic con at the time we didn t know much about the new show and to be honest we still

the series showing oscar isaac being haunted by a strange skull creature which is likely one of the egyptian gods the show has teased from all the clips shown so far it looks like moon knight will be

currently ranking at 88 over on rotten tomatoes based on 67 reviews in our review we praised moon knight as being marvel s darkest series yet pushing mcu into supernatural horror territory for the

the hottest rage in the u s financial markets during the covid 19 pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 was the spac special purpose acquisition company in 2020 around 200 spacs went public in the u s raising about usd 64 billion in total funding according to renaissance capital this is almost as much as the whole of that year s ipos combined 2021 saw a staggering sum of usd 162 billion two and a half times 2020 s amount raised through spac ipos according to data from statista a spac is essentially a shell company which is set up to raise funds for the purpose of eventually acquiring or merging with a privately owned on going business which wants to go public a spac has no products no revenue no commercial operations typically the only money the spac has is the money raised in its own ipo and because investors usually buy into the ipo not knowing what business the spac will eventually acquire spacs are also known as blank check companies for the same reason spacs are usually sponsored by well known institutional investors private equity firms or successful entrepreneurs with extensive business connections for example when the singapore exchange sgx announced in september of 2021 that it would allow spacs to list on the sgx the first two firms to jump in were vertex holdings a wholly owned subsidiary of state owned investment firm temasek holdings and pegasus asia whose sponsors include financiere agache the holding company of lvmh luxury goods chief bernard arnault pegasus asia is backed by european asset manager tikehau capital in the u s serial entrepreneur peter thiel is the sponsor of a couple of spacs under the name bridgetown for the uninitiated thiel is a german american billionaire venture capitalist who was the first outside investor in facebook he is also the co founder of paypal and palantir technologies a big data analytics firm famous british billionaire businessman richard branson has also been involved in spacs when the spac ipo is launched the money collected goes into an interest bearing trust account until the management team finds a private company which agrees to merge with it to go public however spac sponsors also have a deadline by which they have to find a suitable deal in the u s the spac is to be liquidated and investors get their money back with interest after two years in singapore such shell companies similarly have two years to merge with a revenue generating business but have the possibility of extending this by another year subject to fulfillment of prescribed conditions although spacs have been around in the u s for many decades they have suddenly become popular during the covid years because of the extreme market volatility due to the global pandemic many companies held off their ipos due to uncertain market valuations and concerns about their firm s ability to raise the capital they had hoped to get the spac route enables the company to list on an exchange and get a capital influx more rapidly than it would a conventional ipo furthermore it shortens the listing process usually costs less and the newly listing company is not put under the same scrutiny compared with a direct listing the target company is also able to negotiate its own fixed valuation with spac sponsors although this all sounds good on paper ultimately how the newly listed company performs in the market is entirely up to what investors think about the company for example southeast asia s largest ride hailing transportation and food delivery company grab listed in the us market early december last year through a spac its host spac altimeter s share price was usd 11 the day before it listed but on the first day after listing it closed at usd 8 75 currently as of last friday it was trading down over 40 percent at usd 6 04 last week vertex technology acquisition corporation vtac a spac established by temasek holdings backed vertex holdings registered its final prospectus with singapore s central bank the monetary authority of singapore it is raising sgd 200 million usd 148 million through an ipo with 55 percent of the offering already taken up by 13 cornerstone investors it will start trading on sgx on january 20 pegasus asia the other spac mentioned earlier in this article is expected to list the following day it is aiming to raise sgd 128 million with its sponsors investing another sgd 30 million in the spac vtac is said to be focusing on targeting a business in one of the following sectors artificial intelligence cyber security and enterprise solutions consumer internet and technologies financial technologies autonomous driving and new energy vehicles biomedical technologies and digital healthcare india with over 50 unicorns and more than 50 000 startups many in the field of technology would certainly have many potential candidates that can bind with vtac given vertex s india footprint this of course assumes it can successfully navigate india s regulatory and tax obstacles according to vtac ceo jiang honghui the target business will be assessed based on the following criteria technology driven fast growing and scalable business model at an inflection point of their growth journey strong management team and cross border potential all the companies that we will be potentially targeting they will already have a proven product a proven business model they will be growing however we are hoping that with this additional injection of cash through the business combination and also with the support of vertex as a whole network it can grow even faster to have a higher growth trajectory said jiang

should you move while you can or when you must this gives an extreme advantage to those few who move first long before they must the financial advantage for first movers is equally extreme moving is a difficult decision so we hesitate but when the window to do so closes it s too late we always think we have all the time in the world to ponder calculate and explore and then things change and the options we once had are gone for good moving to a new locale is difficult for those of us who are well established in the place we call home add in a house we love jobs work kids in school a parent living with us and all the emotional attachments to friends extended family colleagues and favorite haunts and for many and likely most people moving is out of the question many of us have fond memories of moving when we were in our late teens or early 20s everything we owned fit in the backseat and trunk of a beaten up old car and off we went once you put down roots in a home work enterprise schools neighborhood and networks it s a herculean task to move moving to another state or province isn t just a matter of the physical movement of possessions and buying renting a new dwelling itself an arduous process the transfer of medical and auto insurance finding new dentists and doctors opening local bank credit union accounts obtaining local business licenses and a staggering list of institutions and enterprises that require an address change is complicated and time consuming knowing this i don t ask this question lightly should you move while you can or when you must the question is consequential because the window in which we still have options can slam shut with little warning the origin of the question will be visible to those who have read my blog posts in 2021 on systemic fragility our dependence on long brittle supply chains the vulnerabilities created by these dependencies and my polite i hope suggestions to fashion not just a plan b for temporary disruptions but a plan c for permanent disruptions my new book global crisis national renewal a revolutionary grand strategy for the united states is a result of realities few are willing to face the extreme inequality we now have in the u s leads to social collapse that s the lesson of history so to believe as if collapse is impossible is to ignore the evidence that social collapse is inevitable when inequality reaches extremes human and nature dynamics handy modeling inequality and use of resources in the collapse or sustainability of societies social collapse has consequences and so we have to ask where do we want to be in the vast human herd when social order unravels my new book also addresses the transition that s obvious but easily denied we ve transitioned from an era of abundance to an era of scarcity there are many historical examples of what happens as scarcity diminishes living standards and puts increasing stress on individuals families communities and nations there are ways to adapt to scarcity that s the point of my book but nation states and the elites who run them are optimized for abundance not scarcity so they lack the means to adapt to scarcity their default setting to is keep pursuing a return to higher consumption growth by increasingly extreme means for example printing trillions of dollars and giving it to wealthy elites and corporations and printing additional trillions to give away as bread and circuses stimulus to the masses there is no historical evidence that this vast endless creation of currency is consequence free or successful this delusional pursuit of endless growth that is no longer possible due to resource depletion and soaring costs of extraction transport etc also leads to collapse this is the modern day equivalent of squandering the last resources available on ever more elaborate and completely unproductive temples in the hopes of appeasing the gods of growth as i also detail in the book the status quo is fantastically wasteful and ineffective it now takes 20 25 years to build a single bridge or tunnel and each project is billions of dollars over budget yet we re assured that the entire nation will seamlessly and painlessly transition away from hydrocarbon fuels to alternative energy in 20 25 years never mind that this would require building a new nuclear plant or equivalent every month for the next 20 years skeptics are just naysayers while a successful transition to a degrowth economy and society is certainly physically possible the current status quo lacks the will structure leadership or desire to manage such a transition while no one is entirely independent of long supply chains and energy intensive industrial economies the lower one s dependency and one s exposure to the risks of social disorder the better off one will be put another way the greater one s self reliance and independence from global supply chains the lower the impact should things break down the closer one is to local sources of energy fresh water food etc the lower the likelihood of losing all access to these essentials the wealthiest few hedge their risks by having one or more homes they can escape to if urban life breaks down when risks rise the wealthy start buying rural homes sight unseen for double the price locals paid a few months earlier here s the problem roughly 81 of americans live in urban zones 270 million people and around 19 60 million people live in rural areas about 31 of urban residents live in dense urban cores about 25 live in suburban counties and the remaining 24 live in urban clusters and metropolitan areas smaller cities etc rural regions have plenty of land but relatively few dwellings due to the low population density much of the land is owned by government agencies corporations or large landowners so a relatively small percentage is available for housing many rural economies have stagnated for decades so the housing stock has not grown by much and older homes have deteriorated due to being abandoned or poorly maintained few building contractors survived the stagnation and so finding crews to build a new home is also non trivial so when the wealthiest few rush out to buy second or third homes in desirable rural areas in idaho montana utah colorado north carolina etc they find a very restricted supply of homes available this generates a bidding war for the relatively few homes considered acceptable and prices skyrocket pricing out locals who soon resent the wealthy newcomers financial power and fear the inevitable rise of the political and commercial power their wealth can buy cough billgates cough at present few anticipate urban america becoming a dicey place to live and own a home but inequality and the hollowing out of the economy by globalization and financialization has left cities entirely dependent on diesel fueled trucks to deliver virtually everything this is also true of rural communities of course but some rural areas still produce energy and food and given the lower population density these communities are less dependent on global supply chains and are therefore more self sufficient rural households have more opportunities to raise animals grow vegetables etc and more opportunities to have supportive relationships with neighbors who actually produce something tangible and essential dependence is a matter of scale if you can get by on 5 gallons of gasoline a month you re much more likely to put your hands on enough fuel to get by than if you need a minimum of 50 gallons of fuel to survive the same is true of food fresh water and other essentials the less you need the more you supply yourself the lower your vulnerability to supply disruptions lower population densities lend themselves to greater self sufficiency resilience and to community cohesion roving mobs are less likely to form simply because the low density makes such mobs difficult to assemble as i explain in my book social cohesion is a combination of civic virtue shared purpose agency having a stake in the local economy and a say in decisions which affect everyone and moral legitimacy i e a community that isn t divided into a self serving elite that owns the vast majority of the wealth capital and political power and a relatively powerless majority i e debt serfs and tax donkeys in my analysis social cohesion in most urban zones has already eroded to the point of no return the tattered remnants will crumble with one swift kick the conventional view is the urban populace will continue to grow at the expense of rural regions a trend that s been in place for hundreds of years but this trend exactly parallels the rise of hydrocarbon energy large cities existed long before hydrocarbon energy but these cities arose and fell depending on the availability of essential resources within reach imperial rome for example likely had 1 million residents at the apex of its power residents who were largely dependent on grain grown in north african colonies and shipped across the mediterranean to rome s port of ostia once those wheat exporting colonies were lost rome s population fell precipitously reaching a nadir of perhaps 10 000 residents living amidst the ruins of a once great metropolis more recently economic and social shifts hollowed out many city cores in the 1970s as residents and jobs moved to the suburbs a reversal of this trend in favor of small cities towns and rural areas may already be gathering momentum under the radar all this is abstract until the attractions of city living fade and economic vitality declines to the point of civic and financial bankruptcy cities have cycles of expansion decay and decline just like societies and economies and it behooves us to monitor the fragility dependency and risk of the place we inhabit at nadirs homes and buildings that were once worth a fortune are abandoned or their value drops to a fraction of its former value putting these dynamics together the problem boils down to a systemic scarcity of housing in attractive productive rural towns and regions and a massive oversupply of urban residents who may decide to move once urban zones unravel let s assume that a mere 5 of urban residents decamp for rural regions given that there are about 130 million households in the u s and 81 of that total is 105 million households 5 is 5 25 million households given that the number of rural communities that have all the desirable characteristics is not that large we can estimate that it might be difficult for even 500 000 urban households to relocate to their first choice never mind 5 million this gives an extreme advantage to those few who move first long before they must the financial advantage for first movers is equally extreme as they can still sell their urban homes for a great deal more money than they will fetch once conditions deteriorate the value of homes can drop to zero as detroit has shown those few who decide to join the early movers even though the difficulties are many have all the advantages those who wait until conditions slip off a cliff may find their once valuable home has lost most or all of its value and the communities they would have chosen are out of reach financially most people reckon they have plenty of time to act decades or at least many years the problem with systemic fragility was aptly described by seneca increases are of sluggish growth but the way to ruin is rapid my own expectation is a self reinforcing unraveling that gathers momentum to breaking points by 2024 25 only a few years away rather than fix the systemic problems of inequality and scarcity the status quo s expedient fixes printing trillions out of thin air and hoping there will be no adverse consequences from distributing free money to financiers and bread and circuses will only accelerate the unraveling there may not be as much time as we think new readers pondering these dynamics may find value in one of the more widely read of my essays the art of survival taoism and the warring states june 27 2008 which discusses the importance of being a helpful and productive member of a tight knit community and the futility of having an isolated bug out cabin as plan c the vista of solid ground stretching endlessly to the horizon may turn out to be a mirage and the cliff edge is closer than we

this has not been a fun week watching the market collapse and receiving requests for pricing that are from la la land said one latam syndicate banker whenever the market has a fright some bonds trade and some don t and it s impossible to know which to use fortunately for our friend on the desk not only is it friday but despite another volatile week there has been plenty of latin american primary action to quench the market s thirst what s more the latest issuer to turn to bond markets was none other than compañía cervecerías unidas ccu chile s largest provider of beer ccu attracted 1 45bn of orders on the way to a 600m 10 year again showing that there is cash ready to be deployed in the primary market even if execution is challenging and secondary market performance is mixed several observers however found a peculiarity in the ccu s bond so we d like to take the chance to invite all credit analysts reading to serve themselves a chilean tipple and talk us through what one banker called the deal s funky ratings at bbb s p puts ccu two notches below the chilean sovereign while fitch clearly has more faith in the chilean people s ability to imbibe it rates the company a exactly in line with the chilean government perhaps this explains why some bankers were pricing this against the sovereign but others used chilean corps such as bottler embotelladora andina as comps by the way while we don t object to a cold bottle of ccu s cristal lager particularly on a warm summer s day in santiago we d recommend a glass of carménère for this task also available from ccu of course carry on drinking ccu s was the sixth latam dollar deal of the week açu petróleo bradesco gcc panama and agrosuper had preceded the chilean company opting to push ahead despite an uneasy tone be sure to read our deal write ups for each of these in general trickier conditions were reflected in modest books in the two to three times oversubscribed range and pretty generous new issue concessions even strong issuers like panama and bradesco paid more than 20bp significantly more according to some observers agrosuper another chilean debutant arguably had the best of the conditions on wednesday as it notched its 500m 10 year and the bond did trade up on the break but there is little expectation that volatility will calm down or that the rates sell off is going to slow brazilians adjust the volatility is particularly badly timed for brazilian issuers with brazilian credit having endured a tricky end to 2021 and corporates therefore wanting to use january get their funding done before presidential elections take centre stage there had been talk of 10 15 new issues from brazil in january alone but just four have come to market so far with a us holiday on january 17 there is limited time to reach that number perhaps unsurprising then that citi s brazilian dcm head claudio matos told us it was probably optimistic to expect 10 15 deals this month those who do come he said will have to be pragmatic about pricing it s a biased market that requires careful navigation and investors are demanding higher concessions good news for potential supply most borrowers are pragmatic they realise that the brazilian macro environment and the us rates situation has changed since last year according to matos not such good news a lot of those potential issuers may not be lured into difficult markets as much of the pipeline is understood to be opportunistic liability management focussed transactions our piece on what bankers and issuers are expecting from market conditions here if the choppy start to the year has left you parched have no fear there may be just one latam issuer on the road but it s sure to keep you refreshed the central american bottling corporation which bottles up soft drinks for pepsi and beer for ambev is planning a sustainability linked bond to finance a tender offer have a great weekend and do get in touch for a free trial to access all of globalcapital saludos olly this is globalcapital s latam letter written weekly by latin america reporter oliver west if you enjoy it sign up for free in a matter of seconds here and feel free to pass it on to colleagues and contacts the best of this week s latam bond coverage
an australian born in 2019 can expect to live to about 83 some 34 years longer than people born in the 1880s in japan the average age expectancy is just over 84 today about one in seven australians are 65 or older by 2057 it ll be almost one in four australia has one of the highest life expectancies ranking ninth among oecd countries behind switzerland iceland italy norway japan sweden israel and spain ageing is universal but not uniform it s universal because it happens in all cells and all species but it s not uniform in that we don t all go through it in the same way professor byles says ageing is intrinsic to the living species on this planet but how we grow old and the factors that influence the process are complex and unpredictable being human and living our lives is all about change and that s what ageing is it s change over time says professor julie byles a social gerontologist and researcher at newcastle university it s a fact that many of us don t want to face with every tick of the clock every one of us is ageing it feels scary but it needn t add articles to your saved list and come back to them any time our cognitive processes peak about the time we re 20 in fact most of our body s systems are thought to peak when we are between 18 and 30 says leon flicker a professor of geriatric medicine at the university of western australia that seems to be when the ageing process starts kicking in and you have a progressive decline flicker says it s happening all your life it starts even before you re born from the very first cell division says byles that s because ageing comes down to a gradual accumulation of problems starting with tiny dna transcription errors from the very beginning while most people don t start feeling the effects until at least their 30s the seeds of ageing start when we do can we slow ageing how does it happen and how can ageism be a form of self sabotage we may feel more empowered to make those extra years as fulfilling and meaningful as possible if we understand how ageing happens that it s a lifelong process not just some switch that gets flicked in your 60s says peter lange a university of melbourne clinical associate professor in geriatrics there is a lot of nihilism about ageing and a lot of people think that disease is inevitable that they ll go into a nursing home or develop dementia that s not true but by believing it s going to be the case they end up failing to take action to prevent it he says as the world health organisation says with good health a longer life brings opportunities to pursue new activities a long neglected passion or even a fresh career there are certain hallmarks of ageing on a molecular and cellular level for example gregorevic says we collect damage in our dna one way is that each time our cells divide the little protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes called telomeres which are often likened to the plastic tips on shoelaces gradually shorten which affects our ability to copy dna properly the thing about ageing is it s affecting every system of the body and different parts get impacted differently no two 80 year olds will be the same says dr kate gregorevic royal melbourne hospital geriatrician and author of staying alive the science of living healthier happier and longer the changes we experience as we age are neither linear nor consistent and there is an extraordinary level of variability among older people the thing about ageing is it s affecting every system of the body and different parts get impacted differently no two 80 year olds will be the same but over time our physiological reserves drop so we re left accumulating damage that our body gradually can t keep up with fixing and this can manifest in all sorts of ways it s happening throughout every second of our existence says flicker ageing is not programmed though as we move through the world we suffer little bits of damage it could be from sunlight bacteria a sprained ankle a shonky dna copy bad food that the body then works to repair if you re frail says gregorevic your body is already working so hard at the best of times just to get through daily life so when you get a cold it takes all your energy the pile up of all these changes gradually increases our vulnerability to disease or insults such as a seemingly minor fall leading to bone fracture and eventually leads to frailty which is a loss of physical reserve that affects almost everybody by their 90s at the same time bone density drops while ligaments and joints stiffen becoming more at risk of injury and taking longer to heal also common are weakening lungs our cardiovascular system is impacted and there are certain hormonal changes with people exposed to a higher level of cortisol the stress hormone as they age muscle loss or sarcopenia is another typical part of ageing one study observed that muscle mass decreased between about 3 and 8 per cent each decade after age 30 and the rate of decline was higher after 60 we know that with age we can lose muscle strength gregorevic says particularly we lose fast twitch muscle fibres they re the ones you use when sprinting or when you catch your foot on the pavement and need to steady yourself fast then there are the changes we often notice from our 40s says lange skin loses elasticity hair turns grey as pigment cells in our follicles slowly die we become long sighted as the lenses of our eyes stiffen in some people hearing dulls when dna is damaged over time more cells can die or become cancerous more cells also become what s called senescent they stop dividing on the one hand this defends against cancer but these senescent cells also take up space without contributing causing inflammation and overstimulating the immune system which can t keep up with removing them still while everyone s reserves decrease with age we aren t all similarly susceptible to disease some of us lange says have higher baseline defences so even though someone may have pathologies such as hypertension and mini strokes both of which are linked to dementia they won t necessarily develop a form of the disease flicker says cancer is more common as people age partly because the body s surveillance system becomes less likely to spot and destroy bad cells we are more at risk of diabetes in part because our body becomes less efficient at converting glucose to energy and requires more insulin in 2014 15 almost three quarters of australians aged 65 and over reported they had good or very good health according to the australian institute of health and welfare but disease is more common in older people in 2015 cancer and cardiovascular disease were the most prevalent followed by dementia type 2 diabetes chronic lung disease and osteoarthritis many of these illnesses are also the biggest killers there s a lot of confusion between the implicit processes of ageing and diseases associated with getting old says lange a good example is our minds as brain tissue gradually decreases with age it s normal for our memory to shift to become slower and less efficient but forgetting entirely and suffering from significant impairment is not universal it s a symptom of dementia which is itself an umbrella term for many diseases what difference does the life you ve led make to ageing there s a cheeky saying in gerontology says byles if you want to age well pick your parents being born with as few dna errors as possible gives you a good headstart in life aspects such as a good education financial security and access to nutritious food in childhood add to your stocks you can be already on an un level playing field depending on what your early life is like byles says if you get to older age and you re big and strong with a healthy brain good education a strong immune system they all go into your reserve you can maybe cope with having not as strong muscles or a decline in condition because you have all these other things that support you a quarter of how we age is determined by genetics according to the world health organisation and the rest comes down to lifestyle and socioeconomic factors more than a third 38 per cent of the burden of disease in older australians was preventable in 2015 according to the australian institute of health and welfare smoking poor diet being overweight or obese and high blood pressure were key contributors covid 19 lockdowns which limited exercise and socialising have underlined just how important lifestyle is in ageing lange says the months in lockdown in victoria had devastating impacts on physical and cognitive function for older people there are other factors outside our control being brought up in poor housing abject poverty poor nutrition a whole range of other things all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today aunty geraldine atkinson at the launch of the yoo rrook justice commission in 2021 credit simon schluter social disadvantage is a big one a 2020 study of 5000 britons found that lower socioeconomic status led to an accelerated decline in ageing the researchers pointed out that the rich tended to have for example better access to parks and fitness centres as well as mentally stimulating activities social clubs the arts which all helped bolster physical and mental function meanwhile those living in poverty usually experienced more life stresses which affected health and they could also be exposed to more environmental pollution loading this disparity in ageing is reflected in australian government policy subsidies for aged care services usually kick in at 65 but indigenous australians torres strait islanders and the homeless are at higher risk of health issues and financial inequality so are eligible at 50 or 45 if they are both indigenous and homeless the life expectancy of indigenous australians is about eight years less than for non indigenous australians aunty geraldine atkinson a bangerang woman and co chair of the first peoples assembly of victoria says more must be done to support healthy ageing in aboriginal communities being brought up in poor housing abject poverty poor nutrition a whole range of other things all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today she says credit illustration dionne gain so can we delay ageing much research is being done to find a magic anti ageing pill but there is no strong evidence at the moment that supplements or medications work scientists are trying to find treatments that could lengthen telomeres for example or remove senescent cells via drugs or gene editing in the hope these could slow ageing the medical community is keeping a close eye on clinical trials underway to determine the effects of the drug metformin which is normally prescribed to manage blood sugar in diabetics but has shown broader age targeting potential research previously suggested diabetic people who took the drug outlived non diabetics who didn t and it has been found to delay ageing in mice although in high quantities it was toxic the american federation for aging research is examining whether it can also prevent heart disease cancer and dementia still any geriatrician will tell you a balanced diet and regular exercise are key to supporting healthy ageing and in turn a longer life stimulating your mind also helps minimise disease risk gregorevic says just like our muscles use it or lose it our brains are like that as well she says one of the best things you can do for healthy ageing is just to keep having a go at things not brain training but staying engaged in life socialising learning new skills learning a language it s never too early or too late to start byles encourages people to start planning for old age when young if you re not doing it by your 50s she says that s when you must ask yourself where do i go from here what do i want to protect in terms of bodily social and mental functions make changes that will maintain your wellbeing and keep you pushing your capacity to do things you enjoy the aptly named professor norman lazarus laid out why he considered exercise eating well and mental health a trinity in his book from 2020 the lazarus strategy how to age well and wisely the king s college london physician and researcher overhauled his lifestyle in his 50s to become a champion cyclist at 66 an age he said he expected to start having difficulty getting out of a chair or opening jars at 86 he still cycles trains at the gym walks with his wife watches his diet and works at the university at every age i change my behaviour so that i can do the best i can with the physiological systems i have and i don t look for immortality norman lazarus 86 kickstarted his healthy lifestyle when he was 50 credit liz seabrook lazarus encourages people to first accept they are going to get old and then change their lifestyle to truly enjoy the journey of ageing and retain their independence at every age i change my behaviour so that i can do the best i can with the physiological systems i have and i don t look for immortality he says the trick is to prioritise things you love so you stick to them he says while he and his wife now walk on flatter gentler trails instead of on multi day hikes for example they still relish the time together he even uses the term exercise deficiency diseases to emphasise how key physical activity is a comprehensive study in 2015 found 26 common illnesses could be positively affected by exercise including cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes obesity dementia osteoarthritis osteoporosis and some cancers the most effective anti ageing option we have is exercise lange says it produces beneficial effects for pretty much everything we ve ever looked at exercise improves muscle strength balance bone density and the immune cardiovascular and respiratory systems it boosts mood and supports brain and spinal health too getting out and being active with people is important for cognitive stimulation and by stressing the body you re also getting it used to dealing with small perturbations lange says just a small amount of activity can make a meaningful difference and resistance training is particularly important he has seen this transform once bedbound patients in their 80s and 90s he encourages people to introduce incidental movement into their day carry your shopping bags instead of wheeling a trolley walk instead of drive or tend to your garden even if you have the healthiest exercise diet and social regimen in the world though you could still suffer from disease when older or younger for that matter the harsh reality is that no matter what you do you re going to die and you can live the perfect lifestyle and still get cancer nothing is certain gregorevic says it s why we must be careful not to judge people for the condition they re in when they re older byles points out that people with certain illnesses such as diabetes or lung disease often get blamed some of it is preventable but not all of it some of it is by virtue of the fact you ve been around a long time and have had a lot of chances to accumulate a problem she says why does ageism matter part of the reason people don t notice their own ageing is because the changes are far too subtle flicker says and people don t actually think they re changing with age their vision of self is deeply ingrained byles adds i have a theory that everyone thinks they re 30 you have a concept of yourself so we always think we re younger which is great but then we can get a shock she believes part of this is our own ageism where we value our youth as more relevant indeed we live in a culture that glorifies youth the acceptance of poorer service provision in aged care reflects an undervaluing of the worth of older people in australia s 2021 royal commission into aged care quality and safety commissioner lynelle briggs found that ageism was systemic in australia the acceptance of poorer service provision in aged care reflects an undervaluing of the worth of older people assumptions and stereotypes about older people and their capabilities and ageism towards them this must change she wrote and a world health organisation global survey of more than 83 000 people found that one in two had ageist attitudes one of the great tragedies of ageism is that people internalise it and develop a negative bias against their older selves gregorevic says one common example of self sabotage is that while young exercisers crave feeling out of breath many older people doubting their capabilities take it to mean they should avoid being active lange says that s exercise and it s getting you used to those challenging activities and the next time you get sick and need some extra heart and lung function it ll be there it s really important not to categorise everybody older than 65 as old there s nothing magical about this age it doesn t mean people are all of a sudden decrepit the idea that older people are incapable of using technology is another misconception and professor linda rosenman board member of the australian association of gerontology says debates about retirement age generate another myth i think it s really important not to categorise everybody older than 65 as old rosenman says this is just the age that people become eligible for government pensions there s nothing magical about this age it doesn t mean people are all of a sudden decrepit not all australian communities suffer from ageism it seems not right foreign kind of says aunty geraldine explaining that indigenous communities focus not on what s lost with age but instead on the wisdom that s gained it s an approach she thinks the rest of the country could learn from loading in aboriginal culture an elder is someone recognised for their knowledge and ongoing contribution to their community and they are not neglected they are traditionally referred to as aunty or uncle we always respect and value our elders respect their cultural authority respect the stories they told us and that gets passed down aunty geraldine says you become an aunty not just to your bloodline but to other younger people as well it s different in other countries too when you re in beijing and you go for a walk to parks they re full of older people doing tai chi dancing there s no sense that i m too old to do that byles says byles who helped create the anti ageism every age counts campaign says people could be enjoying life more as they age ageing is a great individual and societal success we should be embracing it she says credit illustration dionne gain what do you gain as you age the fact is we do typically become happier as we age with research showing older people tend to have brighter moods and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than younger counterparts byles says it s possible this is because older people largely do things that bring them satisfaction you can t do all the things you used to do so you are actually focusing on things that are more important to you she says you use your brain to solve problems throughout your life each time you learn a new strategy you can apply it to other problems and that s wisdom plus she says we often care less about what other people think which can be really liberating and there is a sense of contentedness that comes from understanding with time where you and the puzzle pieces of your life fit people keep improving their vocabulary well into their 60s and 70s and while brain speed and working memory peak in early life this doesn t make 20 year olds equipped mentally to run the country older people have what s termed crystalline intelligence flicker says you use your brain to solve problems throughout your life each time you learn a new strategy you can apply it to other problems and that s wisdom reflecting on her own life rosenman considers herself to have become more patient and tolerant and she enjoys having more time you re not trying to climb the greasy pole yourself any more and you re much more ready to mentor and help other people she says in many ways life is a lot more enjoyable than when you were racing off to work and herding the kids grandchildren are a big bonus ageing is a great individual and societal success we should be embracing it professor julie byles says we should start planning for getting old at least by our 50s credit peter stoop how do you deal with the fear of nearing the end of your life there is of course an existential aspect to ageing that can be quite difficult lange says i ve met patients who have lived too long and have outlived their partners and friends and even sometimes their own children and they have increasing physical disability and sensory limitations but lange says most people reach a point where they no longer fear dying people usually accept it will come which is quite freeing lange encourages people to focus on ageing well rather than fixating on the idea that getting older means they re approaching death which is only one moment at the very end of a life journey flicker agrees i think people eventually realise that if you re not dead yet then maybe life is to be lived and really you should try to enjoy the living as much as you can no matter what is happening at the time loading and it s up to all of us to talk to each other to help reframe the way we view our older years as the aged care royal commission report outlined there are everyday things that all of us can do to enable older people to live their lives to the fullest extent possible older people should also be encouraged to think about what it is that would make them happy and to have some goals or objectives for each day or week that give purpose while many people worry they will end up in a nursing home the reality is most australians do not the same report says about 80 per cent of australians use an aged care program at some stage before their death but for most this means at home support nobody is saying the last years can t be difficult you can be faced with losing people you love while also dealing with your own debilitating health problems but the vast majority of people will be healthy enough to live independently for most of their life gregorevic says we need to remember that life is finite and in a way that that s a real gift like all of us lazarus feels taken aback when he sees his older face in the mirror but says there isn t any age that he wishes to be frozen in i m not sure where i put myself i see this old man and i see myself but do i wish i were 20 again not really he says i can t place myself in any decade because i ve really

jstanleyfx markets to watch dollar still em currencies and earnings while gauging the course of the systemic trends is important in my top down assessment of the markets i also tend to seek the more practical movements that can unfold in the financial system first the dollar if we are heading into a period barren of the us policy updates from central bankers the incredible charge from shorter treasury yields the 2 year hit its highest level in nearly two years and fed funds futures implied yields is likely to flag notably the dxy dollar index has experienced an extreme divergence with these rate sensitive measures in fact the 20 day correlation between the currency and yield hit its most severe negative reading since june 2020 readings of this severity don t tend to last long and it is more often the greenback that conforms outside the pull of us policy there are a range of emerging market events and backdrop risks on the former point we have listings like the turkish central

risk appetite is still elevated at the upper end of the spectrum but the correction for the likes of the nasdaq 100 and s p 500 create a backdrop of instability to determine where the markets are heading over the coming week it is worthwhile to assess the dominant fundamental drive and fed speculation will recede this week aside from us monetary policy china s 4q gdp release is top scheduled event risk us earnings seasonal will fill out and there are some other rate speculation outlets menafn dailyfx qqq nasdaq 100 etf fed forecast dollar usdjpy and earnings talking points risk assets flirt with your emotions are risk appetite trends holding steadfast to their years long bull trend or are there potentially fatal tremors that we should be concerned about depending on who you ask the answer to that question will differ substantially if you are looking for a reliable overall trend it should be far more straightforward when assessing a bullish or bearish view on the financial system underlying sentiment trends wouldn t exactly signal a systemic tide that precedes fundamental motivation through this past week and the thematic focus for the week ahead is facing notable headwinds in

running floor there is a healthy debate to be had over which is more indicative of the market but if you are looking for something as remarkable as a full bearish reversal i think it would make sense to wait until both measures are signaling for the bears before making a call it is a fairly low boundary to wait until a break of 4 600 or 4 550 is registered by the s p 500 before throwing in with a bearish run however if you really wanted to raise the speculative requirement on the market a comprehensive correlation and momentum across international equities junk bonds emerging market assets
