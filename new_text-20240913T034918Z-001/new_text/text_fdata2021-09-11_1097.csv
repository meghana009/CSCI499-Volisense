some pennsylvania physicians are offering stock doctor s notes for use by parents wishing to have their children exempted from wearing masks in school according to state health officials who say they have referred the matter for possible disciplinary action a statewide universal mask mandate for pennsylvania schools went into effect tuesday as the wolf administration seeks to keep school buildings open for in person learning amid the latest surge in covid 19 cases hospitalizations and deaths the acting health secretary s face covering order contains an exemption for students for whom wearing a mask would cause or worsen a medical condition but parents in districts that require a doctor s note or other medical documentation have complained it s been difficult to find a physician who will sign off the health department said that some doctors are pushing stock exemptions that are available to anyone regardless of medical necessity health officials did not immediately say how many doctors have offered such notes the administration is aware that some physicians have indicated that they intend to offer blanket exemptions to individuals with whom they have no treatment relationship and regardless of whether the individual s physical condition required an exemption the health department said in a written statement to the associated press those doctors the department said have been and will be referred to the appropriate licensing boards for possible disciplinary action the pennsylvania department of state which oversees the state medical board wouldn t confirm the existence of an investigation or complaint related to blanket mask exemptions but said it investigates every potential violation it becomes aware of in lebanon county dr joel yeager put a stock four page exemption letter on the homepage of his practice s website the site invited people to print your own copy yeager s form letter dated sept 6 claimed that wearing a mask can cause health problems and asserted that parents are exercising their constitutionally protected right in claiming this exception exemption the letter which spread rapidly and far beyond yeager s territory said the medical practice had received numerous requests for an exemption from both existing patients and from people with whom he had no professional relationship unfortunately many physicians have chosen to abandon their patients in their hour of greatest need many are refusing to give valid medical exemptions from masking or vaccination yeager wrote parents took to social media to thank yeager for the form and said they would submit it to their children s schools one parent from leechburg a small town outside pittsburgh some 240 miles 380 kilometers from yeager s practice wrote that her son brought yeager s form to school but was turned down and then handed a mask to wear tiffany nix the superintendent of leechburg area school district confirmed friday that she had rejected a stock exemption letter they have to come directly from a doctor not a form letter nix wrote in an email i explained this to the parent the roman catholic diocese of harrisburg said its schools received several letters from yeager s practice but asked parents to provide appropriate medical documentation to support a mask exemption said rachel bryson spokesperson for the diocese the link to yeager s form was removed from his website on friday morning and his practice s social media post advertising the form was deleted the facebook post had generated hundreds of comments and was shared more than 800 times before it was taken down a message was left on yeager s cellphone seeking comment yeager has been licensed to practice medicine in pennsylvania since 2006 he has never been subject to any disciplinary actions by the state board of medicine dr gerald maloney chief medical officer for geisinger hospitals said doctors should not give a note to anyone they don t have a professional relationship with and such notes when provided should be accurate exempting individuals from a public health measure without evaluating them exposes those individuals to harm and should never be accepted maloney who oversees clinical bioethics at geisinger said via email the state s compulsory masking order has encountered significant pushback from some parents and students who assert they have the right to go unmasked at school several lawsuits have been filed seeking to get the mask mandate overturned while gop state lawmakers who oppose democratic gov tom wolf s statewide approach to masking in schools and say it should remain a local decision are planning to take up mask legislation at least a dozen pennsylvania districts are allowing students to claim a medical exemption with just a parent s signature an approach the state health department rejects as out of compliance with the masking order there are exceptions to the masking order but a parent s opposition to the order is not one of them the health department said
st paul marketed as an easy to use and convenient way to self diagnose covid 19 over the counter rapid tests seem hard to come by websites for walgreens cvs and other pharmacies list brands of the tests as out of stock even in minnesota where residents have easier access to free tests than neighboring states rapid tests appear to be in short supply having been to a couple pharmacies recently when we were looking for some of those rapid tests they are sold out at a lot of pharmacies in minnesota said dr amy karger an associate professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the university of minnesota medical school amid a surge in covid 19 infections driven by the coronavirus delta variant a renewed demand for the tests has made them hard to find the makers of one rapid test brand in august told the new york times that demand was 1 000 times what it had forecast the minnesota department of health last week cited the demand for tests in announcing the launch of two semi permanent testing sites in lino lakes and minneapolis the move stands in contrast to the closure of several state run testing sites earlier in the summer amid a decline in new cases advertisement testing rates in minnesota which help to gauge the spread of covid 19 seem to still be strong health department spokesperson doug schultz said in an email that labs handling tests last month processed between 10 000 and 30 000 samples a day we don t really know how many over the counter tests are being used daily in mn but it is not likely to be significant in comparison schultz wrote schultz said the health department is also continuing to evaluate to determine if the overall positivity rate is being affected by the absence of reports of at home test results with the exception of the free saliva tests minnesota offers at home tests aren t generally reported to the health department even a case reported by a doctor to the minnesota health department based on a patient s results from an over the counter test performed at home according to schultz would not be recorded there are a number of reasons why schultz said some of which have to do with inconsistencies in information collected by test makers such as zip codes and birth dates and we really don t have any way to validate the test result a patient calling their doctor to report their positive result on the other hand would likely be asked to come in for a follow up exam schultz said although protocols may differ from provider to provider karger who helped advise state officials in their efforts to test for covid 19 had a similar outlook generally speaking the data that department health is collecting is likely accurately going to reflect what s going on she said even if they re not capturing all the tests necessarily in the state they can look at those rates of positivity to kind of get a sense of whether we re going in the right direction or not advertisement test makers and health officials still recommend consulting a doctor and alerting close contacts if you do test positive on an over the counter product
a douglas county superior court judge has denied a motion asking that he throw out a lawsuit filed against the state s recently passed capital gains tax court battle over capital gains tax could rewrite state s tax code washington attorney general bob ferguson had initially filed the motion in mid june challenging the legitimacy of a pair of lawsuits against the tax on a few fronts first and foremost he asserted that the lawsuits represent a matter of political disagreement rather than a standard legal challenge given that ferguson argued that plaintiffs would suffer no legal harm from the tax they challenge and they ask this court to issue a purely advisory political opinion in rejecting that claim judge brian huber cited a court ruling in a previous lawsuit against a graduated income tax in seattle where an appeals court stated that it is well settled that washington courts have the power to hear constitutional challenges to tax laws ferguson s second assertion was the because the tax doesn t take effect until 2022 and wouldn t actually be due until the following year there s no way for plaintiffs to know whether they would be directly affected in any way judge huber again disagreed ruling that the state had not presented sufficient legal authority regarding the extent to which a party needs to be directly affected by a tax to challenge its constitutionality in court ferguson also asked that the two lawsuits which were combined into a single case by huber in july be moved to thurston county superior court in the event that they weren t dismissed a request that was summarily rejected as well washington rep capital gains tax is just parity in the tax code while it is true that the state has presented ample reasons why this court may choose to transfer venue to thurston county the state has not presented any persuasive legal authority that this court must or even should do so particularly over the objection of the plaintiffs judge huber concluded in his ruling the tax was approved by the state legislature in april levying a 7 tax on capital gains above 250 000 to bring in an estimated 415 million in 2023 its first year the text of the bill describes it as an excise tax on the sale of stocks bonds and other assets above 250 000 excepting real estate and family owned small businesses the lawsuits ask the court to void the tax declare the bill unconstitutional prevent its implementation while the lawsuit plays out and have the state pay the plaintiffs legal fees a graduated income tax has been illegal in washington since a landmark 1936 case in which the state supreme court ruled that the state constitution required all property to be taxed at the same rate the court said income counted as property striking down a graduated income tax rate approved by voters at the time follow nicknorthwest

decision to file a motion for remand with vacatur in relation to a lawsuit brought by trout unlimited and other environmental groups against the epa challenging the federal agency s july 2019 decision to withdraw its previously issued proposed determination with respect to alaska s pebble project here we go again said northern dynasty president and ceo ron thiessen it is unfortunate that politics continues to interfere with scientific evidence under president joe biden we once again find ourselves dealing with obama era policies that were inappropriate then and are inappropriate now in the end science and facts prevail over political pressure and misinformation we fought and won against former president obama s heavy handed political attempts to kill the project and we will do the same again in a statement released to the media pebble limited partnership wrote we will continue to monitor these developments closely to determine the possible impacts to the project and permitting process it remains our position that the withdrawal of the preemptive veto by the epa was sound and appropriate this is why we recently sought to intervene in the case in the federal district court in anchorage further all decisions about the pebble project should be made based on the established environmental review process of an actual mine plan a position we have long held the u s army corps of engineers published an environmental impact statement eis for pebble in 2020 with input from many agencies including the epa that states that the project can be done without harm to the region s fisheries or water resources the eis further notes the tremendous economic opportunity the project represents for the communities around iliamna lake where year round jobs are scarce and costs of living are quite high our focus remains on working through the formal appeal process via the usace as the biden administration seeks lower carbon emissions for energy production they should recognize that such change will require significantly more mineral production notably copper the pebble project remains an important domestic source for the minerals necessary for the administration to reach

the waterfront in hoboken new jersey the friends snapped a handful of photos on that morning from vantage points in hoboken which look east across the hudson and towards tribeca where the twin towers

knew she was high up i can t remember what floor but i knew ms lieberman remembered clinging on to the idea that her good friend had shared an office with many men and that they re gonna look after her meanwhile further north in midtown manhattan joe o keefe rushed out of his trading office to board a train to get down to the world trade center his wife lesley had left a devastating yet somehow beautiful message on his phone you can hear her calm voice when there is total mayhem in the background he said telling me she loved me and that she may not get out of this as he reached ground zero the north tower came down in front of his eyes mr o keefe explained basically got there in time to watch her tower fall lesley s message where she was the calm in the storm and so strong mr o keefe

in an international incident something of that nature that magnitude you don t picture your life when you re younger marrying someone and seeing something so horrific to happen to someone you love devastating and horrific are the words that come to mind asked if the september 11 attacks feel like 20 years ago mr o keefe doesn t hesitate absolutely not when news of the attack on new york broke edwina sulimirski remembers feeling frantic and hopelessly unable to help all the way across the atlantic on a family holiday in poland ms sulimirski a tasmanian who had lived in new york since 1999

clear that hope and lesley was gone a memorial service was held for ms thomas across the water from ground zero the rubble was still smoldering ms sulimirski said it was the hardest goodbye she read an australian poem at the service another friend read out a eulogy which recalled ms thomas dancing to men at work s iconic tune down under on a boat cruise around manhattan she loved to dance shele

correction a previous version of this article incorrectly said that scott becker was the executive director of the association of public health laboratories he is the chief executive officer the article has been corrected the covid 19 response plan president biden unveiled thursday envisions a sweeping expansion of coronavirus testing aiming to make quick turnaround test kits cheaper and more accessible than ever as the country tries to quell the wave of infections driven by the delta variant leaning on test manufacturers to ramp up production the administration wants to send hundreds of millions of rapid and at home tests to local clinics schools and other establishments nationwide in hopes of making it easier for people to catch infections and contain outbreaks early major retailers have also joined the push offering at home tests to consumers at less than two thirds the normal price for the next three months the plan could help make home and point of care testing a more routine part of the nation s strategy for managing the pandemic which so far has relied largely on lab based testing to detect cases and steer public health decisions advertisement instead of waiting days for results from slower but more accurate pcr tests more americans could test themselves before returning to school going to weddings or attending conferences and get a reading in minutes it s part of a broader shift away from the restrictions that upended life last year and toward individual mitigation measures intended to help people protect themselves against a virus that isn t going away anytime soon testing has been an underappreciated and under resourced tool said mara g aspinall a biomedical diagnostics professor at arizona state university this is a recognition of the importance of testing as part of our public health response demand for at home tests has risen as the delta variant has caused cases to surge to levels not seen since the worst point of the pandemic last winter pharmacy shelves have been cleared of the popular binaxnow test and other consumer kits approved by health regulators in recent months google searches for home coronavirus test and related queries have also shot up tracking with the surge in cases and the start of the new school year advertisement nationwide pcr testing has neared an all time high approaching 2 million per day at the end of august and topping 7 7 million in total in the past week the number is still below what many experts have said is necessary to stay ahead of the virus and it masks disparities in testing availability around the country scott becker chief executive officer of the association of public health laboratories said the lack of rapid testing became apparent last month as schools made them pivotal to their reopening plans stretching an already limited supply and the nation was already starting to neglect testing as a key flank of pandemic management we don t have the mass testing sites we once did because those resources have gone to the mass vaccination sites becker said quite frankly in the early part of the summer the trend was looking really good pre delta and there hasn t been the demand for testing now here we are with delta and with the depletion of rapid tests and it makes us very concerned we are in a very constrained environment advertisement in his speech thursday biden put the problem bluntly from the start america has failed to do enough covid 19 testing to boost the nation s stock of rapid and at home tests the administration is harnessing its powers under the defense production act a wartime law used to ensure critical supplies are available during emergencies the law has come up throughout the pandemic biden first invoked it in february to speed up production of vaccines at home tests and surgical gloves the administration is planning to spend 2 billion on about 280 million rapid tests and distribute them to a range of facilities including community health centers food banks testing sites and shelters retail pharmacy test sites are also being expanded and medicaid will start covering at home tests free for beneficiaries president biden announced on sept 9 a six pronged plan against covid 19 that includes new vaccine mandates and expanded access to testing video the washington post photo demetrius freeman the washington post the private sector is also playing a role in the plan starting next week walmart amazon and kroger will sell at home rapid test kits at cost up to a 35 percent discount for the next three months biden said amazon founder and executive chairman jeff bezos owns the washington post advertisement this is important to everyone particularly for a parent or a child with a child not old enough to be vaccinated biden said thursday you ll be able to test them at home and test those around them share this article share officials declined to comment in detail friday on how they intend to distribute the tests or why it was necessary to invoke the defense production act which allows the federal government to compel manufacturers to prioritize certain supply orders the dpa ensures that the suppliers have prioritization across their supporting supply chains to ensure they can produce the tests the nation needs a department of health and human services spokesperson said in an emailed statement industry is primed to ramp up production and tests will be distributed to support vulnerable populations and help control and reduce the spread of covid the statement added the investments outlined as part of the president s six pronged plan are critical to keep communities safe save lives and prevent transmission and potential outbreaks and get the pandemic under control advertisement aspinall of arizona state university estimated that there were about 277 million rapid and at home tests available in the u s supply this month she expected a similar capacity next month she and others cautioned that the expanded testing would have only a marginal impact without a continued push for vaccinations and mask requirements and its success in preventing infections and deaths will be limited if the tests don t make it to the places most in need said julia raifman a health professor at boston university testing is helpful it s another sort of individualistic approach but i worry it won t be accessible and people won t be informed she said i think we have a long way to go to make sure they re carried out in populations continuing to get hardest hit by covid one testmaker abbott says it is already revving up manufacturing and hiring additional employees to help with the workload advertisement this surge in testing capacity means tens of millions more tests will be available in the coming weeks and months where they re needed most to help stop the spread of this virus read an emailed statement from the company which makes the binaxnow and id now tests another manufacturer quidel said it was reviewing biden s plan and considering how it will respond to the challenge for covid 19 testing in the meantime we continue to dedicate significant resources to further expand our manufacturing capability as we have been doing now for some time a quidel spokesperson said most take home tests including binaxnow and quidel s quickvue test are antigen tests that look for protein pieces of the virus pcr tests detect the virus s genetic material home tests are less sensitive than pcr tests and tend to be better at turning up positive results in people who are symptomatic than those without obvious signs of illness but they offer some key advantages results usually show up in 10 to 15 minutes and they can be administered at the point of care nursing homes clinics schools private residences most pcr tests are administered at testing sites and need to be sent to labs meaning turnaround time is almost always 48 hours or more advertisement experts say they can also be an important tool for curbing asymptomatic spread of the virus especially as evidence suggests breakthrough infections are more common than thought among the vaccinated although overwhelmingly mild expanding access to at home tests would be a game changer for physicians with small practices especially those in areas where testing of any kind is hard to get said gerald e harmon president of the american medical association if you re symptomatic on a saturday all we have in small town communities is an emergency room said harmon who has a family practice in georgetown county s c physicians could get a head start on recommending treatments he said without having to wait for pcr results if somebody calls me and says doc i ve done this test at home i know what the results are he said i don t have to say let s get you tested and wait 72 hours advertisement community health centers could benefit too rapid test kits are not widely available at community health centers which tend to rely on laboratories to process samples according to ron yee chief medical officer for the national association of community health centers he envisions health centers prioritizing the highest risk patients such as the immunocompromised or people with preexisting conditions who face greater danger from even breakthrough infections to send home with rapid testing kits that would be used by relatives and other members of their households when they return from trips or other places they could have been exposed to the virus we are still working on the vaccines but on the other side the rapid tests are key to mitigating spread said yee but testing at home instead of at doctors offices drive throughs and labs could also backfire if people aren t reporting their cases for quarantine guidance and contact tracing some may not necessarily stay at home and avoid others even after testing positive for the coronavirus said marcus plescia chief medical officer of the association of state and territorial health officials

a panel of judges blocked a tennessee restriction that outlaws abortions because of a prenatal diagnosis of down syndrome tennessee usa a panel of federal judges reversed course friday and blocked a tennessee restriction that outlaws abortions because of a prenatal diagnosis of down syndrome or because of the race or gender of the fetus the ruling also kept a six week abortion ban blocked tennessee republican gov bill lee enacted the restrictions last year as part of a sweeping anti abortion measure the law gained national attention because it banned abortion as early as six weeks making it one of the strictest in the country but it included several other anti abortion components in its multipronged decision the 6th u s circuit court of appeals in cincinnati affirmed previous rulings that have blocked the state s six week abortion ban the law states that if the six week ban is deemed unconstitutional a time frame when most people don t know they re pregnant then the ban would begin at various other gestational stages we take note that state legislatures recently have passed more anti abortion regulations than perhaps at any other time in this country s history however this development is not a signal to the courts to change course senior judge martha craig daughtrey wrote for the majority it is in fact just the opposite the judiciary exists as a check on majoritarian rule abortion rights groups said the decisions bring some relief in the aftermath of the u s supreme court allowing texas near ban on abortions to take effect the u s department of justice has sued over the texas law which allows any private citizen to sue texas abortion providers who violate the law as well as anyone who aids or abets a woman or girl getting the procedure the two tennessee restrictions include felony penalties for physicians found in violation the court of appeals today rightly respected nearly 50 years of precedent by blocking these dangerous laws said brigitte amiri deputy director of the aclu s reproductive freedom project with all eyes on the devastating effect of texas abortion ban this is a welcome news for tennesseans and the rule of law the 6th circuit s ruling on the so called reason bans marked a turnaround the six week ban and the reasons ban were immediately blocked by a lower federal court just hours after lee signed the anti abortion package into law however a 6th circuit panel ruled later last year that the state could enforce the reason bans while abortion rights groups continue their court battle against that law two of the three judges in friday s decision were not part of the previous ruling the new ruling says the reasons ban does not give medical professionals a reasonable opportunity to know when they are permitted to perform an abortion as a result of this ambiguity and uncertainty many abortion providers might well choose to steer clear of anything that could possibly be construed as prohibited conduct effectuating the inaccessibility of a right deemed fundamental under the constitution daughtrey wrote in april the full 6th circuit let another ban on abortions based on a down syndrome diagnosis take effect in ohio reversing two earlier decisions blocking the 2017 law s enforcement friday s opinion cited differences in the ohio law and the facts of each case for the opposite outcome for tennessee the ohio law doesn t include the reasons of race and sex and the ohio case did not address the line of argument against the tennessee restriction that it was unconstitutionally vague the opinion states all three judges agreed to keep the six week ban blocked judge amul r thapar dissented on the reasons ban but also broadly addressed abortion writing that the courts should return this choice to the american people where it belongs the state legislatures can do what we can t listen to the community create fact specific rules with appropriate exceptions gather more evidence and update their laws if things don t work properly thapar wrote and if the public is unhappy it can fight back at the ballot box down syndrome is a genetic abnormality that causes developmental delays and medical conditions such as heart defects and respiratory and hearing problems according to the national down syndrome society about one in every 700 babies in the united states or about 6 000 a year is born with the condition which results from a chromosomal irregularity

christ gorges ceo of farmington hills based quick clinic labs said his company had hoped to have by now 10 000 of abbott laboratories binaxnow tests a rapid test widely used by nursing homes one of abbott s facilities had closed this summer as demand for such tests plummeted but the rise of the delta variant in recent months has changed the calculus we ve been told it will be december before we see one piece of the binaxnow order gorges said friday he said he doesn t blame abbott it s a supply issue as the delta variant and others pose a global threat they ve been a good partner he said of abbott he and others said they now draw supplies from a variety of manufacturers and distributors so that if one supply chain dries up they can turn to another beaumont health has also been keeping a close eye on testing supply chains especially for rapid tests because of the extremely high customer demand the health system has been proactively building up stores of rapid testing supplies according to an email friday beaumont said such challenges have not yet affected its ability to provide routine test results within 24 hours at its peak the lab ran about 1 700 cases a day on thursday it ran 993 it s not yet clear how severely the biden vaccine mandate will further affect the availability of testing supplies in michigan as part of the sweeping plan to boost vaccination rates and contain covid biden announced thursday the federal government will buy 2 billion worth of rapid point of care and over the counter at home covid tests 280 million tests in all from various manufacturers to distribute to schools long term care facilities community testing sites homeless shelters jails and other sites the plan also calls for major retailers walmart amazon and kroger to sell at home tests at cost for most customers and free to those on medicaid the federal government also will distribute 25 million free at home rapid tests to 1 400 community health centers and hundreds of food banks serving low income residents according to the plan but just how soon all that happens is unclear and that in turn can put stress on labs as it did last year during earlier surges of the coronavirus when nursing homes and other long term care facilities had to do regular testing of staff and residents said nick decker laboratory services director at memorial health labs which provides testing for owosso based memorial healthcare and residents in detroit last year when the centers for medicare and medicaid began requiring nursing homes to test it took several weeks to get the testing supplies distributed and staff trained to administer them in house decker said nursing homes contracted with laboratories to run the testing in the meantime there s usually a lag between when someone strikes the pen drafts government policy and when things are fully operational he said compounding the problem is that many supplies have been put on allocation meaning that labs can only order them in limited quantities he and others said i used to be able to stockpile supplies but i can t bump up that stock like i used to decker said and that s a problem as the number of new infections in michigan has risen since early july with cases likely to climb this fall as students return to school and people spend more time indoors as the weather cools labs continue to face waves of covid cases decker said and it appears that michigan may be on the front end of another even as testing mandates pressure supply chains as the waves go up and down you need to be in front of them get ahead of them he said it s too late when it s already here
st paul marketed as an easy to use and convenient way to self diagnose covid 19 over the counter rapid tests seem hard to come by websites for walgreens cvs and other pharmacies list brands of the tests as out of stock even in minnesota where residents have easier access to free tests than neighboring states rapid tests appear to be in short supply having been to a couple pharmacies recently when we were looking for some of those rapid tests they are sold out at a lot of pharmacies in minnesota said dr amy karger an associate professor of laboratory medicine and pathology at the university of minnesota medical school amid a surge in covid 19 infections driven by the coronavirus delta variant a renewed demand for the tests has made them hard to find the makers of one rapid test brand in august told the new york times that demand was 1 000 times what it had forecast the minnesota department of health last week cited the demand for tests in announcing the launch of two semi permanent testing sites in lino lakes and minneapolis the move stands in contrast to the closure of several state run testing sites earlier in the summer amid a decline in new cases advertisement testing rates in minnesota which help to gauge the spread of covid 19 seem to still be strong health department spokesperson doug schultz said in an email that labs handling tests last month processed between 10 000 and 30 000 samples a day we don t really know how many over the counter tests are being used daily in mn but it is not likely to be significant in comparison schultz wrote schultz said the health department is also continuing to evaluate to determine if the overall positivity rate is being affected by the absence of reports of at home test results with the exception of the free saliva tests minnesota offers at home tests aren t generally reported to the health department even a case reported by a doctor to the minnesota health department based on a patient s results from an over the counter test performed at home according to schultz would not be recorded there are a number of reasons why schultz said some of which have to do with inconsistencies in information collected by test makers such as zip codes and birth dates and we really don t have any way to validate the test result a patient calling their doctor to report their positive result on the other hand would likely be asked to come in for a follow up exam schultz said although protocols may differ from provider to provider karger who helped advise state officials in their efforts to test for covid 19 had a similar outlook generally speaking the data that department health is collecting is likely accurately going to reflect what s going on she said even if they re not capturing all the tests necessarily in the state they can look at those rates of positivity to kind of get a sense of whether we re going in the right direction or not advertisement test makers and health officials still recommend consulting a doctor and alerting close contacts if you do test positive on an over the counter product

a 12 story mixed use project pitched for a key central soma site at fourth and brannan streets won approval thursday by the san francisco planning commission despite concerns about future demand for office space in san francisco expressed by several commissioners strada investment group plans a 12 story 185 foot building at 490 brannan st that would provide 270 000 square feet of office space as well as a ground floor childcare facility and 12 000 square feet of production distribution and repair uses largely earmarked for local arts organizations at discounted rents the project will also deliver a 120 seat performing arts theater as part of an agreement struck with community stakeholders despite opposition by residents of the nearby palms condo building and concerns from the commissioners over the amount of office space currently vacant in the city as a result of the pandemic the project passed with a unanimous vote after strada founding principal jesse blout expressed strong confidence the office market s recovery as we have seen in past market correction in san francisco whether during the dot com bust or other times in the market the city has a remarkable ability to reinvent itself on the fly and recover quickly from downturns he said highlighting the green shoots his team is already seeing there have been some remarkable rents lately on some of the premier buildings in the city and we think that our building will compete with those in terms of offerings he said the approved project which would replace a surface parking lot and shuttered wells fargo building would be located adjacent to a light rail stop planned at fourth and brannan streets while the street facade of the building matches the surrounding properties the massing up the building steps is envisioned to create multiple landscaped terraces all of which will contribute to a sustainably designed vertical urban landscape which should be a strong draw for future office tenants said blout it is a healthy building addressing all of the things tenants are looking for now in the era of covid 19 around systems that address healthy and sustainability concerns he said however with san francisco at the forefront of a historic wave of office subleases space hitting the market across the nation and local tech jobs increasingly advertised with remote work as a benefit there is reason for concern san francisco tech giants eventbrite and yelp have given up large swaths of office space in the city s downtown and opted instead to move their primary offices into much smaller and likely cheaper subleases and they re unlikely to be the last companies to do so in the wake of the pandemic given how much we are reading about the large amounts of available office space in the downtown area and very large amounts of available sublease space and a return to work that may involve fewer than five days there may be a significant possibility of increased remote work by tech workers i m interested in your views on the timing of your project what needs its serving and how it fits into the context of what s happening downtown said planning commissioner sue diamond blout countered that 490 brannan would not be delivered to the market until mid 2025 giving strada four years of runway he also said that while the project comes with large floor plates generally preferred by tech giants there currently is an appetite in the market for smaller spaces between 25 000 square feet and 50 000 square feet for startups and other companies and that 490 brannan s floor plates can be divided up to meet that demand blout acknowledged that hybrid work is likely to bring about a structural change in the city but added that according to conversations he s had with business and real estate leaders people are dying to get back into their spaces and start working the city s glut of sublease space is by its nature and interim condition and demand for premium space is unlikely to fade he said but added that the current market could cause the old stock of san francisco s office building that isn t ready for the next wave of companies to be re imagined for hotel or residential uses smaller floor plate buildings that could be converted easily into residential hotel or other uses i think that may be a long term part of the solution he said

bloomberg a key biden administration proposal to collect more tax revenue from wealthy individuals appears poised to be watered down by lawmakers and may even be removed entirely from the democrats tax and social spending agenda according to people familiar with the matter democrats in the house and senate are moving toward scaling back or potentially dropping president joe biden s proposal to significantly limit the tax exemption known as step up in basis for assets passed on at death to heirs the people said on condition of anonymity because the talks are private biden had proposed raising the capital gains tax rate for top earners to 39 6 from 20 if democrats drop the plan to treat death as a taxable event for capital gains for individuals with real estate and other asset appreciation over 1 million then a capital gains rate above 28 would likely cost the federal government money the situation remains fluid with efforts to draft the tax portion of the democrats 3 5 trillion social spending plan expected to run through the weekend the people said the biden proposal aims to both tax inherited wealth and help offset programs like a multi year extension of an expanded child tax credit or paid family medical leave tweaks to biden s plan could mean democrats also have to pare back their aspirations toward equalizing treatment of work income and long term investment income a stated priority of progressives dimming chances third party estimates of how much money the biden administration s plan would raise range from 213 billion to approximately 400 billion over 10 years representative bill pascrell a senior member of the house ways and means panel said in an interview friday that he believes the administration s proposed changes to step up in basis faced an uphill climb for inclusion in the committee s draft legislation downplaying its chances compared to those related to addressing the cap on state and local tax deductions or salt if i was a betting man i d probably think that that does not have as good a chance as of this moment as a salt reprieve or a salt change of threshold said the new jersey democrat who has made repeal of the 10 000 salt writeoff limit a top priority the white house didn t immediately respond to a request for comment senate democrats are already planning for the possibility of scaling back some of biden s proposals by focusing revenue raising efforts more toward businesses than individuals alternative plans earlier friday senate finance committee chairman ron wyden introduced two new proposals likely to be included in the senate s overarching bill later this month an overhaul of tax treatment for business partnerships and a 2 excise tax on stock buybacks that was co sponsored by senate banking committee chairman sherrod brown of ohio such proposals are seen as less politically risky than the 28 corporate income tax rate the white house wants since multiple democratic senators have said they prefer a corporate rate closer to 25 while generating other revenue to make up the difference on taxing gains on inherited assets bloomberg reported last week that democrats were considering larger exemptions 5 million per person and 10 million per couple meaning taxation of inherited assets would begin after those totals democrats were also looking into a special carve out of an additional 25 million in value per couple for family farm property passed on to heirs though that exemption could go even higher when the senate s tax language is introduced later this month farming interests the proposed exemptions reflect the high profile opposition to the proposal from congressional democrats who represent farming areas as well as broader concerns among rank and file members in both chambers over the politics and effects of making death a taxable event for more americans democrats including house agriculture committee chairman david scott of georgia senior house ways and means committee member mike thompson of california and montana senator jon tester have all expressed reservations about the administration s proposal the stepped up basis proposals senator tester has seen to date would have a negative impact on montana s family farms ranches and small businesses and he is going to keep fighting to defend those folks from shortsighted policies that put their continued operation in jeopardy tester spokesperson roy loewenstein said in an email as this important process moves forward senator tester is committed to working with his colleagues to make sure any package is fully paid for and works for rural america 2021 bloomberg l p

by jonnelle marte howard schneider and ann saphir reuters media reports this week that two of the federal reserve s 12 regional bank presidents were active traders has some of the central bank s most vocal critics questioning the rules that allowed them to engage in the transactions in the first place dallas fed president robert kaplan and boston fed president eric rosengren made frequent or substantial trades in 2020 the wall street journal and bloomberg reported earlier this week the trades occurred during a year in which the central bank took major actions to shore up the economy and swooning financial markets after they were broadsided by the coronavirus pandemic while the trades were permitted under the fed system s ethics guidelines their disclosure prompted some observers and a top lawmaker to flag possible conflicts of interest forget about the individual trades said benjamin dulchin director of the fed up campaign at the center for popular democracy a group that advocates for the fed to focus more on the needs of american workers the issue is that a president of a fed bank one of the handful of people who set our country s monetary policy so clearly has his personal interests aligned with the success of our biggest corporations on thursday kaplan and rosengren said in separate statements that their trades complied with the fed s ethics rules they also said they would change their investment practices to address even the appearance of any conflict of interest and sell all individual stock holdings by sept 30 moving the proceeds into cash or passively invested index funds both kaplan and rosengren said they would not trade on those accounts as long as they are serving as fed presidents the changes came after they both faced criticism for transactions made last year dealings that were first reported by the wall street journal this week each has since made his annual financial disclosures public the documents showed that kaplan for instance bought and sold at least 18 million in individual stocks in 2020 mostly tech stocks like apple inc and amazon com inc and energy stocks such as marathon petroleum corp all of those transactions were reviewed by the dallas fed general counsel said dallas fed spokesman james hoard rosengren who has publicly shared concerns about potential over valuation risks in the commercial real estate sector held stakes in four real estate investment trusts and made other investment trades as highlighted by a bloomberg report regrettably the appearance of such permissible personal investment decisions has generated some questions so i have made the decision to divest these assets to underscore my commitment to fed ethics guidelines rosengren said in a statement on thursday calls for greater oversight fed officials are subject to specific restrictions such as not trading during the blackout period around each fed meeting when policy sensitive information is distributed not holding stocks in banks or mutual funds concentrated in the financial sector and not reselling securities within 30 days of purchase but the code of conduct has broader language as well an employee should avoid any situation that might give rise to an actual conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest the code states those with access to market moving information should avoid engaging in any financial transaction the timing of which could create the appearance of acting on inside information concerning federal reserve deliberations and actions the financial disclosures did not look strikingly different from prior years but 2020 was a signature year for the fed in which by its own account it crossed red lines to ensure financial markets continued to function in a rapid fire response to the then unfolding pandemic fed policymakers in march 2020 slashed interest rates to near zero and rolled out programs meant to keep the markets for treasury bonds mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds working smoothly the fed s fast action was praised for helping to stave off a larger financial market collapse an achievement fed officials say helped to minimize the hit to the economy but some criticized the fed s moves for helping to boost asset prices while not doing enough to support small businesses and households on main street some fed watchers say it may be time for the rules to be reviewed this is more evidence that the oversight of the federal reserve regional bank presidents is broken said aaron klein a senior fellow at the brookings institution i don t know if this is a failure to enforce the rules or a failure of the rules u s senator elizabeth warren long one of washington s most vocal critics of the central bank s approach to financial regulation said fed officials should not be allowed to trade i ve said it before and will say it again members of congress and senior government officials should not be allowed to trade or own stocks warren posted on twitter on friday period reporting by jonnelle marte in new york howard schneider in washington and ann saphir in berkeley calif editing by dan

to withdraw its previously issued proposed determination with respect to alaska s pebble project here we go again said northern dynasty president and ceo ron thiessen it is unfortunate that politics continues to interfere with scientific evidence under president joe biden we once again find ourselves dealing with obama era policies that were inappropriate then and are inappropriate now in the end science and facts prevail over political pressure and misinformation we fought and won against former president obama s heavy handed political attempts to kill the project and we will do the same again in a statement released to the media pebble limited partnership wrote we will continue to monitor these developments closely to determine the possible impacts to the project and permitting process it remains our position that the withdrawal of the preemptive veto by the epa was sound and appropriate this is why we recently sought to intervene in the case in the federal district court in anchorage further all decisions about the pebble project should be made based on the established environmental review process of an actual mine plan a position we have long held the u s army corps of engineers published an environmental impact statement eis for pebble in 2020 with input from many agencies including the epa that states that the project can be done without harm to the region s fisheries or water resources the eis further notes the tremendous economic opportunity the project represents for the communities around iliamna lake where year round jobs are scarce and costs of living are quite high our focus remains on working through the formal appeal process via the usace as the biden administration seeks lower carbon emissions for energy production they should recognize that such change will require significantly more mineral production notably copper the pebble project remains an important domestic source for the minerals necessary for the administration to reach

about the issues that matter sign up for our wine club today did you know you can support the nation by drinking wine we have taken a great wound we americans and our first task is to rescue survivors if that is still possible to grieve and to remain alert until we better understand what happened to us the time will come soon enough to sort out the causes who delivered this vicious attack and how we hold them accountable then to assign official blame at home if the facts require it we should also begin deeper arguments about the political meanings the failures in our own leadership and the role our government has chosen to play in the world but right now our minds are swimming in the same ghastly images dazed men and women covered with dust streaming north on foot from lower manhattan a tv videotape replaying the fiendish plot in which commercial airliners are turned into suicide bombs the smoldering ruins at the pentagon the lost skyline in manhattan the bolt of fear where are my children questions spun through our heads but all the circuits were busy terror leaves its sickening residue the swooning sense of helpless vulnerability that is the purpose one odd privilege of being american is that we have had very little experience with such blindsiding assaults at least in modern times other countries became the battlegrounds not ours other peoples were schooled in stoical expectations knowing that the worst can happen and sometimes does but not americans it is essential now to stick to hard facts not fearsome shadows or injured hubris or the xenophobic hatreds already in the air yet the intelligence agencies that had not a clue what was coming were claiming within hours to have proof of who organized the attack and figures like henry kissinger are already calling for an open ended war against terrorist organizations regardless of whether any evidence establishes their culpability civil liberties already under attack were immediate targets legislators talked of granting the fbi and other agencies broad new powers this despite the fact that the fbi is already intercepting a record number of calls some called for wholesale closing of us borders on tuesday only senator joseph biden himself a key supporter of the noxious anti terrorism and effective death penalty bill of 1996 to his credit stood on the capitol lawn to suggest that any incursions on civil liberties should be resisted after the dead are properly mourned after we have reliably established how this happened and who was responsible then we americans must undertake a most difficult conversation among ourselves yes we should speak with one voice expressing our compassion and outrage but we need a multiplicity of voices a true national debate about what sane national security means in the twenty first century the paradox is that if or when we engage in brutal reprisals they will serve a cathartic function for the vast majority of justifiably outraged americans but let us not delude ourselves they will inflame rather than deter in the long run the only way to deal with international terrorism is to build and support international institutions toward that end this is a pivotal moment when we should reconsider our posture toward the world and examine the true burdens and obligations of acting like an empire awesomely more powerful than any others and answerable to no one to maintain international order our military occasionally intervenes in what for us are meant to be casualty free wars our economic order claims to spread democracy by imposing its own self interested rules on poorer nations yet as we learned and should have already understood this great country is vulnerable too beyond imagination whoever planned this vicious attack must have calculated that the united states is at a fragile juncture its great prosperity sinking and uncertain leaders in power they probably intended an unraveling both of financial markets and the national confidence it may seem trite to say so but the calamity does test our character if we are shrewd about ourselves and truly brave citizens will not yield to hysteria or accept draconian new laws that undermine civil liberties but will force these difficult questions into the political debate

the keeneland auction ring has seen future champions sell at every price range and influential bloodlines pass through it the 78th annual keeneland september yearling sale will begin sept 13 and continue through sept 24 with buyers and consignors coming back to the world s largest yearling market in hopes of repeating past success we re perpetual dreamers said bloodstock agent mike ryan we re eternal optimists you ve got to be the keeneland september sale had its first million dollar yearling in 1987 when darley stud management bought brush aside for 1 1 million from lane s end it produced its next seven figure yearling in 1995 and has sold them each year since spending that kind of cash is a high dollar gamble often offset by sought after bloodlines in one particular case for ryan the risk proved worth the reward magic at every stage ryan described good magic as a horse who always did what he was supposed to do at the 2016 keeneland september sale ryan went to 1 million to secure the curlin colt for e 5 racing bred in kentucky by stonestreet thoroughbred holdings good magic was produced from the stakes winning hard spun mare glinda the good he was consigned to the sale by hill n dale sales agency agent for stonestreet bred raised when you pay that kind of money you feel the pressure and heat ryan said the bloodstock agent had pinhooked 2013 belmont stakes g1 winner palace malice from curlin s first crop and liked good magic s female family when i saw good magic he was a beautifully made horse good proportioned not overly big but beautifully made beautiful profile great limbs on him ryan said it was his demeanor and his movement besides his physical it wasn t one of these horses that you re standing there looking at him for two or three minutes it was an immediate positive vibe from him very clean limbed horse and hard to fault him some people might have said i wish he was a touch bigger but everything fit very well he was a bigger horse in motion than he was standing on the shank photo anne m eberhardt mike ryan at keeneland trained by chad brown good magic was campaigned in partnership by e 5 racing thoroughbreds and stonestreet he was second in his first two starts at 2 including in the 2017 champagne stakes g1 before breaking his maiden with a 4 1 4 length score in the sentient jet breeders cup juvenile g1 the performance earned him champion 2 year old male honors at 3 good magic added victories in the toyota blue grass stakes g2 and betfair com haskell invitational stakes g1 while also finishing second in the kentucky derby presented by woodford reserve g1 behind triple crown winner justify good magic entered stud at hill n dale in 2019 after earning 2 945 000 he now has first crop yearlings of which 74 are scheduled to sell at keeneland september as of three days before the sale i have to say i was impressed by his yearlings he s getting his own type meaning that they have a lot of quality they re agile horses they re good movers they ve got a lot of his traits ryan said many of them are medium sized like himself though i have seen some big ones as well but they look like horses that will perform at 2 and hopefully be quality older horses 3 year olds as well like he was he was a very good 3 year old i think he would have won the derby maybe seven out of 10 years he just ran into a monster in justify real big heart it doesn t always take seven figures to buy a champion sometimes not even six figures real quiet the champion 3 year old male of 1998 has helped back denali stud s record of selling saturday afternoon horses the colt bred in kentucky by little hill farm out of the believe it mare really blue outperformed the expectations of him after selling to mike pegram for 17 000 at the 1996 keeneland september sale the colt went on to win grade 1 races at ages 2 3 and 4 while nearly completing a triple crown if anybody told you they thought he was that kind of horse they re lying said denali s craig bandoroff bandoroff recalled when trainer bob baffert and owner pegram caught sight of real quiet at the 1996 sale i remember bob and mike pegram were sitting on the wall and bob jumps off the wall and looks at him bandoroff said he was a good legged but kind of a long slab sided horse and he toed out significantly i was a little surprised when bob was looking at him but lo and behold he buys him for the huge price of 17 000 photo anne m eberhardt craig bandoroff at keeneland nicknamed the fish by baffert for his build real quiet got a good start at 2 winning the hollywood futurity g1 but excelled at 3 when taking the kentucky derby and preakness stakes g1 the other thing i vividly remember is he was running in the kentucky derby and i didn t bother to go to churchill i was with friends and good clients of ours and we were watching the races from keeneland in the clubhouse bandoroff said i remember watching the race and real quiet started to make his move on the turn and i said to myself oh my god i m gonna sell the derby winner and i m not gonna be there photo anne m eberhardt real quiet after winning the 1998 kentucky derby at churchill downs real quiet missed out on capturing the triple crown when victory gallop caught him by a nose i was there for the belmont bandoroff said i m sitting in a box with a very good view and i m thinking oh my god we re going to have sold a triple crown winner victory gallop just got his nose down at the very very last second it was really close of course the triple crown hadn t been won in a long time and i thought we had it real quiet also proved good at 4 taking the pimlico special handicap g1 and hollywood gold cup g1 before retiring with earnings of 3 271 802 at stud he produced 2007 champion sprinter midnight lute and was twice the leading sire in pennsylvania he died at age 15 in 2010 from a paddock accident they come in all shapes and sizes and you can t measure their heart bandoroff said denali opened for business in 1990 and real quiet delivered the operation its first classic winner many years later we picked up the tagline we sell saturday afternoon horses and i ve always believed and son conrad feels the same way that when people walk up to our barn they know we re going to shoot straight with them and they re going to see nice horses bandoroff said but just as importantly they re buying from people that have a history of selling the best real quiet being one of the first high profile ones that s what i think is very important all in the family at the 2004 keeneland november breeding stock sale eaton sales on behalf of a partnership purchased the multiple grade 1 winner take charge lady in foal to seeking the gold for 4 2 million from three chimneys sales agent the one thing i remember about take charge lady was her beauty said eaton sales reiley mcdonald she was the most stunning looking mare and she passed that on to all of her foals i don t think she had a bad one in january of 2005 take charge lady produced her first foal charming that filly lit up the auction ring at the 2006 keeneland september sale and the take charge lady family has continued to produce since the first foal she had was charming who was sold to todd pletcher for 3 2 million and who was just a phenomenal looking filly mcdonald said photo anne m eberhardt reiley mcdonald at keeneland charming won one of three starts on the track but has shined as a broodmare she produced the 2014 champion 2 year old filly take charge brandi giant s causeway 2016 keeneland phoenix stakes g1 runner up courage under fire war front and in 2016 dropped another war front colt bred by the charming syndicate and offered at the 2017 keeneland september sale as part of the eaton consignment later named omaha beach that colt was a 625 000 rna but privately sold to the late rick porter s fox hill farms i called up rick porter who had liked him a lot as had his trainer larry jones mcdonald said i said for some reason you didn t bid on my horse he said i thought he d bring a lot more too much for me so i ll send the guys down to look at him he had promised richard mandella a horse so that s who he sent down to look richard looked at the horse approximately five seconds and said what am i missing here this is the nicest horse i ve seen he ended buying him and the rest is history there omaha beach won the rebel stakes g2 arkansas derby g1 santa anita sprint championship g1 and malibu stakes g3 at 3 and also finished second in the big ass fans breeders cup dirt mile g1 he retired to spendthrift farm with earnings of 1 651 800 and has his first foals on the ground this year mcdonald said omaha beach as a yearling showed traits of his dam s family not huge not small average size big shoulder great depth just a perfectly balanced horse he said it s quite remarkable that he fell through the cracks a little bit but that can happen at that select day of keeneland if you re in fairly early charming was quite beautiful and she threw the exact same conformation as her mother in omaha beach photo anne m eberhardt omaha beach at spendthrift farm take charge lady was named broodmare of the year in 2013 her 2009 foal was take charge indy a p indy and her 2010 foal was will take charge unbridled s song both became grade 1 winners the one that i really remember was take charge indy who had his mother s beautiful body but he had no overstride at all in fact he had an understride so a very stiff walker and very upright in the front mcdonald said but nevertheless he had that beautiful body with the big shoulder that she had we rna d him for very little money 80 000 at the 2010 keeneland september sale then resold him privately to carl bowling take charge indy resold at 2 was campaigned throughout his career by chuck and maribeth sandford at times in partnership and trained by patrick byrne he won the 2012 florida derby g1 and 2013 alysheba stakes g2 on his way to career earnings of 1 103 496 and stands at winstar farm will take charge sold by hill n dale at the 2011 keeneland september sale brought 425 000 from owner willis horton trained by d wayne lukas will take charge was named champion 3 year old male in 2013 after wins in the travers stakes g1 clark handicap g1 pennsylvania derby g2 rebel stakes g2 and smarty jones stakes as well as a second in the breeders cup classic g1 he captured the oaklawn handicap g2 and placed in multiple grade 1s at 4 to retire with earnings of 3 924 648 he stands at three chimneys farm take charge lady was really one of the coolest broodmares i d ever seen that she went on to become as good a broodmare as she was following her racing career is quite remarkable mcdonald said i have great memories and i was very fortunate to be a part of her even though it was a small part like a throwback bloodstock agent donato lanni has played a role in the selection of many top racehorses but a large gray colt he selected for juddmonte farms in 2014 stands outs for a string of particularly impressive performances later known as arrogate the unbridled s song colt was bred in kentucky by clearsky farms which also offered him at the keeneland september sale out of the multiple stakes winning distorted humor mare bubbler and from the female family of champion 2 year old filly meadow star the way the colt presented himself made him one his connections couldn t pass up i showed him to bob baffert and bob instantly loved him garrett o rourke juddmonte u s a general manager loved him as well and that was it we had to buy him lanni said arrogate cost 560 000 as a yearling he became the richest horse in north america earning 17 422 600 photo anne m eberhardt donato lanni at keeneland he was a really big horse and for a big horse he was really light on his feet and very athletic lanni recalled of arrogate as a yearling he had a tremendous amount of bone on him and kind of looked like a throwback like an old school thoroughbred he was just a really laid back really cool horse i remember he was real quiet at the sale and a big giant that moved really well though he did not debut until april of his 3 year old year arrogate closed out that season with wins in the travers stakes and breeders cup classic to secure the title of champion 3 year old male in 2016 in the travers he romped by 13 1 2 lengths and set a track record of 1 59 36 for 1 1 4 miles and in the classic he edged horse of the year california chrome arrogate returned at 4 to take the pegasus world cup invitational stakes g1 setting a track record at gulfstream park in for 1 1 8 miles in 1 46 83 he then went to the dubai world cup sponsored by emirates airline g1 in which a slow start cost him his typical forward placing but he produced a last to first flourish to pull off the victory i get goosebumps thinking about that race at saratoga when he broke from post 1 in the travers and what he did there and then he followed that up with the race in dubai and the whole world got to see on an international stage what he was all about lanni said i ve never seen a horse put together four races like he did travers breeders cup the pegasus and dubai i ve never seen a horse come up with four races like that and of course bob the best trainer in the world what he did with him is phenomenal arrogate began his stud career in 2018 at juddmonte s kentucky operation the stallion unfortunately died at age 7 last year after a neurological illness the racing industry was reminded of its loss sept 6 when arrogate sired his first two winners between saratoga race course and monmouth park he was a unique individual just very different lanni said i was just lucky i got to be part of it as of friday morning there are 50 yearlings from arrogate s second crop set to sell at keeneland september clearsky is also offering arrogate s justify half brother consigned as hip 288 little risk for big reward mark taylor of taylor made sales agency remembers sending a filly from the first kentucky crop of saint ballado through the ring at the 2002 keeneland september sale one who went the way of starlight stables for just 170 000 three years later in that same auction ring future hall of famer ashado set what was then a world record when she hammered for 9 million to john ferguson bloodstock at the keeneland november sale there was a particular pedigree pattern which my brother duncan taylor loved about the mare goulash to go to saint ballado he was obsessed with this taylor recalled we got mr and mrs jones to buy goulash specifically to breed to saint ballado so this filly had a lot of pressure on her from conception on she was always a nice filly she wasn t necessarily the superstar of the farm but she had all the parts growing up she had been a little back in her knees a lot of horses run through that but it can be a sales flaw she had kind of grown out of it a little bit and by the time we got her to september she was in book 1 and she really was a beautiful mover she had a great neck and shoulder really well balanced but if people were taking notes on her they d say she was a touch back in the knee barry berkelhammer was helping jack wolf of starlight stables pick horses at that time and i give them credit they were in love with her walk and her balance and her athleticism photo anne m eberhardt mark taylor at keeneland ashado went on to win eclipse awards in 2004 champion 3 year old filly and 2005 champion older mare her top wins from seven grade 1 victories included the 2004 kentucky oaks g1 and that year s breeders cup distaff presented by nextel g1 what she did on the racetrack was fantastic taylor said she actually became the first horse we sold for starlight when she came off the track and of course she set the world record when she sold at keeneland november so she really came full circle and won all those grade 1 races in the middle she was just a tremendous tremendous horse starlight s luck from taylor made s 2002 draft to keeneland september didn t stop there we sold two grade 1 winners within about an hour and a half of each other it was ashado and

for the first time in over 25 years the celebrated bristol bay red king crab fishery is closed for the season due to an inadequate abundance of mature females the announcement on friday sept 4 came as a surprise to many in the crab industry even those aware of the downward trend in female red king crab since 2012 and a downward trend in bering sea snow crab abundance we appreciate that adf g is giving early notice that we are not going to have a fishery said jamie goen executive director of alaska bering sea crabbers this news on one hand shows sustainability in action she said in that the closure is to help rebuild stocks on the other hand such news is incredibly disappointing and concerning she added further action should have been taken already to help crab stocks rebound she said the crab plan team is scheduled to meet from sept 13 16 and to give its full report to the north pacific council during its virtual october meeting advertisement according to a noaa survey report the total mature male biomass of commercial crab stocks in the eastern bering sea in 2021 was the lowest on record and 2021 biomass estimates continued a declining trend that began in 2015 the decline in crab biomass and abundance was most notable for snow crab with abundance estimates for mature male and female snow crab down 55 and 70 respectively the report said declines in immature snow crab abundance had been noted on the 2019 survey and 2021 abundance estimates for immature males and females showed 96 and 99 declines respectively from 2018 values the report noted goen noted that the crab industry had urged federal fisheries managers earlier for more research and in fact had submitted comments in february to the north pacific fishery management council regarding concerns over unobserved and unaccounted mortality of crab bycatch in the bering sea and aleutian islands the magnuson stevens fishery conservation and management act s national standard 9 on bycatch defines unobserved mortality as fishing mortality due to an encounter with fishing gear that does not result in capture of fish absc said in its comments to the council the crabbers said they suspect that the impact of this unobserved mortality has the potential to be significant particularly from mobile gears like pelagic and non pelagic trawl gear due to the benthic nature of crab species and their inability to quickly move out of the way such unobserved mortality is currently unaccounted for in total mortality estimates for stock assessments or in bycatch prohibited species catch management and we know the number is greater than zero crabbers told the council in their february comments snow crab is down as well and with no king crab the closure is expected to be devastating for crab harvesters this is an 80 million to 100 million take if snow crab is down 50 and red king crab is closed goen said for snow crab this is the largest recruitment failure we ve seen and we need to understand what happened especially given that just a few years ago we were seeing the largest recruitment event in the history of the snow crab fishery absc said in a statement on tuesday sept 7 it s not just a problem for this year our future looks bleak with low recruitment now in all crab fisheries and with these drastic changes come changes in the market supply alaska crab is known for being a premier product many markets prefer alaska crab but losing those markets to foreign production is difficult to get back for most crab fishermen crabbing is the primary source of income it is really difficult to see this happen to the industry for red crab especially for those who depend on it as a source of their income said gabriel prout a third generation crab harvester on the f v silver spray we had hoped the bristol bay red king crab stocks would have rebounded by now after several years of reduced and conservative harvest levels but that is simply not the case coupling this closure with the fact that snow crab harvest levels could be reduced as well even after positive levels of recruitment in previous years has the makings for a very frustrating and trying time for crab fishermen and the industry as a whole in april public employees for environmental protection filed a complaint on behalf of former noaa fisheries biologist braxton dew charging the federal fisheries agency with paving the way for collapse of the bristol bay red king crab fishery by engaging in sampling bias and data falsification which inflated annual population estimates peer contends that this led to a multi year regime of overfishing noaa fisheries had attributed the sudden loss of millions of crabs to a drastic increase in natural mortality and massive die offs claims for which no evidence has materialized the peer complaint said peer also contends that noaa ignored massive indirect fishing mortality associated with record fishing harvests noaa fisheries classified such ancillary deaths caused by fishing as natural mortality and never admitted that overfishing was occurring or that today s nearly depleted stock was ever overfished the peer complaint said we have not gotten a formal response that they even received it said jeff ruch pacific director for peer that s the first time that has happened and our headquarters is a block away from noaa headquarters in silver spring md peer did receive acknowledgement from the post office that the complaint was delivered first by certified mail and then by registered mail he said i don t know what else we could have done except send smoke signals he said

substantial trades in 2020 the wall street journal and bloomberg reported earlier this week the trades occurred during a year in which the central bank took major actions to shore up the economy and swooning financial markets after they were broadsided by the coronavirus pandemic while the trades were permitted under the fed system s ethics guidelines their disclosure prompted some observers and a top lawmaker to flag possible conflicts of interest forget about the individual trades said benjamin dulchin director of the fed up campaign at the center for popular democracy a group that advocates for the fed to focus more on the needs of american workers the issue is that a president of a fed bank one of the handful of people who set our country s monetary policy so clearly has his personal interests aligned with the success of our biggest corporations on thursday kaplan and rosengren said in separate statements that their trades complied with the fed s ethics rules they also said they would change their investment practices to address even the appearance of any conflict of interest and sell all individual stock holdings by sept 30 moving the proceeds into cash or passively invested index funds both kaplan and rosengren said they would not trade on those accounts as long as they are serving as fed presidents the changes came after they both faced criticism for transactions made last year dealings that were first reported by the wall street journal this week each has since made his annual financial disclosures public the documents showed that kaplan for instance bought and sold at least 18 million in individual stocks in 2020 mostly tech stocks like apple inc and amazon com inc and energy stocks such as marathon petroleum corp all of those transactions were reviewed by the dallas fed general counsel said dallas fed spokesman james hoard rosengren who has publicly shared concerns about potential over valuation risks in the commercial

investment decisions has generated some questions so i have made the decision to divest these assets to underscore my commitment to fed ethics guidelines rosengren said in a statement on thursday calls for greater oversight fed officials are subject to specific restrictions such as not trading during the blackout period around each fed meeting when policy sensitive information is distributed not holding stocks in banks or mutual funds concentrated in the financial sector and not reselling securities within 30 days of purchase but the code of conduct has broader language as well an employee should avoid any situation that might give rise to an actual conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest the code states those with access to market moving information should avoid engaging in any financial transaction the timing of which could create the appearance of acting on inside information concerning federal reserve deliberations and actions the financial disclosures did not look strikingly different from prior years but 2020 was a signature year for the fed in which by its own account it crossed red lines to ensure financial markets continued to function in a rapid fire response to the then unfolding pandemic fed policymakers in march 2020 slashed interest rates to near zero and rolled out programs meant to keep the markets for treasury bonds mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds working smoothly the fed s fast action was praised for helping to stave off a larger financial market collapse an achievement fed officials say helped to minimize the hit to the economy but some criticized the fed s moves for helping to boost asset prices while not doing enough to support small businesses and households on main street some fed watchers say it may be time for the rules to be reviewed this is more evidence that the oversight of the federal reserve regional bank presidents is broken said aaron klein a senior fellow at the brookings institution i don t know if this is a failure to enforce the rules or a failure of the rules u s senator elizabeth warren long one of washington s most vocal critics of the

when ellen richmond looks out the front window of the children s book cellar in waterville maine she sees a main street torn up by equipment and talks about how the large infrastructure project going on has slowed foot traffic as the summer wanes but she also sees what it will be like when the work is finished in two years and a host of arts institutions across waterville converge along with colby college in the newly revamped downtown waterville is definitely going to be a destination richmond predicted rattling off details about the organizations involved that show a deep knowledge of her community the opera house has 825 seats railroad square cinema is undergoing a renovation and when it reopens there will be three screens the nearby hotel has 53 rooms this is the worldview richmond has brought to a 40 year bookselling career she sees things for what they are and in the same moment she understands where they are going richmond began bookselling in the early 1980s at mr paperback a chain of independent bookstores that thrived in central and northern maine for half a century before closing in 2012 during her time at the bookstore she staked out a straightforward role and held onto it i got a fair idea of the market and of what customers wanted but without having any responsibilities for any paperwork or payroll she said richmond eventually moved to the waterville location of mr paperback where she worked until 2001 her plans for a next step were derailed by 9 11 but eventually richmond got word that the children s book cellar was for sale she couldn t say no to prepare for the purchase richmond went to her accountant and asked him to look over her stocks and savings i said jim sell enough so that i can pay for it and have some money to play with to start buying inventory she said and so i bought it i bought it outright richmond took over in 2002 as the fourth owner of the store which opened originally in 1987 when the mr paperback chain closed she bought bookshelves from them but she has otherwise kept the same 1 000 sq ft space overflowing with children s books as the store s sole employee working the counter nine to five from tuesday through saturday richmond has raised a generation of readers whom she remembers with the same level of detail she used in her descriptions of the arts organizations of waterville there was margaret who began coming in with her family while vacationing in the summer a history buff richmond started the little girl on ron roy s capital mystery series she later attended northeastern studying archaeology then there was thomas the son of a colby college faculty member who took up the redwall series by brian jacques at age 10 at richmond s suggestion then he moved to the hardy boys insisting on reading them all in order and refusing to move ahead when a copy of 33 could not be found when he graduated high school he friended me on facebook and went off to princeton and is now working in mountain view for google richmond said those are the things that just make this such a special special job children s book cellar has had its ups and downs and richmond continues to profess a dislike for the business aspects of running the store but when it comes to the books on the shelves she has an easy confidence i know the books and i know my customers she said during the pandemic the many arts organizations and other charities in town that richmond mentions have turned to her for just that reason placing a steady stream of large orders for children s book giveaways reading groups and charities as the new landscape emerges around the store richmond said she is interested to see what a successor might do with the children s book cellar and is eyeing the steps it will take to make it welcoming for a new owner should a buyer come along a few years ago she received an indie bookstore grant from james patterson and used it to install led lighting she has also been adding a growing section of books for adults alongside the brimming shelves of children s books but for now richmond said the warmth of community that she experiences because of the bookstore has been deeply meaningful especially during the pandemic in early september she recalled she went to a local restaurant and as she wrapped up her meal a woman came over and introduced herself asking you re the woman who s got the bookstore in waterville right when richmond said yes the woman replied i just want you to know how much i love what you do and what you re doing and i m so happy that you re there it was like wow richmond said out of the clear blue sky this is great

washington senate democrats are coalescing around imposing a new tax on corporations that buy back their stocks to boost share prices and tightening rules around business partnerships that have allowed rich companies to shield profits from taxation the plans likely to be included in the senate s budget bill to offset some of its 3 5 trillion in social policy spending show how far democrats are willing to go in using tax policy to reshape business behavior democrats say the tax changes would bring in about 270 billion over 10 years while pushing companies to invest more in their workers and businesses their emergence is also a sign that democratic leaders are still looking for fresh ways to pay for the spending as other proposals run into rank and file opposition sen jon tester d mont expressed opposition friday to a plan to tax inherited assets based on the gain in value from when those assets were initially purchased rather than what they are worth at the time of death that proposal would have a negative impact on montana s family farms ranches and small businesses and he is going to keep fighting to defend those folks from shortsighted policies that put their continued operation in jeopardy said roy loewenstein a spokesman for tester taxing buybacks may be more unifying cash rich firms such as apple jpmorgan chase exxon mobil and pfizer spend billions of dollars each year to buy back then retire shares in their own companies a practice that can help drive up the company s stock price that has been lucrative not only for shareholders but for corporate executives whose compensation is often tightly tied to their firm s stock performance heavy use of buybacks has come under criticism especially since former president donald trump s huge corporate tax cut was enacted in 2017 proponents of that legislation promised that companies would use the tax law s windfall to boost worker wages and grow their businesses and the economy instead it touched off an explosion of stock buybacks that critics say has made top executives and industry insiders even more wealthy in 2019 the largest american companies spent a record 728 billion on stock buybacks a 55 increase from 2018 according to senate finance committee data sens sherrod brown d ohio and ron wyden d ore the finance committee chair are proposing to tax the amount companies spend on such buybacks at 2 enough they say to bring in revenue while making companies price in the financial risk and distortions that large scale buybacks can pose to the economy instead of spending billions buying back stocks and handing out ceo bonuses it s past time wall street paid its fair share brown said the finance committee is also leaning toward changing the rules that large business partnerships have used to avoid taxation and evade irs audits congress drafted the rules when partnerships were dominated by small businesses like doctors offices but increasingly partnerships are large companies or subsidiaries of major corporations arrayed in complex overlapping configurations to allow their owners to shift profits losses and deductions to evade taxes

the writer a chevening scholar studied international journalism at the university of sussex with the installation of an interim taliban cabinet the process of government formation has marked a step forward in the pursuit of returning afghanistan to some semblance of normalcy mainly consisting of the old guard taliban leaders many of whom have been on the un terror list on the face of it the new afghan cabinet inspires little confidence those who pinned their hopes on the reformed taliban to have learned their lessons and walked the talk are a bit dismayed at the composition of the new government it is mainly taliban dominated and does not have an inclusive and broad based representation from other political tribal ethnic and women groups the fact that the newly announced set up is interim in nature and has been put together to deliver essential governance and stop chaos from persisting still inspires some hope in the final governance model being more representative and inclusive as the world prepares itself to come to terms with the post america and taliban led afghanistan a much detested scenario not long ago pakistan stays engaged with the new rulers in kabul to facilitate the evacuation of thousands of foreigners including journalists pakistan s embassy remains the busiest foreign mission frequented by those looking to avoid uncertainty and insecurity in a war torn country the events of the past few months have placed pakistan s afghan policy at the heart of global discourse the beeline of foreign ministers and other key officials visiting islamabad to hold talks with the pakistani authorities in the wake of the changed afghan landscape represents the recognition of pakistan s central role as a stabilising force in the region at a broader level it also acknowledges the efficacy of the pakistani s consistent position on the afghan imbroglio without pakistan s effective role the doha peace agreement would neither have been concluded for the united states to end its 20 year old combat mission nor would evacuations have taken place at such a massive level after the taliban s takeover of kabul consumed by rage after 9 11 as the us prepared for an attack on afghanistan for housing osama bin laden pakistan advised restraint inherent in this sensible advice was a recommendation to the us to politically engage the taliban as legitimate stakeholders had the bush administration heeded this piece of advice back then the us would not have had to cut and run from afghanistan today and fought the longest war in its history at such a high cost to its global prestige pakistan s afghanistan policy has been informed by an experience of the past forty years as well as the hard realities of a country that is globally known as the graveyard of empires from pm imran khan to fm qureshi to minister for information fawad chaudhry pakistani leaders have been emphatic in highlighting the need for a political solution to the afghan conflict at the heart of this policy has been a consensus between the pakistani civil and military leadership that a military solution will fail to bring about lasting peace in afghanistan and will invariably be followed by more bloodshed strife and protracted fighting in addition to helping the us taliban negotiations become successful pakistan worked with friends and allies as part of various regional peace initiatives to allow for a peaceful and rules based transfer of power duly agreed to by the afghan parties be it the extended troika consisting of the us china russia and pakistan or the russia and china led dialogue process or any other peace endeavour pakistan has been at the forefront of these disparate peace efforts despite the ghani administration s often scathing criticism of islamabad holding it responsible for its own failures pakistan did not shy away from working with kabul to provide a push to an intra afghan peace and reconciliation process in the event of the taliban s takeover pakistan has joined the international community in calling for an inclusive government in afghanistan knowing full well the consequences of failure on this count as the foremost neighbouring country as a responsible member of the international community islamabad has also impressed upon the rulers in kabul the need to ensure that afghan soil is not used for terrorism against other regional countries the reference here is to the renewed threat posed by the ttp led terror syndicate to peace and stability in pakistan pakistan has witnessed an uptick in violence in recent months and these attacks have clear ttp signatures pakistan s afghanistan policy has also sought to advocate global engagement by highlighting the interests of the afghan people the international community has rightly been warned of the consequences of its apathy if an unfolding humanitarian crisis is not managed through greater collaboration and synergy of actions amid reports of depleting food and medicine stocks in afghanistan pakistan is the first country to send three planes carrying foodstuff and other direly needed items of use it also flew a pia cargo flight to deliver who medicines in mazar e sharif the country has offered to establish an air corridor to allow the smooth flow of international aid pakistan s call for global action to help the afghans is also evidenced by the lessons of history when the world left afghanistan to fend for itself after the withdrawal of the ussr this country had to bear a heavy brunt in the form of an influx of three to four million refugees who fled afghanistan in search of physical security according to the unhcr pakistan still hosts 1 4 million afghan refugees in addition to an almost equal number of the same who are not registered the travails of the afghans are real they have been at the receiving end of a global war on terror and a civil war over the last four decades their lives livelihoods and future have been destroyed beyond repair the world s dismissal of and antipathy towards the taliban should be no reason to ignore the common afghans who face an uncertain future with a long and harsh winter ahead the abandonment of the people of afghanistan yet again will lead to the swelling of the ranks of terror outfits such as al qaeda is k and etim etc the regional countries have a special responsibility to explore ways to ameliorate the hardships of the afghans through the timely provision of aid they can either work under the un system or set up their own arrangement to deliver assistance pakistan s afghan policy is pivoted around the goal of a peaceful and stable afghanistan this interest in peace and stability is informed by the consequences of the cold war as well as the us led war on terror given pakistan s myriad security challenges it cannot afford to have a running conflict on its western border more so when the situation on the indian border remains volatile the recent peace overtures launched by islamabad have failed to elicit any kind of reciprocity from india backdoor diplomatic engagement notwithstanding there is little hope that new delhi can break the mould to give peace a solid chance modi s politics remains firmly embedded in an anti pakistan agenda wherein pursuing peace is considered a weakness with indian occupied kashmir bearing the brunt of modi s fascism pakistan does not have any incentive to engage india more than it has already done the us has clearly thrown its weight behind new delhi in what is patently a china containment policy and is not expected to act as a neutral peace broker for rapprochement between the archrivals given pakistan s close and multifaceted cooperation with china islamabad is sure to get caught in the crosshairs of this fierce competition hence all the more reason for pakistan to do everything possible to stabilise things on its western border pakistan s afghan policy is aware of the challenges on its eastern border and is geared towards protecting the country s vital economic political and strategic interests the joint statement issued at the conclusion of the recently concluded foreign minister s meeting on afghanistan endorses pakistan s position and is an effort at evolving regional consensus email amanatchpk gmail com twitter amanat222

new york heart association functional class nyha class for patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy obstructive hcm while other studies have documented this association in hcm this study represents one of the largest multi centered studies that specifically focuses on the obstructive hcm patient population these data demonstrate the importance of assessing nyha functional class in obstructive hcm patients said neal lakdawala md cardiovascular medicine specialist at brigham and women s hospital and lead author on the study we should determine the impact of therapies for obstructive hcm on patients overall prognosis over a median follow up of 3 9 years the data show a 5 mortality rate in obstructive hcm patients initially classified as nyha class i 9 in class ii and 13 in class iii iv risks of all cause mortality and the composite outcome of death or heart transplant increased with worse nyha class at baseline p30 mmhg or septal reduction therapy and documentation of nyha class patients were followed from the date of index nyha class assessment first documentation of nyha class i ii iii or iv to last share visit or death the risks of all cause mortality and a composite endpoint of death and heart transplant were compared across index nyha classes using log rank tests about obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy obstructive hcm the most common type of hcm is a chronic progressive disease in which the heart muscle becomes abnormally enlarged or thick causing the left ventricular outflow tract lvot where blood leaves the heart to become obstructed by the enlarged heart muscle as a result obstructive hcm can lead to debilitating symptoms for patients and has also been associated with

it emerged late last week that communications and digital economy minister isa ali ibrahim pantami or his agents possibly instructed zamfara state governor bello muhammad matawalle to place an advertorial in the daily trust to congratulate pantami on his promotion to the rank of full professor of cybersecurity by an unnamed university in the advertorial matawalle repeated the dishonestly hyperbolized claims pantami cherishes and promotes such as the claim that he has over 160 publications which don t show up in any scholarly repository and that he was trained at harvard mit and oxford even though he only attended a few days workshops there he used the american english full professor that the islamic university of madinah where pantami taught also uses to describe what is simply called professor in british and nigerian terminology since mutawalle isn t an academic it s obvious that pantami wrote the advertorial for him i later learned that pantami s professorship was granted by the federal university of technology owerri where he has never taught it doesn t take much thought to see that the professorial promotion and worse its promotion in the media is some self humiliating intellectual duplicity perpetrated by pantami himself the last academic position pantami held before he became dg of nitda in 2016 was an assistant professorship roughly equivalent to a senior lectureship in the nigerian system at the islamic university of madinah where he taught for two years after his phd in 2014 before earning his phd in the uk he taught at the abubakar tafawa balewa university atbu in bauchi as a junior lecturer at no point in his academic career did he ever teach at the federal university of technology owerri so only atbu or the islamic university of madinah could have legitimately promoted him to the position of professor but he couldn t possibly be promoted to professorship at the islamic university in madinah because having terminated his contract with the school to take up a government appointment he is no longer in the school s employ plus his last rank at the university was an assistant professor to be promoted to full professor he would first need to be an associate professor for at least 5 years but he was assistant professor for only two years and you need to be an assistant professor for at least 5 years to be promoted to associate professor at atbu he was either a lecturer ii or a lecturer i or perhaps an assistant lecturer before he left the school for his doctoral studies to become a professor there he would first need to be promoted to a senior lecturer and then a reader which is called associate professor in the north american system before becoming a professor that would take at least 6 years in other words pantami is not qualified to be promoted to the rank of professor in the two universities he has some associations with most importantly though he is not qualified to be appointed professor by and at any university in the world because he does not teach research or render service at any university now a professorship isn t a flippant honorary title that can be arbitrarily conferred on people who pay for it like honorary doctorates have become it is the crowning accomplishment and the highest professional rank that is bestowed on people who teach and research at a university it s like the position of permanent secretary for the civil service editorship for journalism ambassadorship for the diplomatic service managing directorship or the position of a ceo for the private sector or being a field marshal in the military you can t be made permanent secretary and not work in the civil service an ambassador and not work in the diplomatic service an editor and not work for a media organization a ceo and not be associated with the company that made you ceo or a field marshal and be away from military service pantami is a professor who doesn t profess who doesn t teach research or render service at the university that supposedly conferred the title on him that s a down the line intellectual scam that he should be ashamed of it s one of the most intellectually violent vandalisms of time honored academic conventions i ve seen in a long while as a religious cleric whom many young people look up to pantami should know better than to perpetrate fraud promote it through third parties and then swank it himself with unabashed hauteur if he has any honor and really desires a professorship he should disclaim this fraudulent professorship and earn it the right way after his tenure in 2023 he should go back to either atbu or the islamic university in madinah and spend at least 6 to 8 years teaching researching and rendering service then he might legitimately earn a professorship different universities have different criteria for promoting academics to the position of professor some prioritize teaching over research others prioritize research over teaching still others strike a happy balance between the two if he is too impatient to follow the conventional route to professorship he can get the federal university of technology owerri to make him a professor of practice in cybersecurity after his ministerial tenure this will of course require him to relocate to owerri and actually teach students there professors of practice don t have to go through the traditional protocols of academic promotion because it is their industry experience not their scholarship or pedagogy that is the basis for their employment my friend kingsley moghalu was a professor of practice at tufts university in the united states although nigerian universities don t have a tradition for appointing professors of practice there is always a first time if pantami can bludgeon a university into promoting him to the position of professor even when he has zero formal association with it he can cause it to do anything but to pretend to be a professor when he isn t qualified to be one and when he doesn t teach and has never taught at the university that conferred the position on him is the sort of self debasing fraud a religious leader shouldn t be identified with to be sure pantami s fraudulent professorship isn t new as i pointed out in my june 25 2011 column titled ndi okereke onyiuke s fake doctorate and professorship former nigeria stock exchange boss ndi okereke onyiuke whose phd is fake got her professorship the exact way pantami got his through intellectual legerdemain the university of nigeria nsukka made her professor of capital market studies in 2007 without having ever taught a course at the university before and after her conferral the late dora akunyili s path to professorship was less fraudulent than okereke onyiuke s and pantami s but it was also unusual as i wrote in the june 25 2011 column although she taught at for long she left for public service when she was many ranks away from a professorship curiously however it was while she was officially away from teaching research and university service that she mysteriously skipped several ranks and became a professor in my december 5 2020 column titled ganduje and fraudulent american professorships for nigerian politicians i called attention to the growingly maddening titular vanity among nigerian politicians that causes them to want to be known as professors you see bought honorary doctorates have lost their gravitas and the dr title has now lost its sheen among nigerian politicians so they are moving to the next level which is bought professorships i wrote a u s based cameroonian academic by the name of victor mbarika used to routinely scam nigerian politicians into thinking they had been appointed to professorship at a historically black louisiana university called southern university ike ekweremadu was told that he had been appointed professor at the university ganduje was also scammed by the same guy until his scam was unveiled pantami appears to be leading a detour back to home universities for the conferral of fraudulent professorship on politicians who can pay compromised university administrators fortunately the nuc is now headed by professor abubakar abdulrasheed a conscientious ethically sound thoroughbred academic who has a reputation for doing the right things i hope professor abdulrasheed will cause the nuc to sanction the fut owerri for the intellectual fraud it has perpetrated in promoting an undeserving non employee to its highest academic rank and ensure that other mercenary university administrators don t replicate this swindle in the future i also hope pantami has enough decency left in him to renounce the professorial fraud he wears in the interest of the sanctity of what remains of nigerian university traditions

confirms something that was becoming more and more apparent the kingdom wave 4 case assortment has changed from what we reported almost a year ago slammer and pipes are not part of this wave and will come in a later wave of course this does not necessarily mean an extension on the kingdom line in the temporal sense and could simply be additional waves to ensure that there is enough product on the shelves in the holiday season something hasbro was very adamant about this wave being available at this time also confirms that hasbro has indeed secured a lot of shipping contracts since it was expected next month at the minimum it is still not revealed and has no preorders and if a collectible retailer in canada is getting stock it means these have reached north america and are being

revision 2115721 posted by my preorder for kingdom scorponok arrived today was really excited for it but i have to admit this was the first big whiff for me of the beast wars characters in the kingdom line good stuff out of the way first it looks very good the bot mode is very accurate to his show appearance although a little stocky and the scorpion mode is going for a more realistic and creepy look par for the course for this line so far the transformation is actually very unique love the way the legs both become part of the tail and the included weapons look good in the claws but a couple of issues popped up pretty early on mine first off its a little small scorponok wasn t the biggest character on bw so not a huge issue but he s shorter than kingdom blackarachnia so its somewhat noticeable the bigger issue though is all the red parts are absurdly loose these are the ball jointed legs and the stinger on the tail and they pop off constantly the legs can barely be twisted before falling off and the stinger that thing just fell off in the box i posed it in robot mode with my other predacons and am worried it s just going fall off the shelf and get lost somewhere i m not even sure floor polish will help it s way too loose as i mentioned this was the first bw character from this line that has disappointed me the rest have been anywhere from good to great so not sure what

chart 1 shows that the us stock market is in a long term uptrend relative to the rest of the world the upper window compares the s p to the vanguard all world ex us etf and indicates a recent breakout from a consolidation reverse head and shoulders the lower panel substitutes the s p equal weight etf it too is in an uptrend against the rest of the world chart 1 you may be asking the question if the us is the place to be why look at anything else the answer lies in the fact that individual country etfs like sectors are continually rotating in popularity amongst investors and traders since there are always new ones emerging or fading the point of this article is to draw your attention to some interesting funds that may be about to emerge in that respect i am really referring to relative action as the vast majority of country etfs are already in established uptrends from an absolute price aspect consequently we can refer to these etfs as relative sleepers which are positioned to potentially take over from the us leadership in the event that it should start to falter israel israel is a great example of this positive absolute weak but stabilizing rs combination as the price has clearly managed to break above its 2014 2020 resistance trendline and 65 week ema since the long term kst which you can read about here is also positive there is little doubt that this etf is in a primary uptrend the bottom two windows like all the remaining charts display the relative line to the ishares msci world stock etf acwi together with its long term kst for relative action in israel s case the situation is mixed but promising that s because the rs kst has just gone positive but the relative line itself is just below its 2015 2021 down trendline and 65 week ema chart 2 europe europe has been a relative laggard for some time although some areas notably scandinavia and the netherlands have outperformed the world over the last few years the uk norway and italy may be set to follow suit chart 3 shows that the uk etf ewu has recently cleared a trendline joining the 2014 2018 and 2020 peaks the price is comfortably above its 65 week ema and the kst is positive its failure arises from the fact that the rs line has been unable to seriously clear its 65 week ema since 2014 it s also significant that the ema is currently trading at the same level as the dashed green trendline the effect is that they reinforce each other as an area of resistance which if bettered would represent a very bullish signal especially as the kst for relative action is already positive chart 3the norwegian etf norw is in a very similar position to that of the ewu in that the price has already cleared long term resistance unlike its other scandinavian counterparts norw has not yet been able to establish a trend of improving relative action though it is very close to its 2014 2021 down trendline the rising kst for relative action is encouraging from that aspect chart 4the italian etf the ewi tried seven times to clear the 2009 2021 resistance trendline shown in chart 5 it finally did it earlier this year the trend of relative action has gone flat since april of 2020 with the result being that the rs line is right at the convergence of two trendlines and its 65 week ema since the kst for relative action is in a rising trend it seems likely that this formidable resistance will be successfully overcome chart 5 latin america in 2020 mexico eww broke below significant support in the form of the horizontal dashed red trendline in chart 6 however the break turned out to be a whipsaw that meant that a powerful rally was likely to follow as market participants scrambled to get back on the right side of the market we have already seen an advance which has resulted in a decisive break above the 2014 2021 down trendline however the size of that false downside break should enable the price to power still higher note that the rs line is close to its 65 week ema and 2013 2021 down trendline it has also gone extremely quiet all of which suggests that when it does break to the upside a very powerful rs rally will follow the positive rs kst argues for an eventual bullish relative break chart 6 further south the global x argentina etf has completed an inverse head and shoulders for both the absolute and relative prices the two ksts are also in the black chart 7 frontier markets the ishares msci frontier 100 etf fm recently broke to a new all time high just as impressive was the ability of the rs line to clear its 2018 2021 down trendline and complete a small base a little more improvement in relative action will place the overall technical position in a solidly positive light chart 8the largest country holding for the frontier markets etf is in vietnam the vaneck vectors vietnam etf vnm is featured in chart 9 its technical picture is very similar to the european etfs described earlier whereby the price itself has broken above significant resistance and the rs line is poised to violate its long term down trendline chart 9egypt has tentatively violated its 65 week ema and 2014 2021 down trendline it needs to be watched closely since the long term kst for the absolute price and that of the relative one are not yet in a uniform ally bullish trend the overall technical action though does qualify as a potential sleeper chart 10good luck and good

in search of higher prices shale oil producers have reined in upstream capex over the last couple of years before 2019 they were focused on ever increasing incremental production growth and often bragged about their year over year compound annual growth rate cagr in investor publications no more the oil price crash of 2020 having led to near bankruptcy scenarios for some of them has initiated a much more austere mindset in the boardrooms of many companies many are heavily laden with legacy debt from those free wheeling days of not very long ago now thanks to a doubling of oil prices since the first of the year and sharply reduced capital expenditures capex these companies are producing prodigious amounts of operating cash flow ocf capex is now held to what the industry calls maintenance capex enough only to maintain production at levels only sufficient to replace natural field declines or a low single digit growth rate these companies are now focused on two things the first is repairing their balance sheets by paying down debt the second is attracting and retaining investors by rewarding them with a good chunk of the startling amount of excess cash they are generating author s research company filings as you can see in the table above many of the companies listed are generating huge volumes of cash in excess of what s required to support their current dividends this gives rise to the potential for additional capital returns to shareholders in the coming quarters this excess cash gives a measure of security to yield and income seeking investors that these increasingly generous programs are funded internally without resort to debt or capital raises it further insulates them from an investor s worst fear capital loss in this article we will discuss how this return of capital is taking place and the relative under valuation of the traditional energy sector as compared with other sectors under valuation in traditional energy companies there are two primary vehicles for these companies to distribute this wealth to shareholders one is through increased dividends and the other is through advantageous stock repurchases many of the first group in the lightly gray shaded rows have been giving increased dividends and share repurchases priority due to a feeling their common stock is undervalued by the market they have reasons for this suspicion if you compare the valuations for the energy sector against the valuations other industries are receiving there is a substantial disconnect between cash flow and the earnings multiples investors are willing to pay valuation methods can vary operations cash flow or ocf is one i use frequently as it tells you how much cash the company s business generated over a period of time it also tells you about the company s ability to continue meeting capital expenditures capex on a regular basis without resorting to credit lines or common shareholder diluting capital raises it also tells you the amount of cash available to meet stockholder expectations of capital returns or dividends and share repurchases related the major problem with evs no one is talking about as an example let s compare the cash generation between occidental petroleum nyse oxy and nextera energy nyse nee one company produces oil and gas primarily and the other participates in the green energy sector building windmill farms for electricity generation author s research company filings investors in nextera are looking past a mountain of debt to award the company a capitalization of 168 bn at the current share price of 85 some of this is understandable given the figurative wind at the back of this industry windfarms could be the tulip craze of the modern era and are endorsed and sanctioned by local state and the federal government however if dividend security is analyzed using conventional metrics in the table above investors in oxy should be sleeping much better at night than those holding shares of nee at some point investors in nee may have to come to grips with the fact that as attractive as this sector is socially it is not generating returns sufficient to maintain generous dividends being offered analysts are beginning to take note of the cash generation being seen in the american upstream oil industry scott gruber of citibank nyse citi recently put out a bullish note on oxy citing the company s cash flow yield of 13 for 2022 his short term estimate for the stock includes growth to 35 per share when all of this is considered you can understand why execs at oxy are anxious to finish their deleveraging over the next year vicki hollub ceo at oxy commented on the coming shift in capital allocation priorities once debt targets are insight we have significantly de risked our balance sheet with the successful completion of our recent debt tenders and this marks the next stage of our deleveraging effort as we work to further reduce debt and to lower our breakeven while we still have work to do before transitioning to the next stage of our cash flow priorities including returning additional capital to shareholders we re confident that the steps we have completed to date and the strong operational performance that we continue to deliver will accelerate our progress oxy filings another company devon energy nyse dvn has already begun returning capital to shareholders in the form of an innovative dividend policy and share repurchases jeff ritenour cfo of dvn commented in their recent analyst call about capital allocation i would say the share repurchases is certainly moving up the list of options for us potential options for us as we move through the back half of this year we could absolutely supplement it with some incremental variable dividends and potentially some incremental share repurchases i think the other thing we ll look at as we get further into the year and probably into 2022 is the potential to increase the fixed dividend as well dvn company filings dvn s newly implemented dividend policy includes a modest regular dividend of 0 44 per share combined with a special dividend that constitutes a plan to return as much as 50 of excess cash to investors dvn company filings advertisement your takeaway many factors have resulted in the under valuation of the traditional energy sector fluctuating oil and gas prices have annihilated balance sheets in prior years now improved products prices have opened a window for these companies to repair pay down debt those balance sheets and return capital to shareholders related why bitcoin miners are setting up shop in texas oilfields at present this cash generation potential is under appreciated by the market we don t think this will be the case for long and investors looking for growth and income should consider if investing in traditional energy producers fits their risk profile attractive capital return plans and very shareholder friendly management could set the table for a very
