global economic growth prospects are holding strong for this year and next despite a significant majority of economists in reuters polls warning new variants of the coronavirus pose the biggest risk to that outlook a global survey of nearly 500 economists taken this month also concluded recent rising inflation in key economies around the world would be transitory the global economy was now forecast to expand a sizzling 6 0 this year which would be its fastest in nearly half a century followed by a still robust 4 5 in 2022 both were marginal increases from the april poll slightly more than half the 48 economies polled on each quarter were upgraded for both years but a surge in the latest variant of the virus which has kept the delayed tokyo 2020 olympics an event without spectators is a reminder vaccinations may have improved but the pandemic has not gone away in recent weeks financial markets have caught up to the idea that the covid crisis is not entirely over the delta variant adds to the challenge raising the number of cases and the threshold for herd immunity said ethan harris global economist at bank of america securities overall we see the delta surge as a moderate headwind to global growth but as new information comes in we can be persuaded otherwise financial markets are on edge ahead of the u s federal reserve s meeting this week where policymakers are grappling with increased coronavirus infections and a disrupted global supply chain that could induce more price pressures as for risks to the global economy nearly 80 of economists or 160 of 202 responding to an extra question said the biggest was a spread of new coronavirus variants over 70 of economists or 152 of 209 said the current uptrend in global inflation was transitory but respondents upgraded their 2021 inflation forecasts for 35 of 48 economies polled on and 31 of them for next year at the same time there were 29 economies with growth upgrades for this year and 26 for next suggesting some price stickiness what makes market pricing in the u s more instructive is that they clearly rate the fed s policy willingness to look through higher inflation as being credible this is at a time when u s inflation has surprised to the upside again and is leading a spate of upside surprises across dms and some ems said christian keller head of economics research at barclays while economists expected the fed to end its bond buying program by end 2022 with a few more analysts now predicting a rate hike as early as next year the bank of japan and the bank of england were predicted to keep policy unchanged through to the end of next year the european central bank meanwhile will start tapering its pandemic related asset purchases sometime after its september meeting and stop buying them by the end of march while developed economies have handled the pandemic with massive vaccination drives emerging ones are still dealing with shortages of doses vaccination remains the key noted vishwanath tirupattur strategist at morgan stanley risks remain elevated in countries with low vaccine penetration especially in south and south east asia africa and other em economies in china the world s second biggest economy economic growth likely slowed sharply to 8 1 in the second quarter from a record 18 3 in january march as new covid 19 outbreaks have weighed on consumer spending economists expected australia s resource heavy economy to take a hit this quarter from renewed lockdown restrictions and india s economic rebound was also predicted to lose momentum brazil s economy was forecast to extend its jobless recovery after this year s inflation surge while prospects for growth in mexico looked brighter how labour markets recover or adapt effectively once government support schemes lapse will also be key in coming months to both the growth and inflation outlook jobless rates were broadly expected to remain above pre covid 19 levels in coming years including in the united states where the pace of hiring has been very strong in recent months according to michael every global strategist at rabobank a weak atomized global labour market acts as a huge structural headwind to sustained wage inflation and thus to sustained inflation in general source reuters reporting by shrutee sarkar analysis by indradip ghosh polling and additional reporting by the reuters polls team in bengaluru and bureaus in shanghai tokyo london istanbul johannesburg and buenos aires editing by ross finley and steve orlofsky

file in this friday may 21 2021 file photo customers view the new 24 imac desktop computers in an apple store in new york three tech companies that have amassed unparalleled influence while reshaping the way we live released their latest quarterly report cards in a flurry late tuesday july 27 2021 although apple microsoft and google owner alphabet inc make their money in different ways the results for the april june period served as another reminder of the clout they wield and why government regulators are growing increasingly concerned about whether they have become too powerful ap photo mark lennihan file three tech companies apple microsoft and google owner alphabet reported combined profits of more than 50 billion in the april june quarter underscoring their unparalleled influence and success at reshaping the way we live although these companies make their money in different ways the results served as another reminder of the clout they wield and why government regulators are growing increasingly concerned about whether they have become too powerful recommended videos the massive profits pouring into each company also illustrated why they have a combined market value of 6 4 trillion more than double their collective value when the covid 19 pandemic started 16 months ago apple apple s first iphone model capable of connecting to ultrafast 5g wireless networks continued to power major increases in quarterly revenue and profits for tech s most valuable company with iphone sales posting double digit growth over the previous year for the third consecutive quarter apple s profit and revenue for the april june period easily exceeded analyst estimates the cupertino california company earned 21 7 billion or 1 30 per share nearly doubling profits earned during the same period last year revenue surged 36 to 81 4 billion but in a tuesday conference call with analysts apple ceo tim cook lamented that the steadily spreading delta variant of the coronavirus is casting doubt on how the rest of the year will unfold the road to recovery will be a winding one cook said that uncertainty has already led apple to delay employees mass return to its offices from september to october most of apple s stores though are already open the iphone 12 released last autumn is shaping up to be apple s most popular model in several years largely because it s the first to work on the 5g networks that are still being built around the world apple s iphone sales totaled nearly 40 billion in the latest quarter up 50 from a year ago apple s services division the focal point of a high profile trial revolving around the commissions it collects from iphone apps saw revenue climb 33 from last year to 17 5 billion a potentially game changing decision from the trial completed in may is expected later this summer among apple s upcoming challenges is whether shortages of computer chips and other key parts will force the company to delay its next iphone this year as it did last year while apple expects revenue to rise 10 in the current quarter it said it may have more trouble getting parts for iphones and ipad during the upcoming months executives skirted questions about another possible iphone delay alphabet google s earnings improved markedly over the year ago period when the pandemic was starting to bite consumer spending and its partner advertising now that vaccines have allowed people to shed the shackles of the pandemic and splurge again a big chunk of that pent up demand has spurred advertisers to spend more too with a big chunk going to google and its corporate parent alphabet inc powered by google alphabet earned 18 53 billion or 27 26 per share during the quarter a nearly threefold increase from last year s earnings of 6 96 billion or 10 13 per share google s advertising revenue soared 69 to 50 44 billion thanks to what ceo sundar pichai called a rising tide of online activity among consumers and businesses retail along with travel and entertainment ads were the biggest contributors to the revenue increase the company said total revenue surged 62 from last year to 61 88 billion revenue after subtracting tac or traffic acquisition costs was 50 95 billion the april june quarter looks particularly strong since the 2020 downturn forced google to report its first decline in quarterly ad revenue from the previous year analysts were expecting alphabet to earn 19 24 per share on revenue of 56 2 billion and 46 2 billion after subtracting tac alphabet s stock jumped 135 or 5 1 to 2 773 in after hours trading after the results microsoft microsoft on tuesday reported fiscal fourth quarter profit of 16 5 billion up 47 from the same period last year net income of 2 17 per share beat wall street expectations the software maker also topped forecasts by posting revenue of 46 2 billion in the quarter that ended on june 30 a 21 increase over the same time last year analysts were expecting microsoft to earn 1 91 per share for the april june quarter on revenue of 44 1 billion microsoft profits have soared throughout the pandemic thanks to ongoing demand for its software and cloud computing services for remote work and study after an initial dip in after hours trading the company s shares later recovered and were up by less than 1 growth in sales of microsoft s cloud services which compete with amazon and other companies and its office productivity tools for handling work documents and email both outpaced overall revenue growth the company s historical pillar personal computing grew just 9 in the quarter microsoft

recently some of the richest landmarks and countries of the world have come to an agreement concerning the closing of international tax loopholes that have been endorsed by the biggest multinational corporations some of these tech companies have the largest share prices within the stock market such as apple amazon google and so on while tech taxation has long been an issue that international governments have had to agree on between themselves betting too shares similar problems especially due to its increase in popularity and allowed legalisation globally here we have provided a comparison of new betting sites which follow through on the correct taxation laws and legalities necessary for international usage during the g7 summit which our last reports spoke about the topic of brexit and trade deals representatives of the united states france germany united kingdom canada italy and japan came to a unified agreement to support the global corporation tax rates of at least 15 it was in agreement that this should happen as these corporations should pay taxes where their businesses are in operation and to the land they operate in tax evasion has long been propagated using initiatives and loopholes found by corporation entities this unanimous decision will put a stop to hold tech companies responsible this decision is believed to be years in the making and the g7 summits have long wanted to reach an agreement to make history and reform the global taxation system for the rising innovation and digital age that is on the horizon making companies like apple amazon and google take accountability will keep taxation in check for what is estimated to be the surge of their developments and involvement overseas rishi sunak the united kingdom s chancellor of the exchequer has mentioned that we are in the economic crisis of the pandemic companies need to hold their weight and contribute to the reformation of the global economy reformed taxation is a step forward in achieving that global tech companies such as amazon and apple have massively increased in shareholder prices for each quarter after the major drop last year making tech one of the most sustainable sectors to obtain taxes from of course not all would agree on such comments being that taxation loopholes have long been a thing and issue of the past the deal agreed upon will put massive pressure on other countries during the g20 meeting that is to occur in july having a base of agreement from the parties of g7 makes it very likely that other countries will come to an agreement with nations such as australia brazil china mexico etc who are to be in attendance lower tax haven countries like ireland will expect lower rates with a minimum of 12 5 where others may be higher depending it was expected that the 15 percent tax rate would be higher at the level of at least 21 and countries who agree with this believe that a base level of 15 should be set with possibilities of more ambitious rates depending on destination and region that multinational companies operate and pay taxes from this article contains sponsored links advertisement share this article
a barge and support boats work on cable installation near woronkofski island in july photo courtesy of trey acteson southeast alaska power agency companies installed a new underwater electrical transmission line between wrangell and petersburg in july some work remains before that new power line is supplying electricity to petersburg and it s not yet clear what broke the old cable the new three and a half miles of transmission line replaces a section of the southeast power grid that failed in september of 2019 it s between vank and woronkofski islands near wrangell and crosses a section of the stikine strait that gets as deep as 700 feet trey acteson is ceo of the southeast alaska power agency which sells hydroelectricity to utilities in ketchikan wrangell and petersburg he said the work has gone well folks might have saw the barge out there over the fourth of july period acteson said we mobilized up there right at the beginning of the month and the installation removal barge mobilized with a couple of tugs and three more other boats support boats and then also a dive boat as well seapa is contracting with japanese multinational sumitomo along with several subcontractors for manufacturing and installation of the new power line along with removal of the old one that failed the old line dates back to the early 1980s it s one of four single phase conductors used to transport power between islands workers were able to pull up the three and a half inch diameter cable and found it had almost completely broken in one spot with one remaining strand of the line stretched about 20 30 meters acteson did not see any wearing on the outside of the line and said it s too early to draw any conclusions on the cause of the failure of course the insurance company is going to do their own investigation and try to make a determination on the root cause of the failure acteson said just simple observation of the ends that were retrieved it appears that there was a sudden breakage in the cable so some type of an underwater event triggered that it could have been sediment maybe perhaps a cornice of sediment that had built up on top of a ledge there and it cut loose and had broken the cable or something of that nature the broken power cable photo courtesy of trey acteson southeast alaska power agency workers used a remotely operated vehicle in retrieving that old power line and positioning the new one on the ocean floor acteson said they avoided and later retrieved a number of lost boat anchors in that installation the new power line and the old photo courtesy of trey acteson southeast alaska power agency the new power line cost millions to manufacture and ship over from japan acteson described watching the precision work so first of all there s that kind of nervous part where you have to cut the cable and you got to make sure it s correct he said so they have three different ways of measuring that cable length just to confirm that they ve got it correct because you know first all you ve got the cable pulled up from the bottom and it s hanging off the back of the boat so you have some angles and some calculations and then you have the distance to shore and then you have the distance that you have to take it up to the final terminations and it cant be too long the old link is comprised of four separate power lines with one redundant each providing one part of the three phase electricity it s the same system used on seapa s other submarine cable crossings the three that remained kept petersburg connected to cheap hydro power for nearly two years petersburg s utility director karl hagerman noted the community would have been forced to rely on much more costly diesel power during that time if any of the other three lines had gone yes everybody at the power plant is breathing much easier to have that cable in place and knowing that that redundancy is there hagerman said the new cable around six inches in diameter has all three conductors bundled together the power provider can still use the old group of three remaining cables along with this new connection as needed it ll be another two to three weeks to complete the connection and test the transition from the underwater line to above ground power lines customers in petersburg will notice backup diesel generators running from time to time while that work continues the power provider has had several large expansion projects over the past few decades seapa connected its two hydroelectric plants one near ketchikan and one near wrangell in 2009 it also boosted capacity raising the level of the swan lake dam near ketchikan in 2016 but this cable work is one of the largest replacements of the original system seapa s acteson noted it s another good example of spreading out the cost of major projects to the three communities for just a single community to have to take on a 10 20 million dollar project by themselves that s a heavy lift and when you can spread those costs over a wider base it really benefits all at the end of the day he said seapa is bonding for more than 13 million dollars with the alaska municipal bond bank to pay for the work the seapa board this fall is expected to consider increasing the wholesale cost of electricity to repay that debt that could mean incremental rate hikes for the utilities in all three communities

dallas business wire matador resources company nyse mtdr matador or the company today reported financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2021 a short slide presentation summarizing the highlights of matador s second quarter 2021 earnings release is also included on the company s website at www matadorresources com on the events and presentations page under the investor relations tab second quarter 2021 management summary comments joseph wm foran matador s chairman and ceo commented on both our website and the webcast planned for tomorrow s earnings conference call is a set of six slides identified as chairman s remarks slides a through f to add color and detail to my remarks we invite you to review these slides in conjunction with my comments below which are intended to provide context for the second quarter of 2021 compared to matador s goals for the year record results in second quarter 2021 the second quarter of 2021 was an outstanding quarter for matador highlighted by record operational and financial achievements see slide a including a significant increase in net income and all time quarterly highs for oil and natural gas production oil and natural gas revenues adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow san mateo also delivered record results in the second quarter highlighted by all time quarterly highs for third party midstream revenues net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow see slide b the board and i would like to acknowledge and express our sincere appreciation to both the matador and san mateo teams for their strong execution once again in the second quarter net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter was 258 2 million a 52 sequential increase leading to second quarter 2021 adjusted free cash flow of 156 3 million a sequential increase of 145 and an all time quarterly high this adjusted free cash flow included 16 3 million in performance incentives received by matador from our midstream joint venture partner five point associated with turning the first 13 voni wells to sales in the stateline asset area in the second quarter given this strong free cash flow matador repaid 100 million in borrowings outstanding in the second quarter of 2021 matador has now reduced the borrowings outstanding under its reserves based revolving credit facility by 235 million or essentially half of the prior borrowings outstanding during the past three quarters as a result matador s leverage ratio under the reserves based credit facility has now declined to 1 8x see slide c which marks the lowest leverage ratio in two years dating back to the second quarter of 2019 matador expects to use a significant portion of its free cash flow in future periods to continue reducing the borrowings outstanding under its reserves based credit facility and paying quarterly dividends to shareholders operations tracking key 2021 milestones including strong well results and improved capital efficiency matador s 2021 priorities and milestones are shown in slide d and we continue to be on schedule or even slightly ahead of this operating and capital efficiency plan for 2021 during the second quarter of 2021 we achieved our second key operational milestone when we turned to sales in april the first 13 voni wells in the stateline asset area just recently we achieved our third key operational milestone when we turned to sales four wells all two mile second bone spring completions in the greater stebbins area we remain very pleased with the continued better than expected well performance being achieved all across our acreage position in the delaware basin but we are particularly excited by the better than expected well performance we continue to achieve in the stateline asset area and in the rodney robinson wells in the western portion of the antelope ridge asset area in fact the first six rodney robinson wells turned to sales in late march 2020 in aggregate achieved payout in approximately one year and the first 13 boros wells turned to sales in september 2020 in aggregate achieved payout in approximately nine months all despite being turned to sales in 2020 during periods of significantly lower oil and natural gas prices than we enjoy today further we currently expect the initial 13 voni wells in aggregate to achieve payout even quicker than the first 13 boros wells matador s drilling and completion costs and operating efficiencies continue to improve drilling and completion costs averaged 615 per completed lateral foot in the second quarter of 2021 an all time quarterly low and 655 per completed lateral foot in the first six months of 2021 approximately 4 below expectations see slide e this improvement in capital efficiency through our transition to drilling and completing longer laterals has been and continues to be a high priority for matador matador expects that 98 of the wells it turns to sales this year should have completed lateral lengths of two miles or longer looking ahead we are today announcing two important modifications to our anticipated operated and non operated activities for the second half of 2021 first as the operations team continues to reduce drilling times for wells in the stateline asset area we are now expecting to advance completion operations for the next 11 voni wells currently being drilled entirely into the fourth quarter of 2021 as opposed to completing most of those wells in the first quarter of 2022 accelerating these completions should allow us to make more capital efficient use of two stimulation crews during the fall of 2021 and into early 2022 which should enable us to turn this next group of voni wells to sales two to three months earlier in 2022 than previously anticipated but will defer some of our expected fourth quarter 2021 production until after the first of next year second we now expect to participate in approximately 2 3 net fewer non operated well opportunities during 2021 as a result of certain of matador s operating partners deferring activity from 2021 into 2022 given the cost savings in operated d c e capital expenditures matador has achieved thus far in 2021 the capital efficiency this change provides us and the anticipated savings from fewer non operated well opportunities during the remainder of 2021 we believe we can accelerate completion operations on the 11 new voni wells in the fourth quarter of 2021 without increasing our total estimated d c e capital expenditures for full year 2021 further given our strong start during the first two quarters of 2021 we also expect to achieve our full year 2021 production guidance despite the loss of production resulting from fewer non operated wells being turned to sales in the second half of 2021 and the deferral of production in the stateline asset area from the fourth quarter into the first quarter of 2022 as currently producing wells are expected to be shut in during completion operations on the next 11 voni wells additional details on these modifications to our operating plan and updates to our third and fourth quarter production estimates are provided in more detail later in this earnings release see slide f we are also pleased to announce that san mateo has recently secured several new midstream opportunities with new and existing customers in eddy county new mexico we salute the san mateo team for their successful business development efforts and look forward to these new natural gas oil and water volumes being connected to san mateo s system as a result we have increased our anticipated full year 2021 midstream capital expenditures by approximately 15 million to connect these new midstream volumes and to be ready for first production from matador s next 11 voni wells in early 2022 we expect san mateo to continue to generate free cash flow in the second half of 2021 and have increased our estimates for san mateo s adjusted ebitda by approximately 10 million for full year 2021 we believe the second half of 2021 will continue to be exciting for matador and its stakeholders as we work to generate additional free cash flow lower costs reduce debt pay dividends to our shareholders and grow the value of our oil and natural gas and midstream assets we look forward to finishing 2021 in a capital efficient manner to set up even stronger value creation for matador stakeholders in 2022 and beyond second quarter 2021 financial and operational highlights net cash provided by operating activities and adjusted free cash flow second quarter 2021 net cash provided by operating activities was 258 2 million gaap basis leading to second quarter 2021 adjusted free cash flow a non gaap financial measure of 156 3 million a 2 5 fold increase from adjusted free cash flow of 63 9 million in the first quarter of 2021 net income earnings per share and adjusted ebitda second quarter 2021 net income gaap basis was 105 9 million or 0 89 per diluted common share a significant improvement from net income of 60 6 million in the first quarter of 2021 and a year over year increase from a net loss of 353 4 million in the second quarter of 2020 the change in net income between the year over year periods was significantly impacted by a non cash full cost ceiling impairment of 324 0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2020 second quarter 2021 adjusted net income a non gaap financial measure was 121 7 million or 1 02 per diluted common share a 44 sequential increase from adjusted net income of 84 5 million in the first quarter of 2021 and a significant year over year increase from an adjusted net loss of 3 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings before interest expense income taxes depletion depreciation and amortization and certain other items adjusted ebitda a non gaap financial measure were 261 0 million a 32 sequential increase from 198 1 million in the first quarter of 2021 and a 143 year over year increase from 107 6 million in the second quarter of 2020 record oil natural gas and oil equivalent production as summarized in the table below matador s second quarter 2021 average daily oil natural gas and total oil equivalent production all exceeded the company s expectations and were all time quarterly highs the majority of the production outperformance resulted from the better than expected performance of the 13 voni wells in the stateline asset area which were turned to sales in april 2021 as well as by continued strong performance from the four most recent rodney robinson wells turned to sales in mid march 2021 the 13 new voni wells are anticipated to have typical estimated ultimate recoveries eurs between 1 75 and 2 5 million barrels of oil equivalent boe

the second quarter of 2020 drilling and completion costs continue at record lows drilling and completion costs for the 15 operated horizontal wells turned to sales in the second quarter of 2021 averaged 615 per completed lateral foot a decrease of 28 from average drilling and completion costs of 850 per completed lateral foot achieved in full year 2020 drilling and completion costs associated with the 21 operated horizontal wells turned to sales in the first half of 2021 averaged 655 per completed lateral foot approximately 4 below the company s expectations matador incurred capital expenditures for drilling completing and equipping wells d c e capital expenditures of approximately 101 million in the second quarter of 2021 or 20 below the company s estimate of 125 million for d c e capital expenditures during the quarter matador estimates that approximately 10 million of these savings were directly attributable to improved operational efficiencies and lower than expected drilling and completion costs in the delaware basin the remainder of these cost savings resulted primarily from the timing of both operated and non operated drilling and completion activities and most of these costs are currently expected to be incurred in the second half of 2021 through the first six months of 2021 matador estimates that it achieved cost savings of approximately 16 million attributable to improved operational efficiencies and lower than expected drilling and completion costs in the delaware basin credit rating and senior unsecured notes upgraded by s p global ratings on june 28 2021 s p global ratings raised matador s issuer credit rating from b to b and raised the issue level rating on matador s senior unsecured notes from b to b lender commitments increased under san mateo s revolving credit facility on june 29 2021 matador announced a 75 million increase in lender commitments to the credit facility of its midstream affiliate san mateo midstream llc san mateo from 375 million to 450 million in addition the lenders agreed to refresh and increase the accordion feature under the credit facility to 250 million which could further expand lender commitments to up to 700 million the 75 million increase in lender commitments to the credit facility should provide san mateo with greater operating and financial flexibility quarterly cash

guidance as affirmed or updated on july 27 2021 5 capital expenditures associated with drilling completing and equipping wells 6 primarily reflects matador s share estimated capital expenditures for san mateo the guidance estimates presented in the table above are based upon the following key assumptions and modifications for anticipated drilling and completions and midstream activity and capital expenditures for full year 2021 as provided on july 27 2021 consistent with its february 23 2021 guidance estimates matador still expects 49 gross 45 6 net operated horizontal wells with an average completed lateral length of 10 400 feet to be turned to sales during full year 2021 matador now expects to participate in 65 gross 4 7 net non operated horizontal well opportunities during 2021 a decrease of 11 gross 2 3 net wells from the company s prior expectations primarily as a result of certain of its operating partners deferring drilling and completions activity from 2021 into 2022 as a result matador now expects its delaware basin non operated oil and natural gas production in the second half of 2021 to be approximately 225 000 boe below its prior estimates including a decrease of approximately 175 000 barrels of oil and 0 3 bcf of natural gas further matador now estimates d c e capital expenditures attributable to non operated wells for full year 2021 to be approximately 21 million less than its original estimates as provided on february 23 2021 matador s non operated oil and natural gas production in the first half of 2021 was in line with the company s expectations as a result of savings of approximately 16 million on operated d c e capital expenditures a faster drilling and completions pace and the anticipated decrease in its non operated d c e capital expenditures in the second half of 2021 matador now intends to advance the next 11 voni well completions forward into the fourth quarter of 2021 and expects to be able to do so without increasing its estimates for d c e capital expenditures for full year 2021 by doing so matador should also be able to fully utilize the same two completions crews throughout the fall of 2021 and into early 2022 which the company believes will result in more capital efficient completion operations matador estimates that advancing the next 11 voni completions into the fourth quarter of 2021 should result in a reduction in estimated fourth quarter production of approximately 475 000 boe including a decrease of 275 000 barrels of oil and 1 2 bcf of natural gas as compared to prior estimates this deferred production results from the need to shut in certain voni and boros wells in the stateline asset area during the fourth quarter while completion operations are ongoing on these 11 new voni wells these shut ins were originally expected to occur in the first quarter of 2022 accelerating these 11 voni completions into the fourth quarter of 2021 however should enable these new wells to be turned to sales in february 2022 two to three months earlier than previously anticipated this acceleration should allow matador to achieve not only improved capital and operational efficiencies but also to realize essentially a full year of production from these 11 voni wells in 2022 matador has today affirmed its full year 2021 production guidance notwithstanding the anticipated aggregate production decrease of approximately 700 000 boe in the second half of 2021 including a decrease of approximately 450 000 barrels of oil and 1 5 bcf of natural gas as noted above significantly matador believes it should still achieve its full year 2021 production guidance primarily as a result of the outperformance associated with the voni and rodney robinson wells turned to sales earlier in 2021 as well as the continued outperformance of the original boros and rodney robinson wells turned to sales during 2020 in recent months san mateo has secured several new midstream opportunities with producers in eddy county new mexico san mateo is very pleased to have these new midstream opportunities but such opportunities require san mateo to increase its estimated capital expenditures for full year 2021 in order to build the necessary pipeline connections to secure these additional volumes in addition matador s decision to accelerate the next 11 voni completions into the fourth quarter of 2021 requires san mateo to accelerate the installation of compression facilities and other infrastructure prior to the end of 2021 in order to be prepared for these additional stateline volumes in early 2022 previously these voni related capital expenditures were scheduled for early 2022 as a result effective july 27 2021 matador increased its full year 2021 estimates for midstream capital expenditures from 20 to 30 million to 35 to 45 million or an increase of approximately 15 million at the midpoint of guidance these midstream capital expenditures primarily reflect matador s 51 share of san mateo s estimated capital expenditures for full year 2021 notwithstanding this increase in full year 2021 capital expenditures san mateo still expects to generate adjusted free cash flow during 2021 further the company now estimates that san mateo s full year adjusted ebitda should be between 130 and 150 million as compared to its original estimate of 125 to 135 million as provided on february 23 2021 third and fourth quarter 2021 completions and production cadence update third and fourth quarter 2021 estimated wells turned to sales matador expects to focus on its completion operations in the stateline asset area and in the southern portion of the arrowhead asset area in eddy county new mexico the greater stebbins area in the delaware basin during the third and fourth quarters of 2021 early in the third quarter of 2021 as anticipated matador turned to sales four gross 3 5 net operated wells in the greater stebbins area all of which are two mile second bone spring completions matador expects to turn to sales 24 gross 22 3 net operated wells in the fourth quarter of 2021 all of which are two mile laterals these estimates reflect no change to the company s estimates for operated wells expected to be turned to sales in the second half of 2021 from those originally provided on february 23 2021 third and fourth quarter 2021 estimated oil natural gas and oil equivalent production the table below provides matador s estimates for anticipated quarterly sequential changes in the company s average daily total oil equivalent oil and natural gas production for the third and fourth quarters of 2021 as of july 27 2021 these production estimates reflect the anticipated modifications to matador s operated and non operated drilling and completions plans as described above

the stateline asset area in eddy county new mexico these two rigs recently completed drilling 13 additional boros wells in the eastern portion of the stateline asset area and are now drilling 11 new voni wells in the western portion of that asset area the other two rigs have been drilling 13 wells in the greater stebbins area nine of which are still in progress four of these wells all second bone spring completions were recently turned to sales and are currently cleaning up after completion operations while matador prepares to install electric submersible pumps esps in each well when matador completes drilling the nine wells currently in progress in the greater stebbins area the company plans to use these two rigs to drill two additional uncle ches wells in the ranger asset area in lea county new mexico and several additional rodney robinson wells in the western portion of the antelope ridge asset area in lea county the next 13 boros wells the nine remaining greater stebbins area wells and the two uncle ches wells a total of 24 wells are all expected to be turned to sales prior to the end of 2021 as previously reported wells completed and turned to sales during the second quarter of 2021 matador completed and turned to sales a total of 24 gross 15 6 net wells in its various delaware basin operating areas this total was comprised of 15 gross 14 6 net operated wells and nine gross 1 0 net non operated wells the 15 operated wells included the first 13 voni wells in the western portion of the stateline asset area all of which had completed lateral lengths of approximately 12 000 feet or about 2 3 miles making them the longest horizontal laterals that matador has completed to date in the delaware basin operated non operated total gross operated and non

the stateline asset area on a staggered basis during april 2021 and these wells continue to outperform the company s expectations in aggregate these 13 voni wells have produced approximately 2 3 million boe in just over three months of production these wells have been produced on restricted chokes throughout their early producing lives and still exhibit high flowing surface pressures and shallow production declines matador turned to sales the initial 13 boros wells in the eastern portion of the stateline asset area in september 2020 in aggregate these 13 boros wells have produced approximately 5 2 million boe in just over 10 months of production most of these wells also continue to produce at high flowing surface pressures with shallow production declines of particular interest in aggregate these first 13 boros wells achieved payout in may 2021 or after approximately nine months of production where payout is defined as net oil and natural gas revenues received less d c e capital expenditures plus all associated operating expenses incurred since the wells were turned to sales in september 2020 all oil natural gas and water production from these boros and voni wells is being gathered via pipeline by san mateo rodney robinson wells western antelope ridge asset area lea county new mexico matador turned to sales four additional rodney robinson wells in late march 2021 in aggregate these four wells have produced 850 000 boe in approximately four months of production and these wells continue to outperform the company s expectations these wells have been produced on restricted chokes throughout their early producing lives and still exhibit high flowing surface pressures and shallow production declines matador turned to sales the initial six rodney robinson wells in the western portion of the antelope ridge asset area in late march 2020 in aggregate these six wells have produced just over 3 5 million boe in approximately 16 months of production and matador continues to be very pleased with the performance of these wells these first six rodney robinson wells in aggregate achieved payout as described above in april 2021 or after approximately one year of production matador considers this to be particularly significant given that these six wells experienced their first full quarter of production in the second quarter of 2020 when matador s realized oil and natural gas prices were 24 03 per barrel and 1 49 per thousand cubic feet respectively uncle ches wells ranger asset area lea county new mexico matador turned to sales two uncle ches wells in the ranger asset area in march 2021 as noted in the company s first quarter earnings release on april 28 2021 24 hour initial potential ip tests were expected to be conducted after these wells were equipped with esps this is matador s customary practice for many wells completed and turned to sales in the ranger and arrowhead asset areas particularly in the bone spring formations the following table highlights the 24 hour ip test results from these two uncle ches wells both two mile second bone spring completions matador is very pleased by the 24 hour ip test results and the 90 oil cuts exhibited by both uncle ches wells as well as by the early performance of both wells these wells also exhibit very low water cuts producing less than one barrel of water per barrel of oil produced which should further enhance the economic returns from these wells completion 24 hr ip boe d oil asset area well name interval boe d 1 000 ft 1 comments ranger lea county nm uncle ches 127h

2020 matador s weighted average oil price differential relative to the west texas intermediate wti benchmark inclusive of the monthly roll and transportation costs was 1 27 per barrel in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to 1 09 per barrel in the first quarter of 2021 and 3 97 in the second quarter of 2020 for the third quarter of 2021 matador s weighted average oil price differential relative to the wti benchmark price inclusive of the monthly roll and transportation costs is anticipated to be in the range of 1 00 to 2 00 per barrel matador s realized loss on derivatives of approximately 42 6 million in the second quarter of 2021 was primarily attributable to the significant increase in wti oil prices during the first and second quarters of 2021 resulting in wti oil prices that were above the strike prices for most of the company s oil swaps and costless collars please see the accompanying slide presentation for a more complete summary of matador s current hedging positions natural gas prices matador s weighted average realized natural gas price excluding derivatives was 4 46 per thousand cubic feet in the second quarter of 2021 a 24 sequential decrease from 5 88 per thousand cubic feet in the first quarter of 2021 but a three fold increase from 1 49 per thousand cubic feet in the second quarter of 2020 ngl prices and especially propane prices continued to be strong in the second quarter which contributed to the company s weighted average natural gas price being well above the company s expectations in the second quarter of 2021 matador is a two stream reporter and the revenues associated with its ngl production are included in the weighted average realized natural gas price for the third quarter of 2021 matador s weighted average natural gas price differential relative to the henry hub benchmark price is anticipated to be in the range of 1 00 to 1 50 per thousand cubic feet assuming ngl prices continue to remain strong throughout the third quarter operating expenses on a unit of production basis production taxes transportation and processing expenses increased 1 sequentially from 5 13 per boe in the first quarter of 2021 to 5 17 per boe in the second quarter of 2021 this increase was primarily attributable to increased production taxes associated with oil and natural gas revenues of 412 1 million an all time quarterly high reported by matador in the second quarter lease operating expenses decreased 13 sequentially from 3 90 per boe in the first quarter of 2021 to 3 39 per boe in the second quarter of 2021 lease operating expenses in the second quarter reflected a modest increase in costs associated with workovers chemicals and other typical expenses associated with servicing an increased number of wells over time but on a unit of production basis these costs were offset by the 26 sequential increase in total oil and natural gas production achieved in the second quarter resulting primarily from new wells recently turned to sales general and administrative expenses per boe decreased 14 sequentially from 3 33 per boe in the first quarter of 2021 to 2 88 per boe in the second quarter of 2021 general and administrative expenses in the second quarter reflected the reinstatement of employee compensation beginning in march 2021 which had been previously reduced beginning in march 2020 in response to the significantly lower oil and natural gas price environment at that time in addition no bonuses were awarded to matador management and staff in 2020 general and administrative expenses also reflected an increase in stock based compensation expense associated with the company s cash settled stock awards the values of which are remeasured at each reporting period matador s share price increased 54 from 23 45 at march 31 2021 to 36 01 at june 30 2021 on a unit of production basis however general and administrative expenses were positively impacted by the large sequential production increase in the second quarter san mateo highlights and update operating highlights and financial results san mateo s operations in the second quarter of 2021 were highlighted by sequentially higher volumes and better than expected financial results natural gas gathering and processing water handling and oil gathering and transportation volumes all increased sequentially in the second quarter of 2021 primarily as a result of the first 13 voni wells being turned to sales in the stateline asset area along with two new wells in the wolf asset area second quarter 2021 volumes do not include the full quantity of volumes that would have otherwise been delivered by certain san mateo customers subject to minimum volume commitments although partial deliveries were made in the second quarter but for which san mateo recognized revenues during the second quarter of 2021 san mateo anticipates natural gas gathering and processing water handling and oil gathering and transportation volumes should decrease sequentially in the third quarter of 2021 consistent with the anticipated sequential decrease in matador s production volumes these volumes are now expected to increase slightly in the fourth quarter of 2021 and then significantly in the first quarter of 2022 operating highlights during the second quarter of 2021 san mateo handled an average of 281 000 barrels of produced water per day a 21 sequential increase as compared to 233 000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2021 and a 30 year over year increase as compared to 217 000 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2020 gathered or transported an average of 43 900 barrels of oil per day a 25 sequential increase as compared to 35 000 barrels of oil per day in the first quarter of 2021 and a 61 year over year increase as compared to 27 300 barrels per day in the second quarter of 2020 gathered an average of 252 million cubic feet of natural gas per day a 32 sequential increase as compared to 191 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2021 and a 29 year over year increase as compared to 195 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of 2020 processed an average of 223 million cubic feet of natural gas per day at its black river processing plant a 41 sequential increase as compared to 158 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2021 and a 38 year over year increase as compared to 162 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of 2020 financial results during the second quarter of 2021 san mateo achieved better than anticipated financial results as described below net income adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow were each at all time highs for san mateo net income gaap basis of 32 6 million an 80 sequential increase from 18 1 million in the first quarter of 2021 and a 2 1 fold year over year increase from 15 3 million in the second quarter of 2020 this quarterly result was above the company s expectations for the second quarter primarily resulting from better than expected volumes delivered by matador and other san mateo customers adjusted ebitda a non gaap financial measure of 42 3 million a 53 sequential increase from 27 6 million in the first quarter of 2021 and an 82 year over year increase from 23 2 million in the second quarter of 2020 net cash provided by san mateo operating activities gaap basis of 25 3 million leading to san mateo adjusted free cash flow a non gaap financial measure of 32 7 million capital expenditures matador s portion of san mateo s capital expenditures was approximately 4 1 million in the second quarter of 2021 about 2 million less than the company s estimate of 6 0 million for the quarter primarily attributable to both cost savings on completed projects and the timing of various operations as noted earlier in this release effective july 27 2021 matador increased its guidance for full year 2021 midstream capital expenditures from 20 to 30 million to 35 to 45 million to account for additional capital expenditures associated with new midstream opportunities as well as to plan for additional infrastructure needed to handle increased volumes associated with the acceleration of production from matador s next 11 voni wells in the stateline asset area into the first quarter of 2022 which was earlier than prior expectations these midstream capital expenditures primarily reflect matador s 51

transfers of all u s regulated products software and technology to the designated huawei entities while most of teradyne s products are not subject to the ear and therefore were not affected by the entity list restrictions some of its products are currently manufactured in the u s and thus subject to the entity list restrictions on august 17 2020 the u s department of commerce published final regulations expanding the scope of the u s ear to include additional products that became subject to export restrictions relating to huawei entities including hisilicon these new regulations restrict the sale to huawei and the designated huawei entities of certain non u s made items such as semiconductor devices manufactured for or sold to huawei entities including hisilicon under specific

operations including increased costs company wide and decreased sales in its industrial automation businesses the company cannot accurately estimate the amount of the impact on teradyne s 2021 financial results and to its future financial results the covid 19 outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty in teradyne s markets this uncertainty resulted in a significant decrease in demand for certain teradyne products and could continue to impact demand for an uncertain period of time the spread of covid 19 has caused teradyne to modify its business practices including employee travel employees working remotely and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and the company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers there is uncertainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and teradyne s ability to perform critical functions could be impacted the degree to which covid 19 impacts teradyne s results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and continued surge of the virus its severity the actions to contain the virus or the availability and

tech profits soared as the covid 19 pandemic began to fade three tech companies that have amassed unparalleled influence while reshaping the way we live released strong earnings results in a flurry late tuesday although apple microsoft and google owner alphabet inc make their money in different ways the results for the april june period served as another reminder of the clout they wield and why government regulators are growing increasingly concerned about whether they have become too powerful the massive profits pouring into each company also illustrated why they have a combined market value of 6 4 trillion more than double their collective value when the covid 19 pandemic started 16 months ago apple apple s first iphone model capable of connecting to ultrafast 5g wireless networks continued to power major increases in quarterly revenue and profits for tech s most valuable company with iphone sales posting double digit growth over the previous year for the third consecutive quarter apple s profit and revenue for the april june period easily exceeded analyst estimates the cupertino california company earned 21 7 billion or 1 30 per share nearly doubling profits earned during the same period last year revenue surged 36 to 81 4 billion as usual the iphone accounted for nearly half of apple s revenue the iphone 12 released last autumn is shaping up to be apple s most popular model in several years largely because it s the first to work on the 5g networks that are still being built around the world apple s iphone sales totaled nearly 40 billion in the latest quarter up 50 from a year ago apple s services division the focal point of a high profile trial revolving around the commissions it collects from iphone apps saw revenue climb 33 from last year to 17 5 billion a potentially game changing decision from the trial completed in may is expected later this summer among apple s other upcoming challenges is whether shortages of computer chips and other key parts will force the company to delay its next iphone this year as it did last year alphabet google s earnings improved markedly over the year ago period when the pandemic was starting to bite consumer spending and its partner advertising now that vaccines have allowed people to shed the shackles of the pandemic and splurge again a big chunk of that pent up demand has spurred advertisers to spend more too with a big chunk going to google and its corporate parent alphabet inc powered by google alphabet earned 18 53 billion or 27 26 per share during the quarter a nearly threefold increase from last year s earnings of 6 96 billion or 10 13 per share total revenue surged 62 from last year to 61 88 billion revenue after subtracting tac or traffic acquisition costs was 50 95 billion the april june quarter looks particularly strong since the 2020 downturn forced google to report its first decline in quarterly ad revenue from the previous year analysts were expecting alphabet to earn 19 24 per share on revenue of 56 2 billion and 46 2 billion after subtracting tac alphabet s stock jumped 135 or 5 1 to 2 773 in after hours trading after the results microsoft microsoft on tuesday reported fiscal fourth quarter profit of 16 5 billion up 47 from the same period last year net income of 2 17 per share beat wall street expectations the software maker also topped forecasts by posting revenue of 46 2 billion in the quarter that ended on june 30 a 21 increase over the same time last year analysts were expecting microsoft to earn 1 91 per share for the april june quarter on revenue of 44 1 billion microsoft profits have soared throughout the pandemic thanks to ongoing demand for its software and cloud computing services for remote work and study but the company s shares fell 2 9 to 278 19 in after hours trading growth in sales of microsoft s cloud services which compete with amazon and other companies and its office productivity tools for handling work documents and email both outpaced overall revenue growth the company s historical pillar personal computing grew just 9 in the quarter microsoft recently unveiled the next generation of its windows software called windows 11 its first major update in six years it will be available later this year

all u s regulated products software and technology to the designated huawei entities while most of teradyneâ s products are not subject to the ear and therefore were not affected by the entity list restrictions some of its products are currently manufactured in the u s and thus subject to the entity list restrictions on august 17 2020 the u s department of commerce published final regulations expanding the scope of the u s ear to include additional products that became subject to export restrictions relating to huawei entities including hisilicon these new regulations restrict the sale to huawei and the designated huawei entities of certain non u s made items such as semiconductor devices manufactured for or sold to huawei entities including hisilicon under specific detailed conditions set forth in the new regulations these new regulations have impacted our sales to huawei hisilicon and their suppliers teradyne is taking appropriate actions including filing for licenses with the u s

controls will significantly impact its ability to sell products to its customers in china or to manufacture products in china the new export controls however could disrupt the companyâ s supply chain

to try to contain the virus such as travel bans and restrictions quarantines shelter in place orders and shutdowns these measures have impacted and may further impact teradyneâ s workforce and operations the operations of its customers and those of its contract manufacturers and suppliers the covid 19 pandemic has adversely impacted the companyâ s results of operations including increased costs company wide and decreased sales in its industrial automation businesses the company cannot accurately estimate the amount of the impact on teradyneâ s 2021 financial results and to its future financial results the covid 19 outbreak has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty in teradyneâ s markets this uncertainty resulted in a significant decrease in demand for certain teradyne products and could continue to impact demand for an uncertain period of time the spread of covid 19 has caused teradyne to modify its business practices including employee travel employees working remotely and cancellation of physical participation in meetings events and conferences and the company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees customers contract manufacturers and suppliers there is uncertainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and teradyneâ s ability to perform critical functions could be impacted the degree to which covid 19 impacts teradyneâ s results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including but not limited to the duration and continued surge of the virus its severity the actions to contain the virus or the availability and impact of vaccines in countries

another possible iphone delay alphabet google s earnings improved markedly over the year ago period when the pandemic was starting to bite consumer spending and its partner advertising now that

back in 2019 more than 11 000 scientists declared a global climate emergency they established a comprehensive set of vital signs that impact or reflect the planet s health such as forest loss fossil fuel subsidies glacier thickness ocean acidity and surface temperature in a new paper published today we show how these vital signs have changed since the original publication including through the covid 19 pandemic in general while we ve seen lots of positive talk and commitments from some governments our vital signs are mostly not trending in the right direction so let s look at how things have progressed since 2019 from the growing number of livestock to the meagre influence of the pandemic is it all bad news no thankfully fossil fuel divestment and fossil fuel subsidies have improved in record setting ways potentially signalling an economic shift to a renewable energy future however most of the other vital signs reflect the consequences of the so far unrelenting business as usual approach to climate change policy worldwide especially troubling is the unprecedented surge in climate related disasters since 2019 this includes devastating flash floods in the south kalimantan province of indonesia record heatwaves in the southwestern united states extraordinary storms in india and of course the 2019 2020 megafires in australia in addition three main greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide set records for atmospheric concentrations in 2020 and again in 2021 in april this year carbon dioxide concentration reached 416 parts per million the highest monthly global average concentration ever recorded last year was also the second hottest year in recorded history with the five hottest years on record all occurring since 2015 ruminant livestock cattle buffalo sheep and goats now number more than 4 billion and their total mass is more than that of all humans and wild mammals combined this is a problem because these animals are responsible for impacting biodiversity releasing huge amounts of methane emissions and land continues to be cleared to make room for them flickr in better news recent per capita meat production declined by about 5 7 2 9 kilograms per person between 2018 and 2020 but this is likely because of an outbreak of african swine fever in china that reduced the pork supply and possibly also as one of the impacts of the pandemic tragically brazilian amazon annual forest loss rates increased in both 2019 and 2020 it reached a 12 year high of 1 11 million hectares deforested in 2020 ocean acidification is also near an all time record together with heat stress from warming waters acidification threatens the coral reefs that more than half a billion people depend on for food tourism dollars and storm surge protection oregon state nasa what about the pandemic with its myriad economic interruptions the covid 19 pandemic had the side effect of providing some climate relief but only of the ephemeral variety for example fossil fuel consumption has gone down since 2019 as did airline travel levels but all of these are expected to significantly rise as the economy reopens while global gross domestic product dropped by 3 6 in 2020 it is projected to rebound to an all time high so a major lesson of the pandemic is that even when fossil fuel consumption and transportation sharply decrease it s still insufficient to tackle climate change there is growing evidence we re getting close to or have already gone beyond tipping points associated with important parts of the earth system including warm water coral reefs the amazon rainforest and the west antarctic and greenland ice sheets flickr ok so what do we do about it in our 2019 paper we urged six critical and interrelated steps governments and the rest of humanity can take to lessen the worst effects of climate change prioritise energy efficiency and replace fossil fuels with low carbon renewable energy reduce emissions of short lived pollutants such as methane and soot curb land clearing to protect and restore the earth s ecosystems reduce our meat consumption move away from unsustainable ideas of ever increasing economic and resource consumption stabilise and ideally gradually reduce human populations while improving human well being especially by educating girls and women globally these solutions still apply but in our updated 2021 paper we go further highlighting the potential for a three pronged approach for near term policy a globally implemented carbon price a phase out and eventual ban of fossil fuels strategic environmental reserves to safeguard and restore natural carbon sinks and biodiversity a global price for carbon needs to be high enough to induce decarbonisation across industry and our suggestion to create strategic environmental reserves such as forests and wetlands reflects the need to stop treating the climate emergency as a stand alone issue by stopping the unsustainable exploitation of natural habitats through for example creeping urbanisation and land degradation for mining agriculture and forestry we can reduce animal borne disease risks protect carbon stocks and conserve biodiversity all at the same time shutterstock is this actually possible yes and many opportunities still exist to shift pandemic related financial support measures into climate friendly activities currently only 17 of such funds had been allocated that way worldwide as of early march 2021 this percentage could be lifted with serious coordinated global commitment greening the economy could also address the longer term need for major transformative change to reduce emissions and more broadly the over exploitation of the planet our planetary vital signs make it clear we need urgent action to address climate change with new commitments getting made by governments all over the world we hope to see the curves in our graphs changing in the right directions soon read more 11 000 scientists warn climate change isn t just about temperature

around 29 1 of its 13f portfolio ack asset management is also relatively very bullish on the stock dishing out 8 14 percent of its 13f equity portfolio to rog seeing as rogers corporation nyse rog has experienced declining sentiment from the smart money we can see that there was a specific group of funds that slashed their positions entirely by the end of the first quarter at the top of the heap brandon haley s holocene advisors said goodbye to the biggest stake of all the hedgies followed by insider monkey valued at about 0 8 million in stock david harding s fund winton capital management

the u s economic recovery is being threatened by the covid 19 delta variant increasing vaccination rates is the most important thing the u s can do to sustain the economy over the next few months beyond that however full recovery might require creating new vaccines against delta and other emerging variants u s stock markets and treasury yields took big dips in recent days before rebounding despite the bounce back the volatility is evidence that investors are worried about the health of the recovery it s not just markets either there are some concrete signs of economic weakness such as a week with an unexpectedly high number of initial jobless claims the lights aren t flashing red yet but these are clear warning signs the obvious reason is the delta variant of covid 19 this variant which is both more infectious and more resistant to vaccines than previous versions of the virus has become the dominant strain in the u s as a result cases are rising again if the u s ends up looking anything like the u k the country is in for another big wave of disease the economic risk isn t a renewed policy of lockdowns and mandatory social distancing the american populace and government officials seem to have had their fill of such restrictive measures but in fact lockdowns were never a very big contributor to the economic devastation of 2020 evidence on the timing and the strictness of government mandated social distancing measures has shown that economic harm occurred pretty much regardless nor did state level reopenings give economies much of a boost but if lockdowns weren t what hurt the economy what was it it was simply widespread fear of the virus the existence of a deadly highly contagious plague is a powerful reason to order from amazon com instead of going to a store or to dine at home instead of going to a restaurant some people went out heedless of the danger but that paltry demand wasn t enough to sustain local service businesses which laid off workers after the initial wave when masking became commonplace and people began to understand the risks of what they were facing economic activity wasn t so hobbled by fear even during the disheartening fall and winter surge in late 2020 and early 2021 but it was only after vaccines became widely available that local economies really began to roar back to life delta puts that rapid recovery under threat its high infectiousness means that even a fairly substantial percent of vaccinated americans won t be enough to protect the unvaccinated from getting the virus and america has quite a lot of unvaccinated people thanks in part to a right wing campaign against the safe and highly effective vaccines even an apparent recent positive shift in fox news tone toward vaccines is unlikely to counteract the corrosive effect of months of highly politicized anti vaccination propaganda and while some of those unvaccinated americans will doubtless be as macho in their defiance of delta as they were with the original version of the coronavirus some will deem it more prudent to avoid crowded indoor spaces just a little bit more meanwhile even vaccinated americans may be hesitant to go out in the face of delta the mrna vaccines from moderna inc and pfizer inc biontech se significantly lower the risk of becoming infected with delta and in the vast majority of cases they prevent the vaccinated from getting sick enough to be hospitalized or die but they don t entirely eliminate the risks there s a fairly substantial number of breakthrough infections even among the fully vaccinated and while that s rarely life threatening there remains the possibility of the protracted symptoms called long covid even among young people perhaps if this were march 2020 this level of risk wouldn t be enough to deter americans from going out to eat and shop but they ve had a year to adapt to the habits of social distancing and many may just decide to extend their pandemic life a little while longer until the threat of delta has passed to monitor whether this is happening keep an eye on opentable restaurant reservation data so far it doesn t look too bad but if that changes watch out what can anyone do to allay this possibility as before only defeating the virus through more comprehensive vaccination will bring the economy fully reliably back we need an intensified public information campaign including the right wing media to make that happen but in the longer term confidence might improve with rapid government approval of vaccine boosters specifically designed for delta and other variants that may now be emerging ultimately it may take several iterations of vaccination to clean covid out of the u s economy
new york chinese firms are more enthusiastic than most about listing on us stock exchanges currently 250 of them including companies that are registered in hong kong or offshore centres but derive most of their revenue and profits from mainland china trade on us equity markets but a recent flurry of official measures in both china and the united states suggests that the two governments are not keen on chinese firms retaining their us listings if push comes to shove how would delisting hurt either country the latest controversy concerns the dominant chinese ride hailing platform didi global partly owned by uber which on june 30 raised 4 4 billion in a successful ipo on the new york stock exchange within 48 hours the cyberspace administration of china cac citing a suspected data security breach announced that it would restrict the company s ability to sign up new users the cac then ordered the removal of didi from all domestic chinese app stores and the state administration of market regulation the country s antitrust authority fined the firm for not obtaining prior approval for earlier mergers and acquisitions the penalties imposed on didi widely interpreted as a warning to other chinese companies against listing in the us without government approval partly reflect three concerns among chinese policymakers the authorities are worried that sensitive digital data including the location of and traffic flows around important addresses in china may fall into the hands of the us intelligence or defence communities they also do not want chinese technology firms to become too large and powerful and fear that big tech companies forays into financial markets may undermine financial stability i suspect that the chinese authorities have a fourth reason to reduce us leverage in the last days of his administration president donald trump signed america s holding foreign companies accountable act the new law authorises the delisting of chinese companies from us stock exchanges if china fails to allow the us public company accounting oversight board pcaob to obtain the underlying worksheets of these firms auditors after three consecutive years and on june 22 the us senate passed another bill that could bring delisting forward by one year if the us has the option of delisting chinese firms en masse and in a disorderly manner at a time of its choosing it could potentially use it to generate financial and economic instability in china the chinese authorities may therefore find it prudent to reduce or eliminate this vulnerability us lawmakers ostensible reason for threatening to delist chinese companies is to protect american investors from potential accounting frauds such as the one committed by luckin coffee last year but us investors have lost much more money as a result of accounting scandals at us companies such as enron worldcom healthsouth freddie mac american international group and lehman brothers some of which took place after the pcaob was established moreover chinese firms most egregious accounting frauds tend to be discovered by professional short sellers using techniques such as undercover company visits that auditing firms do not employ chinese authorities once tacitly encouraged us listings viewing them as a symbol of china s embrace of the global capital market many chinese technology firms also had little alternative to listing in the us before 2018 but the situation today is different previously many chinese firms chose to list in new york instead of shanghai or shenzhen because their foreign private equity or venture capital investors wanted to avoid china s foreign exchange controls moreover china has much tougher listing requirements and a long and uncertain waiting period for regulatory approval for example amazon and facebook would not have been allowed to list in china at the time of their us ipos because they did not have the requisite profits similarly although hong kong imposes no capital controls it also had stricter listing requirements than the us until 2018 in particular while the us allows different classes of shares to have different voting rights as is the case with alibaba and didi for example hong kong required voting rights and financial stakes to be exactly aligned most countries regard a divergence between voting rights and cash flow rights as facilitating bad corporate governance because it potentially allows controlling shareholders to enrich themselves through self dealing at the expense of other investors but after seeing so many chinese companies choosing new york the hong kong stock exchange decided to allow us style multiple share classes for technology and life sciences firms more chinese firms have since listed in hong kong or have a dual listing there and in new york tencent china s biggest social media company was first traded in hong kong before adding a secondary listing in new york and currently commands a higher price to earnings multiple than facebook its closest us counterpart this suggests that the effects of delisting us traded chinese firms may be manageable for both china and america china as a high savings country and a net exporter of capital does not need us listings of its companies to import more capital and while some firms founders and initial investors may experience a valuation haircut in their ipos this does not pose a major challenge to the chinese government similarly most us hedge funds mutual funds and rich individuals will still be able to invest in chinese firms listed in hong kong and even albeit less conveniently and straightforwardly those listed in mainland china true delisting profitable and fast growing chinese companies may reduce returns for many middle class us households whose pension funds are restricted to investing only in us listed securities and us stock exchanges will lose business as ordinary americans would not connect lower returns on their pension funds to delisting of chinese firms us politicians are unlikely to face a backlash and that fact could make delistings more likely shang jin wei a former chief economist at the asian development bank is professor of

period last year revenue surged 36 to 81 4 billion but in a tuesday conference call with analysts apple ceo tim cook lamented that the steadily spreading delta variant of the coronavirus is casting doubt on how the rest of the year will unfold the road to recovery will be a winding one cook said that uncertainty has already led apple to delay employees mass return to its offices from september

high profile trial revolving around the commissions it collects from iphone apps saw revenue climb 33 from last year to 17 5 billion a potentially game changing decision from the trial completed in

in itgr over the last 23 quarters with the smart money s capital changing hands there exists a select group of key hedge fund managers who were increasing their holdings significantly or already

in developing technology solutions for producing cleaner energy held liberty s first investor day highlighting our culture technology financial performance and strategic outlook transitioned onestim acquisition from initial integration focus to the next phase of raising operational and capital efficiency through technology integration and automation liberty delivered another solid quarter of progress as we start to exit the covid downturn we achieved a 5 sequential increase in revenue or a 9 increase when excluding the seasonal impact of the canadian spring breakup we reported 37 million in adjusted ebitda2 representing a 15 sequential increase despite our decision to restore variable compensation plans for field personnel one quarter ahead of schedule that accounted for an 8 million increase to personnel costs we are pleased with our initial progress integrating the sizable legacy onestim business which we expect to continue through the end of the year liberty continues to maintain a disciplined approach toward the growing industry activity levels commented chris wright chief executive officer mr wright continued the second quarter marks the anniversary of the extraordinary events of a year ago where the collapse in oil demand drove a near halt in frac activity we are now seeing the strength of our business one year out from the depths of the cycle with the transformative actions we ve taken over the past year including the onestim acquisition more broadly we are also navigating the macroeconomic supply and demand shocks triggered by the pandemic and related re openings that are creating supply chain constraints and labor shortages effective completion scheduling was challenging with producers and service companies dealing with supply chain interruptions staffing and transportation shortages liberty was not immune from staffing issues and the industry s supply chain challenges however we believe these pandemic driven effects are transitory in nature and our team is working diligently with our customers and suppliers to streamline service delivery in support of our increased activity levels we believe the third quarter will benefit from these actions with improved effective utilization outlook global economic growth outlook continues to improve albeit at a moderating pace sentiment is based upon improving positive economic data as countries reopen partially offset by the impact of global supply chain constraints and virus variant concerns commodity markets remain constructive as sustained economic expansion continues to drive rising energy demand while underinvestment in the energy sector constrains supply this is evidenced by global oil inventory draws that demonstrate the growth in oil demand is higher than the increase in the oil supply looking forward the recent announcement by opec for a gradual reinstatement of prior oil supply cuts through 2021 is expected to be more than offset by projected increases in global oil demand this should support a continued increase in demand for north american completion services exploration and production e p capital spending likely increases in 2022 as operators work towards attaining modest oil production growth they will need to address both a decline in the inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells and the impact of decline curves on their production base as a result we anticipate a modest increase in frac activity to support production growth in 2022 the combined impact of improved e p economics with greater potential for free cash flow generation increased completion service activity demand and tightness in next generation frac equipment is expected to underpin a more disciplined frac market and an increase in service prices the economic rebound across north america has also led to a rise in inflation and wage growth it is important that service prices continue to rebound from extreme pandemic lows and the basis for discussions on service pricing with e p operators have strengthened throughout the year it is noteworthy that service prices tend to lag broader inflationary increases across the value chain but these increases are necessary to facilitate the next phase of growth and investment especially as the service industry contends with inflationary increases as we look ahead the opportunity excites us as activity has improved meaningfully over the last year we are working diligently to provide superior services to our customers while balancing the management of temporary pandemic related challenges and the recovery of returns to an acceptable level we believe we are significantly advantaged with our deep customer relationships comprehensive best in class service offering and a strong balance

repeats column filed on tuesday without changes the opinions expressed here are those of the author a columnist for reuters by andy home london july 27 reuters u s buyers of physical aluminium ingot are paying a record premium of 30 cents per lb or 670 per tonne to get metal to their plants the u s midwest premium is payable on top of the london metal exchange lme cash price which at a current 2 498 per tonne is within striking distance of may s three year high of 2 579 50 the premium has never been higher even the trump administration s 2018 double whammy of import tariffs and sanctions on russian producer rusal couldn t push the premium beyond a may peak of 485 per tonne there are plenty of specific drivers at work in the north american aluminium market but it s not just aluminium buyers who are having to pay up u s tin and lead buyers are also paying record premiums for their metal the common theme is one of import dependency a vulnerability that is brutally exposed by chaos in the shipping sector that has disrupted everything from global automotive to local retail supply chains out of stock the united states has no primary tin or lead production capacity and imported 32 000 tonnes and 370 000 tonnes of refined metal last year respectively the united states geological survey usgs found tin imports accounted for around 75 of u s consumption last year and lead imports around 24 lower because of the greater use of recyclable material in the all important lead acid battery sector both tin and lead markets are experiencing global supply side disruption the lme three month tin price early on tuesday hit a fresh all time high of 34 990 per tonne on a combination of production hits and booming demand from the electronics sector lme tin inventory remains chronically low at just 1 165 tonnes excluding the 1 150 tonnes scheduled for physical load out most of those stocks 1 080 tonnes are located in taiwan close to asia s electronics hubs there is nothing at all in the united states where midwest buyers are now paying premiums of between 3 300 and 4 000 per tonne to get material according to fastmarkets assessments that remember is on top of the record lme price in a misfiring global tin supply chain the u s finds itself at the back of the queue and facing the highest freight costs so too in the lead market where fastmarkets u s midwest premiums have surged to record highs of up to 19 cents per lb over lme lme stocks of lead are also low and there is zero registered tonnage in the united states europe has stocks but that market is still short of physical metal after germany s berzelius stolberg smelter was forced to close by last week s flooding while the western lead market is caught in a rolling supply squeeze the chinese market is awash with the stuff lead stocks registered with the shanghai futures exchange shfe have grown from 45 900 tonnes at the end of december to 158 073 now there is an obvious arbitrage solution to this imbalance but since the arbitrage will be with the lme the bulk of any export shipments will likely head to exchange warehouses in asia u s importers will still face high freight costs to move the metal to the domestic market assuming there is available freight capacity greater competition record u s aluminium premiums were already adding to a potent mix of bull drivers before last weekend s strike action at the kitimat smelter over the border in canada rio tinto which operates the plant has said it will reduce production to 35 of its 432 000 tonne per year capacity tightening an already super tight market tariffs on u s imports have already served to reduce flows of canadian metal and producers everywhere are ramping up output of value added products meaning less production of the commodity grade metal that determines the midwest premium more fundamentally however the u s aluminium sector faces greater competition for imported metal as china the world s largest producer itself turns net importer just about all of the lme inventory both on and off warrant is located at asian locations particularly malaysia s port klang accessible stocks have migrated eastward to within easy shipping distance of china s ports competition for this material and the associated higher freight costs are driving premiums higher in both the europe and the united states but particularly the latter because it is furthest away fracturing the global price u s nickel premiums are also starting to move sharply higher and copper shows signs of stirring only zinc seems relatively immune because of greater domestic production capacity and plenty of lme stocks in new orleans stocks of everything else are in the wrong place as u s manufacturing recovers from the pandemic the current turmoil in the global freight sector has served to make the united states an island in metals supply chains a phenomenon that becomes most acute when the global market is itself operating in supply deficit as is the case with tin such import dependency has led the biden administration to initiate a supply chain task force to build domestic resilience in everything from medical supplies to lithium ion batteries critical minerals are a central part of this initiative tin is one of them but tends to be overshadowed by rare earths and battery metals the current focus of u s government minerals policy lead isn t on the list even though it powers most of the vehicles currently on u s roads and aluminium has been deemed critical for national defence but the trump solution of import tariffs has exacerbated the stellar rise in the premium cost to u s manufacturers aluminium also reveals the longer term issues facing u s metal buyers the tariffs which remain in place under biden have accentuated the very import dependence they were meant to alleviate baking it into a structurally higher domestic premium trying to reshore supply chains inevitably makes them less global that increases the significance of regional pricing premiums over global pricing on the lme such seems to be the evolving trend in aluminium pricing the woes in the global shipping sector will eventually pass but this underlying shift in metals pricing in a deglobalising world may be here to stay editing by barbara lewis
a federal deposit insurance corp proposal released last week would add principal and interest funds advanced by a servicer to borrower coverage calculations currently deposit insurance covers up to 250 000 of payments of principal and interest at the mortgagor level but not certain funds that servicers must advance on borrowers behalf when consumers aren t paying which are applied at the corporate level with that same limit the proposal issued july 20 would extend the mortgagor coverage to payments that servicers advance expanding the amount potentially insured the amendment floated appears to be another instance in which policymakers are focusing more closely on advancing risk but it s also aimed at improving the bank record keeping process something that proved to be problematic during the large scale collapse of indymac back in 2008 this inconsistent treatment of principal and interest amounts could result in financial instability during times of stress and could further complicate the insurance determination process the fdic said servicers almost exclusively work with large banks to hold custodial accounts and the biggest institutions have increased record keeping duties under the fdic that could be complicated by the recategorization of advances in line with the proposal i m guessing that ll be a source of friction said jeffrey naimon a partner in the washington office of buckley llp the fdic has not simplified its deposit insurance rules since 2008 and the resulting disarray that followed more recently led to greater record keeping requirements for bigger institutions escrow funds which servicers collect from borrowers to pay consumers property taxes and insurance on consumers behalf also get advanced and have received coverage at the mortgagor level however advanced p i payments have not he said the proposed change in the treatment of servicer advances may require relatively complicated servicing system logic to map to existing and new data fields and extract the information needed for banks to ingest into their separate platforms used to comply with fdic deposit insurance calculations it s a complex determination but it is a matter of working through it said vicki vidal a senior vice president at servicing system provider black knight adding that the proposal is a positive clarification servicers are still working through deposit insurance determinations for mortgage servicing assets because p i custodial and advance balances are maintained at the pool level or investor level whereas deposit insurance for msas is calculated on a borrower level as a result some of the data would have to be converted from the investor or pool level to individual borrowers vidal said among other changes in the advance notice of proposed rule making is a simplification of distinctions between revocable and irrevocable trusts if the change is made depositors would be insured for up to 250 000 and up to five beneficiaries regardless of the trust s status revocable trusts can be changed at will whereas irrevocable ones cannot without the beneficiaries consent jhvephoto stock adobe com an unusual amount of inquiries related to trust accounts prompted the fdic to decide to simplify coverage according to the fdic more than half of the 20 000 inquiries the fdic has been receiving per year have been related to trust accounts when indymac failed during the great recession s housing crash it affected 34 206 trust accounts and 2 6 billion in deposits according to the fdic
opportunities still exist to shift pandemic related monetary support measures into climate friendly activities it is encouraging to see fossil fuel divestment and fossil fuel subsidies improving in record setting ways the scientists note an unprecedented surge in climate related disasters since 2019 including devastating floods record heatwaves and extraordinary storms and fires there is growing evidence we are getting close to or have already gone beyond tipping points associated with important parts of the earth system including warm water coral reefs the amazon rainforest and the west antarctic and greenland ice sheets said professor ripple distinguished professor of ecology in the oregon state university college of forestry last year was the second hottest year in recorded history with the five hottest years on record all occurring since 2015 and in april this year carbon dioxide concentration reached 416 parts per million the highest monthly global average concentration ever recorded priorities need to shift toward immediate drastic reductions in greenhouse gases especially methane said dr wolf a postdoctoral scholar at oregon state with its myriad economic interruptions the covid 19 pandemic had the side effect of providing some climate relief but only of the ephemeral variety the scientists say global gross domestic product dropped by 3 6 percent in 2020 but is projected to rebound to an all time high professor ripple said likely because of the pandemic fossil fuel consumption has gone down since 2019 as have carbon dioxide emissions and airline travel levels all of these are expected to significantly rise with the opening of the economy a major lesson of the pandemic the authors say is that even sharply decreased transportation and consumption are insufficient to tackle climate change and instead transformational system changes are required even if politically unpopular despite pledging to build back better by globally directing covid 19 recovery investments toward environmental policies only 17 percent of such funds had been allocated that way as of early march 2021 as long as humanity s pressure on the earth system continues attempted remedies will only redistribute the pressure dr wolf said but by halting the unsustainable exploitation of natural habitats we can reduce zoonotic disease transmission risks protect carbon stocks and conserve biodiversity all at the same time other vital signs the authors highlight

if the f 150 raptor is too small for you megarexx trucks will build you its bigger brother the f 150 raptor in the us and the smaller ranger raptor in europe have proven to be quite popular as everyone seems to love off road capable and performance oriented pickups but what happens if both of those trucks are too small for your taste megarexx trucks from north carolina has the answer with their custom built megaraptor the pictured megaraptor is based on a ford f 250 super duty platinum but the company is willing to convert any f 250 f 350 or f 450 truck most of the body panels have been replaced by bespoke fiberglass parts including those ultra wide front and rear fenders adding 12 or 18 to the stock vehicle s width the f 150 style anzo headlights make the truck appear even larger than it is the megaraptor also gets off road front and rear bumpers together with led light bars see also 2021 ford f 150 raptor rated at 450 hp available to order from 65 840 the super duty is an already big and capable truck but the megaraptor takes this to another level thanks to the jacked up air suspension and huge wheels more specifically a set of mine resistant ambush protected aluminum rims rated at 10 000 lbs each are shod in massive michelin xzl tires measuring 46 x15 5 395 85r20 the conversion includes 4 5 inch icon progressive coil springs in the front and 5 multi leaf springs in the rear bilstein shocks longer radius arms adjustable track bar and a built in air compressor in order to make it easier for the passengers to climb into the cabin they fitted electrically operated running boards by amp research on each side read also 2022 ford super duty revealed with less chrome new 12 inch infotainment system under the bonnet there is a turbocharged 6 7 liter power stroke diesel v8 sending power to all four wheels the mill doesn t have any modifications but the stock 475 hp 354 kw 482 ps and 1 050 lb ft 1 423 nm of torque are more than enough to move freely in any kind of terrain megarexx trucks which is now owned by aaron richardet who also ownes osprey custom cars will build more megaraptors for anyone that is interested each truck takes up to 2 3 months to build and requires the donor car plus a 50 percent deposit while we don t know the price of this thing we guess it won t come cheap judging from the extend of modifications the company suggests that each build is unique thanks to a long list of options including different colors textures lighting suspension bumpers trailer hitches side rails bodykits and more this will allow each owner to configure his truck according to his liking while retaining the workload capabilities of the super duty interestingly this is not the first time we hear the megaraptor name as back in 2017 a different company made similar conversions again based on super duty trucks
a slump in stock price and reports about proterra s costly electric buses underperforming across the country have sent the biden administration s favorite electric battery company into damage control mode retaining a top flight defamation lawyer and inveighing against partisan blogs like the washington free beacon and the taxpayer funded npr proterra the electric bus company linked to several biden administration officials and top democrats has retained the services of high profile attorney erik connolly the company said a proterra spokesman said connolly was hired to address some recent false and defamatory publications about the company proterra also published a statement monday night that sought to set the record straight about mischaracterizations about our company in recent partisan news blogs that are opposed to the widespread adoption of zero emission vehicles it is unclear whether proterra s reference to partisan news blogs refers to the taxpayer funded npr or the free beacon proterra said that reports about its bus failures have been twisted into an indictment of battery electric technology that the problems are limited to its first generation buses and that its battery technology has never directly caused a fire the free beacon reported on friday that foothill transit a southern california transit agency is considering doing away with several of its proterra buses due to mechanical issues including a january 2020 bus fire the report followed an npr investigation into philadelphia s proterra buses which have been taken off the road due to performance issues there has never been a fire on a customer bus related to our proprietary battery technology or powertrain proterra wrote in its statement the company s stock value has plummeted over 40 percent in the past month as proterra s failures have garnered national headlines the biden administration has said it plans to support the company through its trillion dollar infrastructure package and both president joe biden and vice president kamala harris have participated in public events showcasing proterra buses biden energy secretary jennifer granholm is a former proterra board member her stock holdings in the company worth millions of dollars were the subject of a free beacon report in april the details of the january 9 2020 california proterra bus fire remain murky a spokeswoman for foothill transit initially told the free beacon that the bus caught fire while charging but said after publication that the fire wasn t a battery related incident richard cordero foothill transit s director of maintenance and vehicle technology revealed during friday s public meeting on the proterra buses that the electric battery manufacturer itself was conducting the investigation into the cause of the fire that bus was involved in a thermal event from the front section of the bus cordero said we haven t had any results from the investigation that was performed by proterra s investigation team still asking for the results of that the proterra spokesman said that its technology had nothing to do with the fire and that foothill transit won t be receiving any additional information from proterra we have provided foothill with all the information that it requested from us regarding the bus involved in the january 9 2020 incident the spokesman said the matter concerned third party components located at the front of the bus the fire did not involve proterra s proprietary battery system or powertrain the fire did not involve charging the bus was not charging when the fire occurred proterra boasts that its over 500 vehicles have traveled a cumulative 14 million miles that equates to approximately just 29 000 miles per bus a typical car lasts 200 000 miles and diesel buses last approximately 250 000 miles while the company denied any responsibility for the fire it did not address the other problems foothill transit experienced the agency s public report indicates that the buses were melting in the california sun and that many remain on the shelf because proterra has failed to provide replacement parts or the problems that led philadelphia to abandon its product there the city says there isn t enough battery power to get buses through even the city s easiest routes and that the weight of the proterra batteries are cracking the bus structure

milestones on our march to on all platform model on a wave of continued strong demand for the first time our all platform offerings software and the associated systems and services were greater than 50 of our bookings we expect this trend to continue for the third quarter in a row we did not have a 10 customer and we do not expect to have one in the current quarter this speaks directly to the breadth of our customer base and the predictability of our all platform model at the same time we brought our b6 and c7 products to end up sale these two systems were the founding systems of calix and this marks another milestone in our continued pursuit of our all platform future with these milestones behind us the board of directors has added the chairman shift to my ceo role i will continue my focus on our long term strategy and i m confident that our executive team my friend michael weening our president and chief operating officer will continue to execute our strategy with excellence while supply remains a challenge and will remain a challenge well into next year organic demand for our solutions remains grown up every day we are excited to help our customers simplify our businesses excite their subscribers and grow their value with that let us open the call for questions donna questions and answers operator our first question is coming from george notter of jefferies please go ahead george notter jefferies analyst hi guys thanks very much and congratulations on the strong results i guess i wanted to ask about gross margins if i remember going back three months ago you mentioned that you had a shipment of low margin product that got pushed from q1 into q2 i guess i m wondering if that had some impact on the gross margin result this quarter and then also i would imagine your component costs are higher also given the supply constraints around the industry and any sense you can give us for how that might have impacted gross margins also would be great cory sindelar chief financial officer yes george you have that remembered correctly that that should have been pushed from q1 into q2 and it had some impact on our margins and you re also correct that the component increase in prices and higher freight loss contributed to the sequential decline in margin from q1 to q2 george notter jefferies analyst got it any chance you guys could quantify that is it a point margin two points a margin half a point anything you could steer us to would be great carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i think cory in past you ve said it s not any significant but we haven t tried to bracket it i think in the past cory has said that it s more than a point less than some higher number it s a significant number george and that s i think the best way we do george notter jefferies analyst got it ok that s great and then i guess i also wanted to ask about centurylink i guess now called lumen your larger customers were that segment was down quite a bit year on year obviously centurylink it sounds like is going through a strategic process or some of their assets but any perspective on what s going on there and in any chance that account could improve going forward let s say they do make some strategic decisions maybe get some cash proceeds from the strategic decisions could they reinvest in areas of the business that you guys are exposed to carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes george i think that s the correct observation as you know over the last couple of our few quarters they ve been pretty tight on capex as i think they ve been going through their strategic valuations if you ll notice and the announcement around the latin american assets they spoke directly to a likely use the proceeds into capex and investments but we think it s kind of continued like this for a while as they continue that focus on where they want to go strategically so our business continues to move along if you look across the industry you ll see that their capex was down across a number of spaces and i think there is a chance it will improve but it may improve through lumen it may improve through the spun off assets whatever they may be so stay tune george notter jefferies analyst okay i ll pass it on thanks very much guys carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer george thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from paul silverstein of cowen please go ahead paul silverstein cowen and company analyst thanks guys the 43 new customers in the quarter that s a big step up from your historical past i think the 24 of the preceding quarter of the 20s and the teams before that is this the new norm was there something specific about this quarter then i ve got a couple of follow ups carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer i don t know if it s the new norm i would really characterize it as that we ve been investing to get up to our model and a significant portion of that has been in sales and marketing and so i would say stay tune but i think you re going to see an increasing aggression on the part of the sales and marketing organization michael do you have any words you want to add to that michael weening president and chief operating officer i mean just see that the different sized customers from small to medium size and exactly what you said carl is that the investments that we re making in the sales and marketing organization are paying off along with the platforms being very mature at a customer say to me the other day that we re the only wi fi 6 platform that s carrier class and mature in the marketplace and that s why they went with us and it s paying off dividends because we were the first in the market and now that we d have all of our new platforms coming into place and our new solutions we were very excited about the future which is leading a new customer acquisition paul silverstein cowen and company analyst all right then your mid sized customers remember the number they were up again very strong if it s worth 60 or 80 growth this quarter and top of the 130 growth from the previous quarter is that indicative of something that s utterly estimates loss assembled that level but are they back to growth node for an appreciable period of time and what s going on there any notes that you could offer carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes so i think we re taking care about mid sized customers because it s easy to remember the past and think of mid sized customers as the tier 2s and if you remember we said mid sized customers that those greater than 250 000 subscribers less than 2 5 million so it is indicative of something in the future but it s not necessarily that the tier 2s are week that s our value proposition as you heard michael alluded to in small and medium customers it s starting to work its way up the stack of customer size paul silverstein cowen and company analyst got it one last question if i may on the non us i know you ve had your hands full with us demand and so you haven t correct me if i m wrong and been deploying a significant non incremental investment in terms of opex that set time resources into non us i know you ve had your hands full with us demand and so you haven t correct me if i m wrong and been deploying a significant amount of incremental investment in terms of opex that set time resources into non us and the non us is up strong once again this quarter in incremental insight get off to read to the future carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes so same story from my perspective and i ll let michael add some color we are being very much focused on north america but globally this whole drive toward from anywhere broadband etc is a way that s moving through the marketplace but michael if you want to add some color michael weening president and chief operating officer yes on the international side we re being pragmatic on how we expand and a lot of the growth that we re seeing is actually from existing customers who are making incremental investments in their networks and the markets that they cover and we re getting the benefit of it as we have a long history with them they chose us as a strategic partner and i think that s the key differentiator is that the companies who are with us in international markets are the ones actually understand the value of our platforms how they simplify their operations and excite their subscribers and they re betting on us long term and that s and they get more capital they partner with us paul silverstein cowen and company analyst all right i ll pass it on thanks guys carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks paul operator thank you our next question is coming from chris howe of barrington research please go ahead chris howe barrington research analyst all right good morning everyone and congrats on the quarter carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning chris and welcome to the party as it were chris howe barrington research analyst yes a party indeed a few questions here but leading off just tying together some thoughts with some of the previous questions the 43 new customers in the quarter and in the shareholder letter you had a brief highlight related to favorable regional mix the success you had in adding new customers should we think of that as being tied to how you targeted your potential customer base on a geographic basis carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer it s tied to the same model that we ve been pursuing which is we have a direct model that we re continuing to invest in and so look there s more smaller customers than there are medium customers there s more medium customers than there are larger customers and so on a numbers basis you re going to see the most of them in the smaller customers michael do you want anything to add michael weening president and chief operating officer yes the other part is that if you look at the maturity of our cloud platforms what we are unique in the market with is the fact that we can actually enter a customer on many different vectors so where if you go back to the history of calix 15 years ago we would have primarily partnered with a customer s nicest vendor we re now able to go and transform the call center we re able to transform their marketing like nobody else in this marketplace through behavioral analytics insights we re able to help them build out a virtual storefront in the home with wi fi 6 and therefore that gives us an access to competitive accounts that we never had before and we re entering in a different vector and allowing us to win those customers chris howe barrington research analyst that s great thank you for the color and just digging into total operating expenses you came in better than expected can you put this leverage into context for the current quarter and kind of at what point you saw the potential leverage start to realize itself and how perhaps we should think about that on an ongoing basis i know we re moving toward the target financial model on a percentage basis that you highlighted in the letter perhaps you can go into some of the leverage opportunities or what we could potentially see as revenue perhaps overgrows your total expense line carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer so let me shape my answer to your question in a return on investment manner because obviously we expect to make discipline investments in opex that yield returns and we are very focused on growth that being said the leverage is in our view in a return on investment by driving the growth of the business and opening up new margin expansion opportunities it is not in leverage at the bottom line from having opex be below our model so cory do you want to add some color for chris to that and where we re having share cory sindelar chief financial officer sure the underperformance in opex was largely due to not meeting our hiring goals in the quarter so we did add a roughly no more than 5 to the workforce in the quarter but fell short of what we expected but over the near term we intended to get to model and so those opex investments will continue to increase carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes and so the way we refer to it chris just in your perspective is we are planning for success but we re not going to lower the bar for folks coming in to meet a head count goal we re going to go get the very best talent we can and we think our culture supports that chris howe barrington research analyst okay great i guess that speaks to one of the recent press releases surrounding the high quality of talent that you re attracting to calix not lowering the bar for that my last question is just quickly it was asked about the lower margin items that got pushed forward from q1 as we look at kind of the end of q2 anything there that we should make note of as it relates to q3 cory sindelar chief financial officer sure we have seen a little bit more of purchase price variances and spot market buys are going to start affecting margins we factor that obviously in the guidance that we provided but we are moving into the tougher part of our fourth quarter and remember back when in our first quarter call we ve talked about the push out in lead times lead times leading a gap in the fourth quarter and so as we approach the fourth quarter it s obviously becoming increasingly more difficult to meet the demand and so that it has been assuming costs have increased increased component prices so we re going to go through the most challenging supply part that we ve faced in the last 18 months in the next couple of quarters chris howe barrington research analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks chris and welcome aboard operator thank you our next question is coming from michael genovese of westpark capital please go ahead michael genovese westpark capital analyst great thanks very much so with the upside versus where the street numbers were in 2q and 3q do you have any update to the full year outlook carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer mike we do and i ll let cory cover that with you cory go ahead cory sindelar chief financial officer yes last quarter we setting up in about 15 per year with the improvement over performance of the second quarter and outlook for q3 at this point we can grow at 20 or more for the year carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer so for the year what does that make it i mean we re talking about cory sindelar chief financial officer perhaps 660 for the year carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer okay does that help mike i hope michael genovese westpark capital analyst yes absolutely thanks okay so just could you just quickly talk about i just think it s important when you talk about that the legacy products i think i guess quite realize you have so many legacy products because i mean they re all fiber but what s really the difference between the legacy stuff that s phasing out and the all access if you can give us some color there that d be helpful carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer well we do have we re a 21 year old company the company was founded on the c7 we acquired a company called occam which has its founding product called the b6 and you may notice from my introductory remarks that we actually achieved end of sale in june on both of those systems after those systems came to market in 2007 we built the e series product family which may bring about because e series continues to peg but the initial e series was built on an operating system called esa and those were copper and fiber systems we also then built the gigacenter family which was our first generation of premises systems and all of those are in what we refer to now as our traditional or legacy systems they result they have a broad deployment e series was a phenomenally successful system and so we have many many customers that have built networks for e series and have premises systems on gigacenter that are still robustly ordered when we brought our platforms to market axos and exos which has become the intelligent access edge and the revenue edge along with our clouds that is our all platform business going forward the axos and exos operating systems even though they are abstracted from the hardware still have hardware resources underneath them we continued with the e series for the access side and we have now brought the gigaspire family to market for exos so we are slowly but surely growing our all platform systems but customers that have networks built on e series or the gigacenter premises if they choose to continue to order those systems i for one i m perfectly happy to take the order and as they see the opportunity to deploy our platforms they ll move to them michael do you want to add some color michael weening president and chief operating officer yes when i joined five years ago carl shared the view it was five years into it and we re down this path i m on the journey to build these platforms and i would say the only thing i would say that s important to understand between the legacy and the new is that we ve chosen a very different path than our competition what our competition has done is actually kept their existing systems that have been there for 20 plus years they haven t under upgraded the fundamental underlying technology and instead they re taking the very traditional technology path but actually putting middleware over top of it and actually building out all over top of it and covering it up well carl and the leadership team did 10 years ago was actually rebuild these platforms from the bottom up using industry standard technologies like netcom gang and all those elements which is why our products are unique in the market they are built from the bottom up to actually embrace the future which is all around helping service providers understand their customer leverage data and win and so that s the difference between the old and the new from my perspective carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer i just want to point out that i ll take that compliment michael weening president and chief operating officer why don t carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer mike you don t michael genovese westpark capital analyst okay well thank you i mean that was great color for that question i m going to ask two more and i ll just ask them at once even though they re on different topics i just want to take your temperature on gross margin expansion for the overall year the typical 100 basis points to 200 basis points where you stand on that right now and then secondly just how are you feeling about congress and infrastructure related further stimulus for this industry thank you carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer okay so let me just i want to put some color on the gross margin and ask cory to then add to it i want to go back to what cory was saying earlier about q4 filling and etc and i want to frame that with what michael just said we have an enormous opportunity in front of us it is a secular disruption and we are very energized by helping our customers succeed what that drives us to do is to work very hard to meet their expanding needs which means delivering systems and not raising prices for example because our vendors have raised their prices so we are all oars in the water to meet our customer s demand which means we will pay expedite fees do things on freight find things on the open market for silicon and that s the color that cory was talking about so cory you want to shape that to the direct question and then i ll come back and talk about congress cory sindelar chief financial officer sure i think the strength in gross margin and the first quarter and continued performance in the second is the confidence that we think will achieve margin expansion of 100 to 200 basis points year over year so i think we re on track to do exactly that carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer right but we can it s a try no one should take away that s an easy game right now it is a fight on congress look there s lots of puts and takes and we re all following these things here s the thing i would leave you with it seems that in the vernacular regardless of affiliation everyone now knows to say we re interested in hardcore infrastructure roads bridges and internet no matter party affiliation you hear the same phrase so why do i say that because it s clear that they didn t ask on it internet infrastructure has resolved itself in 55 million either way there s going to be a large amount of dollars invested in when how it shows up we could have long discussions about i am on record as having said the following and i ll repeat it these programs always turn out to be larger than you think they take longer than you think and what i ve said about calix remains true it is not a pull forward of boxes it is an uplift of our entire model as we help our customers build a new business model on top of the new infrastructure they re building michael genovese westpark capital analyst thanks again appreciate it carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks mike operator thank you our next question is coming from ryan koontz of needham and company please go ahead ryan koontz needham and company analyst good morning thanks for the question impressive metric there with the software bookings north of 50 can you give us any color there on some of the trends are fairly familiar with the products but what s driving that and is that should we think about that as the new normal or kind of a one time event thanks carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer so let me make sure i m being very clear it is our all platform business which is software the associated systems so remember there s a hardware resource underneath both the access infrastructure and the premises and the services that go along with it so that business not just software business the whole business has now made it over 50 and obviously once having made it over 50 it s not going backwards so i won t speak of it again ryan prior to you joining us i had said at some point in time we re going to go over the 50 in revenue i thought it was meaningful to share when we get eclipsed that 50 in bookings so that s the one ticket and we expect it to continue does that help ryan koontz needham and company analyst it does thanks so much carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer go ahead ryan koontz needham and company analyst can you hear me okay carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer we can go ahead ryan koontz needham and company analyst great specifically on the art of programs are you seeing any action there we ve heard from some of your peers that maybe some of the engineering work is starting to be funded maybe by internal mechanisms but folks are looking to get going late this year early next year is that in line with what you guys are thinking thank you carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer you mean you ve heard from some folks that previously two years ago said it was going to happen next quarter so all sarcasm aside let me be clear as i said it always takes longer that being said we are clearly seeing now people planning starting to put in some orders but it s still early days michael do you want to add some color to that michael weening president and chief operating officer i would say that s exactly the case the growth that you re seeing right now is based upon us taking market share and so while that s a great future looking opportunity for us as carl just stated and it takes longer and it s bigger and so that we expect that to start flowing through and in subsequent years but the results that you re seeing today are about our organization actually taking market share based on our customers to understand the value of our platforms and their desire to build a new business model to fundamentally transform and win customers against their biggest threat which is the consumer direct companies who want to get inside the home own that subscriber and monetize them through incremental services which the service provider needs to do ryan koontz needham and company analyst helpful thank you very much lastly any color on the international side obviously a great quarter there on revenues any regional color you can offer up thanks so much carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer just continued execution cory you want to add some cory sindelar chief financial officer yes we assume it tomorrow it was pretty broad based it came from a number of regions straight particularly in europe ryan koontz needham and company analyst great thanks so much i ll pass it on carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer ryan thanks and welcome operator thank you our next question is coming from christian schwab of craig hallum capital group please go ahead christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst hi congratulations on another good quarter and guide guys most of my questions have been answered carl i have one quick question when you look at small customers here domestically the less than 250 000 subscribers but what do you hear penetration rates into that customer base currently is and could you identify a number of how many target customers that are left out there that are not customers at all of your all platform offering carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer so we are well penetrated from 20 years of working in north america as counts having said that with our all platform offerings you ve heard me say we are very early days and so i would say to michael as a vp of sales once said in my very early selling career when it comes to orders too much is never enough so michael i don t know if you have some color but these are we are so early in this transformation process michael maybe you want to give some color on the business transformation and how earlier it is michael weening president and chief operating officer i want to go back to what we talked about earlier which was that in the past if you were to go back 15 years ago we would have competed with a number of vendor competitors and are only offering in the access network while we re actually seeing over and over again is again with multiple vectors into a customer with the ability to win their marketing organization to win the transformation of their call center it completely changed how they bring services to market in the home to compete with the consumer giants and then the access side that means we can go back to customers who we really have nothing to talk about with the form because they made a big access network investment and they re like i m not going to switch midway through and talk about all these other business transformation elements so for us it s an amazing opportunity which again goes back to my previous comment which is the growth that you re seeing is us taking market share as we enter into not only new customers but actually places where we get into something to go to talk to them about before and absolutely now we do christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst okay well let me i appreciate that let me ask it a different way given your long history in access what percentage of your historical access customer base over the last 15 20 years that you ve been selling to is currently buying your all platform solution today carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer a large minority of buying some portion of it but it is still a minority christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst okay all right and you know where i m going carl i ve just trying to frame a couple of different ways how big the opportunity for you can be at a small penetration rate follow up on the earlier question about the new customer attrition in the all platform so is there 500 existing customers that don t buy in all platform solutions it s something like that i guess you know understanding carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes so let me be clear you ve heard me say this many times every day i get up and go to work i get more excited by the opportunity we have in front of us and the reason i m getting more excited because i m looking at what customers are doing with us and i then come to the realization that we re even earlier and this opportunity than i thought so that s one way of thinking about it the second thing you ve heard me say is that our model expands in multiple dimensions in multiple ways and so it s not all as you heard michael speak earlier we can enter a customer with marketing cloud and that might be the only thing they deployed but as they started to do marketing cloud then they might spend a support cloud and they might go to the revenue edge there s so many dimensions of expansion that even with our customer base which is 1 500 plus strong we are still barely scratching the surface for that expansion opportunity even though there are quite a few hundred that have deployed some aspect of what we re doing on the platforms so the expansion which is what you re getting at we are just getting off the fast in the first minute christian schwab craig hallum capital group analyst yes that s great color thank you guys congrats again carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer thanks christian operator thank you our next question is coming from tim savageaux of northland capital markets please go ahead tim savageaux northland capital markets analyst hey good morning and congratulations carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer good morning tim tim savageaux northland capital markets analyst good morning carl i just wanted to follow up on some of the market share commentary and obviously you guys are have been a pretty established player in the market especially on the rural side for quite some time so i was a little bit struck by that comment and where to follow up with weather and you can define your addressable market how you like i d be focused on that kind of maybe the small carryover segment or perhaps the us in general if you could estimate what you think your current share of that market opportunity is and from whom are you taking market share do you think and i ll follow up carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes so market share michael used that term market share you have to keep in mind that in a disruption market share is an interesting thing because what you re focused on is actually as you heard him say addressing new opportunities that don t exist in the way the service part of things about so if you look at as just overall spam from service providers we are growing the share of that spam but it s in places that are different than the way you would traditionally think about and so the best way i can point this to you is overtime you ll have you ll be able to look back on a basket of different vendors that are in this space and i think you ll see a different growth rate out of calix than others around us in the space and that s the best way i can give you to think about it in the aggregate so hopefully that makes sense the second piece is when you look at the overall opportunity tam sam all those different metrics you ve heard me say that hardware side we think that our customers will share between 1 and 10 per month per subscriber as we help them grow more and more successful business models and so who are you taking share from we careful about that term share because part of it is the new spaces that don t exist and so ultimately the best way i can answer your question is i think you go list the folks that you would think of and then let s see in the rear view mirror which businesses grow at what rate which businesses expand margins at what rate so that s the way i would address the question tim savageaux northland capital markets analyst okay i think i understand that so you re kind of saying you re taking share from your maybe your customers kind of internal marketing departments for it departments and serve it sort of a non traditional definition of the tam although in defining it that way go ahead carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer hang on tim so let s be clear when you hear us say simplify their businesses excite their subscribers and grow their value what we re actually trying to do is actually increase the value of our customers by helping them grow their revenues lower their costs and we ve all participate in the share of that it s a very different way of thinking than the traditional market share statistics tim savageaux northland capital markets analyst okay it s still have a number there but i hear what you re saying and i wanted to follow up on a couple of finer points on a few market segments that you touched on one would be tier 2s where we do perhaps see some uptick in activity there as a few of those when again it s hard to tell from just how they re defined but there does seem to be some broadly some more activity there so i wonder if you could maybe segment again and i think the overall theme here i m trying to get to is market growth versus share gain and there does seem to be a lot of market growth so in terms of whether there s something new and interesting happening in tier 2 hand on the one hand and then international i guess the comment was about existing customers so we should think more about canada mexico caribbean in terms of growth versus some of your new kind of old carrier engagements uk and elsewhere and in terms of what s driving that and that s it for me carl russo chairman of the board and chief executive officer so tier 2s again to get back to what i said earlier that mid sized customers turn 50 000 to 2 5 million is the segment that s growing but tier 2s are part of that but they are not all of that and so what we re saying back to michael s point earlier is we are having more and more success working with customers that are in larger and larger to deploy platforms and build these new business models and for the traditional tier 2s that are going through various forms of restructuring and reimbursements we ve made there will be an opportunity there over time but we ll see how they align their business strategies and through international i think we covered that earlier on where we re seeing it which is to michael s point earlier from our existing customers for the most part expanding we add new we did add new names in the international market to be sure but it s frankly the result of our continued focus as we have been on where we re aligned with customers internationally it s not because we are expanding internationally here michael weening president and chief operating officer yes tim savageaux northland capital markets analyst okay thanks operator our next question is coming from paul silverstein of cowen please go ahead paul silverstein cowen and company analyst sorry carl you re competing with the conference on that on broadband i ll ask you guys offline thanks for taking carl russo chairman of

appears the music has stopped for bill ackman universal music deal we ve got a couple of stocks to watch for the coming week joining me as always it s certified financial planner mr matt frankel matt how is everything going matt frankel good how are you doing today moser man i ve got no complaints and you know what they say even if i was complaining nobody out there wants to listen anyway we re going to look at the glass half full say everything is doing just fine matt last week we closed the show out with a preview so to speak looking at the beginning of earnings season in the banks that were getting ready to report this week we re going to talk a little bit about the banks that have reported so far primarily we focused on the big banks this week on the show and really all of the biggest banks have reported we wanted to go through the four that really stood out to you the most i wanted to kick the conversation off today with jpmorgan we know going into this earnings season jamie dimon the ceo of the bank definitely had some concerns that inflation might not necessarily be transitory some others maybe thinking about what stood out to you this quarter for jpmorgan frankel well it was weird because the stock actually dropped a little bit right after the report even though the bank beat expectations on both revenue and earnings as we mentioned earlier several times that the banks put a lot of money aside for loan losses during the pandemic and that we might see some reserve releases that was absolutely the case here jpmorgan released 5 2 billion giving you an idea of how much of things the economy has improved that accounted for over 1 a share in earnings all by itself it beat earnings expectations it beat revenue expectations trading revenue was actually pretty impressive remember in our earnings preview i was concerned that we would see trading revenue really just fall off a cliff if you remember the first quarter was really volatile in the stock market which generally makes for good trading revenue volatility in not only stocks but in interest rates as well means more people are trading bonds more people are trading stocks more frequently think institutional investors things like that trading revenue in the first quarter blew everyone s expectations out of the water in the second quarter it was a boring market in a lot of ways especially compared to the first quarter jpmorgan s trading revenue actually beat expectations on the fixed income side and the equity side fixed income was 800 million ahead of expectations equities was 1 billion over expectations as we go through you will see some of its peers did not post numbers like that so that was very promising but trading revenue is one of those things where it s very tough to predict and it jumps around from quarter to quarter a lot moser it seems almost like it s if you look at something like a disney media company where the movie revenue can be so lumpy because it s hit driven you can never really predict how a movie is going to be received and it s not like a steady stream of just hit movies always come in it s unpredictable frankel right the nature of it is really a good way to describe it because a really volatile week of the stock market can really boost your equities trading revenue which is what makes it so tough to predict because you have to think back like ok it was really volatile in march it wasn t too volatile in february that we had that one day flash crash wherever it was trading things like that it can be really tough to predict i don t put too much stock into trading revenue which a lot of investors don t which is why those were blowout numbers but the stocks still dropped interest margins really didn t creep up as much as we would hope still really really lower than last year jamie dimon hog loan demand challenged even though the loan portfolio increased by 1 over the first quarter it s still a big drop over from a year ago deposit base is up 23 year over year people have money they don t need to borrow it it is actually a big take on it a very profitable quarter return on equity was 18 which is really good for a bank anything in the double digits is usually considered good a well run bank dual wealth beats trading but we ll see how much that lasts moser yeah to your point there on loan demand it seems like that s a common thread through this earnings season so far at least with the big banks and we call that also in bank of america i think wells fargo talked about tepid demand there but i think we had referred to this statistic last week or perhaps the week before but it was just amazing to think about the numbers pre pandemic you were looking at a savings a lot of consumers had saved 800 billion collectively throughout pandemic and all of a stimulus and everything that s gone on those savings balances jumped up to 3 trillion basically played out to four years worth of saving all pulled forward in a one year so it s easy to understand why loan demand would be tepid because like you said customers are with all of the challenges consumers generally are flush with some cash frankel yeah i can see that changing over the next few quarters moser yeah it feels like it has to that s not an endless pot of money frankel as we go through bank of america s numbers you ll see that consumers are spending a whole lot there s deposit balances are going to start wildling the way down and then what happens then people need to borrow money or stop spending but let s be honest americans generally choose to borrow money rather than not spending moser yes the puts and takes of a credit driven economy let s talk about these bank of america numbers because that s another one where i was looking through this call it was interesting to see the revenue down modestly 3 5 from a year ago but it sounded like investment banking fees played a role there but what stood out to you there with bank of america s quarter frankel yes bank of america they missed revenue expectations which is really rare for a bank banks generally beat expectations i really don t know why they even bother putting out expectations because they just beat them every quarter but bank of america had a rare miss they missed revenue by about 200 million but if you said a lot of this was on the investment side specifically the trading revenue remember i just said that jpmorgan blew out expectations out of the water for trading revenue between the two fixed income and equities they beat by 1 8 billion bank of america did not bank of america missed trading revenue estimates on the fixed income side by 800 million so 800 million lower than expectations if they missed their revenue expectations by 200 million but missed trading revenue expectations by 800 million that means the rest of their business actually beat expectations moser yeah frankel another concerning thing net interest margin was i mentioned this is a problem across the board but was even lower than expected net interest margin was 1 61 that s 26 basis points lower than it was a year ago and a little bit lower than analysts were looking for like jpmorgan they released some reserves they released 1 6 billion in reserves their loan book grew in the second quarter slightly but for the first time since the pandemic started i guess consumers are going to start spending money one of the most interesting things and then i ll stop talking about bank of america because i talked about them enough on our show they actually put out a lot of consumer spending data in their earnings presentation remember brian moynihan a couple of weeks ago said consumers were spending about 20 more than they were before the pandemic moser yeah frankel but now we have the hard numbers it s actually 22 more than the first half of 2019 he broke it down into categories consumers are spending more than pre pandemic not just 2020 everyone knows we re spending more money on gas and groceries and stuff like that now than we were in 2020 i don t think i bought gas during the second quarter of 2020 frankel you probably didn t need it moser i d tell you i m still not buying a whole heck of a lot of it though it s a lot more now than it was a year ago that s for sure frankel the average bank of america customer is spending 34 more on retail than they were before the pandemic 20 more on services 16 more on food and 8 more on gas than they were in 2019 they re spending 13 less on travel so that really hasn t come back yet but even with that across the board that s 22 higher consumer spending than before the pandemic deposits are up loans are down but how long is that going to last if people are spending like this moser yeah that s a good point deposits are up 14 that s considerable but to your point again more credit reserves released much like the loan demand that s another common thread we re seeing and it s a good indicator these banks are feeling better and better about being back to where they were before 2020 ultimately that s an encouraging sign there but yet another common thread to pay attention to with these banks let s pivot to wells fargo another bank that you follow closely i ll remind listeners that this is the bank that you tapped at the beginning of the year for your financial stock of the year and so far that s working out very well for you as i watch this thing continue to creep upward it s not without its challenges they still haven t had that asset cap lifted yet matt i think that s coming sooner rather than later but it seems like it was a pretty good quarter all the way around iain followed some of those common threads we ve been talking about frankel with that asset cap he mentioned that other banks had their deposits up 10 even over 20 year over year wells fargo didn t their deposit base is only up 4 and a lot of that is because they re not allowed to grow if they take in more assets than they are allowed to they have to get rid of it somewhere else but they are the top performing bank stock year to date if only someone had suggested them moser you hear that folks that s matt tapping himself on the back frankel no just the stats the stock s up 43 year to date bank of america is up 32 jpmorgan 23 the s p is up 16 so banks as a whole are beating the market the financials to show are looking pretty good normally it s the tech show that s the star of industry focus 2020 2019 it was all the tech stocks going crazy now it s our turn wells fargo their quarter looks pretty good revenue and earnings both beat expectations they released 1 6 billion in reserves revenue grew 10 year over year which given their asset cap is pretty impressive net interest margin is better than most of their peers still did not live up to expectations but i mentioned bank of america s was 1 61 billion wells fargo s a little over 2 so their profit margin looks pretty good they said that loan demand is not doing too great and with the loan portfolio down 12 year over year it s easy to see why they would say that but just the fundamentals of the business are looking so much better than they were even a couple of years ago return on equity is almost 40 in this quarter which remember double digits is good last year it was 10 2 moser i was going to say the efficiency ratio seems like it s coming back around frankel yeah they were expecting about 76 which to put it in context jpmorgan s is 56 which is a good number moser wells was 80 just a year ago frankel yeah now they re at 66 and lower is better with efficiency ratio so we want it in the 50 but it s getting there it s getting toward where it needs to be it s becoming profitable they recently doubled the dividend remember they had to cut the dividend at the start of the pandemic it s not quite back to where it was but all things are looking good we need the fed s asset cap to be released i don t know what the fed is waiting for it seems like wells fargo has made all the right moves if you ask me moser yeah it does it does feel like they re developing this track record of just consistency and that i think to me and i know we ve talked about this before but i just want to reiterate you can offer up your twos here but it just feels like it was so key for them to bring in an outsider in charlie scharf as the new ceo they made a mistake the first time around keeping an insider when all of those culture issues were really coming to the surface just to me it really does show the value in bringing in that outside set of eyes that can take a bit more of an objective look and not feel so tied to just legacy constructs of how that business was running itself from before frankel yeah i would agree i think they re making all the right moves remember we talked last week about them cutting the personal lines of credit they could have done a better job at handling that moser that was a little bit of a failure frankel i m sure that didn t make regulators happy moser no frankel it looks like they re doing pretty good they ve improved their culture like you said they brought in some outsiders i would have thought it would have happened by now moser maybe that s a headline here the back half of the year that just keeps this thing going in the right direction i don t know maybe we go back to the beginning of the year i think it s just a great call by you and i love seeing it workout let s hope the ball keeps rolling it seems like they are setting themselves up for success here so that s a good thing in regard to investment banking investment banking i think really had an interesting period of time here particularly with all these ipos the spac there s just been a lot of business to underwrite lately how did that impact goldman sachs because that s the investment bank this bank really should be shining in this investment banking environment frankel yes their investment banking revenue was the second highest it s ever been the first quarter was the highest so they almost beat their own record the ipo market certainly helped goldman s big ipo underwriter there has been 135 billion worth of ipo issuance so far this year the average for a full year over the past five years is 53 billion we re well above what you would see in a typical full year in the ipo market and that s not spacs that s traditional ipos goldman that really helped trading revenue was down but exceeded expectations in a non volatile environment you re not going to stay that high forever earnings really smashed their expectations like i said i don t know why they even put expectations for goldman s earnings because they seem to beat them every quarter they just increased their dividend by 60 after the stress tests were released their business is looking great they re maintaining their no 1 market share in most of their key categories revenue came in over 3 billion above expectations we ll see how the ipo market continues for the rest of the year but all these ipo alerts i m getting from my td ameritrade account there s a new one i ve gotten three today so it doesn t look like it s slowing down anytime soon moser now it s a good environment to get out there and raise some money do you get any feel for how goldman is doing with its marcus offering how is marcus in general i know you ve interviewed some thoughts from the team there in regard to marcus clearly they re making big investments how is marcus performing frankel marcus is the personal loan and savings platform for those who don t know they re one of the few that their deposits are up year over year which is nice right now their loan balance is up here every year moser oh that s good frankel but a lot is because they have some high value loan products remember they re apple s credit card partner they recently took over gm s credit card business i don t know if you saw the recent news they re developing a buy now pay later lending service for apple moser yes i did see that frankel specifically for apple right now with your apple card you could finance your macbook over 24 months interest free things like that now they re developing something that will let you do that for any purchase in conjunction with apple we saw affirm stock get hammered after that they re the leading buy now pay later goldman is really going all in on consumer banking and it s still a really small percentage of the total i don t have the number right in front of me but it s less than 10 of their business but i can see that becoming much bigger in the coming years moser well matt another story that we ve been following here over the last several weeks and one you ve really dug into a good bit and explained very well i might add because it is a complicated story by virtually every angle but this is bill ackman s pershing square tontine we ve been talking about this move to acquire 10 of universal music through this back offering from pershing square then we now see that actually this deal isn t going to happen it looks like pershing square tontine is dropping this deal to buy 10 of universal music i m wondering if you could explain the nuts and bolts of what s going on frankel well i wish they would have looked into whether the sec would have approved this before they decided to i m disappointed in that to be honest with you the whole point of a spac is to acquire a full business to have a business combination you can make the argument that acquiring a 10 stake of a music company is not a business combination moser yeah frankel i have the press release in front of me the sec s problem in particular was whether the structure of this qualified under the rules they call it the structure of their intended business combination whether they re qualified now i m kicking myself for spending hours looking through the structure of the deal and trying to understand this thing now that it can t go through but so what happens now is the question moser well yeah what is happening now frankel now they still have 4 billion of cash sitting there pershing square itself the hedge fund not the spac is going to go ahead with the 10 universal stake pershing square is still buying that it doesn t help the spac investors at all now they have 4 billion they are going to pursue a traditional spac business combination where they actually buy a business bill ackman was on cnbc this morning one of the biggest obstacles and also one of the biggest competitive advantages is that this is the biggest spac ever investing that 4 billion only makes sense with a handful of companies remember we did our fund episode where we named like 20 companies they could buy moser sure frankel i think chick fil a was one of them subway was one things like that moser yeah frankel that s also a big limiting factor but he said that s not necessarily a limitation they could acquire a smaller company and pay a dividend to shareholders with whatever is left if they wanted to do it that way but now they still have 18 months left on the clock to execute a business combination he made the point on cnbc this morning that they are not starting from zero before they settled on the universal deal they had discussions with a lot of other companies so they can just as easily pick those discussions back up if they want to he said they re getting into this with a running start not terribly worried about it i m holding onto my shares because they re pretty much not trading at much of a premium they have 20 per share in cash sitting in that account and i think it was trading for 20 50 less their worth it s approaching the floor that 20 creates a price floor because that s cash sitting in an account i m holding onto mine i m optimistic i m disappointed i m not going to say i m not i thought this was a done deal that would have a really good long term structure which i still think it would have been but obviously the sec said this is not what spac s are for you re pushing it bill ackman it s what they re saying there you re pushing the limits a little too far moser well hey listen you got to play by the rules and i guess it makes sense to not throw good money after bad if it s something they feel like they can pull off but we shall see matt before we take off let s give our listeners a couple of stocks to keep an eye on this week what is your stock to watch this week frankel i am watching some of these homebuilder stocks if you have just gotten beat up lately dream finders homes dfh 4 70 is one in particular i m watching it is one of the latest additions to my own portfolio the ticker symbol is dfh in the first quarter their homes delivered went up 95 year over year because the real estate market has gone crazy their new order book was up 137 year over year they had a backlog of over 3 600 homes at the end of the first quarter this is a company that s built a total of about 10 000 homes in its history that s a big backlog they focus on the sun belt markets they re based in jacksonville and have a presence in the carolina s they actually have a presence in dc which is not as far north as they ll go so you might see some dream finders homes signs around where you are but a company i m watching especially for the next few years they re growing really rapidly so i want to see if that keeps up this quarter and for the rest of 2020 but the stocks really pulled back tremendously lately it s back on the top of my watchlist and i might even add to my new position moser there you go i m going to be keeping an eye on not really a financials company so to speak but we enlist most stocks to watch we open up the universe here for all listeners given that it s earning season i m actually going to be keeping an eye on chipotle cmg 1 32 earnings for chipotle come out tuesday after the market closes you look at the five year chart for this business particularly given where they were not all that long ago and to the food safety crisis there that they went through the five year chart for this company stocks up 275 that has been one heck of a comeback year to date shares are up a little bit they re underperforming but it was one of the stars i think of 2020 from an operational perspective this is going to be a quarter at comps over one where things were getting pretty dicey just a year ago i think it will be interesting to see how that comp works out for them last year they stood at around 15 million loyalty customers and their digital sales in that quarter a year ago grew 216 from the previous year highest ever quarterly level at that point in time represented 61 of overall sales i think it s just going to be interesting to see how this business reports and compares to a year ago particularly when you consider that it really is one of the restaurants that helped spearhead so much change over the course of 2020 where that change really was just an absolute necessity it is a stock i still own a few shares of believe it or not matt i m feeling pretty good about hanging onto those shares because this has been a long term big fat winner do you own any shares of chipotle frankel no but you know who is a loser in that one mcdonald s remember chipotle used to be a subsidiary of mcdonald s and they sold it for something like 10 million moser i do remember that i remember that well yeah you got to feel like mcdonald s is kicking themselves frankel next time you go through the mcdonald s drive through i don t know if you do that or not but thank them for getting rid of chipotle and making you some money in the process moser that s right well matt i think that s going to do it for us this week as always thanks so much for taking the time to join us frankel of course it s always fun to be here moser remember folks you can always reach out to us on twitter mfindustryfocus or you can drop us an email at as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against so don t buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear thanks as always to tim sparks for putting the show together for us for matt frankel i m jason moser thanks for listening and we ll see you next week
jack antonoff has achieved a rarified ubiquity for a songwriter producer you can measure his prominence in grammy awards five and to a certain extent critics lists and charts though for someone technically working behind the scenes the best proof might just be the memes like this scrappy photoshop job of lorde telling the taylor swift evermore cover mom said it s my turn with the jack antonoff or the tiktok of three men tossing a child back and forth which one twitter user captioned lorde clairo phoebe bridgers passing around the jack antonoff or just a quick twitter search will reveal multiple people reaching the same conclusions all the pop girlies really are passing antonoff around like a blunt since producing a pair of tracks on swift s 1989 antonoff s not only remained one of her closest collaborators but served as a primary producer on albums by lorde lana del rey st vincent the chicks brockhampton s kevin abstract and clairo he s made tracks with fka twigs pink troye sivan and carly rae jepsen his trio red hearse with singer sam dew and producer sounwave released an album in 2019 and parallel to all this he s also had bleachers nominally a band but effectively an antonoff solo project who are now back with their third album and first in four years take the sadness out of saturday night bleachers are the clearest window into the musical mind of an artist best known as a collaborator from the outset they have specialized in the kind of driving ginormous songs that can really only be described as new jerseyan antonoff is a garden stater born and raised their 2014 debut strange desire and 2017 s gone now approached the enormity of life heartbreak and hope with more contemporary pop flourishes and an eye towards the eighties not dissimilar from the work antonoff was doing with swift and lorde at the time now on take the sadness out of saturday night the sounds are for lack of more interesting words more organic and analog closer antonoff s recent efforts with del rey and st vincent popular on rolling stone editor s picks it s a consistent intriguing occasionally revelatory album rooted in a 2017 break up but completed during the pandemic as antonoff recently explained to rolling stone the desperation that accompanied that heartbreak echoed his desperation to play music again with other people for other people i realized oh that s the same feeling of being from new jersey that desperation of wanting out of i want to break through into another part of my life he said the balm was to call his bleachers bandmates into the studio and that full band energy anchors most oftake the sadness out of saturday night s mightiest moments front and center more than ever before is antonoff s bruce springsteen worship sure the man himself pops up to sing a verse on chinatown but even he doesn t sound as springsteen ian as the excited anxious eager chimes on don t go dark or the call and response rave up on how dare you want more beyond bruce there are orchestral elements that recall the beatles at their most baroque and that early 2000s folk indie rock chamber pop milieu of arcade fire sufjan stevens and rostam era vampire weekend 91 with its staccato strings and overlapping cascading vocals reminiscent of the jersey pop punk emo scene where antonoff cut his teeth is a compelling opener when the brass and woodwinds return on the final two tracks strange behavior and what d i do with all of this faith each is tender gentle and aching enough but not enough to make the other feel at least a little redundant the highest highs on take the sadness out of saturday night are familiar for bleachers rock and roll thrillers with punchy pop pleas like stop making this hurt don t go dark and how dare you want more like i wanna get better and don t take the money before them these songs are impeccably crafted lab perfected to chill one s spine but the performances on take the sadness are just shaggy and loose enough to keep the dullness of perfection at bay bleachers let their studio chatter whistles whoops and hollers settle in the mix on some tracks it s an old obvious trick but the joy isn t contrived it s contagious when everyone s trying to sing along with sax solo on how dare you want more on don t go dark antonoff staggers the delivery of his vocals and soaks them in reverb like he s trying to keep up with himself while the chicks unmistakable harmonies leap up in a way that would play great in an arena but feel even better suited for the space between a club s low ceiling and sticky floor related stories for the most part the music on take the sadness out of saturday night does conjure and harness that break on through energy nothing s outright unlistenable and even the album s most lackluster offering secret life has a couple nifty chord changes the lyrics meanwhile feel rooted in the concerns of that former phase brooding over a disintegrating love parsing depression and fractured feelings and dreaming of what s next bleachers albums regularly feature recurring motifs and this one is no different antonoff can t stop chasing holy ghosts on secret life he s haunted by a lonely ghost on strange behavior and speaking of specters with diminishing thematic returns the kennedys make a shrug worthy cameo on what d i do with all of this faith it s not just the repetition but the words antonoff chooses often feel overwrought and over familiar my chinatown baby sounds like something an e street neural network would spit out and it s not exactly thrilling to hear springsteen sing a line like i wanna find tomorrow with you baby when he came up with just around the corner to the light of day 34 years ago bleachers earn themselves a pass when these stock phrases aren t hung out to dry by music that s merely competent the canyon wide guitar strum of 45 lends some tact to the hook s cheeky reference but i m still in sight your fast machine always holding your love supreme and the stop making this hurt line but me and ray we got a dream and a car we re like free as the night arrives with a punch as an unexpected breakbeat caroms across the mix the novelist zadie smith and del rey helped write 91 and don t go dark respectively and unsurprisingly those contain some of the album s most vivid and interesting language 91 even has its own ghost but waltzing with mom against a backdrop of endless war on tv it earns its right to haunt antonoff s own best lines don t feel like they ve been dwelled on or molded to fit the rock canon and even burst with a bit of the weird who is she without all of this carryin fear he wonders on how dare you want more oh god she s still my mother and still my wheel as much dreaming and striving as there is on take the sadness out of saturday night one of its most interesting quirks is antonoff s inability to stop checking himself over his wants it s a tic he discussed in rolling stone tying it in part to his american jewishness and the shtetl mentality still kicking around needling and nagging with caution and guilt despite decades of assimilation for someone so earnest and averse to cynicism as antonoff it s almost refreshing to hear him ask on stop making this hurt if we take the sadness out of saturday night i wonder what will be left with anything worth the fight he wants to run from the darkness sure but he wants to shout at the light too and when it s all over no one is standing triumphant it s practically an oy vey exhale oh god we barely survived this tension combined with that full band energy make take the sadness out of saturday night bleachers most cohesive effort but it doesn t quite match the grandiose expectations antonoff s laid out for himself as an artist who wants to make albums not just songs there are songs here that can stand alongside antonoff s best work and it feels as if he s beginning to carve out a clearer vision of what bleachers can be as a band if take the sadness out of saturday night was about trying to conjure a new phase of life here s hoping the next one s even better

places starting in nevada next year i want to thank all our employees around the world for their contributions to a great quarter i know it s been a challenging 18 months through it all taking care of everyone in our workforce has remained a top priority now we are reimagining the future of work with flexibility as a guiding principle i was excited to see so many people in person as we started a voluntary return to our california offices recently as we make our way back we are giving employees more flexibility in how and where they work and we ll continue to invest in our sites in the u s and elsewhere over to philipp philipp schindler chief business officer thanks sundar and hello everyone it s great to be with you today we are pleased with the growth in google services revenues in the second quarter year on year performance reflects elevated consumer online activity broad based strength in advertiser spend and the lapping of the first ever revenue decline in our ads business last year due to covid in the second quarter retail again was by far the largest contributor to the year on year growth of our ads business travel financial services and media and entertainment were also strong contributors let s now take a few minutes to talk about the trends we ve seen across our business over the last 18 months we ve been deeply focused on helping businesses big and small navigate profound change first as a lifeline during the pandemic and now as a partner to reaccelerate growth as the world begins to reopen the road to global recovery is likely to be uneven and unpredictable that s why the real time insights we ve put in the hands of businesses going into the pandemic will be just as important coming out of it new tools like travel insights which launched in the u s this month after rolling out to select countries in apac and emea in december are helping our partners get a clearer picture of where demand is coming from wyndham hotels and resorts for example is leaning into insights and automation across search display and youtube to meet travelers wherever and whenever they need a hotel they drove nearly 2 times more direct bookings from media deployed on google in the first half of 2021 versus the year prior or take amtrak covid hit ridership plummeted budgets were cut uncertainty ensued on how to efficiently reach essential travelers so we stepped in with insights and automation bookings for the last quarter which was q2 increased 3 times year over year with cost per acquisition down 52 these examples also underscore the value of ai and automation in a world that s changing fast we know today that more than 80 of our advertisers use automated bidding using ml our ads products are more efficiently connecting businesses with our customers taking the guesswork out of getting the right message at the right time to the right customer all in a privacy first way and performance max our newest ai powered campaign is now in beta it let s brands buy ads from a single campaign across all google properties helping drive more online sales more leads and or more store visits early results for participating advertisers are great moving on to retail where momentum remains strong we re continuing to build an open ecosystem that benefits both users and merchants last year we removed financial barriers with free product listings and zero commission fees this year we are removing integration barriers with shopify woocommerce godaddy and square merchants can now onboard and show their products across google for free and our shopping graph is using ai to connect these products to the people who want them with over 24 billion listings for millions of merchants across the web let s talk omnichannel last quarter i said it was here to stay and it is retailers continue to build their digital presence to drive both online and offline sales and we re helping them to do it take bed bath beyond who quickly pivoted to curbside pickup pickup in store and same day delivery when people were stuck at home they ve continued these offerings across google with impressive success omni and digital shoppers now make up 50 of customers and in q1 a third of total digital sales were fulfilled by stores of course they ve tapped youtube to build awareness for their new customer inspired own brands we ll continue to invest in new ways to help retailers through what is likely to be a long and uncertain recovery around the world let s move to youtube which had a great quarter with strong growth in both brand and direct response we ve seen three key trends first brand youtube is helping advertisers reach audiences they can t find anywhere else according to nielsen s total ad ratings reach reporting from q4 18 to q4 20 on average 70 of youtube s reach was delivered to an audience not reached by the advertisers tv media in other words youtube s reach is becoming increasingly incremental to tv and this audience dynamic is a huge win for brands in fact nielsen found that u s advertisers who shifted just 20 of spend from tv to youtube generated a 25 increase to their total campaign reach within their target audience while lowering their cost per reach point by almost 20 these combined effects of approved reach and efficiency are helping advertisers get the most out of their brand investments second direct response advertisers are turning to the platform to generate demand and drive transactions like malaysian ed tech platform mindvalley which focuses on personal growth and learning increased their investment in trueview for action and now video action as people turned to youtube in record numbers to learn in q2 this generated 600 000 plus leads with 20 coming from the u s third youtube is uniquely positioned to drive both massive reach and action we re seeing more advertisers adopt a full frontal approach to scale their businesses with increased efficiency compara a financial services market leader in chile combined a reach and direct response campaign to capitalize on leads over 10 weeks they reached 5 million users with incremental conversions up 70 this trend is widely embraced by the largest advertisers where business are breaking down silos between online and offline since our founding we ve always believed that the future of google and the future of our partners are intrinsically linked from individual youtube creators and major music labels to global and local online publishers to play developers big and small our business is built on revenue share models that succeed only when our partners succeed one excellent example of how we re helping our partners innovate is our work with the telecom industry sundar talked about efforts in cloud to help them build more efficient networks and transition to 5g we re also working cross google to help carriers including at t telstra t mobile and verizon launch new devices and services add new subscribers we re seeing customer engagement via business messaging partnerships and support enterprise growth i want to close with two huge thank you s first to our customers and partners for their collaboration second to our product partnership sales and many support teams for their extraordinary work this quarter and dedication to our customers and partners success now over to ruth ruth porat chief financial officer thank you philipp our strong revenue performance in the second quarter reflects lapping the impact of covid on our business elevated consumer online activity broad based strength in advertiser spend as well as the benefit of excellent ongoing execution by our teams my comments will be on year over year comparisons for the second quarter unless i state otherwise we ll start with results at the alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook for the second quarter our consolidated revenues were 61 9 billion up 62 or up 57 in constant currency our total cost of revenues was 26 2 billion up 41 primarily driven by growth in tac which was 10 9 billion up 63 followed by growth in other cost of revenues which was 15 3 billion up 29 the largest driver of which was content acquisition costs operating expenses were 16 3 billion up 22 in terms of the three component parts of opex first the increase in r d expenses was driven primarily by headcount growth second the growth in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to the ramp up of spending on ads and promo in contrast to the pullback in the second quarter last year finally the increase in g a reflects the impact of charges relating to legal matters headcount was up 4 061 from the first quarter operating income was 19 4 billion up 203 and our operating margin in the quarter was 31 other income and expense was 2 6 billion which primarily reflects unrealized gains and the value of investments in equity securities net income was 18 5 billion let me now turn to our segment financial results starting with our google services segment total google services revenues were 57 1 billion up 63 google search and other advertising revenues of 35 8 billion in the quarter were up 68 with broad based strength across our business led again by strong growth in retail youtube advertising revenues of 7 billion were up 84 driven by brand followed by direct response network advertising revenues of 7 6 billion were up 60 driven by ad manager and admob other revenues were 6 6 billion up 29 primarily driven by growth in youtube non advertising revenues followed by hardware which benefited from the addition of fitbit revenues and finally google play which lapped the increased level of user engagement that started in q1 last year due to the pandemic google services operating income was 22 3 billion up 134 and the operating margin was 39 turning to the google cloud segment revenues were 4 6 billion for the second quarter up 54 gcps revenue growth was again above cloud overall reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services once again strong growth in google workspace revenues was driven by robust growth in both seats and average revenue per seat google cloud had an operating loss of 591 million as to our other bets in the first quarter revenues were 192 million the operating loss was 1 4 billion let me close with some comments on our outlook in the second quarter revenues benefited from an fx tailwind of more than 4 at the consolidated level based on fx spot rates against the dollar relative to the third quarter of last year we expect a more muted tailwind to revenues in the third quarter in terms of outlook by segment for google services the benefit to revenue growth in q2 from lapping the effects of covid last year will diminish through the balance of the year as we begin to lap stronger performance in the second half of 2020 in the second quarter we continued to benefit from elevated consumer online activity and broad based strength in advertiser spend we believe it is still too early to forecast the longer term trends as markets reopen especially given the recent increase in covid cases globally within other revenues play revenue growth for the balance of the year will face headwinds due to the impact of lapping elevated engagement in the pandemic as well as the change in fee structure which was implemented as of july 1 we continue to invest across google services to support the extraordinary opportunities we see a couple of reminders consistent with prior years we expect that headcount additions will be seasonally higher in q3 as we bring on new graduates in addition we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year in part to support product launches and the holiday season as for google cloud we remain focused on revenue growth and are pleased with the trends we are seeing across cloud we will continue to invest aggressively given the opportunity we see turning to capex the results in the second quarter primarily reflect ongoing investment in our technical infrastructure most notably in servers to support ongoing growth across google we also began to increase the pace of investment in ground up construction and fit outs of office facilities which were slowed due to covid and are focused now on turning to cash and capital allocation we continue to generate strong free cash flow of 16 4 billion in the quarter and 58 5 billion for the trailing 12 months we ended the second quarter with 136 billion in cash and marketable securities as we indicated in our press release today our board has approved an amendment to the existing 50 billion stock repurchase program permitting us to repurchase both class a and class c shares in a manner that s in the best interest of the company and its stockholders thank you and now sundar philipp and i will take your questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from brian nowak with morgan stanley your line is open brian nowak morgan stanley analyst thanks for taking my question i have two one for sundar and one for philipp sundar the first one is you ve had so much innovation over the years using ai to improve search and improve the overall business can you just give us some examples of where you still see marketing fruit or areas for further improvement in the company s overall products using ai etc over the next couple of years and then philipp your comments on omnichannel were pretty loud and clear give us some examples of where you re most focused to continue to enable more retailers to move in the omnichannel to drive that kind of business thanks sundar pichai chief executive officer brian thanks couple we see so much headroom given our bet on ai going to our most important product of all search when you see the launch of bert which was a significant improvement and we are following that up with mum which is another extraordinary advance so the rate i mean information is growing pretty rapidly and so constantly developing better models to improve our search quality ranking etc is one of the most important ways we invest beyond that i would say all the work we are doing into making sure computers can understand in a multi modal way be it images audio text video and then bringing it up across our products i think is an important way we ll approach it philipp philipp schindler chief business officer yes and to my part of the question look we want to make sure that when people come to google they are able to basically find the best products and prices available from frankly the widest possible range of merchants and we re making strong progress on the build leadership and as i said earlier 2020 was about removing financial barriers we made listings free removed commission fees and it s worth pointing out the upside of combining free listings with shopping ads actually merchants that used both in q1 saw a 50 lift in clicks once they started i think that s pretty impressive 2021 as i said has been about removing integration barriers we have the partnerships with shopify square bigcommerce godaddy woocommerce and so on and they re making it easier for businesses to get started with us whether it s across search and shopping and image search and youtube and then once merchants are on boarded i mean there is so much more value we can offer them we launched a new measurement tool to help retailers better understand performance and pricing you asked specifically a question about focus areas and then we re making the product and user experience better not only with our ui ux research feedback with our tech and ai capabilities and maybe a cool example is how we re using ai to bring in store experiences online like with auto dealerships and on letting users really try before they buy and we do this in cosmetics and in apparel categories and we have the shopping graph which i mentioned earlier and we think it will open up completely new product experiences across google shopping with lens is one example you can shop with your screenshots or use your phone camera to find the dress or pair of sneakers that caught your eye or whatever and we re working hard to build an open retail ecosystem and that really levels the playing field for all merchants and we think there is a lot of opportunity ahead and i think those are our biggest areas of focus brian nowak morgan stanley analyst great thank you both operator thank you our next question comes from doug anmuth with j p morgan your line is open doug anmuth j p morgan analyst great thanks for taking the question i have two first just i think a key initiative over the last couple of years has been to bring the full breadth of google services to customers so i was hoping you could talk more just about when you think about the search and overall ads recovery and also growth in google cloud how those efforts are going as you work across businesses with corporate customers and what their reception has been and then ruth just on costs kind of in the back half and going forward as you think about bringing some of these costs back just curious if you can comment more around some of the puts and takes as you think about the overall cost structure pre covid versus post covid thanks sundar pichai chief executive officer yeah thanks doug i would say overall as you realize it s a broad digital shift customers are looking for digital transformation and depending on the sector they are in they look to alphabet as a digital partner and we try to bring the broader solution set that s possible across our capabilities and that s been working well you mentioned cloud most of our cloud customers are either in conversations with us it could be because they re concerned about security on their supply chain or they are trying to understand the shift to digital and invest more in data analytics or the shift to a hybrid workforce is what s probably getting them to think about workspace and so on and if they are retailers we can bring in our expertise across ads the work we re doing on commerce to be with the partnerships we have and so we can bring those additional expertise to bear and so that s a trend we are seeing across philipp gave examples of our telco partnerships and so across our priority verticals we are able to engage in a broad way and maybe the recent googlewide partnership with univision was another example of a multi year multi product partnership with companies ruth porat chief financial officer and with respect to the second question how we think about investments in the back half really the driving focus is how do we support near term long term quality growth and i think it s important to note that some of our costs are less variable in the short term such as depreciation and the operations costs of our data centers so when you look at q2 performance in part the meaningful year on year improvement in the operating margin in the second quarter clearly reflects the strong revenue growth but also the fact that some of these costs are less variable in the short term however to support long term growth and very much to your questions through across both google services and google cloud we will continue to increase the pace of investment and that s true in headcount it s true with continued sales and marketing really across the board and you also heard that in some of my comments about capex we re continuing to pick up the pace of investment in office facilities both fit outs and ground up construction had been slowed as a result of covid and we re pleased that the pace has picked up and that really relates to our comments about continuing to build out across the u s around the globe in line with continuing to invest in headcount growth i d make one other point which is i think you re aware of this but in this quarter the results also reflect the benefit from the change in useful lives that we talked about earlier in the year that reduced depreciation expense it s a benefit of about 721 million in the quarter and the benefit from this change will be lower in the second half as you re looking ahead doug anmuth j p morgan analyst great thank you sundar and ruth operator thank you our next question comes from justin post with bank of america your line is open justin post bank of america analyst great thanks for taking my questions a couple when you look at search in the quarter it really accelerated beyond the comp and if you look at it quarter over quarter it was really good so wondering if there s any products or verticals that really surprised you or things to call out and how do you think about the sustainability here specifically in search and the product pipeline from here and then secondly on cloud really saw a nice margin improvement there how do you feel about where you are in the infrastructure side and ability to really continue to show kind of that improvement in margins over time thank you sundar pichai chief executive officer two questions maybe i ll take the second first on the cloud side first of all we do in the investments in our infrastructure first of all we are doing it across the set of cloud services we are building for google and it s the same that we bring to cloud and so there is tremendous synergies we have there and maybe to give you an example of it i earlier mentioned data analytics and processing it s the same infrastructure be it bigquery etc which we have invested and built over time and people are looking to use data analytics alongside with machine learning and ai they want to do this across structured and unstructured data do it across any platform and so that s the kind of capability we are able to bring and overall i ll let ruth comment on maybe the margin side of this a bit more ruth ruth porat chief financial officer yeah i would just build on sundar s comment there is really no change in our approach to building the cloud business we do intend to continue to invest meaningfully we are very pleased with the business as we both said as an example we re continuing to build out the global footprint continuing to invest in our compute capacity globally as an example we most recently announced a second cloud region in india this is our 26th cloud datacenter region globally and so continuing to invest across the board given the opportunity that we see and as i said last quarter i would not extrapolate from quarter to quarter given we still are in the early stages of building the business and we do intend to continue to invest aggressively including expanding our go to market organization our channel expansion our product offerings and our compute capacity excited about what we re seeing the team executing upon here sundar pichai chief executive officer on search the first part of your philipp schindler chief business officer yeah can you hear me sundar pichai chief executive officer yeah philipp schindler chief business officer yeah and to the first part of the question it s similar to what i said in my remarks at the beginning retail was again by far the largest contributor to the year on year growth of our ads business travel financial services media entertainment were also very very strong contributors justin post bank of america analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from colin sebastian with baird your line is open colin sebastian robert w baird analyst great thanks for taking my questions first sundar as a follow up on cloud you talked about the tailwinds from advanced ai and data analytics in terms of growth is it fair to say as well based on your initial comments that security also represents some competitive differentiation that s contributing incrementally to business developments and then for philipp on the momentum in youtube and capturing the shift in viewership and advertising away from linear tv how do the different google services fit together in that not just core youtube but android tv google tv youtube tv is this something that s been increasingly connected or linked in the back end and as well on the front end for consumers thanks sundar pichai chief executive officer on security and cloud we definitely see it as a strong differentiation obviously google for a long time we are cloud native we pioneered approaches like zero trust build our architecture out from a security first perspective and so particularly over the course of the last couple of years as companies have really with the recent attacks they ve really started thinking deeply about the vulnerabilities supply chain security has been a major source of consensus particularly over the past few quarters cyber threats increasingly is in the mind of not just cios but ceos across our partners and so it s definitely an area where we are seeing a lot of conversations lot of interest it s our strongest product portfolio and we are continuing to enhance our solutions be it integrating chronicle beyond core and all the product competence we have there so a definite source of strength and you ll continue to see us invest here philipp schindler chief business officer and on the second part of your question look momentum is really strong across both our brand and direct response business on youtube maybe let me start on the brand side the global shift to online video and streaming continues with over like 2 billion monthly active users now 1 billion plus hours of video watched every day i think we re at the forefront of this shift and advertisers have increasingly needed to look beyond linear tv alternatives to achieve their reach and awareness goals and as i said earlier nielsen s total ad ratings reach reporting found on average 70 of youtube s reach was delivered to an audience not reached by the advertisers tv media so not only are we driving improved reach but we re also helping brands do it more efficiently and as a result of this you see many advertisers reevaluating their media mix and increasing their investments in our platforms and as far as the direct response part goes we re helping advertisers convert intent into action we tried to drive performance at an incredible scale take an example like with video action campaigns which is our next generation trueview for action format advertisers are getting access to even more inventory across youtube and our partners all in a single automated campaign and as i said before we re working really hard to make youtube not only more actionable but also more shoppable so youtube is proving to be meaningful for not just brand building and reaching a massive audience but also for converting viewers into buyers and what s nice is that we re seeing more advertisers leveraging brand to create demand and direct response to convert it so they re basically using the full funnel very very smartly and then to the second part of your second question the youtube tv ads for example this part we re really trying to bring the well connected tv is let me phrase it from connected tv part i think that s easier it is really the fastest growing consumer surface that we have and that growth started before the pandemic and has frankly solidified since and in the u s we have over 120 million people who watch youtube on tvs every month and that s up from like 100 million last year we re number one in reach and watch time among ad supported streaming services so we re very very happy with the development that we re seeing here operator thank you our next question comes from brent thill with jefferies your line is open brent thill jefferies analyst thanks just a follow up on youtube can you maybe talk to the e commerce opportunity that you re seeing evolve where you re at now and eventually where would you like to be thank you sundar pichai chief executive officer on youtube look i mean if you look at the engagement across the platform we definitely see a lot of headroom for e commerce over the past year you ve seen us really focus on accelerating a shift to in terms of on boarding merchants across google so we ve definitely invested both in terms of bringing merchants on board removing barriers there providing better integrations by partnering with players platform providers across the industry and now we are investing in our consumer experiences speed on google search or on youtube and so you will see us roll out features over time philipp do you want to add more here philipp schindler chief business officer yeah look there is a ton of commercial intent across youtube and it was a shopping destination before covid i mean think unboxing videos product reviews make up tutorials and so on and throughout the pandemic we ve really seen more shoppers turn to the platform for ideas inspiration and really help them decide what to buy and a number of shopping capabilities are already underway and we are working real hard to make it easier for users to discover and buy directly on youtube and i mentioned how merchants can globally add their product feeds now right into video action campaigns and brands and shoppers alike are loving it and we also began beta testing this for example with discovery ads and kind of last quarter i mentioned i hope viewers can make purchases from their favorite creators with their early experiments with brandconnect and shoppable product shelves and early adopters are seeing a lot of success here so stay tuned for more updates later this year brent thill jefferies analyst great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mark mahaney with evercore isi your line is open mark mahaney evercore isi analyst thanks we ve had record new business formation in the u s and i think globally in the wake of covid and my guess is that that s also been a major driver of growth for you could you just talk about that a little bit to the extent to which you think some of these especially the advertising trends come from these new businesses that are formed whether they re digital hybrid or whatever and then secondly how do you go from tens of thousands of waymo rides to millions of rides like what are the biggest obstacles to that any clue at all as to how long that takes is are the issues more regulatory more technical thank you philipp schindler chief business officer new businesses small businesses are the backbone of our economy here but obviously local communities are in varying stages of recovery some are reopening while others are unfortunately returning to lockdown and we re focused on continuing to i would say level the playing field for smbs here and from getting them online and frankly set up for success to giving them all the digital tools they need to get discovered and be ready for what s ahead this includes the ability to like seamlessly transition between online and offline and reach customers nearby far beyond their local neighborhoods as well so over the past few months i mean literally just the past few months we ve made it easier for smbs to show their product across google for free and we added new ways for them to highlight in store inventories through local inventory ads and we ve also made it easier for them to leverage the power of youtube they now can create video ad campaigns literally within minutes via their smartphone and these are just a few examples of the ways we re helping plus also interesting trend people are more eager than ever to support their local small businesses searches for support local business are up like 20 times last year in the u s alone and this is creating a lot of opportunity for smbs overall and i don t know take an example like ayla beauty for example it s a san francisco beauty brand they made a 100 pivot to online during the pandemic and with insights into popular wellness and beauty searches in google ads has been really able to grow their business significantly over the last year sundar pichai chief executive officer on waymo as you mentioned in phoenix we ve had very good experience by scaling up rides these are driver less rides and no one s in the car other than the passengers and people have had a very positive experience overall we are obviously with a strong focus on safety we are looking to scale it up through it all we are building newer capabilities as well investing in next generation of hardware and software so it s an iterative process and at each step it s very clear to us that we are ahead and we are making progress and you ll see us continue to invest here with a focus on safety first and i expect us to scale up more through the course of 2022 mark mahaney evercore isi analyst thank you sundar and thank you philipp operator thank you our next question comes from michael nathanson with moffettnathanson your line is open michael nathanson moffettnathanson analyst great thanks i have one for you sundar and one for philipp just a minute ago philipp spoke to the acceleration in streaming and smart tvs worldwide and the importance that youtube has on the tv glass i wanted to hear from you about your interest in supporting the smart tv ecosystem and what do you see as the opportunity for google in terms of your product offerings to maybe improve consumer adoption of connected tvs and then for you philipp people have been asking about search but if you look at search on a two year stack the growth is as high as it s been in years and i wonder if you can disaggregate for us the growth between maybe new search customers coming on the platform versus increased spending on a existing per customer basis or anything to help us kind of what drove it on a client by client basis on search sundar pichai chief executive officer on the first question on the smart tv ecosystem look i mean there is a shift to these becoming computing devices over time they re going to be connected computing experiences people will both consume content passively actively including gaming over the top video and so on so we view this as part of our platform shift android tv has made tremendous strides it s a very customizable platform we are working not only with tv providers globally we are doing it with cable box manufacturers as well as we supplemented with google tv with chromecast as well so it s a significant investment from our side making sure we can drive that shift and obviously it adds a lot of synergies for us in terms of being able to bring our services to our users as well as give more opportunities for our play developers to reach more users as well but definite strong integration points with youtube and youtube tv as well philipp schindler chief business officer look maybe rather than go into the deep disaggregation that you re talking about let me maybe talk a little about how we think about the overall market for search in the addressable market in the last call last quarter i gave you a little bit of a breakdown here but what is really important is we re not just addressing above the line marketing budgets which is different metrics around let s say around 0 5 trillion which is traditional advertising tv advertising and so on and there is also significant upside in below the line budgets overall like promotional pricing product within sponsorships and so on and sure we ve seen covid accelerate the shift to e commerce at an astounding rate but keep also in mind 80 of commerce still remains offline so there s a lot of room for digital to play a bigger role and we think we can tap into other budgets that were traditionally used for let s say local advertising to derive sales and as we think about our long runway for growth we also think obviously about improving user and advertiser experiences for years to come here and we are constantly asking ourselves how do we derive better answers to queries including those with commercial intent and how do we use our ml to deliver even more relevant and higher quality experiences for users and our primary focus is really on delivering great experiences for users and driving incremental value for our partners and making them successful and i think as long as we do this we should continue to see budgets move our way michael nathanson moffettnathanson analyst okay thank you both operator thank you our last question comes from jason bazinet with citi your line is open jason bazinet citi analyst i just had one question maybe it dovetails off of what you just said but if i take your ad dollars this quarter 50 billion in annualized it s like 200 billion a year are you or the board focused at all on trying to diversify away from the ad market or do you just feel like there is so much runway that there is no real reason to stay focused on non ad based growth sundar pichai chief executive officer look at a high level we multiple parts to your question obviously we are very focused on we have a mission we have an approach of being helpful across certain important attributes and we do deep investments in computer science and ai to build services and out of that naturally there is diversification over time when you look at youtube as contributing to that you look at cloud and within cloud we have both gcp and workspace contributing to that and longer term we have efforts like waymo as well beyond that as both philipp and ruth have spoken about with this digital shift we see a lot of headroom in terms of where market for either advertising or e commerce and so we see a lot of headroom there as well so we take a long term view we start from first principles toward focusing on both investing in deep technology and solving user problems and out of that i think you have a set of diversified models that emerge both different types of businesses and also within a business for example in youtube we have both ads and subscription over time and so i think we ll continue approaching it that way with an eye for the long term jason bazinet citi analyst thank you operator thank you and that concludes our question and answer session for today i d like to turn the conference back over to jim friedland for any further remarks jim friedland director of investor relations thanks everyone for joining us today we look forward to speaking with you again on

of panter hall using the ronati ecommerce manager has been a very positive experience but most importantly we are making money because of it and seeing tangible sales online success finding buyers on and offline is a direct result of the number of locations buyers can find a dealer no dealer can rely on a single fair to produce the sales needed in a year and online is no different if a dealer does not list their stock where qualified buyers shop the first opportunity for connection is lost online marketplaces find the number one reason dealers do not want to join their platform is because they simply can t manage their stock on yet another marketplace the ronati ecommerce manager solves this issue for both the dealer and the marketplaces ronati has signed on leading dealers in the uk and north america and established partnerships with some of the most important art and antiques organisations including lapada cinoa aadla olympia art antiques fairs dolphin promotions and others in

to date avoiding customers facing disappointment after finding an item they are interested in buying has been sold as those who have already signed up for the service have discovered being able to post more items across each marketplace on a regular basis makes them more visible to potential clients and has resulted in increased sales thanks to ronati we are actually uploading our stock to multiple marketplaces says london fine art dealer matthew hall of panter hall using the ronati ecommerce manager has been a very positive experience but most importantly we are making money because of it and seeing tangible sales online success finding buyers on and offline is a direct result of the number of locations buyers can find a dealer no dealer can rely on a single fair to produce the sales needed in a year and online is no different if a dealer does not list their stock where qualified buyers shop the first opportunity for connection is lost online marketplaces find the number one reason dealers do not want to join their platform is because they simply can t manage their stock on yet another marketplace the ronati ecommerce manager solves this issue for both the dealer and the marketplaces ronati has signed on leading dealers in the uk and north america and established partnerships with some of the most important art and antiques organisations including lapada cinoa aadla olympia art antiques fairs dolphin promotions and others in summary the ronati ecommerce manager allows art and antiques dealers to harness technology to help them control and direct their business rather than have the technology in the driving seat holding the reins a brief video of how the product works can now be found online at ronati
shares of alibaba jd com and full truck alliance were all sliding this morning what happened shares of chinese tech stocks were falling for the third session in a row tuesday in the ongoing fallout from the chinese government s crackdown on the for profit education sector oddly chinese tutoring stocks like new oriental education group and tal education group that had seen nearly all of their value wiped out over the last two days were gaining today as some investors saw the sell off as a buying opportunity however big tech stocks like alibaba group holding baba 2 19 jd com jd 0 11 and full truck alliance ymm 1 42 were still down today as fear of spreading restrictions on big businesses in china continued to motivate investors to sell after falling sharply in the morning these stock recovered some of their losses later in the session alibaba finished down 3 jd was off 2 and full truck alliance had fallen 12 8 at the same the ishares msci china etf was down 4 the third straight session it s fallen 3 or more so what in addition to the broader concerns on the chinese regulatory front both alibaba and jd com were downgraded by dz bank to sell this morning likely in response to the regulatory pressure on chinese stocks prior to the crackdown on the for profit education sector which includes a restriction on raising new capital and teaching on weekends and holidays chinese authorities had told ridesharing giant didi global earlier this month to remove its app from major chinese app stores and earlier this year alibaba was fined 2 8 billion as the result of an anti monopoly investigation into the e commerce giant last year concerns about chinese government intervention rose when authorities blocked the ipo of ant group the financial arm of alibaba seemingly in response to disrespectful comments alibaba founder jack ma made about financial officials at a conference in total those events have led to an atmosphere of distrust among investors who believe that the chinese crackdown could go even further or that it could render the american depositary shares worthless though that seems unlikely even in the swirl of negativity on these stocks at least one analyst said the sell off was a buying opportunity mizuho said the crackdown on the education sector wouldn t spread to other industries as analyst james lee saw it as an exception rather than a harbinger of more regulations to come he also said that the growth in chinese internet stocks remains intact another factor hitting these stocks is that big investors are rotating out of china on the news investors outside of china were net sellers of chinese stocks by about 2 billion on monday according to bloomberg just yesterday cathie wood s ark invest sold about 20 million worth of jd com and alibaba now what investors who have avoided china because of the risk of its unpredictable government likely feel vindicated after the last few days but that doesn t mean that these stocks won t bounce back the underlying businesses still remain among the strongest in the world alibaba is the world s biggest e commerce platform with more than 1 trillion in gross merchandise volume and jd com is china s biggest direct online seller and has built a logistics network that rivals amazon s recent ipo full truck alliance a digital freight platform saw sales double in its most recent quarter we ll get another update from these companies in the coming weeks when they report second quarter earnings but even a strong round of results won t necessarily lift the regulatory cloud now hanging over these stocks

santa clarita calif july 27 2021 prnewswire princess cruises made history when the cruise line introduced its revolutionary shore power program and began operations in partnership with the city and borough of juneau and alaska electric light and power company in the summer of 2001 now 20 years later when princess cruises vessels arrive at the franklin dock ships continue to plug in to local surplus hydroelectric power and turn off the diesel engines reducing the impact of visible air emissions and the cruise line s carbon footprint in an effort applauded by local government officials and the residents of the capital city princess cruises shore power event speakers and attendees take photo in front of majestic princess on franklin street dock sea walk in juneau the 20th anniversary milestone was recognized as majestic princess made her maiden call to the port of juneau and commissioned to connect to the juneau electrical grid princess cruises president jan swartz majestic princess captain dino sagani alaska electric light and power company president and general manager connie hulbert and juneau mayor beth weldon and city manager rorie watt were in attendance shore power in juneau has been a significant win win situation not only for princess but also for the customers of alaska electric light and power company and the residents of the city and borough of juneau who have been incredible partners over the last 20 years said jan swartz princess cruises president our beneficial collaboration has paved the way for the cruise industry to reduce air emissions and allow cruise ships to plug in in addition to this investment for the past 20 years every dollar spent by princess for purchasing electrical energy in juneau has been credited to a cost of power adjustment or copa account this credit is used to offset any diesel expenses in the next quarter and any extra funds go back to residents and businesses in juneau in the form of a rebate on electric bills to date this has benefitted the juneau community by 8 5 million dollars the implementation of shore power in juneau 20 years ago was a truly remarkable accomplishment and this first of its kind program became a reality in our capital city through our partnership with princess said connie hulbert alaska electric light and power company president and general manager we are proud that our remote city with our own isolated electric grid is the first place in the world to use this innovative technology for passenger vessels which has provided economic and environmental benefits to the community of juneau shore power also known as cold ironing enables ships to connect to local electric power and turn off their diesel engines the specialized shore side equipment includes a specially designed transformer and a sophisticated system of cables circuit breakers and control circuits shore based electricity then runs all onboard services during the day long calls to create this unusual power system princess has outfitted all 14 of its ships with custom built hardware and automation that automatically connects the ship s electrical network to the local electrical network ashore the electrical power is transmitted from the transformer ashore to the vessel via multiple 3 ½ inch diameter flexible electrical cables on the dock in juneau the cables hang festooning style on a special gantry system designed to accommodate the 25 foot rise and fall of the tide and withstand the 100 mph juneau winds during the winter the actual cable connection on the vessel is a traditional though quite large plug and socket the shore power hookup is the result of a multi million dollar investment to build a sophisticated power distribution system designed to help clear the air of accumulated haze in the port area since 2001 princess has invested more than 15 million in equipment alone to enable its vessels to connect to shore power each year princess ships plug in more than 300 shore power connections this ground breaking technology has now grown and is used by various cruise lines in port cities including seattle 2005 vancouver 2009 san diego 2010 san francisco 2010 los angeles 2011 new york 2012 and halifax 2014 as well as internationally in shanghai and kristiansand norway with more and more port cities becoming shore power enabled the length of time needed to connect a

santa clarita calif july 27 2021 prnewswire princess cruises made history when the cruise line introduced its revolutionary shore power program and began operations in partnership with the city and borough of juneau and alaska electric light and power company in the summer of 2001 now 20 years later when princess cruises vessels arrive at the franklin dock ships continue to plug in to local surplus hydroelectric power and turn off the diesel engines reducing the impact of visible air emissions and the cruise line s carbon footprint in an effort applauded by local government officials and the residents of the capital city princess cruises shore power event speakers and attendees take photo in front of majestic princess on franklin street dock sea walk in juneau the 20th anniversary milestone was recognized as majestic princess made her maiden call to the port of juneau and commissioned to connect to the juneau electrical grid princess cruises president jan swartz majestic princess captain dino sagani alaska electric light and power company president and general manager connie hulbert and juneau mayor beth weldon and city manager rorie watt were in attendance shore power in juneau has been a significant win win situation not only for princess but also for the customers of alaska electric light and power company and the residents of the city and borough of juneau who have been incredible partners over the last 20 years said jan swartz princess cruises president our beneficial collaboration has paved the way for the cruise industry to reduce air emissions and allow cruise ships to plug in in addition to this investment for the past 20 years every dollar spent by princess for purchasing electrical energy in juneau has been credited to a cost of power adjustment or copa account this credit is used to offset any diesel expenses in the next quarter and any extra funds go back to residents and businesses in juneau in the form of a rebate on electric bills to date this has benefitted the juneau community by 8 5 million dollars the implementation of shore power in juneau 20 years ago was a truly remarkable accomplishment and this first of its kind program became a reality in our capital city through our partnership with princess said connie hulbert alaska electric light and power company president and general manager we are proud that our remote city with our own isolated electric grid is the first place in the world to use this innovative technology for passenger vessels which has provided economic and environmental benefits to the community of juneau shore power also known as cold ironing enables ships to connect to local electric power and turn off their diesel engines the specialized shore side equipment includes a specially designed transformer and a sophisticated system of cables circuit breakers and control circuits shore based electricity then runs all onboard services during the day long calls to create this unusual power system princess has outfitted all 14 of its ships with custom built hardware and automation that automatically connects the ship s electrical network to the local electrical network ashore the electrical power is transmitted from the transformer ashore to the vessel via multiple 3 ½ inch diameter flexible electrical cables on the dock in juneau the cables hang festooning style on a special gantry system designed to accommodate the 25 foot rise and fall of the tide and withstand the 100 mph juneau winds during the winter the actual cable connection on the vessel is a traditional though quite large plug and socket the shore power hookup is the result of a multi million dollar investment to build a sophisticated power distribution system designed to help clear the air of accumulated haze in the port area since 2001 princess has invested more than 15 million in equipment alone to enable its vessels to connect to shore power each year princess ships plug in more than 300 shore power connections this ground breaking technology has now grown and is used by various cruise lines in port cities including seattle 2005 vancouver 2009 san diego 2010 san francisco 2010 los angeles 2011 new york 2012 and halifax 2014 as well as internationally in shanghai and kristiansand norway with more and more port cities becoming shore power enabled the length of time needed to connect a ship to shore power and shut down the vessel s diesel generator is approximately 40 minutes after the ship has been secured at the dock once connected the ship s engines are powered down and the ships

dear britney you may have felt alone in your fight for freedom from the abusive conservatorship you have been trapped in after all until recently you waged your legal battle in isolation deprived of trusted legal counsel controlled by those with a financial interest in the continuance of your conservatorship threatened with loss of access to your children and loved ones if you step out of line as organizers of the freebritney movement we are writing this open letter to let you know that you are not alone in your suffering or in your quest for freedom you have a fierce movement behind you and by fighting for yourself you are exposing the plight of thousands of others mainly women who are trapped in abusive guardianships with seemingly no escape the freebritney movement started as a small group of fans who united on social media over concerns about your safety after witnessing what we are convinced is the human trafficking of you in plain sight we too have withstood the gaslighting cast by your conservators as a group of crazy fans with outlandish claims like you we have been growing in strength and impatience for your freedom over the last year unwilling to back down in the face of clear human right abuses against you we have become a powerful global and savvy force of volunteers we teamed with legal experts on guardianship fraud to better understand what has been happening to you and the ways in which you and others can be freed from what we now know is an increasingly more common form of human trafficking in your last two court appearances you detailed the abuses of your conservators and admitted fearing for your life according to the guardianship reform experts who listened to your testimony how you have been treated is consistent with the methodology used by those committing guardianship fraud isolate intimidate overmedicate drain the estate when there s nothing left of an estate for the predatory guardians to steal or accusations of guardianship abuse arise the ward typically an elderly woman is often moved to the final phase of the fraud cremate like many people abducted through guardianship you were not even aware of let alone present at the initial court proceeding that stripped you of all of your civil and human rights when full control of your life was assigned to your father you were never given the chance to defend yourself your conservators threaten access to your children and loved ones if you do not comply with their demands including being overmedicated these are common techniques used by predatory guardians to subdue their victims when loved ones try to fight for the victim they are also intimidated served with restraining orders and lawsuits indeed several freebritney organizers received cease and desist orders to silence them predatory guardians typically plunder the victim s estate use it to fight off any challenges by the victim and to silence those who attempt to fight to free the ward often family members and loved ones risk severe legal costs in order to save the trapped victim yet the predatory guardian doesn t spend a dime of their own money the victim s estate is used against the victim to maintain the conservatorship it s a technique you are painfully aware of in your court testimony you explained that you did not feel heard in previous appearances before the court which is another common experience of those trapped in an abusive conservatorship court appointed attorneys can have as much financial interest in the continuance of the conservatorship as the conservators and as a result often dismiss the concerns of their own client that you were unaware you could even contest the conservatorship suggests you have not been represented properly the freebritney movement has united with the guardianship reform movement to prevent predatory guardianships and to free those now in them your request to choose your own attorney was granted by the court all wards in conservatorship deserve that right too our first step together is supporting california senate bill 724 which would grant all wards in a conservatorship in california the right to choose their own attorney you rightfully said in court that the laws must change working with securewomen org we are calling for guardianship fraud prevention efforts to be implemented nationwide immediately including requiring a second opinion for a capacity determination mandatory 30 day notification of next of kin when a petition for guardianship is filed the limiting of the number of wards a guardian can have the rotation of probate court judges and the restriction on guardians using victim s assets to cover legal costs when the conservatorship is contested by the ward britney we are working tirelessly toward the day in which you choose how you live when you work who you hire whether you have more children and have the ability to go for a drive with your future husband whenever you two please we envision the day you no longer have to plead for basic human rights from strangers and instead you can join us in leading the movement you inspired john fernandes is a freebritney advocate at touchofroseproject thanks to american forum for sharing this article
in the push toward carbon free energy production some cities in utah and nearby states are considering a new type of nuclear reactor to power their future the project partially funded by the u s department of energy aims to bring six small modular nuclear reactors smrs online by 2029 including for customers of utah associated municipal power systems however watchdog groups warn the new generation reactors are untested and could have high financial and environmental costs scott williams executive director of the healthy environmental alliance of utah said the new system comes with the same old problems we ve been opposed to this project from the beginning because there s no solution for the high level waste that it generates williams explained we re still accumulating that all over the country and we ve never figured out what to do with that and it s highly highly toxic williams pointed out a number of power utilities have backed out of various projects using smrs and the utah utility recently cut its commitment from 12 to 6 power units he noted the main selling point has been the units do not emit greenhouse gases williams observed the financial markets have mostly shied away from backing the project which means small municipalities in utah idaho and other western states could be left holding the bag when there s experimental technology that venture capitalists won t put money into we should be really cautious about having small towns put money at risk for a first of its kind technology williams contended and when it comes to providing carbon free energy williams argued there are proven cost effective technologies available right now there s no way this stuff is going to be online soon enough to start dealing with what we need to do to address climate change williams asserted it s diverting resources into speculative technology when we have real technology that we should be ramping up quickly the smrs design has been approved by the u s nuclear regulatory commission but it will likely be a decade or more before the system is fully licensed and operational
