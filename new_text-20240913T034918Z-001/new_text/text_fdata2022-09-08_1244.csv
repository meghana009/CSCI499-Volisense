3 or 4 traes the combination therapy was found to be safe and tolerable with a similar safety profile to that of pembrolizumab monotherapy there is an urgent need for better therapies for patients

vienna iran s stock of uranium enriched to up to 60 close to weapons grade has grown to enough if enriched further for a nuclear bomb a report by the united nations nuclear watchdog showed on wednesday passing that threshold is a milestone in the unravelling of the 2015 nuclear deal between iran and world powers which capped the purity to which iran was allowed to enrich uranium at 3 67 well below the 20 it achieved before the deal and the roughly 90 that is weapons grade washington s withdrawal from the deal under then president donald trump and its reimposition of sanctions against tehran that had been lifted under the deal prompted tehran to breach the deal s nuclear restrictions iran now can produce 25 kg of uranium at 90 if they want to a senior diplomat said in response to wednesday s international atomic energy agency report seen by reuters when asked if iran had enough material enriched to 60 for one bomb the report said iran s stock of uranium enriched to 60 and in the form of uranium hexafluoride the gas that centrifuges enrich was estimated to be 55 6 kg an increase of 12 5 kg from the previous quarterly report it would take iran roughly three to four weeks to produce enough material for a bomb if it wanted to the diplomat said adding that it would take the iaea two to three days to detect a move in that direction iran denies intending to indirect talks between iran and the united states have made only stuttering progress towards reviving the deal which would take the many advanced centrifuges iran is now using offline since the deal only allowed it to enrich with first generation ir 1 centrifuges a revived deal would also slash its stock of uranium enriched to various levels currently roughly four tonnes back to within the deal s cap of 202 8 kg no progress one stumbling block in those talks however has been iran s continued failure to explain the origin of uranium particles found at three undeclared sites iran has been calling at the talks for the iaea s years long investigation into the issue to be scrapped western powers and the iaea however say iran has a duty to clear up the issue as a signatory of the nuclear non proliferation treaty and the issue has nothing to do with the 2015 deal the director general is increasingly concerned that iran has not engaged with the agency on the outstanding safeguards issues during this reporting period and therefore that there has been no progress towards resolving them a second iaea report also issued on wednesday and seen by reuters said us intelligence agencies and the iaea believe iran had a secret coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003 iran however insists it never had such a programme most of the sites are thought to date back to around 2003 or earlier __tribune com
in the press finding the top financial advisor in the united states means choosing between thousands of options whether you re looking for help with retirement wealth management or tax planning the u s is home to thousands of advisors that can meet your specific needs based on the methodology outlined below smartasset identified these financial advisor firms as among the top 5 financial advisor firms in the u s rank financial advisor assets managed 1 714 587 898 072 2 173 418 270 044 3 46 803 858 104 4 94 617 046 882 5 19 851 537 239 methodology to find the top financial advisors in the u s we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business relationship with smartasset in which smartasset is compensated for lead referrals such relationships have no impact on our rankings and firms are included and ranked based strictly on the above criteria smartasset is not a client of the aforementioned firms smartasset did not receive compensation for including any of the firms on the aforementioned list why work with an advisor we believe it s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please carefully review the methodologies employed in the vanguard whitepaper to receive a copy of the whitepaper please contact compliance smartasset com the value of professional investment advice is only

television production at the annual emmy awards the 2022 emmys will be awarded on september 12 this year series like succession the white lotus and ted lasso are among the primetime drama and comedy series with the most award nominations and poised for big nights at the emmy ceremony the emmys and their film oriented awards counterpart the oscars today have more content than ever to assess when identifying excellence in the field with major investments over the last decade from streaming giants like netflix amazon hulu and apple in addition to more traditional production and distribution companies tv and film creators have abundant opportunities to showcase their talent these creators include the actors and actresses who power tv and film productions advertisement article continues below this ad the emmys and oscars tend to focus on productions from the u s and as such performers from the u s have won a significant majority of acting awards over time more than four in five oscar and primetime emmy acting awards 81 7 have been won by actors and actresses from the u s compared to around one in five 18 3 for international performers in recent years however international actors and actresses have increased their share of awards 59 of the 154 emmys and oscars awarded to international performers have been earned since 2000 domestically new york and california are the leading states for the entertainment industry in the u s so it is unsurprising that the two states together account for more than one third of oscar and emmy acting awards new york s dominance in television is especially notable the state s actors and actresses have earned a total of 137 emmys more than double the 56 earned by second place california new york and california also far surpass other states

we first identified all firms registered with the sec in the country next we filtered out firms that don t offer financial planning services those that don t primarily serve individual clients and those that have disclosures on their record the qualifying firms were then ranked according to the following criteria aum firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher firms with more total assets under management are ranked higher individual client count firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher firms that serve more individual clients as opposed to institutional clients are ranked higher clients per advisor firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher firms with a lower ratio of clients per financial advisor are ranked higher years in business firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher firms that have been in business longer are ranked higher fee structure firms with a fee only as opposed to fee based compensation structure are ranked higher these stats are updated annually and accurate as of may 25 2023 this list may include firms that have a business

s more important now than ever to review your retirement plan with a fiduciary financial advisor here s why the pandemic has shown us just how quickly decades of planning investing and saving can be completely upended this could mean your current financial plan might leave you without enough money to last your retirement additionally emotionally charged decisions to sell off large quantities of stocks or other investments now lock in your losses removing any chance for future growth research suggests people who work with a financial advisor feel more at ease about their finances and could end up with about 15 more money to spend in retirement 1 consider this example a recent vanguard study found that on average a hypothetical 500k investment would grow to over 3 4 million under the care of an advisor over 25 years whereas the expected value from self management would be 1 69 million or 50 less in other words an advisor managed portfolio would average 8 annualized growth over a 25 year period compared to 5 from a self managed portfolio 2 a 2020 northwestern mutual study found that 71 of u s adults admit their financial planning needs improvement however only 29 of americans work with a financial advisor 3 assuming 5 annualized growth of 500k portfolio vs 8 annualized growth of advisor managed portfolio over 25 years the hypothetical study discussed above assumes a 5 net return and a 3 net annual value add for professional financial advice to performance based on the vanguard whitepaper putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha please

materially readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any such forward looking statements which speak only as of the date made forward looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management s current expectations and plans relating to the future readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes we do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based except as required by law reconciliation of non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues we prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial information used to evaluate our performance in this and other earnings releases and investor conference calls as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap we believe that current shareholders and potential investors in our company use non gaap financial measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues in making investment decisions about our company and measuring our operational results the term adjusted ebitda refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings before certain charges that management considers to be non operating expenses and which consist of interest taxes depreciation amortization stock based compensation for which we include related fees and taxes and other charges for which we include restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues divides adjusted ebitda for a period by the revenues for the corresponding period and expresses the quotient as a percentage management considers these non operating expenses to be outside the scope of descartes ongoing operations and the related expenses are not used by management to measure operations accordingly these expenses are excluded from adjusted ebitda which we reference to both measure our operations and as a basis of comparison of our operations from period to period management believes that investors and financial analysts measure our business on the same basis and we are providing the adjusted ebitda financial metric to assist in this evaluation and to provide a higher level of transparency into how we measure our own business however adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues are non gaap financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap or other non gaap measures that may be used by other companies such as ebitda the use of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues does have limitations in particular we have completed six acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal 2022 and may complete additional acquisitions in the future that will result in acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges as these acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges may continue as we pursue our consolidation strategy some investors may consider these charges and expenses as a recurring part of operations rather than expenses that are not part of operations the

todd rosenbluth head of research at vettafi appeared on etf edge to discuss esg investing along with dws s arne noack s p global s mona naqvi and host bob pisani esg has become a hot button issue amid news that both florida and texas moved to block state fund managers from using esg considerations in their investment decisions blackrock and other firms have come under fire from some corners simply for having esg funds with the argument being that esg funds boycott energy stocks fresh off a new piece about esg rosenbluth was asked about these attacks this is just ludicrous rosenbluth said what you have is broadly diversified strategies that are giving you the best according to not just climate change but also related to fair pay practices gender diversity and a whole host of other factors host bob pisani noted that some of the largest esg funds including those from blackrock are overweighted in terms of energy compared to the s p ishares esg aware msci usa etf esgu has 4 8 of its holdings in energy while ishares msci usa esg select etf susa has 3 8 the argument falls down once you dive into it rosenbluth said noting that esg funds often get criticized from multiple sides with some saying they don t have enough energy and others saying that any energy at all goes against esg principle these are intended to be broadly diversified products the esg industry has 186 funds only 6 of the etf universe with just 1 5 of its asset base many folks disagree about the extent to which esg influences investing in part because there is no standardized definition esg is a broad concept that can be many different things to many investors we wouldn t be sitting here asking why don t all growth funds look the same why should esg be any different naqvi pointed out pointing to the xtrackers s p 500 esg etf snpe and the global x s p 500 catholic values custom etf cath rosenbluth noted that these dramatically different funds both exist under the esg umbrella he remarked it is really important that investors understand what they are getting and that they are not boycotting esg in general they are choosing the fund that fits their objective and ignoring everything else naqvi noted that the dollars in these funds remain solid despite the noise from political actors in states like texas and florida and controversies around greenwashing greenwashing where funds appear greener than they are is just as hard to define and pin down as esg itself after all is an energy company working toward sustainability esg is tesla esg or not many investors draw the line in different places sec chair gary gensler has asked for more clarity around fund names regarding esg claims rosenbluth said i think it s a good thing to ask the question and have asset managers have to answer what is their criteria and be as transparent as possible pivoting to profit vs purpose pisani wondered if esg investing comes from a different mindset than milton friedman s profit above all else positioning rosenbluth sees these two positions as not in direct conflict many of the factors that are part of esg have an intermediate or long term impact rosenbluth noted research has indicated that more diverse companies tend to be more profitable while companies that have been sued for bad practices are at greater risk of losing profits people are looking at more than how profitable a company is rosenbluth also sees the profit above all else as a limited perspective given that investors use all sorts of metrics beyond profitability such as valuations rosenbluth noted you don t see anyone boycotting the nasdaq 100 for more news information and strategy visit vettafi

go to shell fury in maine as woke seafood watch program redlists state s famous lobsters and warns against eating them because lobster pots put whales in danger monterey bay aquarium s seafood watch rated maine lobsters unsustainable due to their reported impact on right whales in july a federal judge ruled that federal regulators allowed lobstermen to fish with trap lines that can entangle the cetaceans there are 350 right whales left in existence less than 100 are breeding females noaa fisheries reported that only 9 of 34 right whale deaths have been caused by fishing line mainers and lobstermen were outraged by the seafood watch designation calling it uninformed they say that they have used a breakaway line that will prevent whale entanglements mainers are up in arms over seafood watch a woke environmental program warning diners off lobster because they claim the fishing pots can harm or kill endangered right whales california s monterey bay aquarium which runs the program issued its latest edicts over what to eat on tuesday ruling that american lobster should be avoided because the lines from the traps used to catch them could entangle the dwindling population of right whales causing injury or death seafood watch recommends to avoid american lobster caught by trap from the southern new england stock due to population depletion risks to the critically endangered north atlantic right whale and insufficient measures for reducing these risks according to the september 6 report there are only 350 right whales remaining according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration and less than 100 breeding females of the species seafood watch the issued their latest edicts over what to eat on tuesday ruling that american lobster should be avoided because the lines from the traps used to catch them could entangle the dwindling population of right whales the lobster industry contributes about a 1 billion to the maine economy and supports more than 5 500 workers according to a 2017 colby college study in 2016 130 million pounds of the crustacean was harvested for an estimated retail value of more than 547 million since 2017 noaa fisheries has reported that there have been 9 deaths and 20 serious injuries recorded due to entanglements most whale deaths over the last five years were due to unknown causes or ship strikes seafood watch which has been grading the sustainability of seafood for the past six years aims to prevent overfishing extinction and other negative impacts on the ocean they tend to recommend diners eat farmed seafood and avoid fish caught wild the designation met with immediate backlash from maine public officials and industry groups today s decision by seafood watch to red list maine lobster is simply absurd and flies in the face of common sense the maine lobster industry one of our state s most important economic drivers and a source of pride has long been committed to environmentally conscious sustainable fishing maine state senator angus king an independent said tuesday make no mistake this decision will have a real world impact with the industry already facing challenges the accusations of the designation will hurt thousands of families and businesses across our state i hope the millions around the world who enjoy the delicious crustacean will see through this farce continue to support the iconic industry and join me in pushing for seafood watch to reverse this irresponsible decision and take lobster off the so called red list in july a washington d c judge ruled that federal regulators had failed to do enough to help the endangered mammal saying that the greatest human caused threat come from entanglement in fishing gear but the maine lobster industry hit back saying the judge and seafood watch is out of touch with the updates they ve made to trapping lobster the assessment uses old data fails to account for the many steps lobstermen have taken to protect whales and gets several basic facts wrong the group said in its response to the designation 80 of rope recovered from right whales between 2010 and 2018 is not consistent with the rope most typically used in the maine lobster fishery greater than 1 2 rope recovered from right whales the fishery uses smaller than 1 2 the group said the lobster industry says its also phased out floating rope that could entangle the leviathans and implemented breakaway lines called weak links that will further prevent injury new england filmmaker jason mann pointed out that the shipping industry poses a far greater risk to the whales until they start blacklisting the cargo ships and the tankers that actually hit whales it seems like bs to me he posted on twitter fisherman steve train also urged the aquarium s program to check its facts lobster is one of the best managed and most sustainable fisheries in the country he said on twitter there has never been a fatality to right whales attributed to the maine lobster fishery this is an overreaction and a publicity move by an ngo that could hurt harvesters and do nothing for whales whole foods and red lobster use the red listing when deciding what seafood to sell according to wmtw news there are certainly industrial buyers for restaurants and retail that follow these lists and i don t think they understand that we re being mislabeled train told the station we are sustainable the lobster industry contributes about 1 billion to the maine economy and supports more than 5 500 workers according to a 2017 colby college study in 2016 130 million pounds of the crustacean were harvested for an estimated retail value of more than 547 million advertisement it isn t well researched fred terry co owner of the lobster roll in southampton ny there isn t a lobster trap in maine that a right whale couldn t break the line of and go right through
the china securities regulatory commission announced on august 26 that it together with the ministry of finance had signed an audit oversight cooperation agreement with the u s public company accounting oversight board pcaob and will implement the agreement in the near future this big step of bilateral auditing inspection cooperation will help ease auditing triggered delisting risks facing chinese companies listed on u s stock exchanges and stabilize market sentiment this agreement is mainly composed of three parts first the principle of reciprocity that is equally binding on both sides both the u s and china may conduct inspections and investigations of relevant offices within the jurisdiction of the other party in accordance with their statutory duties and in accordance with the cooperation agreement the requested party shall endeavor to provide full assistance second the scope of the cooperation is explicitly defined it includes assisting with the inspections and investigations of relevant audit firms taken by the authorities among them the assistance provided by the chinese side also involves some firms based in hong kong special administrative region that provide audit services for stocks and whose audit transcripts are kept in the chinese mainland third the agreement has made clear arrangements on the treatment and use of possibly sensitive information during audit oversight cooperation audit papers that the u s regulator needs access to will be obtained by and transferred through the chinese side based on coordination in advance so far more than 280 chinese companies have been listed on u s stock markets and over 30 accounting firms inside china have registered with the pcaob offering audit services to these u s listed companies auditing inspection over these companies is the major issue that hindered cooperation between the two countries capital markets in 2020 the u s house of representatives passed the holding foreign companies accountable act hfcaa which requires foreign issuers and their accounting firms to release their audit papers for inspection to the u s securities and exchange commission proving they are not under any foreign government ownership or control so far 161 chinese stocks listed in the u s had been put on the provisional list foreign companies risk getting delisted if they fail to submit their audit papers to a u s accounting oversight body for three consecutive years chinese companies on the provisional list account for more than 60 percent of all chinese companies listed on u s exchanges by doing so the u s aims to contain china s economic growth but it is violating principles of the u s capital market as chinese companies managed to get listed on american exchanges by conforming to all the rules and regulations of the u s capital market it s unfair to hobble them by releasing the hfcaa and other barriers after they have been listed it s also decreasing the credibility of the u s free market if these chinese companies have to delist they the u s stock market and investors will all suffer losses neither china nor the u s would be happy to find themselves embroiled in this kind of fiasco listed companies and the world at large hope to see the two sides achieve workable outcomes so that the legitimate rights of investors around the world are protected the talks slipped into a deadlock because the u s side demanded the disclosure of a large number of audit papers of u s listed chinese companies that contain classified information related to china s business environment and even national security the agreement brings a fair deal for both sides with no requirement for chinese companies to provide audit papers related to china s national economic security the signing of this agreement may well end the delisting crisis facing u s listed chinese companies auditing inspection cooperation remains the main trend this agreement is set to lay the groundwork for further cooperation in this regard it also reveals the truth that only cooperation can bring win win results copyedited by g p wilson

had gone to the residence to collect them adding he did not break into the home as the claimant had said but said he was invited in the suspect also told officers that earlier that day the occupant was supposedly robbed the suspect was concerned for the safety of the litter and the complainant had too many problems and was unable to care for the animals the report states brambila also denied stealing the puppies as the reporting party had claimed and initially told officers he could return the puppies to the occupant he also claimed it was another individual who had stolen the puppies the suspect also said it was while he was collecting the puppies he alleged it was the caller who attacked him punching him in the face he said as the altercation was taking place the suspect told officers two other men grabbed the kennel of puppies and fled from the residence the officer also noted the suspect continued stating that he had shown up to take his dogs the 911 caller was interviewed separately and reportedly told police that prior to the incident one of his friends was due to arrive so the two could hang out at the house but when the friend arrived he said brambila and another man came barging through the door once inside the complainant said brambila started to remove the kennel that contained the seven puppies the caller added he yelled at the suspect to stop but brambila was undeterred and a tussle ensued the suspect reportedly assaulted the caller and continuously punched him with a closed fist according to the report the reporting party also said as he was trying to ward off the assault another man entered the kitchen grabbed a knife and told the caller he was going to kill him investigators noted in the report as the assault continued the caller alleged the other man dropped the knife and ran from the residence carrying the kennel with the seven puppies the caller also told the suspects he was going to call police if they did not leave he said which is when the suspect reportedly told him if he did call then they would come back for the reporting party s son the resident also denied that attacked the suspect adding the injuries to brambila resulted from the suspect jumping the fence as he fled officers also learned the value of each of the puppies was 4 000 5 000 a piece making the total loss as high as 35 000 at the scene officers also learned the crate of puppies had been abandoned a short distance from the residence but when officers combed the area they were unable to locate both the puppies and the second suspect less than two hours after the initial call to police the victim called 911 reporting he had located the crate of puppies and that one of the puppies was dying extensive criminal history involving violent acts the arresting officer requested that brambila be held without bail citing the suspect has an extensive criminal history involving violent acts in addition to the threats officers allege he made to the reporting party in the case instead the suspect was held on 10 000 bail until his release the following day after posting a bond on tuesday formal charges were filed against the suspect the distressed puppy died shortly after being discovered in the crate according to a supplemental report that was confirmed with authorities no further information on the second suspect reportedly

by jim o neill china daily updated 2022 09 08 07 33 britain s newly appointed prime minister liz truss delivers a speech outside 10 downing street central london on sept 6 2022 we have a reasonably clear idea of what liz truss the new british prime minister would like to do but the real question is whether circumstances will allow her to pursue the path she appeared to make clear during the long campaign to become the next leader of the conservative party and the country truss played to the tory party membership emphatically during the campaign evoking memories of the margaret thatcher era when the former leader presided over a highly liberal economic agenda to supposedly unleash the private sector to drive a more prosperous britain given the never ending popularity of the thatcher legacy among the tory grassroots it was an effective strategy to get herself elected even if it meant ignoring many of the realities of the day truss desire appears to be for a traditional right of center cutting taxes both for income earners and businesses approach with reduced regulation to supposedly unleash the private sector to deliver stronger economic growth and to deliberately allow for yet another period an expansive fiscal policy to help achieve these goals it is conceptually quite ambitious but may run into considerable difficulties the most immediate difficulty is of course the huge rise in gas prices and the enormous pressure on the cost of living indeed in the final days of the campaign truss strongly indicated that she will introduce policies to help avert the worse of any future gas price increases with even talk of an across the board freeze for a year on the weekend she made it clear that she will announce her specific package on energy prices within a week if it were to involve a freeze this could cost the government as much as 100 billion 115 65 billion if implemented for a year threatening her other apparent commitments including some of her desired plans on taxes the fortnight before the end of the leadership race was interesting in view of the renewed focus on the us federal reserve s tightening policy financial markets are paying increasing attention to the inflation challenge again and have specifically singled out the united kingdom as looking a bit lax compared with both the united states and the eurozone as can be seen by the combined underperformance of the pound sterling and the uk gilt prices it will be fascinating to see if this continues into the early days of truss leadership as this itself could both add to the likelihood of more intense inflationary challenges and with it a more aggressive bank of england in terms of tightening monetary policy one would hope that truss advisers are aware of all of these risks so perhaps they may roll back some of their intended policies to allow for markets to digest the energy support package not least because if the talk of a price freeze is correct inflation could peak much earlier than many recent forecasts which could allow a different mood to appear both in the markets and media commentary in the uk this said truss appears to be quite committed to honouring the desires of traditional tory voters and this means at some stage she will have to deliver on them and given that a general election is legally required to be held in not much more than two years the fact that the party membership retains a huge affection for previous prime minister boris johnson and that tory mps did not really support her leadership bid truss has to tread a very fine line to remain a respected leader of the conservatives and the emboldened opposition labour party obviously won t make life easy for her there is a broader economic issue that will remain a big talking point beyond the immediate challenges not least because truss has frequently described the preferred economic policies of the past 20 years as failing to facilitate stronger economic growth including what she describes as policies based on redistribution this in my view is an even bigger risky strategy for her to pursue because it isn t really accurate the earlier conservative government she had been part of presided over a significant reduction in government spending and lower corporate taxes policies she claims to prefer and while under the 2015 government of david cameron the conservatives accelerated the earliest of policies focused on devolving policies around england it was modest and coincided with significant spending cuts for many local authorities and while johnson talked endlessly about levelling up his government didn t really commit vast redistributive resources to this endeavour at the same time because of his popularity he created a strong enough impression that it was serious that s how the tories won the last election and if there is now a leader opposed to the pursuit of these policies then he or she may not be in power beyond 2025 or even earlier at the end of the day the uk faces the same challenge as every other country as well as one related to its unique geographical productivity factor long term economic growth is driven by the number of people that work and their productivity the uk is already close to its lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years so unless it can significantly boost its woeful productivity it will not be able to generate sustained low inflation growth the productivity of london and the southeast is among the strongest in europe it is the rest of the country that does truly need levelling up in terms of productivity yet it seems unlikely that the new uk leader will reverse her stated priorities and truly deal with this aspect as for relations with china truss once a proud advocate of importing the best of chinese maths teaching standards is likely to support the growing popular voices of caution against all things chinese which when it comes back to economics is not likely to help her other economic ambitions the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily the author is a leading british economist and former commercial secretary to the uk treasury

wang yangyang for china daily fed rate hike and worsening geopolitics are making investors seek safe haven dollar denominated assets to strengthen regional currency cooperation the us dollar has been gaining strength relative to other major global currencies since the beginning of this year so far the us dollar index has grown more than 13 percent to hover around 109 the higher than expected interest rate hikes by the united states federal reserve is the major driver behind the strong dollar to rein in the runaway inflation the fed has increased the benchmark interest rates four times since march raising the rates radically by 225 basis points altogether the growing gaps between the interest rates of the united states and other countries have triggered massive capital flows from the rest of the world to the us the ukraine crisis is another key factor behind the surging dollar the worsening geopolitical instability has prompted international investors to seek shelter and boosted the demand for safe haven assets global capital has been fleeing europe and emerging economies and flocking to dollar denominated assets the turbulent global financial market aggravated by the us interest rate hikes and the ukraine crisis has pushed the dollar to its highest level in 20 years the strong dollar has exerted wide ranging impacts on the global economy which risks derailing the economic recovery of developing countries since 2021 developing countries in asia have embarked on paths of recovery thanks to the rebound in external demand as some countries have been actively approving new investment projects and some have rolled out development strategies to support infrastructure building investment and consumption in developing asia have also revived however as most asian developing economies are export oriented and heavily dependent on external demand a strong dollar may have significant influences on these countries first a strong us dollar could put pressure on those economies international trade it can drive up import prices leading to heavier cost burdens on enterprises that rely on imports moreover higher import costs may spell imported inflation dampening domestic demand in terms of exports a strong dollar may give developing countries price advantages in exports countering the negative effects it brings about however as the strong dollar is largely the outcome of the us tightened monetary policy it will inevitably be accompanied by weak us market demand which in turn will have a negative influence on the exports of developing countries second a strong dollar may disrupt the economic growth of developing countries through capital flows and financial markets the global capital flows to dollar denominated assets place huge pressures on the stock bond and foreign exchange markets of developing countries in the first quarter of this year foreign investors withdrew 31 9 billion from china s bond market and 6 8 billion from its stock market the largest capital outflow on record in india about 28 billion has been pulled out from the country s stock market in the first half of the year the largest among asia s emerging economies by mid june the bombay stock exchange sensitive index or bse sensex had lost more than 15 percent compared with last october however emerging economies in asia remain a favorite destination for global investors since mid august china s stock market has seen a net inflow of capital and the bse sensex has gained its lost ground and rebounded to the level at the end of last year third a strong dollar puts bigger pressures on the sovereign debts of emerging economies which however is not regarded as a major risk in asian countries where residents have high saving rates and thus rely less on external debts compared with latin american countries in a report released by the asean 3 macroeconomic and research office in april the realization of a sovereign debt crisis in asean 3 economies asean countries and china japan and the republic of korea is deemed merely a tail risk and the three major global rating agencies have barely changed the sovereign debt ratings of asian developing countries however the risk of a sovereign debt crisis remains serious for a few vulnerable economies such as sri lanka to alleviate the external pressure some countries have increased interest rates and tightened monetary policies which on the downside will hold back economic recovery higher interest rates dent people s willingness to seek loans which will hamper the recovery of domestic consumption meanwhile enterprises will face bigger risks of debt default and higher borrowing costs thus having weaker capacities to invest governments will also bear greater burdens to pay debts aggravating their fiscal vulnerabilities all the above mentioned factors will hinder the economic growth of developing countries in asia in addition to interest rate increases developing countries could consider utilizing other policy tools first is to strengthen regional currency cooperation asian countries could give full play to currency swap arrangements such as the chiang mai initiative and explore more bilateral and multilateral currency cooperation mechanisms to increase the resilience of asian economies to shocks in the foreign exchange markets second is to develop more capital regulation measures by introducing market based instruments such as tobin tax on financial transactions to deter speculative capital flows and stabilize foreign exchange markets third is to enhance fiscal support when countries tightened monetary policies to counter the effects of interest rate hikes by the fed fiscal measures can play a key role in mitigating the impacts a strong dollar has on vulnerable groups through transfer payments wang yangyang for china daily the author is an assistant research fellow at the institute of world economics and politics at the chinese academy of social

in the 1970s i met one of hitler s leading propagandists leni riefenstahl whose epic films glorified the nazis we happened to be staying at the same lodge in kenya where she was on a photography assignment having escaped the fate of other friends of the fuhrer she told me that the patriotic messages of her films were dependent not on orders from above but on what she called the submissive void of the german public by john pilger special to consortium news did that include the liberal educated bourgeoisie i asked yes especially them she said i think of this as i look around at the propaganda now consuming western societies of course we are very different from germany in the 1930s we live in information societies we are globalists we have never been more aware more in touch better connected or do we in the west live in a media society where brainwashing is insidious and relentless and perception is filtered according to the needs and lies of state and corporate power the united states dominates the western world s media all but one of the top 10 media companies are based in north america the internet and social media google twitter facebook are mostly american owned and controlled in my lifetime the united states has overthrown or attempted to overthrow more than 50 governments mostly democracies it has interfered in democratic elections in 30 countries it has dropped bombs on the people of 30 countries most of them poor and defenceless it has attempted to murder the leaders of 50 countries it has fought to suppress liberation movements in 20 countries the extent and scale of this carnage is largely unreported unrecognised and those responsible continue to dominate anglo american political life harold pinter broke the silence in the years before he died in 2008 the playwright harold pinter made two extraordinary speeches which broke a silence u s foreign policy he said is best defined as follows kiss my arse or i ll kick your head in it is as simple and as crude as that what is interesting about it is that it s so incredibly successful it possesses the structures of disinformation use of rhetoric distortion of language which are very persuasive but are actually a pack of lies it is very successful propaganda they have the money they have the technology they have all the means to get away with it and they do in accepting the nobel prize for literature pinter said this the crimes of the united states have been systematic constant vicious remorseless but very few people have actually talked about them you have to hand it to america it has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while masquerading as a force for universal good it s a brilliant even witty highly successful act of hypnosis pinter was a friend of mine and possibly the last great political sage that is before dissenting politics were gentrified i asked him if the hypnosis he referred to was the submissive void described by leni riefenstahl it s the same he replied it means the brainwashing is so thorough we are programmed to swallow a pack of lies if we don t recognise propaganda we may accept it as normal and believe it that s the submissive void in our systems of corporate democracy war is an economic necessity the perfect marriage of public subsidy and private profit socialism for the rich capitalism for the poor the day after 9 11 the stock prices of the war industry soared more bloodshed was coming which is great for business today the most profitable wars have their own brand they are called forever wars afghanistan palestine iraq libya yemen and now ukraine all are based on a pack of lies iraq is the most infamous with its weapons of mass destruction that didn t exist nato s destruction of libya in 2011 was justified by a massacre in benghazi that didn t happen afghanistan was a convenient revenge war for 9 11 which had nothing to do with the people of afghanistan today the news from afghanistan is how evil the taliban are not that u s president joe biden s theft of 7 billion of the country s bank reserves is causing widespread suffering recently national public radio in washington devoted two hours to afghanistan and 30 seconds to its starving people at its summit in madrid in june nato which is controlled by the united states adopted a strategy document that militarises the european continent and escalates the prospect of war with russia and china it proposes multi domain warfighting against nuclear armed peer competitor in other words nuclear war it says nato s enlargement has been an historic success i read that in disbelief the news from the war in ukraine is mostly not news but a one sided litany of jingoism distortion omission i have reported a number of wars and have never known such blanket propaganda in february russia invaded ukraine as a response to almost eight years of killing and criminal destruction in the russian speaking region of donbass on their border in 2014 the united states had sponsored a coup in kiev that got rid of ukraine s democratically elected russian friendly president and installed a successor whom the americans made clear was their man in recent years american defender missiles have been installed in eastern europe poland slovenia the czech republic almost certainly aimed at russia accompanied by false assurances all the way back to james baker s promise to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in february 1990 that nato would never expand beyond germany nato on hitler s borderline ukraine is the frontline nato has effectively reached the very borderland through which hitler s army stormed in 1941 leaving more than 23 million dead in the soviet union last december russia proposed a far reaching security plan for europe this was dismissed derided or suppressed in the western media who read its step by step proposals on feb 24 president volodymyr zelensky threatened to develop nuclear weapons unless america armed and protected ukraine on the same day russia invaded an unprovoked act of congenital infamy according to the western media the history the lies the peace proposals the solemn agreements on donbass at minsk counted for nothing on april 25 u s defense secretary lloyd austin flew into kiev and confirmed that america s aim was to destroy the russian federation the word he used was weaken america had got the war it wanted waged by an american bankrolled and armed proxy and expendable pawn almost none of this was explained to western audiences russia s invasion of ukraine is wanton and inexcusable it is a crime to invade a sovereign country there are no buts except one when did the present war in ukraine begin and who started it according to the united nations between 2014 and this year some 14 000 people have been killed in the kiev regime s civil war on the donbass many of the attacks were carried out by neo nazis watch an itv news report from may 2014 by the veteran reporter james mates who is shelled along with civilians in the city of mariupol by ukraine s azov neo nazi battalion in the same month dozens of russian speaking people were burned alive or suffocated in a trade union building in odessa besieged by fascist thugs the followers of the nazi collaborator and anti semitic fanatic stepan bandera the new york times called the thugs nationalists the historic mission of our nation in this critical moment said andreiy biletsky founder of the azov battaltion is to lead the white races of the world in a final crusade for their survival a crusade against the semite led untermenschen since february a campaign of self appointed news monitors mostly funded by the americans and british with links to governments have sought to maintain the absurdity that ukraine s neo nazis don t exist airbrushing once associated with stalin s purges has become a tool of mainstream journalism in less than a decade a good china has been airbrushed and a bad china has replaced it from the world s workshop to a budding new satan much of this propaganda originates in the u s and is transmitted through proxies and think tanks such as the notorious australian strategic policy institute the voice of the arms industry and by journalists such as peter hartcher of the sydney morning herald who has labeled those spreading chinese influence as rats flies mosquitoes and sparrows and suggested these pests be eradicated news about china in the west is almost entirely about the threat from beijing airbrushed are the 400 american military bases that surround most of china an armed necklace that reaches from australia to the pacific and south east asia japan and korea the japanese island of okinawa and the korean island of jeju are like loaded guns aimed point blank at the industrial heart of china a pentagon official described this as a noose palestine has been misreported for as long as i can remember to the bbc there is the conflict of two narratives the longest most brutal lawless military occupation in modern times is unmentionable the stricken people of yemen barely exist they are media unpeople while the saudis rain down their american cluster bombs with british advisers working alongside the saudi targeting officers more than half a million children face starvation this brainwashing by omission is not new the slaughter of the first world war was suppressed by reporters who were given knighthoods for their compliance in 1917 the editor of the manchester guardian c p scott confided to prime minister lloyd george if people really knew the war would be stopped tomorrow but they don t know and can t know the refusal to see people and events as those in other countries see them is a media virus in the west as debilitating as covid it is as if we see the world through a one way mirror in which we are moral and benign and they are not it is a profoundly imperial view the history that is a living presence in china and russia is rarely explained and rarely understood vladimir putin is adolf hitler xi jinping is fu man chu epic achievements such as the eradication of abject poverty in china are barely known how perverse and squalid this is when will we allow ourselves to understand training journalists factory style is not the answer neither is the wondrous digital tool which is a means not an end like the one finger typewriter

menafn jordan times cairo since the latin american debt crisis of the 1980s sovereign debt crises have become a regular occurrence for emerging and developing economies today sri lanka needs a bailout

to deficit finance their way out of the synchronised global downturn these countries now must contend with the economic fallout from the ukraine crisis which all but eliminates a near term return to pre pandemic growth rates with few exceptions sri lanka and zambia for example most developing economies are not heavily indebted collectively their average debt to gdp ratio has increased by just 7 percentage points to 65 per cent since the start of the pandemic much lower than the 20 percentage points increase in advanced economies where the combined sovereign debt now averages 122 per cent of gdp the flow of funds that developing economies receive from global bond markets and banks has remained dismally low according to the most recent estimates from the institute of international finance their combined sovereign liabilities represent less than 30 per cent of global public debt worse following post pandemic credit downgrades many low income countries cannot access international capital markets and now face acute liquidity constraints that could morph into solvency crises and because these countries sub investment grade credit ratings have raised their borrowing costs the fiscal impact of their sovereign liabilities has increased and their governments reduced ability to roll them over as they fall due has raised the specter of a developing country debt crisis ghana for example planned to issue a bond to refinance its foreign currency denominated debt earlier this year but with a wave of ratings downgrades driving up international bond yields ghana has effectively been shut out of international financial markets and its ten year sovereign bond yield has risen above 22 per cent after resorting to painful internal adjustments tax increases and cuts to discretionary spending during the pandemic ghana is now contending with soaring food prices and its government is seeking imf assistance two other factors are combining to increase the risk of a liquidity crisis in developing markets the currency of lending and the shift toward variable interest rates in a context of increasingly complex lending structures and growing reliance on international capital markets between 2000 and 2020 the number of low income countries with variable rate external debt rose sharply from 13 to 31 and now that systemically important central banks are normalising monetary policies to fight inflation these countries will incur significantly higher costs when servicing their external debts while reliance on foreign currency denominated debt can reduce the risk of runaway inflation it can also increase the risk of sovereign default especially when a sharp exchange rate depreciation suddenly raises the costs of servicing external debts this is especially the case during episodes of heightened global volatility and tightening financing conditions which are often associated with large scale capital outflows from emerging and developing economies historically sovereign defaults have been driven by markets unwillingness to roll over existing debt or to do so only at prohibitively high interest rates across emerging and developing economies over inflated risk premiums driven by distorted perceptions have amplified the fiscal impact of sovereign debt and been a major driver of liquidity crises and default risk advanced economies with the exorbitant privilege to issue reserve currencies usually do not face such risks because their currencies are regarded as safe havens they can sustainably attract foreign investment in government treasuries and bonds continuously roll over their debts at low costs and run deficits without tears consider the european central bank which recently adopted exceptional measures to reassure investors and stem bond market volatility in response to renewed concerns about fragmentation risks within the eurozone under the anti fragmentation instrument it adopted in march the ecb now reserves the right to deviate in the future from credit rating agencies ratings if warranted in line with its discretion under the monetary policy framework the short term impact of this move has been remarkable with yields on the bonds of weaker eurozone members falling sharply immediately thereafter but systemically important central banks should be no less concerned about the disproportionately large spreads between advanced and developing economies what we might call global fragmentation risk the tightening of financing conditions by the us federal reserve fed and other major central banks has exacerbated developing economies macroeconomic management challenges by heightening exchange rate volatility increasing liquidity risks and widening spreads in the past systemically important central banks have successfully extended some of the benefits conferred by their exorbitant privilege to other countries at the height of the pandemic downturn for example the fed reinforced its currency swap arrangements first introduced during the 2008 financial crisis and broadened the geographical coverage of its support to include a few emerging economies that move led to currency appreciation improved credit default swap spreads and lower long term interest rates in beneficiary countries and beyond alleviating liquidity risks the extension of dollar denominated swap lines reassured investors thus stemming capital outflows and enhancing those countries ability to roll over their debts even though low income countries do not pose a systemic risk to the international financial system a concerted effort to mitigate liquidity risks should be a high global priority not least because debt restructuring has huge costs according to the world bank it leads to lower output growth in the short term for countries that lack the protection of systemically important central banks default driven borrowing rates undermine macroeconomic stability and reduce the supply of patient capital over the medium and long term without which developing economies cannot undergo the transformation needed to break the negative correlation between growth and commodity price cycles in the long term the most sustainable solution to recurrent liquidity crises is to develop deep efficient well regulated domestic capital markets in emerging and developing economies under an integrated financial market framework a vibrant repo market will enhance the money and bond market nexus enabling liquid capital markets to emerge taken together these highly integrated markets will help build proper yield curves to improve investment decisions the world already has effective well tested tools to prevent recurring liquidity crises which is a prerequisite for building these integrated markets democratising the global financial system to maximise its positive impact on development is perhaps the most important challenge on the road to international debt sustainability hippolyte

klmax istock via getty images a quick take on mawson infrastructure group mawson infrastructure group nasdaq migi reported its q2 2022 financial results on august 22 2022 increasing its bitcoin self mining footprint the company provides a range of data center services and mines bitcoin for its own account while migi is not a low risk stock since iâ m bullish over the longer term on the price of bitcoin and intrigued by its hosting colocation growth opportunity iâ m putting migi on a watch list for further consideration for now my outlook is a hold for migi mawson infrastructure overview north sydney australia based mawson infrastructure was founded to develop a range of crypto mining services in australia and north america the firm is headed by founder and ceo james manning who was previously an executive director at carrington forsyth investment limited the companyâ s primary offerings include data center colocation services infrastructure optimization bitcoin mining digital asset management the firm acquires customers through its direct sales and marketing efforts and through partner referrals migi has five bitcoin mining sites under operation in the us and australia and has recently begun developing a â large scale hydropower bitcoin mining facility in tasmania and the southern half of australia â mawson infrastructureâ s market competition the global market for bitcoin mining is currently in significant flux with the recent bans on mining in china causing a large amount of that country s hashpower to exit the network while those operators look for a more suitable location the market value for mining depends on the price of bitcoin since the majority of value going to the miner is a function of the current bitcoin reward rate of 6 25 bitcoin per successfully mined block at a price of 25 000 per bitcoin the annual mining rewards for the entire industry would be approximately 8 2 billion major industry participants include bitfarms bitf bitf ca

metrics may be viewed here commentary on mawson infrastructure in its last earnings call source seeking alpha covering q2 2022â s results management highlighted the expansion of its hosting colocation business which now totals 54 megawatts in size and 1 8 exahash in mining capacity the firmâ s self mining capacity rose briefly to 1 85 exahash by quarter end until falling slightly to 1 7 exahash in july mawson also signed a 120 megawatt infrastructure deal in texas as part of its energy demand response program this type of program enables grid operators to request that bitcoin mining power down during peak energy use periods to free up energy capacity for critical needs the company also announced it will â become a 33 shareholder in tasmania data infrastructure â where it will be developing a hydropower bitcoin mining operation in tasmania and the southern region of australia also the firm closed a 10 million pipe in july to cover potential loss due to a major hosting customer celsius entering bankruptcy as to its financial results total revenue rose 236 year over year while gross profit was little changed over the same period in 2021 however gaap operating losses worsened significantly during the quarter for the balance sheet the company finished the quarter with 2 5 million in cash and equivalents while paying down its foundry digital debt facility which it expects to be paid off by the end of october 2022 the company s existing mining fleet is now fully paid for and all units have been delivered looking ahead management has deferred â all major forward capital expenditure until market conditions normalize â a prudent approach as the price of bitcoin continues to drop while mining hashrate remains high resulting in a profit squeeze for miners for its hosting colocation business management sees â strongâ inbound interest and demand as it continues to expand this business segment from 100 megawatts of customer agreements in place to as high as 200 megawatts by the end of 2023 regarding valuation the market has beaten down migiâ s stock price as the company has doubled down on bitcoin mining despite a significant bear market in bitcoinâ s price while itâ s anyoneâ s guess where bitcoinâ s price will track over the near term managementâ s characterization of its hosting colocation business and growing demand is encouraging also positive is the firmâ s ability to tap private equity investment to cover its operational exposure to the celsius bankruptcy filing the primary risk to the companyâ s outlook is a continued bear market for the price of bitcoin just as large investments in bitcoin mining equipment have been made by the firm and others in the space a potential upside catalyst would obviously be a bitcoin price rally but also a pause in the rise of cost of capital essentially migi is trading as a proxy to bitcoin at least in the near term while i am bullish on bitcoin in the longer term it could take an extended period for price to rebound however migiâ s hosting colocation business is growing and should provide interested investors with potential revenue stream diversification over the medium term while migi is not a low risk stock since iâ m bullish over the longer term on the price of bitcoin and intrigued by its hosting colocation growth opportunity iâ m putting migi on a watch list for further consideration for now my outlook is a hold for migi

cnn the world is in desperate need of water drought and increasing temperatures have threatened to impact nearly every major sector of the economy from energy to agriculture to shipping markets are taking note the s p global water index which tracks 50 companies from around the world that are involved in water utilities infrastructure equipment and materials has outperformed the s p global broad market index by more than 3 percentage points per year since its beginning in late 2001 so far this year the global water index return has been nearly 5 percentage points higher than the s p global bmi the big picture europe is suffering the worst drought it has seen in at least 500 years after sweltering temperatures led to thousands of deaths across germany the united kingdom spain and portugal european rivers hit record low water levels interfering with crop and power production as well as shipping the rhine fell so low that shipping had to be severely reduced causing supply issues in switzerland and germany yields of major crops are expected to fall by at least 10 to 20 due to water restrictions it s not the only region of the world struggling with water shortages a drought that has been enveloping the southwestern united states since 2000 marks the driest 22 year period of the past 1 200 years a ucla led study found the american farm bureau federation suggests that yields could be down by as much as a third this year compared with last year because of drought and extreme heat climate change could make these extreme droughts a common occurrence a report by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change last year found droughts in drying regions that previously occurred only once every 10 years are now happening about 1 7 times per decade on average if the earth warms by another 2 degrees celsius the once rare occurrences will happen about 2 5 times per decade what it means for markets stress on public budgets will make it difficult for governments around the world to solve water access and drought issues on their own publicly traded companies are increasingly likely to be part of the solution and analysts predict opportunity for upside as these demands for clean water increase companies involved in water related business activities stand to grow in the coming years wrote tianyin cheng a senior director at s p dow jones indices recent reports from the world economic forum estimate the global water industry at 483 billion as of mid 2022 investors want in there were 23 water funds launched over the last five years with a collective 8 billion in assets according to morningstar data common holdings in these funds include utilities like american water works company georg fischer ag a swiss firm that works on the safe transportation of water and water technology companies like xylem which forecasts revenue growth around 5 annually through 2025 consolidated water which recycles waste water into potable water is also being watched by analysts its shares are up 52 this year while the broader s p 500 is down nearly 19 over the same period a rising tide on the other side of the equation lie companies that sap water resources and don t address drought as a critical problem to their business operations a recent analysis from environmental disclosure platform cdp and planet tracker a non profit think tank showed listed companies could face losses of at least 225 billion from risks related to water also in august sustainability investor group ceres announced the creation of the valuing water finance initiative

fund will pressure companies to pay more attention to their impact on water quality and availability participants they say will consider additional steps of escalation like voting against directors at companies who won t make necessary changes wall street s big month after a mercifully quiet summer the stock market is going to have a lot to react to this month between consequential central bank decisions around the globe and at least eight us fed officials speaking this week alone big bank ceos testifying before congress and some changes coming to the crypto market investors will have a lot to digest and contend with that s not to mention the host of economic data that will let us know more about whether inflation is still biting the labor market is still booming and consumers are still shopping historically speaking this isn t a great month for markets but september is a month of clarity the crisp air snaps away the last of august s haze and allows us to see what s ahead here s what we ll be watching over the next few weeks big week for central banks the us federal reserve is arguably one of the most influential forces on markets right now as officials consider further interest rate hikes later this month to fight inflation investors will be watching closely for any clues to what it might do central bank decisions on hikes are expected across the globe which are expected to have impacts on both european and us markets sept 7 it s a central bank bonanza as cleveland federal reserve president loretta mester fed vice chair lael brainard and vice chair for supervision michael barr all give their economic outlooks on top of that the fed will release its beige book which describes the state of consumer spending sentiment and housing demands in the 12 federal reserve districts beyond the us the bank of canada also publishes its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate sept 8 the fed fete continues as federal reserve chair jerome powell speaks from the cato institute at 9 10 am et the last time powell spoke from jackson hole he said the economy should expect some pain on the horizon which sent markets reeling the european central bank will also release its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate which will be closely watched by investors globally sept 9 this week of fed festivities wraps with speeches from chicago fed president charles evans and governor christopher waller an onslaught of data key economic data mapping the trajectory of us inflation comes out the following week this is the last drop of data before the fed meets to decide where interest rates go and investors will be looking closely for signs that inflation could be easing sept 13 the consumer price index cpi for august is released this measures the change in the prices of goods and services and the fed pays very close attention to this figure sept 14 producer price index ppi for august is released this is the fed s preferred measure of inflation it measures a change in input prices of raw semi finished or finished goods and services sept 15 the bank of england publishes its decision on where to set the benchmark interest rate in the us retail sales for august will also be released these are an important indicator of consumer spending which accounts for the majority of economic activity all eyes on dc the penultimate week of september is perhaps the most newsworthy investors have been waiting since july to see the fed s next move and this week they finally meet and announce the extent to which they ll raise rates wall street ceos will also flock to the hill to talk banking policy and could give an update on where they predict the economy is headed in sept 20 21 federal open market committee fomc members will meet and vote on where to set the target interest rate traders will watch the decision closely as well as the press conference following the decision with fed chair jerome powell any surprises could send us markets tumbling sept 21 22 bank of america s brian moynihan wells fargo s charlie scharf jpmorgan chase s jamie dimon citi s jane fraser pnc s bill demchak us bank s andrew cecere and truist s bill roger all testify for their annual report to senate and congress investors will listen for any predictions on where the economy is going and for any mentions of that dreaded r word recession pass the chips here s another development in the longstanding us china rivalry the biden administration released plans for its 50 billion investment in the us semiconductor industry on tuesday aimed at shaping an important industry and countering china the department of commerce announced how it would allocate its chips for america fund part of an act signed into law in july according to the white house about 28 billion of the fund will go toward grants and loans to help build facilities for advanced and cutting edge chip making another 10 billion will go to expanding manufacturing for older generations of technology used in cars and communications tech like smart phones the last 11 billion will go to research and development initiatives related to chipmaking the department of commerce will start accepting applications for the funding from companies by february and could begin distributing money by next spring the united states was once a leader in semiconductor chip manufacturing but has lost ground to other countries like china now many american manufacturers import the chips that are essential to the production of cars smartphones and medical equipment as my colleague rishi iyengar has reported taiwan complicates matters further the self governed island off china s coast has become a diplomatic and military flashpoint between washington and beijing taiwan is critical to the global semiconductor industry with several of the world s top manufacturers headquartered there the new funding is intended to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the us and as a result help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions reports my colleague katie lobosco the current global chip shortage has limited production of new vehicles for example leaving americans facing high car prices

second quarter was a solid quarter for yext and we executed well against our strategy of driving long term growth through increased operational efficiency best in class product innovation and improving customer satisfaction our revenue for the quarter was 100 9 million and our non gaap net loss per share was 0 03 beating the high end of our guidance range by 0 02 driven by our success in streamlining the business and improving our operating efficiencies these results highlight the momentum we re generating through a realignment of our sales and customer success organizations while successfully managing costs in order to increase our cash position in the future as our full year non gaap eps guidance suggests we expect to achieve profitability in the back half of this year i d like to share some observations about our progress toward achieving our strategic objectives and how the rate of this progress factors into our expectations for the second half of the year first as we noted in our first quarter call providing greater clarity around our brand and platform capabilities are a key to rearchitecting our go to market strategy during the quarter we made significant progress against this priority and transitioned the name of our answers product to search and our core set of products listings reviews pages search and knowledge graph together as the answers platform we did this to align with what we actually do for customers in our vision to help businesses answer every question from their customers employees and partners anytime anywhere we made this change with the launch of our summer release that included 60 plus new features and upgrades across every area of the platform reflecting our continued commitment to innovation and realizing our vision as the answers company to help us continue to strengthen our brand positioning we announced our new chief marketing officer raianne reiss in late august raianne has more than 20 years of global technology marketing experience at companies like aws juniper networks and more recently elastic raianne will oversee yext s global marketing organization and be responsible for building and strengthening the yext brand and increasing demand for yext solutions globally second we continue to lay the groundwork for future revenue opportunities landing deals across all of our products although it s still early i m very encouraged by the breadth and variety of deals we closed during the quarter as they demonstrate that our product suite and value are resonating with customers mark will discuss our recent product innovations and share customer wins in a moment i believe these customer stories are leading indicators reflecting that the ongoing rearchitecture of our go to market is having an impact and we are well positioned to capture additional opportunities as we continue to improve all elements of our go to market motion to drive product innovation and expand customer use across the platform in conversations with dozens of customers and prospects this quarter i ve observed first hand the increasing importance to the c suite of answering their constituents questions wherever and whenever those questions are being asked the individual use cases and priorities of each customer vary from location based questions on third party properties to various company controlled search use cases such as support search but this is a clear priority across the diversity of customer use cases while we remain cautious on our outlook i am highly encouraged by our prospects to drive tremendous customer value third our third quarter guidance reflects our ability to successfully improve our operating efficiencies we ve demonstrated we can operate more efficiently and the team is excited about the changes we are making to drive success for our customers we continue to make organizational changes in the business that lower our operating expenses by reducing layers increasing spans of controls and creating more coordination across our teams i could continue to believe that we ll drive better customer outcomes and ultimately sell and service our products more effectively by creating a leaner more agile organization as we noted on our last call arr is a metric we focus on because it provides insight into the performance of our recurring revenue business model and is less impacted by fluctuations in billing and contract terms direct arr continues to be our primary revenue driver we are working to broaden our relationships with third party resellers and refocus on our share growth opportunities as i look at the arr picture our total arr is relatively flat over the last couple of quarters this is largely driven by significant negative fx in q1 and q2 and weakness in third party reseller arr we are seeing growth in direct arr which we believe is the most immediate measure of our overall products market fit darryl will provide more detail on the specific dynamics around fx and arr we will continue to look at the arr picture conservatively as we work to improve our go to market motion and in light of global macroeconomic and fx conditions we do see a global trend toward more scrutiny on overall spending and longer deal cycles and this is reflected in our outlook our q2 results and full year guidance demonstrate that we are executing well against our strategy while making clear progress on our path to profitability the team and i continue to operate the business based on the principle that long term sustainable growth is the result of a more clinical and efficient operating model and i remain extremely optimistic about our ability to capitalize on our large market opportunity we have installed a lot of change inside the company in the last six months change like this is challenging in any environment and even more so with the backdrop of uncertainty in the global macro environment i d like to take a moment and thank our entire global team for their dedication and commitment to getting to the right answer for our customers and the company we continue to believe that our stock is a great investment and this is reflected in our continued share repurchases in q2 with that i d now like to turn the call over to marc marc ferrentino president and chief operating officer thanks mike as mike noted earlier we reached an important milestone in our brand cleanup this quarter and added new features across the entire platform with the early access launch of the summer release i ll begin by discussing how we are rolling out updated branding and highlight the product innovations included in our summer release followed by a few customer success stories last quarter we discussed how we would be working to clean up our messaging and simplify our brand i am proud to report that we have made major progress on this front we have revised and simplified our brand positioning cleaned up our usage of the term answers by updating the product name to search and establishing answers as the name of our platform we ve updated our website products solutions and marketing materials to reflect this updated messaging and brand positioning we believe that every ceo has an answers problem every day customers employees and partners are asking questions about your business in an attempt to find information answering these questions is hard for any business since the answers are scattered across different content silos and digital channels are managed separately with the answers platform yext solves this problem by collecting and organizing your content then answering these questions through seamless multichannel digital experiences this updated messaging and branding is being rolled out to the organization throughout q3 the rollout of our new branding coincided with the early access of our summer release with this release we have added google business profile listings analytics and more detailed listing statuses which offers never before seen insights into user performance and operating data we believe these insights will further strengthen the value of our flagship listings product we also enhanced our connector framework to allow us to connect to a larger range of internal systems in order to populate the knowledge graph we continue to make great strides with our developer experience with major enhancements to our pages offering and allowing a greater set of development options to create search experiences overall we have launched 60 plus new features across our listings pages reviews search and knowledge graph products these features significantly upgrade the ability of the answers platform to create multichannel experiences that are more efficient cost effective and gratifying for the end user general availability will kick off tomorrow september 8 as mike noted we believe the diversity of our customer wins across listings only listings upsell search and multiproduct solutions are a good indicator that we have the opportunity to expand these partner relationships over time particularly as we continue to strengthen our go to market and customer support teams here are a few examples texas children s hospital was a listings renewal and upsell this quarter originally they use listings for several hundred of their care providers after we were able to demonstrate incremental revenue lift the customer decided to renew and increase their commitment to approximately 3 000 providers this is a listings customer that started small and by showing value we were able to expand our relationship over time and we see future potential opportunities to expand with other products piedmont health is another good example of a healthcare client has started with listings over three years ago and seeing that yext could deliver on both scale and speed invested in additional products this quarter we expanded our agreement with piedmont health to include additional providers in retail we ve expanded our listings and pages relationship with the sparc group to include additional brands that we haven t worked with before including aeropostale eddie bauer and nautica we also transformed nationwide support hub by adding yext search after yext was able to successfully deliver on listings and pages over the past two years nationwide decided to expand our relationship to include support search internationally hca uk was a great win for us as they are one of the largest private healthcare companies in the uk we landed with search this quarter helped them solve the support pain point but with over 3 000 consultants in 240 facilities we see future opportunities to expand with this customer in japan we signed tsuruha holdings one of the leading companies in the drug store industry in japan which will be using our listing solution after a competitive evaluation process box the content cloud selected yext to transform the search experience of their zendesk support site the support search deal is their initial high priority use case and we see additional room for growth across the business we have been working with l oreal s saloncentric brand is a listings client for over a year this quarter we expanded across three additional brands that sell their products through salons our search product was able to provide a centralized platform for managing data integrate with other technologies like salesforce and handle non location related data to provide additional accurate information about the salons that sell these products on the partnership front our partnership with acquia help provide a solution for pegasystems where we will power their search on their support and community sites and our partnership with adobe helped us win a site search deal at booz allen on the competitive front win rates for our search product were very high notably we beat several of our competitors in new business wins including the largest global insurance provider based in europe community health network exponent and ecco shoes in closing we re excited about the pace of our product innovation and the diversity of use cases as demonstrated by our customer wins now i ll turn the call over to darryl darryl bond chief financial officer thanks marc our second quarter revenue grew 3 year over year to 100 9 million which was above the high end of our guidance range as a result of the stronger dollar relative to countries where we transact in local currencies second quarter revenue included a negative year over year impact of approximately 2 8 million or 3 using a constant currency basis excluding the fx impact our second quarter year over year growth was approximately 6 unearned revenue was 165 9 million at the end of the quarter up slightly from a year ago annual recurring revenue or arr was 387 million at the end of q2 up 2 year over year arr at the end of q2 experienced an approximate 10 8 million negative impact from fx year over year on a constant currency basis excluding the fx impact our q2 year over year arr growth was approximately 5 and has grown sequentially since the first quarter of this year our trailing 12 month net dollar based retention which excludes our small business customers was 98 our trailing 12 month net dollar based retention for direct which also excludes small business customers as well as our third party reseller customers was 98 our customer count which exclude small business customers and third party reseller customers increased 8 year over year to over 2 870 last quarter we began providing a more detailed look at arr across our direct customers and third party reseller customers to help investors measure our future opportunity as well as progress across new customer adoption renewals and upsells in the second quarter direct customers represented 81 of total arr direct arr at the end of q2 totaled 312 million representing 5 year over year growth excluding the impact of fx the direct arr growth relative to last year was 8 on a constant currency basis the direct sales team is primarily focused on enterprise and mid market accounts where arr growth is a good measure of adoption and satisfaction third party resellers represent 19 of total arr third party reseller arr totaled 74 9 million at the end of q2 representing decline of 6 over prior year excluding the impact of fx third party reseller arr declined 4 relative to last year on a constant currency basis turning to non gaap results which are reconciled to gaap in our press release q2 gross margin was 74 5 compared to 75 2 in the year ago quarter generally consistent with our second quarter seasonality and we expect to be in the range of our long term non gaap gross margin target of 75 to 80 for the remainder of the year q2 operating expenses were 78 6 million or 78 of revenue compared to 79 8 million or 81 of revenue in the year ago quarter we continue to improve operating efficiencies particularly in sales and marketing sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue declined to 48 in q2 from 52 in the second quarter last year and we expect this metric to continue to improve on an annual basis our q2 net loss was 3 9 million compared to a net loss of 7 2 million in the year ago quarter our q2 net loss per share was 0 03 compared to a net loss of 0 06 per share in the second quarter last year cash and cash equivalents were 188 million at the end of q2 compared to 248 million at the end of the first quarter the decline in our cash balances was driven largely by continued share repurchases executed during q2 which totaled 31 6 million year to date our share repurchases totaled 59 million we intend to continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position going forward and will remain open to buying back our stock at attractive prices net cash used in operating activities for q2 was 25 2 million compared to 32 6 million cash used in the year ago quarter capex was 2 2 million in the second quarter compared to 3 1 million in the second quarter of last year as we have returned to a normalized annual capex run rate following the completion of our real estate expansions turning to our outlook the u s dollar has strengthened even further versus the currencies in which we transact our international business resulting in a larger than expected fx headwinds to both q3 and the full year of our fiscal 23 our guidance assumed present foreign currency rates and we expect q3 revenue to be between 99 million and 100 million our q3 guidance includes the negative impact of 1 million as a result of fx while this indicates a sequential decline in revenue when adjusting for fx on a constant currency basis our business continues to grow for example total arr grew modestly quarter over quarter this year when adjusting for the impact of fx on a constant currency basis we expect our q3 non gaap eps to be between negative 0 01 and positive 0 01 assuming a weighted average basic share count of approximately 124 4 million shares for the full year fiscal 23 we expect revenue of 399 4 million to 401 4 million the total year over year fx impact is now estimated to be 8 million an incremental 2 million since our last earnings call which is based on present foreign currency rates our non gaap net loss per share is expected to range from 0 06 to 0 08 a 0 04 improvement from the midpoint of our previous guidance as we expect continued improvement across operating expenses particularly sales and marketing full year eps assumes a basic weighted average share count of approximately 126 3 million shares operator we are ready to open it up for q a questions answers operator pardon me this is the conference operator we seem to have lost the connection with the main speakers rejoining them momentarily nils erdmann senior vice president investor relations hello operator yes nils can you hear me nils erdmann senior vice president investor relations we can hear you now operator ok let me just try the other line real quick here hang on one second please ok we re going to proceed on this line gentlemen our first question is going to come from naved khan with truist please go ahead naved khan truist securities analyst yes hi thanks a lot just two questions for me first on the sales and marketing we are seeing nice leverage can you just maybe update us on the headcount and i understand the rebranding that you re doing but outside of that what are the other things that you might be doing to increase sales efficiency and maybe sales motion maybe any color there would be helpful and then on the net dollar retention for direct it seems like it went down from q1 and wanted to clarify if there s any fx impact there or how should we understand that sequential decline thanks mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer yes so hey it s mike and thanks for the question i ll let darryl handle the net dollar discussion what i ll say on your question about the sales and marketing efficiencies and specifically headcount one thing i told you on my first call here six months ago was that we are not going to be continuing to run the business from a capacity point of view and that we re going to be focused on driving sales productivity and that we would reinvest in the business when we saw the productivity that we wanted so you can clearly see that we re driving that efficiency through the organization and it s a lot bigger than just quota carrying head count but across the board we re finding these efficiencies and so we re not going to be doing what i m going to be providing a quota carrying number and that s just it s a moving target for us and it s something that we re constantly evaluating and will continue to be constantly evaluating as we look at the ability for the sales teams to be effective in the market so much of the work that we re doing from a branding perspective and from a positioning perspective is going to help us drive better results through the channels and so i think the headline there is we re just taking a totally different look at it approaching it from a productivity standpoint as close to a capacity standpoint darryl bond chief financial officer yes on the net retention you re right it did tick down from 99 last quarter 98 this quarter and that s really a result of just some of the challenges that we ve talked about in previous calls around customer success and gross retention and obviously as we continue to move through a lot of the go to market changes that we ve been talking about we re certainly having an impact on our upsells which are really what s contributing to the movement there naved khan truist securities analyst got it and then a quick follow up if i may so your recent appointment of raianne reiss i think that s a great hire maybe just talk about how you think where do you see sort of hire kind of leveraging her background as it sort of as it relates to the product offering at yext is it do you see that in the search offering or do you see where do you see the most opportunity there just kind of address your thoughts mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer yes so we re absolutely thrilled that raianne has joined the company she is about two weeks in the job so we re going to give her a little time to get oriented but she brings 20 years of technology marketing experience to the table aws juniper and elastic more recently and she is a complete marketing executive who will oversee our whole marketing organization we are not thinking about things from a search being separate standpoint here anymore and i think that s reflected in the positioning so what we re excited about and i think what raianne excited about here is that there s a complete platform to sell here it s keyed in on solving some of the most important problems of the c suite which are answering their constituent questions anytime anywhere and between our brand positioning work which raianne will continue to advance as well as really importantly the demand generation background that she has and the ability to drive that we just really saw she actually bring lot to the table here naved khan truist securities analyst understood thank you operator the next question is from arjun bhatia with william blair please go ahead arjun bhatia william blair and company analyst perfect thank you guys for taking my question here just one on the rebranding efforts and how you re repositioning that what impact or change rather have you made to pricing if any do any of these rebranding efforts impacts how customers are actually purchasing yext s or is it more on just the broader sales process for the communication of these the value proposition is clearer and then just on this topic as well do you have a sense of how long it might take before we start to see some of the broader impact from some of the initiatives that you re rolling out today to play out marc ferrentino president and chief operating officer all right hey this is marc thanks for the question so on the rebrand a lot what we re doing here is really articulating in a really strong way that the total value of the platform historically we ve talked about individual products we are sort of looking at the world now in a way that sort of experiences now span across multiple channels and we have a digital experience platform that allows you to deliver your answers across multiple different channels and of course to do this right you need to of course do that from a pricing standpoint we changed actually two years ago to a capacity based pricing model that was in anticipation of this move toward the platform and so at this time there is no need to change there is no reason to change to be we already meet that big shift a couple of years ago mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer i think the second part of your question we got a little there were some background noise there but it sounded like it started with how long will it take and i lost the second part of it arjun bhatia william blair and company analyst yes no sorry that was right just how long it would take before it starts like it sounds like you re seeing some early impacts but how long before we see a broader impact from some of the initiatives you re rolling out today mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer yes so it s mike again and the way i would describe this is on this friday i think i will have been in the job for six months and obviously the first order of business was getting the team organized which took a little bit of time and the second order of business was a lot of the restructuring and efficiency work that we ve been doing i still fundamentally believe that the more efficient operation that we re creating and that you re starting to see on the expense side of the business is going to actually is going to help us produce better results by having a more coordinated and more streamlined and a more agile organization but i think it s really important to understand that our sales cycles are six months plus right and so our ability to fundamentally change bookings and retention dynamics they re going to it s just going to take longer than it is for us to flex the expense lines and so i think what we re beginning to see in the business are very early indications that better coordination better management of our opportunities but we re just so early in that process and as we get into the next six months to 12 months i think we start to see the fruits of all that work arjun bhatia william blair and company analyst understood very helpful and then you talked about some of the channel the progress in the channel that you re making i m curious what is the reach today like i know it s 90 of arr but as you think about focusing on as an issue in the future here do you want more partners do you want deep relationships with existing partners is there a potential for yext size to get involved here just walk us through how you re thinking the partner strategy mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think you can see clearly that we have some headwinds in the partner channel that is the outside the reseller channel our third party resellers or how we access primarily small and medium smbs and so we do think that there is a bit more headwinds in that section of the market than there is in the enterprise i also think there s a lot more we can do with those reseller partners to bring more opportunity to the table and bring more value to those relationships and so i ve said this before and i could say that we re committed to figuring out ways to continue to drive value through product innovation through different structures and different business relationships with our third party reseller partners and thinking more broadly about what the partnership universe looks like for us which includes a size and marc has been spending a lot of time with not just the and his team not just with the reseller partners but also with partners of many flavors and it s all part of our strategy moving forward arjun bhatia william blair and company analyst understood thanks for taking the question guys operator the next question is from tom white with d a davidson please go ahead wyatt swanson d a davidson analyst hey this is wyatt swanson on for tom thanks for taking our questions sorry if i missed this during the prepared remarks but can you guys talk a bit about retention trends in your listing business i believe you guys recently rolled out some new product features and enhancements for listing customers does that have a quantifiable impact on listings retention mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer yes so i ll start it s mike and then i think let marc talk about a bunch of the product stuff so what we saw in q2 was gross retention in the business in the low 80s which is consistent with what we saw in q1 and as a reminder and i wasn t maybe clear enough about this on the last call the way we calculate gross retention when we talk about it in this context is it s the grand total of contracts that are up for renewal in a given quarter is the number and then what we actually renew and so we re not happy with that number the last couple of quarters in the low 80s but we have a much smaller set of contracts in q1 and q2 that are up for renewal and so there is no higher priority for us in the business than driving performance in this number and a lot of that comes down to happier customers which i ve talked about a lot product enhancements which marc can talk about are a big part of that process as well marc ferrentino president and chief operating officer yes the last two the releases the spring release in summer release we continue to innovate on the listings product listings product has been our one of our core flagship products for a very long time this release we two big features that i mentioned in the prepared remarks we re around the google business profile analytics which actually gives you keyword level analytics now as far as how your brands showing up which is that was something new and exciting really highlights the value of listings overall in addition to just operational metrics around losing status and things of that nature every single release we have continue to evolve the listings product to innovate listings product i think we ve done a better job of in the last quarter is actually articulated those new features to our customer base and that s that has been at least anecdotally well received by many of our customers appreciating the insight and even sending out to the listings specific product updates to sort of be able to highlight exactly what we re doing in that front wyatt swanson d a davidson analyst got you ok thank you and then just one more from me could you share your latest thoughts on potentially using your balance sheet to do some m a or does m a kind of play less of a role right now for yext just given your focus on simplifying the go to market and unifying the overall end customer experience mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer yes so it s mike so i m happy to talk about that we ve obviously as you can see been using our balance sheet to invest in our own stock which we think is the greater investment and we will continue to look at that as we go forward from an m a perspective i do think it s an interesting thing for the future i think at this point we have a lot of wood to chop to continue our to strengthen our go to market and complete the work that we ve been doing here to reorient the business around a more efficient operation so i wouldn t call i wouldn t say it s a high priority for m a at this point to be aggressively looking at that i do think there will be opportunities along the way and we ll obviously look at anything that seems additive and feasible but i m not going to say it s one of my or the team size priorities right now wyatt swanson d a davidson analyst got you ok thank you operator the next question is from ryan macdonald with needham please go ahead unknown speaker hi everyone this is michael on for ryan today you noted it a little bit earlier but could you talk a bit on the broad macro impact outside of just fx are there any verticals or regions that stand out to you in terms of the impact of elongated sales cycles mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer yes so i think what we re seeing is we re seeing customers assessing their costs more carefully we re seeing i think you procurement cycles to take a little bit longer i think most businesses are taking a little bit closer look at what they re spending the other thing we re so i think we re seeing a lot of what a lot of people are seeing which is potentially some elongation of sale cycles and that may be regionally happening a little bit more in europe than it is here in the u s although i really think most global businesses now are taking a closer look at their expense lines the other thing we re seeing and that i think is more encouraging is that with that scrutiny comes to focus on which partners they work with who can provide multiple solutions and platform solutions as opposed to individual point solutions and so one of the things that that we re hearing from customers and frankly we re doing in our own businesses we re figuring out where can we do more with our best partners and potentially eliminate overlap and duplication and we really think that s an advantage for us because we have a platform that crosses many of the needs of our customers and prospects and we think that over the long run any consolidation of focus is going to be to our advantage relative to our competitors who don t have a platform unknown speaker great and then given the turnover you saw in the workforce earlier this year could you give us an update on how you re progressing on your hiring plans relative to expectation and then in regards to those newly hired reps could you give us a sense of how those reps are ramping relative to expectations thank you mike walrath chairman and chief executive officer so i think general comment on the hiring situation is i think we ve seen a significant change in the hiring environment and i think it s cooled down quite a bit and the flip side of that is that hiring in our quota carrying position is significantly less of a priority right now for us as we work through making sure that every reps that we have in the business is productive and making sure that our system is working our way that drives production this is my answer on the quota carrying reps question is related to the so just i ll get very focused on the number of quota carrying reps that we have in the business when all of the quota carrying reps that we have and we re ramped are producing at a level that we wanted to be and so we ll always look to add talent to the business and i think the environment that we re going into makes that easier for us not harder but we re going to get our blocking and tackling together before we go out and aggressively expand unknown speaker great thank you

everyone thank you for joining us we re pleased to be here with you to share the results of our fiscal fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022 i m proud to say that we had a fantastic first year as a public company with great results across the business including our tremendous cloud arr growth of 48 year over year we added new clients grew our existing clients released new applied ai applications on our cloud platform and beat our guidance every quarter we enter fiscal year 23 with strong momentum intapp targets the 3 trillion technologically underserved professional and financial services industry we bring our clients in this market our purpose built industry cloud platform that is highly differentiated from traditional crm and erp systems because it s designed specifically for the unique partnership model of these firms and their unique business model which is driven by each professional s highly specialized market knowledge and expertise our platform enables these professional firms to arm their professionals with the full collective knowledge of the firm to better compete in their marketplace in order to generate greater returns and revenues to operate more efficiently and profitably all while managing the highly specialized risk and compliance requirements across these regulated industries our target firms across our markets are continuing to demonstrate strong fundamental demand for our purpose built solutions and industry cloud platform looking at our results for q4 and for fiscal year 22 it s clear that our value proposition is resonating and demand for our platform and the competitive strength of our solutions remain strong as i noted earlier in q4 our cloud arr grew 48 to 162 9 million cloud now represents 60 of our total arr of 270 5 million which is up 27 year over year in the quarter we earned saas and support revenue of 52 7 million up 34 year over year and total revenue of 75 5 million up 23 year over year we ended our fiscal year serving more than 2 100 premier firms across our target verticals ok starting with products our continued innovation helped fuel growth throughout fiscal year 22 and set us up for continued product leadership in fiscal year 23 and beyond we continue to add valuable product capabilities to our industry cloud platform this enables us to increase the value of our platform to each client during fiscal year 22 we captured this value as we landed many new clients we also captured this value by expanding through cross sell and upsell to our existing clients driving net revenue retention our client led innovation also opened new markets for us as we extended the capabilities of our cloud platform in one example we launched new functionality in our dealcloud solution to directly support the unique complex needs of real estate investors over the year we continue to expand that capability to fully support real estate deal execution with enhanced visualization of pipeline and properties map based property discovery and tools that streamline market and deal analysis alternative real estate investor kayne anderson with 9 billion under management selected dealcloud to replace a competing crm they told us that the increased efficiency between dealcloud and their former solution is night and day in another example we launched a new relationship intelligence capability across the intapp platform relationship intelligence uses intapp s applied ai technology to answer the key question what is our firm s best way to get into this prospect firm and to navigate to this key person relationship intelligence leverages metadata from the firm s contacts email and meetings enabling individual dealmakers to better nurture and harness the entire firm s network of professionals to grow their business already we see dozens of clients taking advantage of these new capabilities including hgcapital a leading international software and services investor with over 55 billion in assets under management they are using this new capability to identify and leverage the relationships of employees across the firm to form a competitive advantage for the entire firm in another example we launched the intapp collaboration and content suite combining the capabilities gained through the repstor acquisition with intapp s industry cloud platform extending our capabilities natively into microsoft office 365 and teams this solution solves complex security compliance and governance requirements all of which are critical issues for professional and financial services firms of all sizes as they increasingly move to office 365 and teams ok let s turn to new markets our capabilities along with the strength of our industry cloud platform created opportunities for us to expand into new markets during the year picking up on real estate as part of our client led innovation strategy we worked with our large multistrategy private capital clients to define and develop valuable new real estate capabilities on the platform in addition to providing a unique whole solution to the large multistrategy firms these new features have enabled us to target and win new clients who are dedicated to real estate investing including municipal acquisitions a private real estate investment firm based in washington d c and sienna investment managers the alternative investment platform of holding company gbo among many others we believe the long term opportunity to support the investors and advisors ecosystem that invests in real assets is significant and is a natural extension to our success serving the growing private equity industry finally the acquisition of repstor in june 2021 and the subsequent launch of intapp documents for corporate legal has provided us entry into the in house legal market building on the capabilities of our collaboration and content suite we launched the solution in may to deliver intuitive and collaborative matter lifecycle management for in house legal departments these solutions allow in house legal teams to streamline management of critical documents and information enabling them to reach better decisions faster we now have in house legal clients across a wide range of sectors including insurance professional services manufacturing biotech and more large clients include a multinational european based sportswear manufacturer and a ftse 100 listed insurance company turning to partnerships another key accomplishment in fiscal 22 was the expansion of our partner ecosystem our partner ecosystem includes data providers technology solutions and professional services partners who enhance the value that we provide to our clients in february we entered an exciting new chapter in our decade long history with microsoft we announced a new strategic partnership that validates our industry cloud leadership in the market and amplifies our ability to combine our purpose built solutions with the microsoft software that firms use every day we have committed to programs to help our clients move to the cloud securely with joint migration support and deeper integration between our platform and microsoft workforce solutions our clients have shared their enthusiasm for the critical role that we can play in helping them leverage their own investments with microsoft and continue to move to the cloud then in april we expanded our partnership with kpmg to help us support intapp s growing base of large enterprise class and global firms intapp s industry cloud platform combined with kpmg s scaled capabilities and cloud transformation services will enable us to deliver essential solutions and services to make our joint clients complex digital transformation programs successful as an example of our partnership kpmg recently announced a global alliance ecosystem highlighting intapp and microsoft to further empower the future of legal services for both law firms and in house legal departments turning now to m a during fiscal 22 we added two important technology capabilities to our industry cloud platform through acquisition as i mentioned we acquired repstor in june 2021 we successfully integrated this business over the past year and are seeing increasing demand from clients across our target market to better leverage their investment in office 365 and teams we are seeing adoption across all the industries we serve including at big four accounting firms we are where we are delivering on the modern workplace vision dramatically improving collaboration in june we acquired a technology called billstream that automates critical billing workflows integrated into the intapp platform this technology extends our solution for operations and finance teams billstream eliminates manual billing steps enabling our clients to achieve more profitable delivery of work the addition of billstream allows our clients to derive even greater value from our purpose built industry cloud platform we ve seen strong client interest particularly from the hundreds of clients who already rely on us for their operations and finance needs turning to industry recognition in fiscal 22 third party validation for our innovation came in the form of several industry awards our dealcloud solution was recognized winning top honors with the best deal origination award at the u s 2022 private equity wire awards and dealcloud won two 2022 private equity wire european awards for best fundraising and best deal origination technology finally our oneplace solution was named 2022 legal tech trailblazer by the national law journal as you can see fiscal 22 was a year of expansion for intapp on many fronts on the people front we re pleased to have welcomed many new team members to support our growing client base an important part of our culture and differentiation with our clients is that our intapp people are recognized as true experts in the industries that we serve and we continue to build on that leadership we also expanded our board in february we welcomed beverly r allen general counsel and chief compliance and privacy officer at inovalon a leading provider of cloud based platforms empowering data driven healthcare as a new director beverly possesses a deep understanding of cloud based platforms designed to address complex regulated industries and their unique client challenges and we re proud to have her on our board on the client front we re excited to have added so many new logos globally throughout the year while cross selling and upselling our existing accounts driving strong net revenue retention the client list is long but some examples include graphite capital a leading u k mid market private equity firm who is now using dealcloud to boost the efficiency of deal management value creation and investor relations hannes snellman a nordic law firm who selected our oneplace solution for risk and compliance a large independent global business advisory firm with over 6 600 employees who turned to intent to improve compliance and business intake in their complex european and regulatory environment and one of the largest private equity firms in the world based in europe who signed a sizable agreement to implement dealcloud and we continue to expand in asia pacific adding new logos like adv partners a hong kong based private equity firm who selected dealcloud to manage deals and investor relations across multiple locations and we ve also increased our presence in australia and expanded our go to market capabilities in singapore to pursue the significant growth opportunity we see in the asia pacific region in conclusion we re proud of our performance in 22 which launches us into fiscal 23 with strong momentum we are serving an extremely durable end market with our deeply differentiated industry cloud platform our subscription revenue model is highly predictable and we see continued opportunity both to add new clients across a broad tam and to deliver greater value to expand significantly within our existing client base we have a great growth opportunity to drive cloud adoption and modernization across all these industries i d especially like to thank our clients our partners our investors our board and our global employee team whose teamwork and dedication led to such a successful first year as a public company thank you all very much ok steve over to you steve robertson chief financial officer thanks john and thanks everyone for joining us today as john noted we had another strong quarter with our cloud arr up 48 year over year and our total arr up 27 year over year before i go through our financials as a reminder i d like to quickly review a few fundamentals of revenue recognition in our financial model cloud arr is recognized as saas revenue ratably following a new sale or renewal on premises arr is recognized in two parts 50 as subscription license revenue recognized upfront at the time of the sale or renewal and 50 as support revenue recognized ratably and included in our saas and support revenue line because it is recognized ratably saas and support revenue is more predictable quarter to quarter while subscription license revenue can vary based on the timing of revenue recognition ok moving to our numbers q4 saas and support revenue was 52 7 million up 34 year over year reflecting both sales to new clients and upsells and cross sell to existing clients of intapp s purpose built cloud solutions subscription license revenue was 13 4 million compared to 14 4 million in the prior year period reflecting our plan to migrate on premises clients to the cloud over time professional services revenue was 9 4 million as compared to 7 4 million in the prior year period in line with the growth of our software implementations year over year as a result total revenue is 75 5 million up 23 year over year before discussing gross margins expenses and profitability please note that i will be discussing non gaap results for q4 going forward as a reminder our financial results along with a reconciliation between gaap and non gaap results can be found in our earnings press release and its supplemental financial tables total non gaap gross margin was 68 2 as compared to 70 1 in the prior year period due to the absolute and relative decline of our high margin on premises license business as compared to a cloud business in the quarter as well as the decrease in the services gross margin as a function of several factors including increased travel expense and use of subcontractors for the quarter non gaap operating expense was 55 3 million a 13 million increase year over year as we continue to invest in sales marketing and product development to support our growth non gaap sales and marketing expense was 24 6 million a 5 9 million increase year over year as a function of increased headcount and increased marketing program spend to capture new business in our growing markets non gaap r d expense was 16 2 million a 3 6 million increase year over year as we increased the headcount and made investments in our product roadmap non gaap dna expense was 14 5 million a 3 5 million increase year over year in line with expected expense increases associated with being a publicly traded company non gaap operating loss was 3 9 million as compared to our fourth quarter fiscal 21 non gaap operating profit of 0 6 million primarily reflecting planned growth investments in the business non gaap net loss per share was 0 04 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 22 as compared to a loss of 0 19 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 21 primarily reflecting a year over year reduction in interest expense and an increase in the weighted average share count moving to our full year results for fiscal 22 cloud arr grew 48 year over year to 162 9 million at june 30 2022 cloud arr represented 60 of our total arr up from 52 a year ago reflecting our cloud first business focus and the market s ongoing shift to the cloud total arr grew 27 year over year to 270 5 million we continue to execute our land and expand model and at june 30 2022 we had more than 2 100 clients 506 of which had arr of more than 100 000 up from 420 in the prior year period in addition at the end of the fiscal year we had 41 clients of more than 1 million in arr up from 31 clients at the end of fiscal 21 due to the steady increase in arr from upsell and cross sell motions we achieve an average net revenue retention rate of more than 114 in fiscal year 22 up from an average of more than 110 in fiscal year 21 saas and support revenue increased 34 year over year to 193 million reflecting continued strength in the sale and adoption of our cloud solutions subscription license revenue was 44 2 million primarily reflecting renewals of our subscription license business this is a modest decrease year over year in line with our strategy to migrate legacy clients to the cloud when they are ready professional services revenue increased 42 year over year to 34 9 million in total revenue increased 27 year over year to 272 1 million before discussing full year gross margins expenses and profitability please note that i will now be discussing non gaap results as a reminder our gaap financial results along with the reconciliation between gaap and non gaap results can be found in our earnings press release and its supplemental financial tables non gaap gross margin was 68 1 down from 69 in the prior year as a result of a change in the mix of our saas and support subscription license and services revenue overall non gaap operating expense was 192 3 million a 52 1 million increase year over year as we invested in a variety of resources in support of the growth of the business while absorbing the costs of going public as a result non gaap operating loss was 7 1 million as compared to an 8 million operating profit in the prior fiscal year non gaap net loss per share was 0 12 in fiscal 22 as compared to 0 56 in fiscal 21 primarily reflecting a year over year reduction in interest expense and an increase in the weighted average share count turning to the balance sheet we ended the fourth quarter with 50 8 million in cash and cash equivalents as compared to 37 6 million at the end of fiscal 21 in terms of cash flow our unlevered free cash flow was 15 4 million for fiscal 22 as compared to 9 4 million for fiscal 21 as we remain committed to positive free cash flow on an annual basis while investing in the growth of intapp s business now turning to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 23 we expect saas and support revenue of between 55 million and 56 million and total revenue in the range of 76 million to 77 million we expect a non gaap operating loss in the range of 1 million to 2 million and a non gaap net loss per share in the range of 0 03 to 0 05 using a basic share count weighted for the quarter of approximately 63 million common shares outstanding for the full year fiscal 23 we expect saas and support revenue of between 238 million and 242 million and total revenue in the range of 324 5 million to 328 5 million we also expect a non gaap fy 23 operating loss in the range of 1 million to 5 million and a non gaap net loss per share in the range of 0 08 to 0 12 using a basic share count weighted for fiscal year 23 of approximately 64 million weighted common shares outstanding with that john and i look forward to taking your questions questions answers operator please stand by while we compile the q a roster our first question will come from the line of kevin mcveigh from credit suisse your line is open kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst hey thank you so much and really just congratulations on the exceptional results and outlook i wonder if you could talk maybe start a little bit with just the net revenue retention when i picked up the number it seems like it came in at about 114 up from 110 and what s interesting though i would think maybe just tie that in because obviously some of the law firms things like that some of the more discretionary parts of the business i m sure slowed around m a things like that or ipos but you folks are clearly powering through that so maybe help us understand what s driving that a little bit if we could start there steve robertson chief financial officer sure i ll take that kevin first of all yeah we were actually a little north of 114 i think what we said was we averaged more than one fourteenth for the year and we as you may remember we raised our range a little bit a quarter or two ago i think what s driving it really is a balanced set of cross sell and upsell motions in the business i mean typically in the professional services business it s more about cross sell of new capability and functionality and typically in the financial services business at least recently we have a lot of upsells in terms of new users we get some of those in both sides of the business but those are the leading drivers in both those two and i think we feel that this is a you know good sign the business is strong and the people it s just part of the land and expand strategy that s working pretty well right now kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst really exceptional and then can we talk a little bit just about billstream and then i ll get back in the queue i mean i remember from the ipo i think that was one of the parts of the offering that there was a gap in terms of the billing and things like that is there any way to think about the revenue associated with that and then from when you acquired it and then ultimately what the potential can be as you extrapolate that across your existing client base john hall chairman and chief executive officer thanks kevin i ll take steve robertson chief financial officer well go ahead john john hall chairman and chief executive officer i ll take the concept steve and then you can do some numbers but generally speaking you re right this was an area that we identified in the ipo and prior to that we knew we had client demand for and we actually acquired this technology from one of our closest services partners who had a very similar development model to ours that was really client driven so we re very excited about this it extends the capabilities of the intapp platform for the firms who are using us in the operations and finance area we ve had a long history of being very strong in the time recording ai supported time recording category and this moves us one step down the line toward the what they call the prebilling process which helps the professionals figure out how they re going to present bills to their clients and get paid so it s an expansion of an existing capability and it s very consistent with our land and expand concept steve robertson chief financial officer yeah and i would just add it s a relatively modest acquisition kevin in terms of size we are optimistic about it we baked into our thinking for our guidance the impacts in the near term from this but yeah it s positive and that down the road we would expect some good things from this combination kevin mcveigh credit suisse analyst thanks again and just great job thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question will come from the line of koji ikeda from bank of america your line is open koji ikeda bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey john hey steve thanks for taking the questions congrats on a nice finish to the year here wanted to ask a question on the guidance really and the confidence what s giving you that confidence in the guidance for fiscal 23 you know you did talk in the prepared remarks a lot of great data points on new logos expansion deals and even the momentum heading into fiscal 23 but given all the macro issues out there and the recession fears out there what is giving you that underlying confidence in your guidance you know not only from an absolute number but you essentially raised the growth rate to 20 at the midpoint steve robertson chief financial officer well i m happy to start john and maybe you could i mean koji look the business is it truly is strong across the board we do have some visibility out into the year in terms of our pipeline and the opportunities we re seeing in the field our yes everyone s had some concerns about recession and we understand but you know our business in particular there s certain parts of the equation in the world that really aren t a factor for us we feel you know we re not subject to oil shocks and logistics supply chains and our clients are doing pretty well and are really looking to adopt our solutions and put them in and make themselves better as a firm so we re just seeing good balanced opportunities across the board we certainly run scenarios in a lot of directions about what might happen and feel pretty good about this guidance we really do koji ikeda bank of america merrill lynch analyst great and then can john hall chairman and chief executive officer i would only add koji ikeda bank of america merrill lynch analyst oh yeah go ahead sorry john hall chairman and chief executive officer i would only add that we are looking at the possibility of inflation and recession effects on the business but we did grow through the 2008 2009 recession successfully as a bootstrapped business this end market is relatively durable and has weathered downturns in the past much better than many of the other industries so i think it s part of our general positioning toward the professional services industry that helps us in the situation we re going to watch it koji ikeda bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok got it thanks john and steve and just one follow up here thinking about services margin you know looks like subscription gross margin is still pretty strong at 80 plus but services a little bit of a drag on overall gross margins so how do we think about margins in the services business kind of going forward from here thanks guys steve robertson chief financial officer yeah actually koji i ll add to that question it is a very important focus for ours in the coming year we are going to those margins will get better as the year goes on we are very focused on that we ve talked for a while about having built a big organization and services that s capable of managing a much bigger book of business and to do so well and we feel we are now at that place and we expect to drive better margins consecutively all year long in the services business so that s a key focus for us john hall chairman and chief executive officer yeah koji ikeda bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thanks john and steve thank you so much steve robertson chief financial officer yeah operator one moment for our next question our next question will come from the line of matthew kikkert from stifel your line is open matthew kikkert stifel financial corp analyst hi this is matthew on for parker thanks a lot for taking my questions first off i want to continue talking about the really nice nrr increase that you saw the 4 basis point increase over the past year you know you mentioned upselling and cross selling as drivers there but are there any specific products applications or verticals that are also driving a majority of that expansion john hall chairman and chief executive officer thanks matthew steve robertson chief financial officer well i john did you want to john hall chairman and chief executive officer go ahead steve robertson chief financial officer yeah i was just going to say it actually is fairly balanced between let s say professional services and financial services and as you know we tend to land in a number of different places and then therefore expand in a number of different places i wouldn t i don t think i would call out anything in particular i think it is an aggregate my view is as an aggregate sense that the market sees our solutions as valuable and we you know land and people are ready to continue to buy and to add to their solution set with us it may be that our increasing cloud percentage of our business makes that a little bit easier and quicker to do which is positive but i wouldn t call out anything particular matthew kikkert stifel financial corp analyst ok great and then secondly i was wondering if the current macroeconomic conditions have impacted the pace of any cloud migrations for any of your clients or has it been pretty steady steve robertson chief financial officer the cloud migrations had been pretty steady typically we are doing them now often when a client is ready to buy some new cloud functionality a number of our clients for example might be what we call hybrid clients they have both some on premises and some cloud business they want to buy some more cloud business and that s the time at which it makes sense to migrate everything to the cloud but that s been pretty steady quarter after quarter in line with our expectations in the modeling and the discussions we ve had with everybody and we see that continuing matthew kikkert stifel financial corp analyst ok thanks for answering the questions and congratulations on the quarter steve robertson chief financial officer thanks john hall chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question come from the line of brian peterson from raymond james your line is open unknown speaker raymond james analyst hey guys this is chase on for brian congrats on the great quarter we ve seen a couple of banks out this week announcing that they re returning to office i was just curious kind of high level how you guys are thinking if there s any kind of impact on your end as banks start to get back to the office if they re looking to take on bigger projects or whether that s migrations or bigger upgrades expansions etc john hall chairman and chief executive officer yeah that s an interesting question we have started going back to the office more frequently ourselves and obviously some of the banks have asked their folks to come in five days a week i don t think we ve seen a ripple effect of that to the buying patterns so far i will say that the whole covid work from home change really adjusted folks expectations of how their technology environment needed to support them in a hybrid experience or even in a highly mobile experience and so a lot of the demand that we re getting is still coming from this mindset change that they had to get to the cloud and they had to get a modern infrastructure for their people because the chalk of working from home instantly a few years ago was just not satisfactory to a lot of the firms of all sizes across these industries and so i think that s helping us generally as a trend and we ll see what the total work from home shift to potentially going back to the office full time has but so far we ve seen very strong demand across the board regardless of whether people are in a hybrid model or asking people to go back all the way unknown speaker raymond james analyst got it makes sense and then just one follow up you mentioned building out the go to market motion in singapore in your prepared remarks i was curious how you re thinking about kind of the initial sales hiring target that you had to fiscal year thank you john hall chairman and chief executive officer so i don t think we re breaking out specific numbers there we have been in asia pacific over the past decade serving the market from sydney australia and that office has continued to grow and as we ve encountered more word of mouth and referrals which is the general way that our business has grown into some of the other parts of asia singapore was a natural place for us to expand to so we ve opened an office there and we ve put a group there we ve actually won some clients there before we opened our office so that s helped us and now we re going to serve part of asia pacific from that location and we ve got good demand across the region which is exciting for us unknown speaker raymond james analyst good to hear congrats on your quarter thanks guys steve robertson chief financial officer thanks operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of terry tillman from truist your line is open terry tillman truist securities analyst yeah can you all hear me steve robertson chief financial officer yes terry tillman truist securities analyst yeah hey john steve and david and congrats from me as well i have two questions first question is the cloud arr tremendous growth you re going to have to deal obviously with the law of larger numbers but anything you can share about just given what you ve got with your pipeline the market opportunities the expanded products how we should think about the cloud arr momentum continuing through the year and is there any seasonality and kind of related to cloud arr could that have a continued nice step up the 60 how to think about the step up from 60 and then i had a follow up after that i think that became a three part question steve robertson chief financial officer well i m happy to start the step up will continue regularly as we go forward we re selling all new cloud and those percentages from 60 will keep moving up regularly and then on top of that we re doing some modest migrations every quarter and every year as we ve discussed i don t think there s any meaningful seasonality i mean there s a little bit we have had a history of a little bit of seasonality in professional services as you may remember but generally speaking this should march pretty sequentially pretty regularly and yeah other than the law of large numbers as you say we don t see anything stopping the momentum we re having now in the cloud sales business so we would expect pretty good pretty reasonable continued progress there terry tillman truist securities analyst ok got it and you have two major kind of flagship product areas serving different markets but i mean i ve been impressed today to hear about some brand new things going on real estate investments and kind of just real asset markets and then potentially into this in house legal market can you kind of stack rank those two opportunities and just share with us maybe how needle moving they could be individually as it relates to cloud arr thank you john hall chairman and chief executive officer thanks terry we re excited about both of them on the real estate side historically the dealcloud business got started mainly in the private equity firms the classic private equity firms and over the years we ve moved up to some of the largest of those and when you get upmarket you enter a category of firm that s doing many different investing strategies of which private equity is just one and real estate is another adjacent and some of our largest clients asked us can you help us with real estate too and as we looked at it we discovered how similar the coverage model is and the whole industry specific data architecture that we have in the industry graph data model that we built into the system that really differentiates it from the traditional crms was perfect for supporting them with the real estate investing strategy as well so we had to change some of the data that we bring in we had to create some more capabilities to look at real estate specific information like geographic map information but we were able to do that and once we were able to serve some of these large multistrategy firms with a more well rounded whole solution we were able to enter the real estate investing category generally including the firms that invest specifically in real estate and don t have for example a private equity component to their business and it s a huge space in private capital so it s a growth area for the private model of asset management is just the way that private equity is a growth model versus traditional public markets and we have a fantastic system that serves that so we think there s going to be a lot of growth there for a long time private equity is still growing itself and there s more within that that we can build out going forward so we re very excited about that as an expansion for us and then in house legal we have a long history serving the law firms the large partnerships that are working on legal deals advising on deals and disputes and there s a circulation of professionals from the law firms to the in house legal departments and back over the careers of these folks and we ve had more and more referrals and demand from people who said oh i used intapp in my law firm can i use it here too and it turns out that s a very large section of the lawyers working in corporate deals in house and so that s a space where we re getting natural client led market expansion to a second adjacency and we re excited about both of them because they re good examples of this industry specific data architecture serving the professionals working in a whole range of areas and it s one of the reasons why we think that this sam and tam that we re chasing is actually quite a significant underserved industry where the professionals working on these deal types and the advisors advising on these deal types across the market have just been underserved over the years so we re optimistic about what we can do in each of those in addition to the markets that we started in terry tillman truist securities analyst that s great thanks for the color operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question will come from the line of brian schwartz from oppenheimer your line is open brian schwartz oppenheimer and company analyst yeah hi john and steve thank you for taking my questions this afternoon one for john and then one for steve john i was just wondering if you talk a little bit more about what you re seeing in the evolution of the pipeline specifically just curious if you re seeing the same cadence of the number of opportunities or projects that are entering the top of the funnel then say what you saw three months ago or even earlier this year and then the question for steve is just in regards to kind of the guidance as you thought about the guidance i was just wondering if you pushed it all for more pipeline coverage when you formulated your guidance given kind of the potential issues that could emerge given the macro conditions that we re facing here in the second half of the calendar year thanks john hall chairman and chief executive officer thanks brian so we re watching the pipeline carefully we have not seen an impact from macro change on the number of deals or sales cycles and it gives us some confidence that there s some strong fundamental demand here obviously everybody is watching the economy and we ll see what happens but so far specific to your question no we haven t

to 578 9 million led by sales gains in international operations and the impact of foreign exchange on the translation of international operations sales an increase in other sales in canadian operations which includes airline revenue financial services fuel and pharmacy and the impact of new stores were also factors excluding the foreign exchange impact consolidated sales increased 0 4 with food sales increasing 0 7 and general merchandise sales decreasing 14 9 compared to last year the impact of higher merchandise and freight cost inflation has continued to result in changes in product sales blend as consumers allocated more of their spending to food and reduced purchases of general merchandise on a same store basis sales decreased 4 1 1 compared to the second quarter last year with both food and general merchandise same store sales decreasing 1 3 and 18 8 respectively the decrease in same store sales is primarily due to the impact of covid 19 related factors including government income support payments and higher in community spending as a result of travel restrictions which contributed to sales gains in 2021 in 2022 covid 19 related income support payments have substantially been phased out and travel restrictions have largely been eliminated although same store sales this year have decreased compared to strong covid 19 related sales gains over the past two years they were up 16 3 compared to pre covid levels in 2019 with food same store sales up 16 2 and general merchandise same store sales up 17 1 gross profit gross profit decreased 3 0 as the impact of higher sales was more than offset by a 177 basis point decrease in gross profit rate compared to last year the decrease in gross profit rate was mainly due to changes in sales blend the impact of higher freight and merchandise cost inflation that was not fully passed through in retail prices and an increase in markdowns on seasonal general merchandise selling operating and administrative expenses selling operating and administrative expenses expenses increased 6 7 million or 5 1 compared to last year and were up 61 basis points as a percentage to sales the increase in expenses is mainly due to cost inflation impacts including higher fuel based utility expenses and the impact of new stores these factors were partially offset by lower annual incentive plan expenses share based

gaap financial measures the company uses the following non gaap financial measures earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings the company believes these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to both management and investors in measuring the financial performance and financial condition of the company for the reasons outlined below earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is not a recognized measure under ifrs management believes that in addition to net earnings ebitda is a useful supplemental measure as it provides investors with an indication of the company s operational performance before allocating the cost of interest income taxes and capital investments investors should be cautioned however that ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to net earnings determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of the company s performance the company s method of calculating ebitda may differ from other companies and may not be comparable to measures used by other companies adjusted ebitda and adjusted net earnings are not recognized measures under ifrs management uses these non gaap financial measures to exclude the impact of certain income and expenses that must be recognized under ifrs the excluded amounts are either subject to volatility in the company s share price or may not necessarily be reflective of the company s underlying operating performance these factors can make comparisons of the company s financial performance between periods more difficult the company may exclude additional items if it believes that doing so will result in a more effective analysis and explanation of the underlying financial performance the exclusion of these items does not imply that they are non recurring these measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other publicly traded companies and should not be construed as an alternative to the other financial measures determined in accordance with ifrs reconciliation of consolidated earnings

abhijit bhattacharyya author and columnist this was the second full day without food we were all suffering from dehydration didn t know how much longer the men and i could go without nourishment as we had already been without food for 60 hours i glanced at my watch it s exactly 9 22 am monday 22nd october 1962 i was prisoner of chinese people s liberation army at this time i was without food for 66 hours exhausted hungry unshaven despondent himalayan blunder page 390 brigadier john p dalvi that s what happens to sovereign nation s fighters without food owing to the criminal negligence of the state machinery to supply provisions from the benign base to the burning border of the himalayan highland china inflicted a one month long humiliating military blow thereby ruthlessly exposing the food crisis in the kitchen of the frontier fighters which compelled the hungry warriors to experience the prison of the foe clearly wars invariably create a food crisis both in the frontier and farmhouse fortunately however global wars have always been at a distance unlike the one in 1962 which was fought within india s own territory nevertheless world war ii still stands as the most destructive and catastrophic famine for eastern india before the 1962 starving of the indian soldiers there took place 150 years ago in 1812 another savage slaughter of the hungry and starving soldiers of the napoleonic regiment owing to a food shortage caused by a monumental logistics failure signalling the fall of the mighty parisians at the hands of romanov czar s unsung and under rated humans and their horses which kept the logistics line alive hence the firing fusillade by the emaciated french fighters was of no use except facing an inevitable rout as their stomach was without food the 1812 french disaster was a historical inevitability contextually today s russia ukraine conflict too has created an unprecedented global panic pertaining to food production consumption and distribution from tokyo to chicago delhi to dhaka canada to argentina every major grain producing country is worried despite being far from the war zone indeed what potentially compounds the complications of combat is its unpredictable duration and endurance despite the six month bloodshed there s no sign of any peace far from it the increased flow of lethal weapons from the west to the armoury of ukraine and the resultant russian retaliation make the peace prospect a mirage nevertheless a realisation is dawning that it s got to be a food world beyond a fighting world first and foremost thus delhi s neighbour dhaka despite being the world s third biggest rice producer 3 60 crore tonnes annually is finalising deals with india and vietnam to import 3 30 000 tonnes to replenish its reserves and cool the soaring domestic prices owing to the war effects india is today the second ranked rice 12 crore tonnes and third biggest wheat 10 04 crore tonnes producer and also an exporter thereof yet alarm bells ring as her current rice production is under threat from a weak monsoon in the two major growing areas of bengal and uttar pradesh which account for a quarter of the national output the indian government therefore has to tread a thin line balancing between the domestic price rise profitable export mart and tight supply line as plantings have reportedly declined by eight per cent in the usa too the government is prodding farmers to plant two crops double cropping instead of one being the fifth biggest wheat producer 5 5 crore tonnes and exporter the europe war worried a helpless washington as wheat remained stuck in the blockaded ports thereby disrupting the distribution consumer axis across the globe in fact double cropping would be the way for the usa to play a bigger role in the world grain market with a larger share of export to hitherto untapped consumers who were used to the asian and european products the ukraine war has thus opened profitable ways for the grain to new buyers from surplus wheat producers ukraine down has meant the usa up for japan however food has always been an area of concern owing to its island geography the concern aggravates when the war is long drawn and protracted thus japan despite being the ninth biggest rice producer 77 lakh tonnes of the world remains an importer the remote russia ukraine conflict spooked japan into boosting its defence spending but the proximate taiwan strait tension is the real security challenge with shrivelling rice paddies what s ominous is the alleged abandonment of rice paddies agricultural land leaving the country more vulnerable than ever retired vice admiral toshiyuki ito is angry they don t do anything for national security they think only about economic efficiency how pointed and piercing is that agriculture relegated in the overall scheme of things by a vulnerable island nation which hugely depends on import through the sea japan s suffering is bound to be colossal in case of a major blockade or disruption to the sea lanes around the china taiwan strait the japanese have learnt the importance of self sufficiency through the ukraine situation we ve realised that what you can do domestically you should you have to produce as much as you can at home including fertilisers and seeds in fact gone are the days of the japanese being the sole unchallenged navy of asia to protect its sea lanes today any direct involvement in a war will only make the food situation dire not only for japan but all as most nations aren t self sufficient in food production indeed farmer fertiliser food and famine collectively constitute the biggest takeaway from the russia ukraine conflict not fire power or bombs missiles or long range artillery guns thus the fallout is so alarming that even canada the world s sixth biggest wheat producer 3 46 crore tonnes is going all out to produce more than expected the basics are simple produce more expand storage to face long term crisis in the food supply and distribution system feed own people first then help the needy neighbours because well fed people cannot remain in peace with a starving neighbour breathing down their neck for the minimum calories for sustenance distress spill over is inevitable coming back to india there s no doubt that food self sufficiency is one marvellous achievement attained by the farmers and supported by successive rulers from the 1960s notwithstanding several fault lines resulting in agrarian distressed suicides and poor debt reduction mechanism nevertheless just as the japanese are reacting about agriculture and food being ignored for the sake of non agriculture economic efficiency india must remember that feeding 1 3 billion heads is her foremost duty and responsibility neither a glitzy metro building nor an increased number of stock market multi billionaires can assume the role of a rescuer in case food and agriculture distress lead to en masse hunger resulting in famine born out of a war in a distant land the signs are ominous eternal vigilance and agility are the need of the critical times because to a man with an empty stomach food is god as gandhiji rightly said

of late i ve heard from listeners with curious treatments antidotes and balms the latest magic bullet comes courtesy of gouvena who swears by hanging pennies in a bag of water to keep flies away she has a good point as according to wideopencountry com this natural fly remedy is widely used by restaurants in the south especially at back entrances where the door is kept wide open for long periods of time during weekly stock deliveries our listener insists it works although snopes com says otherwise i can t say either way because i haven t tried it yet but it s worth putting it to the test get our free mobile app gouvena instructed me to take a gallon sized zip top plastic bag fill it halfway to three quarters with water and drop four or five pennies in it once the bag is firmly sealed she said it can be tied and hung from an eave near the door it s not known exactly why this deterrent works but the tennessee farm bureau speculates it has to do with the workings of the fly s complex eyes that are made up of thousands of individual lenses that are ultra sensitive to any changes in light so when light hits the bag of water with the shiny pennies or pieces of aluminum foil it refracts and disturbs the eyes becomes overwhelmed by it and flies away somewhere else if you re looking for a non toxic and very affordable fly solution try it but wait another listener called to say forget the bag of water with pennies and instead hang irish spring soap in a mesh and that will make flies flee
