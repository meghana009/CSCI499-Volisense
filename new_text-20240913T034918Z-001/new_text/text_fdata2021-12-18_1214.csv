the economic dream team meet the firm of raines rubin daley and bowles ex investment bankers and lawyers form clinton s economic team surprise it s pro wall street by george j church december 23 a bunch of investment bankers and lawyers friendly to the stock market heavily focused on balancing the federal budget sounds like the kind of firm whose ideas of government traditional democrats would instinctively distrust but raines rubin daley bowles is only metaphorically a wall street firm in fact it is the team chosen by bill clinton to shape economic policy in his second term the firm er team is still adding partners er members robert rubin of course is thoroughly entrenched as treasury secretary and a kind of managing partner erskine bowles left his north carolina investment firm to become white house chief of staff immediately after the election last week clinton formally added franklin raines a former partner at lazard freres co by announcing that he would keep raines as head of the office of management and budget a job raines got in september daley son of the famous chicago mayor who as a lawyer might be thought of as counsel for the firm was named secretary of commerce gene sperling another lawyer became in effect the junior partner of the firm when he was named head of the national economic council sperling nicknamed gene the machine is more noted for his ability to grind out thorough policy option papers than for being a brilliant academic economist so while on paper the nec is supposed to be an economic counterpart to the national security council under sperling it is unlikely to have as much clout as it did when rubin ran it before moving to treasury if the appointments proved anything it was that clinton does not need dick morris to stick to a centrist course the administration s most noted liberals like labor secretary robert reich and housing and urban development secretary henry cisneros are leaving cisneros swan song was a blast at raines omb for proposing too deep a cut in low cost housing subsidies in contrast the new men are don t rock the boat appointments and they are exactly what wall street wants says david jones senior economist at aubrey g lanston which really is an investment banking firm certainly the president gave that impression when he announced the economic appointments and some others the most interesting janet reno will after all stay on as attorney general clinton praised the vibrant stock market as increasing not only the wealth of the rich but also the retirement savings of the middle class and he even offered a tepid endorsement of a capital gains tax cut an issue that has long roused almost religious passion among conservative republicans for and liberal democrats against the president calmly implied he just might accept one as part of a balanced budget deal the principal burden of negotiating such a deal has fallen to raines he holds perhaps the highest economic policy post ever achieved by an african american hardly anyone ever speaks of diversity when talking about him though he is accepted as simply a sharp intellect rhodes scholar harvard law vice chairman of the mortgage finance institution fannie mae and a classic american success story last year when asked to join the board of boeing he recalled that his mother once cleaned the company s seattle offices in the budget negotiations raines a few days after the election naively tried to talk g o p congressional leaders into joining the administration in a united budget proposal he lost of course but proved his resolute bipartisanship reported by michael duffy j f o mcallister karen tumulty and adam zagorin washington more time this week

proposed regulations promulgated on december 8 2021 by the financial crimes enforcement network fincen a bureau of the department of the treasury bring the beneficial ownership reporting rules of the corporate transparency act1 the cta one step closer to life though only proposed and not effective until a date to be specified in the final regulations these rules represent a meaningful step in the fight against money laundering tax fraud terrorism and other national security risks fincen s action also responds to decades long criticism from the financial action task force an intergovernmental body comprised of 37 members including the united states that the united states has been dilatory and deficient in its duty to promote the transparency in legal entity ownership believed to be necessary to counter such unlawful conduct upon finalization and entry into effect of these regulations countless corporations limited liability companies and certain other entities will have to report detailed information regarding their beneficial owners and incorporation agents to fincen and will have an ongoing obligation to keep the agency abreast of changes the broad and sweeping rules the cta sets out to create a consolidated repository of beneficial ownership information to among other things better enable critical national security intelligence and law enforcement efforts to counter money laundering the financing of terrorism and other illicit activity 2 the proposed regulations implement congress s instructions for building and maintaining a beneficial ownership repository to close the information gap the database will be populated by requiring certain entities to report pertinent information to fincen who must report many entities will be subject to the reporting obligations any domestic or foreign reporting company broadly defined must file a report with fincen in the form and manner to be prescribed in forthcoming forms and instructions a domestic reporting company is a corporation limited liability company or other entity that is created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any other similar office under the law of a state or indian tribe fincen believes this definition likely includes various types of partnerships lps llps lllps and business trusts a foreign reporting company is a corporation limited liability company or other entity formed under the law of a foreign country and registered to do business in any state or tribal jurisdiction by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or any similar office many entities will be subject to the reporting obligations any domestic or foreign reporting company broadly defined must file a report with fincen in the form and manner to be prescribed in forthcoming forms and instructions while a non business non statutory trust would generally fall outside the reporting company definition information regarding a trust its grantor and its beneficiaries may nevertheless end up on a report if the trust owns a reporting company as described below the rules adopt the cta s list of twenty three types of entities that are to be exempt from reporting with clarification where necessary in doing so fincen commented that many of these entities are already subject to substantial federal or state regulation under which their beneficial ownership may be known e g banks credit unions securities act of 1934 entities tax exempt organizations of note large operating companies i e entities employing more than 20 full time employees in the united states reporting more than 5 million in gross receipts on its prior year s federal tax return and having an operating presence at a physical office in the united states are exempt small and medium sized businesses with similar indicia of no malintent in using the corporate form however must bear the reporting obligations as proposed an exempt entity does not need to file its claim of exemption with fincen but if a reporting entity later becomes an exempt entity the change must be reported what must be reported reports will require information regarding three sets of persons the reporting entity itself e g full name dba names business address formation jurisdiction irs tin or alternative identifier each beneficial owner e g full legal name date of birth residential address unique identifying number such as a passport or driver s license number and an image of the document containing the identifying number and each company applicant e g same information as for beneficial owner with substitution of business for residential address reports will require information regarding three sets of persons a beneficial owner is an individual who directly or indirectly 1 exercises substantial control over the reporting entity or 2 owns or controls at least 25 of the ownership interests of such reporting company substantial control ranges from providing service as a senior officer to having authority over appointment of senior officers to making decisions or exercising substantial influence over important matters ownership interests range from equity or stock to profits interest to certain convertible interests to certain puts calls straddles or other options or privileges of buying any of the enumerated interests the rules for determining beneficial ownership are detailed but clearly intend to pick up a great number of individuals potentially involved with the reporting entity a company applicant is any individual who for a domestic reporting company files or directs or controls the filing of creation documents and for a foreign reporting company files or directs or controls the filing of doing business registration documents the proposed rules provide that a reporting entity need not report any minor children any indirect beneficial owners if their ownership flows through an exempt entity instead the exempt entity would just be listed and deceased company applicants rather than provide required personal information to a reporting company beneficial owners and company applicants can instead provide the information directly to fincen fincen will then issue a fincen identifier number to the individual any reporting company required to list the individual can simply report the individual s fincen identifier instead of their personal information the fincen identifier may prove particularly popular with service providers that get swept up in the company applicant category and would prefer not to share certain personal information e g a passport copy with the reporting company timing of reporting reporting will have tight deadlines and be ongoing pre existing domestic or foreign reporting companies will have 1 year from the effective date of the final rules to be determined to file an initial report with fincen new entities will have 14 calendar days from qualifying as a domestic or foreign reporting company to file an initial report with fincen the quick turnaround for new entities is aimed at making beneficial ownership reporting a standard step in the business incorporation and or doing business registration processes any change to information previously reported must be updated within 30 calendar days of the change transitioning from a reporting company to an exempt company constitutes a reportable change when a beneficial owner dies a change is not considered to occur until the estate is settled any inaccurate information previously reported must be corrected within 14 days of becoming aware or having reason to know of the inaccuracy penalties hefty civil and criminal penalties up to 500 day while the violation continues and up to 10 000 and or up to 2 years imprisonment respectively apply to willful failures to report and willful provision of false or fraudulent information the proposed rules aim to clarify not to mention emphasize that in addition to reporting companies individuals including beneficial owners and company applicants may be subject to penalty if they provide false or fraudulent information to the reporting company it remains unclear whether such individuals have an affirmative obligation to reach out to reporting companies to provide information and make sure the report is filed a safe harbor exists for voluntary corrections of reports within 90 days of filing accessing the forthcoming wealth of information congress entrusted fincen with the management and maintenance of the repository of information gathered pursuant to the cta which must be retained for at least 5 years after the termination of a reporting company fincen may disclose beneficial ownership information to the following persons for limited specified uses upon request through appropriate yet to be determined protocols federal agencies engaged in national security intelligence or law enforcement activity for use in furtherance of such activity financial institutions subject to customer due diligence requirements with the consent of the reporting company and to facilitate the required due diligence federal functional regulators or other appropriate regulatory agencies to assess a financial institution s compliance with requirements and foreign law enforcement agencies prosecutors or judges when requested through a federal agency and required to comply with a treaty e g an income tax treaty or tax information exchange agreement or limited to use in an authorized investigation or national security or intelligence activity requests may be rejected in circumstances outlined in the statute which broadly include other good cause beneficial ownership information will also be accessible for inspection or disclosure to officers and employees of the department of the treasury presumably including the internal revenue service whose official duties require it civil and criminal penalties similar to those applicable to unauthorized use and disclosure of tax return information apply to employees or officers of the requesting agency for violation of protocols and misuse of information just the beginning but forward motion and no turning back while the proposed regulations must go through a comment period before finalization entities beneficial owners and company applicants alike should use this time productively to gain an understanding of their future obligations gathering information and educating individuals for whom personal information must be reported will surely be resource and time intensive there s also no sign of fincen slowing down extensive comments have been requested and must be submitted by february 7 2022 regulation packages implementing protocols for access to and disclosure of beneficial ownership information and revising the existing customer due diligence rule are forthcoming arguably the biggest remaining question is the effective date of the reporting requirements fincen has requested views on timing and potential factors to be considered but is steadfast in its commitment to identify the earliest possible effective date after publication of the final rules

was granted priority review a designation given to applications for medicines that offer significant advantages over available options by demonstrating safety or efficacy improvements preventing serious conditions or enhancing patient compliance 14 tezspire is under regulatory review in the eu japan and several other countries around the world notes severe asthma asthma is a heterogeneous disease affecting an estimated 339 million people worldwide 15 16 approximately 10 of asthma patients have severe asthma 16 17 despite the use of inhaled asthma controller medicine currently available biologic therapies and oral corticosteroids ocs many severe asthma patients remain uncontrolled 16 18 due to the complexity of severe asthma many patients have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine 17 20 severe uncontrolled asthma is debilitating with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life 16 17 21 patients with severe asthma are at an increased risk of mortality and compared to patients with persistent asthma have twice the risk of asthma related hospitalisations 22 24 there is also a significant socio economic burden with these patients accounting for approximately 50 of asthma related costs 25 clinical trials in addition to the phase iib pathway trial the pathfinder programme included two phase iii trials navigator2 26 and source 27 28 the programme also includes additional mechanistic and long term safety trials 29 30 navigator is a phase iii randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial in adults 18 80 years old and adolescents 12 17 years old with severe uncontrolled asthma who were receiving standard of care soc soc was treatment with medium or high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus at least one additional controller medication with or without daily ocs treatment the trial population included approximately equal proportions of patients with high 300 cells per microlitre and low 2 the primary efficacy endpoint was the annualised asthma exacerbation rate aaer during the 52 week treatment period key secondary endpoints included the effect of tezspire on lung function asthma control and health related quality of life 2 as part of prespecified analyses the aaer over 52 weeks was also assessed in patients grouped by baseline blood eosinophil count feno level and serum specific immunoglobin e ige status perennial aeroallergen sensitivity positive or negative 2 these are inflammatory biomarkers used by clinicians to inform treatment options and involve tests analysing a patient s blood eosinophils ige and exhaled air feno there were no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezspire and placebo groups in the navigator trial 2 the most frequently reported adverse events for tezspire were nasopharyngitis upper respiratory tract infection and headache 2 navigator is the first phase iii trial to show benefit in severe asthma irrespective of eosinophils by targeting tslp 2 these results support the fda breakthrough therapy designation granted to tezspire in september 2018 for patients with severe asthma without an eosinophilic phenotype in july 2021 tezspire was the first and only biologic to be granted priority review in the us for the treatment of asthma by the fda patients who participated in our phase iii trials were eligible to continue in destination a phase iii extension trial assessing long term safety and efficacy 29 tezspire tezspire tezepelumab is being developed by astrazeneca in collaboration with amgen as a potential first in class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of tslp a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma including airway hyperresponsiveness 3 4 tslp is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations including allergens viruses and other airborne particles 3 4 expression of tslp is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity 3 5 blocking tslp may prevent the release of pro inflammatory cytokines by immune cells resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control 2 3 5 tezspire acts at the top of the inflammation cascade and has the potential to help address a broad population of severe asthma patients irrespective of biomarker levels 2 3 tezspire is also in development for other potential indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps chronic spontaneous urticaria and eosinophilic esophagitis eoe in october 2021 tezepelumab was granted orphan drug designation by the fda for the

san jose calif ap the jury that will weigh 11 charges of fraud and conspiracy against former theranos ceo elizabeth holmes finally got the case friday afternoon after a three month trial that captivated silicon valley the hand off came after lawyers for the opposing sides wrapped up a second day of painstaking final arguments to sum up their respective interpretations of the evidence submitted to the jury that included the testimony of 32 witnesses including holmes herself and more than 900 exhibits the eight men and four women on the jury began their deliberations late on friday and will take the weekend off before resuming monday morning to decide whether holmes turned her blood testing startup into a massive scam if convicted on all counts holmes 37 could face up to 20 years in prison in his final attempt to persuade the jury to acquit holmes lawyer kevin downey likened her final days running a then reeling theranos to a captain valiantly trying to save a sinking ship had holmes committed any crimes she would have been scurrying to jump overboard like a scared rat downey told jurors as he wrapped up roughly five hours of closing arguments federal prosecutors spent three hours thursday explaining why the jury should convict her referring to a 2016 turning point that threatened to ruin theranos downey asked the jury did she leave no she stayed why because she believed in this technology as he did thursday downey again depicted holmes as a well meaning entrepreneur who never stopped trying to perfect theranos blood testing technology and use it to improve health care she believed she was building a technology that would change the world downey proclaimed friday federal prosecutor john bostic offered a rebuttal arguing that holmes made her attempts to salvage theranos under intense scrutiny that gave her few other options he cited evidence to argue that she consistently sought to deceive people whenever she thought she could get away with her alleged ruse at so many forks in the road she chose the wrong path bostic said bostic s rebuttal echoed many of the themes touched upon in thursday s arguments when fellow prosecutor jeffrey schenk cast holmes as a charlatan who brazenly lied to become rich and famous those purported goals were achieved in 2014 when holmes became a media sensation with an estimated fortune of 4 5 billion based on her 50 stake in theranos the trial revolves around allegations that holmes duped investors business partners and patients about theranos technology she repeatedly claimed that the company s new testing device could scan for hundreds of diseases and other problems with a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick instead of a needle stuck in a vein the concept was so compelling that theranos and holmes were able to raise more than 900 million some of that from billionaire investors such as media magnate rupert murdoch and software titan larry ellison the palo alto california company also negotiated potentially lucrative deals with major retailers walgreens and safeway holmes soon began to grace national magazine covers as a wunderkind unknown to most people outside theranos the company s blood testing technology was flawed often producing inaccurate results that could have endangered the lives of patients who took the tests after the flaws were exposed in 2015 and 2016 theranos eventually collapsed the justice department filed its criminal case in 2018 people lost money downey acknowledged friday that is a bad event and a failure on holmes part but he added none of it was criminal downey told the jury that holmes didn t realize the scope of the problems until a theranos laboratory director informed her in march 2016 that the company had to invalidate 60 000 of its past blood tests had holmes thought any crimes been committed downey posited she would have tried to cover them up and perhaps sell some of her stock not only did she never sell a share downey said she continued to try to salvage the company her turnaround efforts included ousting theranos chief operating officer sunny balwani who also had been her lover in a dramatic turn on the witness stand last month holmes testified that balwani had been covertly controlling her diet her friendships and more while subjecting her to mental emotional and sexual abuse although the testimony cast holmes as balwani s pawn downey never mentioned the alleged abuse and its effects on holmes during his closing arguments the jury has been left to consider whether partner abuse may have affected some of her decisions at theranos in the prosecution s closing argument schenk reminded the jurors that finding holmes guilty of fraud won t mean they discounted her abuse allegations bostic revisited the issue friday telling the jurors they shouldn t allow sympathy to sway their decision on the fraud charges there is an extensive record for the charges of fraud in this case he said there is much less evidence of what happened between miss holmes and mr balwani balwani s lawyer adamantly denied holmes accusations in court documents that the jury never saw jurors also never heard from balwani who intended to invoke his fifth amendment right against self incrimination had been called to testify balwani 56 faces similar fraud charges in a separate trial scheduled to begin in february

the following questions were asked recently on the wonderline q a few years ago the york news times made a hard cover book about the history of york county do you know where i can get a copy or even maybe a few i want to buy some for christmas presents a the books are still in stock and available at the york news times offices q where did the term of amber alert come from a amber alerts are issued when a child is missing and or thought to be abducted and in danger amber alerts are designed to call the public s attention to a child who has been abducted and is at risk at being harmed information about the child is broadcast throughout the area via news media on the internet and by other means such as highway billboards and signs amber is a backronym for america s missing broadcast emergency response the alert was named after amber hagerman a nine year old girl who was abducted and murdered in arlington texas in 1996 q where did the idea of santa s helpers being elves come from a a number of sources say the origin of elves is rooted in germanic scandanavian and british folklores in the past many believed these tiny beings possessed magical powers to protect the homes of people who were good from bad things and as for the bad people elves dealt with them by playing pranks on them then there was the 1823 poem a visit from st nicholas most commonly known as twas the night before christmas in which santa himself was described he was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf the a book called the house of santa claus a christmas fairy show by austin thompson was published in 1876 which also played an instrumental role in further popularizing the image of santa s elves to the world as the theory of santa became more and more a part of holiday culture so did the theory of his helpers the elves q has the new year always been celebrated in january and have there always been new year s celebrations a the earliest recording of a new year celebration is believed to have been in mesopotamia in 2000 b c and was celebrated around the time of the vernal equinox in mid march a variety of other dates tied to the seasons were also used by various ancient cultures the egyptians phoenicians and persians began their new year with the fall equinox and the greeks celebrated it on the winter solstice the early roman calendar designated march 1 as the new year the calendar had just 10 months beginning with march the first time the new year was celebrated on jan 1 was in rome in 153 bc the new year was moved from march to january because that was the beginning of the civil year in 46 bc julius caesar introduced a new solar based calendar that was a vast improvement on the ancient roman calendar which was a lunar system that had become wildly inaccurate over the years the julian calendar decreed that the new year would occur with jan 1 and it became the consistently observed start of the new year q who invented the candy cane and what does it have to do with christmas a the christmas candy cane originated in germany about 250 years ago they started as straight white sugar sticks the story goes that a choir master in 1670 was worried about the children sitting quietly all through the long christmas nativity service so he gave them something to eat to keep them quite he made them into a j shape like a shepherd s crook to remind them of the shepherds that visited the baby jesus at the first christmas sometime around 1900 the red stripes were added and they were flavored with peppermint or wintergreen around 1920 bob mccormack from georgia started making candy canes for his friends and family that s when it became a retail product q why do people decorate sugar cookies for christmas a modern christmas cookies can trace their history to recipes from medieval european biscuits by the 16th century christmas biscuits had become popular across europe the earliest examples of christmas cookies in the united states were brought by the dutch in the early 17th century due to a wide range of cheap imported products from germany between 1871 and 1906 cookie cutters became available in american markets these imported cookie cutters often depicted highly styled images with subjects designed to hang on christmas trees due to the availability of the cutters recipes began to appear in cookbooks designed for their use in the early 20th century u s merchants started importing decorated cookies from germany to be used as presents
elizabeth holmes the founder of theranos leaving court on thursday ms holmes is on trial for fleecing investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars and misleading patients and doctors san jose calif for more than three months the defendant has donned a medical mask clutched arms with her mother and entered the robert f peckham federal building in san jose calif where executives scientists and investors have accused her of fraud now a jury of strangers will decide on her guilt a jury of eight men and four women were handed the case late friday of elizabeth holmes the founder of the blood testing start up theranos lawyers for both sides finished their closing arguments earlier in the day in the nearly four month long trial and judge edward j davila of u s district court for the northern district of california read detailed instructions to the jury jurors will meet to deliberate on monday morning in the courtroom on friday morning kevin downey a lawyer for ms holmes spent nearly three hours attempting to discredit each of the government s witnesses and raise doubt in jurors minds as he flipped through slides meant to dismantle the prosecution s evidence with headings including not every potential issue is an actual issue a few jurors scribbled notes mr downey concluded by saying ms holmes was not a criminal she believed she was building a technology that would change the world he said raising his voice and gesturing dramatically ms holmes faces 11 charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud for claims she made to investors and patients about theranos s technology and business dealings she has pleaded not guilty if convicted she faces up to 20 years in prison the trial which has alternated between media spectacle and business school cautionary tale has come to represent a moment of truth in silicon valley where executives have rarely faced consequences for their inflated claims if ms holmes is found guilty prosecutors could begin to more aggressively dig into the wildly optimistic tales of rocket ship growth at more start ups even if she is acquitted some executives may still tread more carefully in their optimistic pitches start ups have been riding a wave of investor exuberance for nearly a decade despite repeated warnings of bubble like behavior that could lead to more disasters like theranos i would suspect that c e o s of similar companies will be more careful when they talk said andrey spektor a lawyer at bryan cave leighton paisner and a former federal prosecutor in new york s eastern district he said recordings of ms holmes pitching her company to investors and on tv were among the most incriminating evidence in the case prosecutors used dozens of witnesses and hundreds of documents to argue that ms holmes 37 knowingly lied to investors about theranos she said the company had military contracts when it did not that its technology was comprehensively validated by pharmaceutical companies when it had not been and that its machines could do hundreds of tests when it could only do a dozen on thursday jeff schenk an assistant u s attorney and one of the lead prosecutors summarized the government s case simply when theranos was almost out of money ms holmes could have let it fail but she chose to defraud investors instead he said that choice was not only callous it was criminal mr schenk said ms holmes s lawyers countered with a range of responses she had been told by her colleagues that the technology worked she had hid information to protect trade secrets she had moved to fix the problems once she learned of them and the broader narrative about theranos was more complicated than the prosecution had made it seem the government is showing an event that looks bad but at the end of the day when all the evidence flows together it isn t so bad said mr downey he showed slides illustrating the steep burden of the government to prove beyond reasonable doubt that ms holmes had knowingly lied to get money ms holmes s defense primarily relied on her own testimony which lasted seven days and upended the narrative of the case it was the first time that ms holmes had told her version of the events leading to theranos s collapse which has been widely documented in podcasts books documentaries and news reports on the stand ms holmes painted herself as a hardworking and ambitious entrepreneur who believed in her company s technology and potential any exaggerations or misleading statements were merely her projecting grand plans for the future she implied she further said ramesh balwani her former longtime boyfriend and business partner who is known as sunny had berated her and controlled every aspect of her life she also accused him of sexual abuse which he has denied their relationship had been kept a secret at the time but in court every aspect of the relationship text messages emails conversations infidelities and the limited liability company through which they owned a home was picked apart prosecutors dug in to try to show the pair conspired to commit fraud ms holmes s lawyers tried to show she was a victim it is rare for defendants in white collar criminal trials to take the stand and it is even rarer for them to introduce testimony of abuse ms holmes s lawyers were expected to call an expert witness to tie her claims of intimate partner abuse to the alleged fraud but they did not on friday john bostic a prosecutor elaborated on statements made by mr schenk the day before about the abuse allegations telling the jury they did not need to come to any conclusion about ms holmes and mr balwani s relationship to issue a verdict he also attempted to separate the abuse from the fraud charges there is no evidence regarding a link between what their relationship was like and the conduct she is charged with committing he said ms holmes s testimony added to the spectacle of the trial drawing large crowds of onlookers who often waited more than five hours outside the courtroom for one of its limited seats one man yelled that ms holmes was a girl boss as she entered the building and a trio of attendees pretended to sell black turtlenecks ms holmes s business uniform during theranos s rise as part of a performance art piece on friday mr downey closed his argument by saying that ms holmes did not intentionally defraud anyone when theranos got into trouble he said ms holmes did not try to cover up cash out or flee like a criminal would she went down with that ship he said mr bostic rebutted mr downey by reiterating the government s argument against ms holmes the disease that plagued theranos wasn t a lack of effort he said it was a lack of honesty

kelly kawachi is inspiring coloradans to support the local agricultural community one flavorful salami or tender wagyu steak at a time kawachi who was promoted from apprentice to head butcher at boulder s blackbelly in march works with chef owner hosea rosenberg to oversee the whole animal butchery and charcuterie program at the restaurant and market there she educates customers about the value of buying goods from local meat merchants that source responsibly raised livestock from ranches like longmont s buckner family ranch parker s bootheel 7 ranch and brush s mcdonald family farm i wish more people understood what it truly means to buy from butcher shops like ours that support smaller ranchers kawachi says we are aware that it s more expensive than the average grocery store but if you prioritize what you put in your body then the reason why is a worthwhile one you are going to get much higher quality and an extremely local product that makes a difference for so many reasons from health to environmental kawachi a native of oahu in the hawaiian islands joined the blackbelly team in 2016 when rosenberg expanded his then two year old farm to table restaurant to include an adjacent butcher shop and fast casual breakfast and lunch spot since then kawachi has mastered the art of breaking down whole animals using european style seam cutting techniques methods that honor the contours of the animal s muscles with cuts along its seams to yield minimal waste and produce better cuts she has also honed her charcuterie making skills and produces delicious creations like chile and garlic spiked chorizo three month cured pork shoulder coppa and pork terrine studded with olives and piquillo peppers in spring summer 2022 patrons will be able to enjoy more meaty fare from blackbelly which will expand its butcher shop under kawachi s leadership the new market will also include a larger space with more seating and additional menu offerings while details aren t finalized yet the larger footprint will allow for a larger retail section more prepared foods like soups stews stocks and salads house made breads pastries and other baked goods espresso drinks and small shareable charcuterie plates expanded hours will include weekends and possibly evenings in addition to the current breakfast and lunchtime service in the meantime kawachi is excited for patrons to try the comforting dishes on the recently launched winter market menu such as meatball subs and hot bologna sandwiches stuffed with cheddar and potato chips also look for weekly specials like andouille po boys and cassoulet stew and a larger selection of salami and sliced deli meats here kawachi sounds off on what she wishes customers understood about butchery the best cuts to order and the one food she can t live without 5280 what was it like growing up in hawaii how did that upbringing influence the dishes you like to prepare now kelly kawachi it is a beautiful place to live and has such a laid back island culture with a huge emphasis on family but i definitely took it for granted until i moved to the mainland for college and soon realized the uniqueness of my upbringing due to the immigration that occurred during hawaii s plantation days the island has become such a melting pot for asian cuisine being exposed to that and traditional hawaiian food has influenced what flavors i seek out and the ingredients i prefer to use are there any misconceptions you d like to clear up about butchery we often hear complaints about the limited amount of each of the cuts that we have in stock if people were more familiar with how many of each cut one animal yields then there would be a better understanding of the quantity available so we hope to help guests feel more comfortable with lesser known yet extremely delicious cuts we suggest that customers discuss the cooking method they want to apply instead of the cut they had their minds set on this lets us guide them to a similar cut that would be as equally as tasty while introducing them to something they may never have tried before what lesser known cuts do you recommend if someone has their minds set on a top sirloin steak a culotte otherwise known as picanha would be just fine if not better in flavor or instead of a ribeye try a delmonico one that we get a lot is people wanting a tenderloin for its tenderness however a bistro filet a little muscle off the shoulder is just as tender and has a lot more flavor lastly flanks bavettes and skirts will all be similar in muscle structure and quite interchangeable cooking wise they do differ slightly in thickness and tenderness but will do the job pretty much the same especially if you are making fajitas or a stir fry what is a food item you just can t live without rice i can t help it i m half japanese if you could cook for three people living or dead who would they be what would you make there is only one person i wish i could cook for and that would be my dad he passed last year and he absolutely loved food i would give anything to cook him a 7x wagyu steak that we sell in our shop either a delmonico or a denver steak he would ve loved to try those cuts especially our wagyu beef 1606 conestoga st 3 boulder

what s next replacing the nation s lead pipes through policy and innovation by maureen cunningham someday we may point to 2021 as the beginning of the end of lead pipes in this country a problem that was largely created a century ago when they were installed to carry our drinking water president biden began 2021 with a focus on replacing 100 percent of the nation s lead pipes declaring that all americans deserve clean drinking water congress passed the bipartisan infrastructure investment and jobs act which was signed into law in november earmarking 15 billion for lead service line identification planning design and replacement over the next five years putting an end to the usual state match requirement for this funding and ensuring that 49 percent of these funds up from a ceiling of 35 percent and an actual average of 27 percent are allocated as principal forgiveness loans or grants to lessen the burden on disadvantaged communities the build back better act as it stands right now though still in congress would include another 9 billion in grants for lead pipe replacement including for disadvantaged communities who have historically not been able to access this funding as readily as other communities the lead and copper rule revisions may go into effect by the time this article is published with all that promise and funding on the books 2022 will be a good time to start talking about implementation replacing lead pipes efficiently so the money gets us closer to getting the job done replacing them faster to speed up what has been thus far a slow process overall and replacing them equitably to enable communities especially under resourced and underserved ones to access the funding and support they need on federal funding the environmental policy innovation center epic estimated that nearly half of states will be able to replace all of their lead pipes with federal funding if the build back better act passes with its current funding levels the remaining states many of them with the highest number of lead pipes like those in the midwest and northeast will have to be even more frugal and innovative with federal funding in addition to identifying new sources of funding on timing our back of the envelope estimate is that many cities will take decades to replace their lead pipes at their current rate of replacement or up to hundreds of years at the pace chicago was moving earlier this year we also know that faster is possible as evidenced in newark new jersey which has replaced 22 000 of its pipes in two years and is on the cusp of removing the last of them this begs the question how do we pave the way for more newarks and move cities like chicago and many others from a snail s pace to a faster one and on equity we need to ensure more municipalities are able to access federal funding since we know only 7 1 percent of eligible systems have accessed funding from the state revolving funds srfs in recent years the lead pipe replacement funding in the bipartisan infrastructure law will be dispersed to states through the srf program which means that making no changes to the program is not likely to yield the impact we need it to how then do we connect more communities and those facing the biggest risks from lead poisoning and lead in drinking water to this funding stream and other grant programs for lead pipe replacement and faster so they get the money now a plan for tackling the nation s lead service line problem ultimately will require several policy procurement and contracting reforms if we re going to see real progress in the next five years the timeline for the funding in the bipartisan infrastructure law epic and our partners highlighted some of these approaches in our report replacing toxic lead water pipes faster innovative procurement and financing approaches are just as important as federal funding our recommendations from that report and moving forward with now real federal dollars include the following controlling the cost of replacement the cost of replacing lead service lines varies across the country in our analysis of federal funding we used epa s average of 4 700 per pipe in wisconsin the cost can be as little as 1 500 per pipe in northeastern states like new york and massachusetts up to 10 000 and much higher like the exorbitant 27 000 cited by chicago at this level of spending it would take chicago an estimated 8 5 billion according to the mayor or even more to replace their lead lines an unimaginable amount to solve one water quality problem in one city though admittedly chicago has double the number of lead pipes than any city in america as some municipalities have already been doing mapping out lead lines and timing replacement with already scheduled and funded municipal improvements like sewer and other water infrastructure improvements street paving and sidewalk repair is a more efficient approach as is strategically planning for block by block rather than home by home replacements in the case of newark city officials also streamlined and shortened the length of contracts over time to push contractors to do the job faster which also cut costs prioritizing funds for replacement the federal dollars allows the identification of lead lines to be funded which is critical since many communities especially smaller and under resourced ones don t even know if they have them or where they are while statistical modeling to determine the location of a city s lead lines can save both time and money in the long run there is also a danger that states and municipalities will overdraw from the resources for inventory and mapping and fail to save some of those resources for the actual replacement costs states who ultimately manage the srf funding should try to use as much srf set aside money as possible for identification to ensure as much of the federal funding as possible is used to actually dig up and replace pipes thanks to innovation and funding in the private sector companies like blue conduit will be helping by developing open source machine learning technologies for communities to quantify locate and map their lead pipes easier and hopefully more companies will follow suit epic s water data prize will also spur new innovations in this area connecting under resourced communities to the funding we know that we need to increase the number of communities who are able to access federal funding providing technical assistance to communities to apply for and access federal funding encouraging states to use set aside funds from srfs to fund technical assistance and addressing the way communities are defined as disadvantaged are concrete ways to ensure the communities most in need are connected to funding exploring the use of innovative strategies like public private partnerships and pay for success or outcome contracting as we outlined in our report public private partnerships or p3s are a procurement approach used in other sectors that could more effectively target lead pipes in disadvantaged communities help water systems overcome administrative barriers and speed up the immediate deployment of capital an example of a successful p3 in the water sector is the clean water partnership in prince george s county where 24 municipalities were brought together under one project to address stormwater regulations creating efficiencies and cost savings through economies of scale in addition to providing additional community and environmental benefits such innovations could be applied to help aggregate multiple communities in a region who all need their lead pipes replaced in a single third party contract likewise pay for success contracting is a mechanism that can be set up to reward and prioritize lead pipe replacement in burdened communities and create positive price pressure and agreed upon fixed costs for identification and replacement to ensure that new funding goes as far as possible using new funding mechanisms like environmental and social impact bonds impact bonds represent a borrowing and procurement structure that could help maximize private sector and municipal bond financing and operate side by side with federal funding though the city of newark initially planned to replace their lead pipes in a decade the essex county improvement authority agreed to bond 120 million to speed up the process and now two years later this strategy has appeared to work though there are additional policies and factors that led to newark s success the funding played a major role lead exposure affects an estimated half of american children has been linked to an astonishing range of health and societal problems such as lowered iqs increased heart disease lowered economic activity higher welfare costs higher criminal justice system costs and contributes to hundreds of deaths each year while replacing lead pipes is only one aspect of lead poisoning prevention it is a relatively solvable problem with clear benefits every dollar spent on full lead service line replacement generates 42 to 1 33 in estimated health and societal benefits and creates thousands of jobs and economic activity whereas the cost of inaction is in the billions one year ago we could not have imagined so much funding and opportunity in place to replace toxic lead pipes in this country now it s time to ensure that the policies and innovation are also in place to get the job done maureen cunningham is the chief strategy officer director of water strategy for the environmental policy

patrick stock president of united steelworkers usw local 105 wasn t going to let anyone stop him from supporting the united auto workers strike against deere co when a court issued an injunction limiting the number of picketers at a deere facility in davenport iowa stock gathered about 30 members of his local and other unions and organized a rally along a four lane highway within sight of the plant gate he and the others gave up their afternoon and risked injury from the vehicles whizzing past because deere s attack on the auto workers was an attack on them too union contracts provide decent wages and benefits along with safe working conditions retirement security and a means for workers to stand up for themselves one company s efforts to gut a contract and trample on workers emboldens others to follow suit that s why workers from across the labor movement band together to protect one another they walk each other s picket lines they fire off letters of support to the local newspapers they attend rallies and stick signs in their yards they also boycott offending employers and take up collections to ensure striking workers have food diapers and other necessities solidarity serves as a counterweight to corporate power and helps to preserve what s left of the middle class we see the big picture and we support everybody stock said adding he s certain other unions will back his members who work at arconic s davenport works during their next contract negotiations workers throughout the country put their lives on the line and worked exhausting amounts of overtime to keep factories operating during the pandemic despite those sacrifices however companies like deere doubled down on greed even employers that made record profits during the pandemic want to further bloat their bottom lines on the backs of those who stepped up during the crisis that s forced workers into a wave of strikes around the country and underscored the power of solidarity in holding employers accountable they couldn t thank us enough for the support it meant a lot to them especially after the injunction stock said of the deere workers in iowa among 10 000 auto workers nationwide who succeeded in winning a fair contract from deere after a five week strike this fall at the same time that they were helping the auto workers stand up to deere s avarice members of the usw and other unions mobilized to demand justice for 1 400 members of the bakery confectionery tobacco workers and grain millers international union those workers began a nationwide strike against kellogg s in october after rejecting the cereal maker s demands that they give up quality health care and other hard won benefits the company initially tried to bully workers by threatening to move jobs across the border if they refused to accept the cuts now it s threatening to hire permanent replacements for striking workers a ploy sharply condemned by president joe biden and social justice activists around the nation harm to one is harm to all said dave mclimans vice president of the steelworkers organization of active retirees soar chapter 7 4 explaining why he s twice driven to the bakery workers picket line in lancaster pennsylvania to show support you have to fight the fight i ve been on strike before i know the feeling added the longtime usw member recalling a 105 day strike in 1991 against the lukens steel co mclimans still remembers the company s refusal to give workers a fair share of its prosperity the worries about paying bills as the strike wore on and the anxiety that rippled through his coworkers families and across the community also etched in his mind however is how members of other unions stepped forward to ensure he and his coworkers stayed the course the support we got was tremendous he said right now the same kind of solidarity helps to buoy chad thompson and about 400 other members of usw local 40 in their two month long unfair labor practice strike against special metals in huntington west virginia thompson the local president said the city s unionized police and firefighters stop some mornings to provide striking workers with coffee and breakfast sandwiches members of usw locals from as far away as virginia and maryland along with workers from other national and international unions donated hundreds of hams and turkeys and a truckload of grocery items volunteers from unions and their retiree groups help to staff the union hall and walk the picket line giving thompson s coworkers a boost even in the rain and cold and donations enabled the local to buy holiday gifts for members children and even throw a holiday party over the years thompson and his coworkers often supported other unions during their tough times today when he tries to thank supporters for their generosity many remind him of his own members past kindnesses we haven t forgotten what local 40 did for us one worker told him employers like deere kellogg s and special metals try to sow uncertainty foment hardship and divide workers against each other unions do exactly the opposite solidarity brings working people together to fight for justice and better lives it anchors workers in place during some of the darkest days they ll ever face it gives you the strength to do it again tomorrow thompson observed that s what it s all about one day longer the support makes all the difference tom conway is the international president of the united steelworkers union usw this article was produced by the independent media institute

photo the canadian press a sign board displays the tsx as women walk past the richmond adelaide centre in the financial district in toronto on wednesday september 29 2021 the canadian press evan buhler after enjoying a spectacular stock market run this past year canadian investors should be prepared for muted returns in 2022 as central banks end the stimulus gravy train experts say candice bangsund said it s a good time to think about portfolio adjustments we expect a more challenging environment for equities going forward after what s been a fairly impressive rally in 2021 said the portfolio manager for fiera capital the s p tsx composite index was up nearly 25 per cent this year the best performance since 2009 until fears about the omicron variant caused a 5 4 per cent drop in the toronto market in just a few days in late november canada s largest stock market index is up19 per cent as of dec 17 well above the long term average of 9 3 per cent it follows a 2 17 per cent gain in 2020 and 19 1 per cent gain in 2019 u s stock markets are heading toward similarly strong results in 2021 with the s p 500 on pace for a 23 per cent gain nasdaq at 17 7 per cent and the dow running at 15 5 per cent but as savvy investors know past performance is no guarantee of future results an impending pullback in the monetary and fiscal stimulus that fed the strong market gains coupled with higher interest rates are expected to weigh on next year s market performance and bonds long seen as key to a balanced portfolio are no longer viewed as a guaranteed good return bangsund said fiera is recommending its clients shift some of their portfolio into non traditional asset classes such as private credit real estate agriculture and infrastructure she also said investors should rotate out of growth sectors of the market that have thrived during pandemic lockdowns technology foremost among them into cyclical value oriented sectors such as resources and financials where there s more room to run in an era of higher inflation commodity prices bond yields and interest rates both of those sectors are heavily represented on the toronto exchange that is really the thesis underscoring our overweight allocation to canadian stocks versus u s stocks heading into the new year ian riach portfolio manager for franklin templeton investment solutions also expects a widening gulf between the canadian and american markets in 2022 because u s shares are relatively expensive valuations are generally more reasonable here in canada riach said during an online event unveiling franklin templeton s outlook for 2022 lower valuations tend to indicate higher return potential over the longer term like bangsund he pointed to resources and financials as likely sources of healthy earnings energy prices have surged in recent months while banks have benefited from a steepening yield curve and reduced loan loss provisions however risks remain canadian consumers are carrying heavier debt loads than their u s counterparts because of a scorching housing market which could make us vulnerable to a policy mistake if say the bank of canada raises rates too much too early but riachsays what worries him the most are risks that aren t yet known with valuations being high we may be vulnerable to a larger pullback if something unforeseen arises he said pointing for example to volatility earlier this month over concerns about omicron that so called black swan event could cause a larger pullback given where valuations are and so it s going to make it for an interesting environment he said opportunities in the next phase of the market cycle will come from high quality companies that trade at reasonable valuations and can provide some protection from downside risk should there be a larger pullback even though the s p tsx composite has surged 84 per cent since the latest bull market started in march 2020 it still has upside potential says mona mahajan senior investment strategist at edward jones bull markets usually continue unless a recession is on the horizon or central banks are closer to the end of their tightening cycle we don t see either of those conditions in place this year or next year and so in that scenario we think the bull market does have room to run probably at more moderate return levels than we ve seen in the past three years and perhaps more volatility but still positive returns she said from new york city we still continue to believe single digit returns are feasible but along the way you might get some bumpiness mahajan foresees market returns coming in next year in line with historical averages and suggests investors use pullbacks and corrections of five to 10 per cent as opportunities to enhance or diversify portfolios allan small senior investment adviser at ia private wealth says he s warning clients to prepare for market choppiness as interest rates rise i m not fearful of that he said history tells us rates and the stock market can go up together at the same time so i don t think it s a bad thing significantly higher rates in the three to five per cent range would be a game changer but small said coming off zero to about two per cent shouldn t prevent markets from rallying it ll be bumpy because you know investors are going to get nervous he said i would look for more normalized returns in the seven eight per cent range anything above that i think is gravy for next year

morena party has been pushing for the reform and recently said that there s agreement among leading lawmakers to prioritize legislation to regulate cannabis even better with the higher court ruling and potential legislation mexico could become one of the hottest cannabis markets in the world helping according to new frontier data mexico is the second most populated country in latin america with more than 1 4 million cannabis consumers including nearly 850 000 regular users mexico s total potential market revenues are substantial all could be substantial catalysts for companies such as xebra brands cse xbra aurora cannabis nasdaq acb tsx acb canopy growth tsx weed nasdaq cgc tilray inc nasdaq tlry tsx tlry and organigram holdings nasdaq ogi tsx ogi xebra brands cse xbra otc xbraf progressing quickly with cbd and cbg in mexico xebra brands ltd a cannabis company provides and update on its mexican activities xebra s wholly owned mexican subsidiary desart mx sa de cv has been granted an injunction by the mexican supreme court that has positioned it with an outright first mover advantage in the mexican cbd and cbg market official licenses will be granted by the mexican health regulatory agency cofepris in due course the supreme court decision is irrevocable and cannot be appealed mexico is on a path to full cannabis legalization likely in 2022 however xebra s injunction does not depend on legalization in fact the longer mexico takes to legalize then the longer xebra s first mover advantage will be once a legal framework is adopted by congress in mexico it could be up to three years before any entity besides xebra can commence any commercial cannabis activities due to the long approval process that applicants will be subject to this lengthy process was the case in canada colombia and elsewhere and is very likely to be the case in mexico as well the mexican senate and the chamber of deputies are expected to continue debating a proposed cannabis bill in february 2022 however it seems that the debate could be protracted xebra is moving quickly to take advantage of its absolute first mover advantage discussions are underway to secure up to 300 hectares of suitable land for cultivation and multiple canadian and american companies with cannabis processing and extraction expertise have expressed an interest in partnering in mexico manufacturing joint venture opportunities with established mexican parties have been identified and distribution channels are being explored xebra mexico s injunction applies specifically to the industrial cannabis sector and explicitly to cannabis with low levels of thc under 1 therefore in practical terms to hemp cultivation and processing and to the manufacture and sale of mainly cbd and cbg products such as tinctures oils topicals edibles beverages concentrates distillates emulsions and biomass etc and certain uses of the cannabis flower xebra believes mexico has the potential to be one of the largest near term country cannabis consumer markets in the world mexico is also within the north american free trade zone usmca giving it considerable cultivation and product manufacturing cost advantages over canada and the united states xebra is of the opinion that there is sufficient precedent with many agricultural crops and manufactured products to suggest that there is a possibility that ultimately the majority of north american industrial scale cannabis production activity will occur in mexico more information will be provided on xebra s mexican plans in due course

to have a little fun on a topic that might not be intuitive for every parent we have created the financial literacy version of the 12 days of christmas children learn financial literacy by what they see hear and read parents and grandparents are in an ideal position to make a positive impact to their children and grandchildren at this time of year it is easy to get caught up in the financial pressures of the holidays so why not bring up the topic of financial literacy share some of those bottled up financial stories to add some excitement when my kids were little i remember watching a charlie brown christmas and how it talks about the commercialization of christmas when my kids were a little older we sat down and watched another animation called the story of stuff which deals with production and consumption we have watched both shows multiple times over the years one of the best parts of both short shows is that afterwards you can have an open discussion to have a little fun on a topic that might not be intuitive for every parent we have created the financial literacy version of the 12 days of christmas for some helpful discussion ideas day 1 financial literacy on the first day of christmas my parents talked to me about financial literacy instead of spending hours in the shopping malls and shopping online we talked about the gift of knowledge spending time teaching children about financial literacy a subject that is largely missed in the school curriculum could be the greatest long term gift you give them this year financial literacy is so important that i wish it would be a key priority in all grades in my opinion the children most financially literate are those that have parents and grandparents that have dedicated the time outside of the school system to talk to them about money and also lead by example day 2 budgeting on the second day of christmas my grandparents talked to me about budgeting they had great stories grandpa told us how they saved every penny what is a penny when they were younger grandpa said he didn t buy anything until he had the money in his hand grandma said that crumbs made bread and that times were hard they had to stretch every dollar to make ends meet one way to show children how budgeting works is to keep track of expenses and show them receipts for the household quickly showing them how you budget is important again lead by example personally i use a spreadsheet and have the main categories of budgeting i e utilities entertainment vehicle the term budgeting is better talked about in stories but any approach is better than nothing if children never see or hear about the hard work that you did to get the life you have now then how are they to know day 3 goal setting on the third day of christmas my parents talked to me about goal setting we all want to tell our children that they can do anything they want in life if they work hard enough like budgeting sharing some of your own stories of the goals you set when you were younger and how you were able to achieve them can keep their attention some of the best days are those early days of sacrifice and hard work that enabled you to reach your goals contentment and satisfaction come from within and early sacrifices can have both emotional and financial rewards throughout life there are various goals that may have a financial element whether this is education planning vacations purchasing a vehicle or buying a first home by writing all the goals down you will be able to prioritize those most important day 4 earning money on the fourth day of christmas my grandparents talked to me about earning money earnings typically begin by doing small jobs or possibly receiving an allowance for chores the sooner the earnings begin then the easier it is for your children to comprehend the effort needed to make money the phrase money doesn t grow on trees is very fitting when it comes to talking about earnings in my opinion teaching your children how to work and contribute to the family is a life skill to achieve goals that have a financial element you must work and earn money it is only after they have worked and earned their own money that will they fully comprehend the value of money and the effort needed to achieve their goals day 5 savings on the fifth day of christmas my parents talked to me about savings not all people save money the same way some people have one general account while others compartmentalize their savings like a pool of funds for each goal when i was 12 i remember having three different bank accounts one for a travel account one was a car fund and another for education my mind very much compartmentalized things i had worked backward from the goals established in order to purchase a car at age 16 i needed approximately 5 000 with 48 months to save money i set aside 104 17 into my car fund every month the same applied to wanting to travel through europe after i graduated from high school i added up the cost of the return flight international hostel and euro rail pass similarly i was saving monthly into my travel fund another goal was to go to university in the united states and i saved money for that but also learned that if i worked hard in school that i could get both academic and athletic scholarships if your kids do not have a bank account set up yet opening an account for them is a good start day 6 protection on the sixth day of christmas my parents talked to me about protection protection is really an important discussion item to have with children in this age of electronics and social media fraud protection and identity theft are becoming rampant teaching your children how to protect themselves is key knowing that you never provide your personal information i e birthdates social insurance number etc when you are not 100 per cent sure the request is legitimate explaining the different types of internet scams is a good start to the conversation it is also important is to ensure that they speak with you if they feel their information has been compromised day 7 investing on the seventh day of christmas my grandparents introduced investing one of the main components to discuss with investing is risk management and the importance of avoiding big mistakes all too often there is the temptation to take a huge risk as a get rich quick approach explaining that investing in solid companies is different from speculating is key provide examples of companies that they may be familiar with and may even use the products every day such as microsoft or apple there are online tools where you can set up a portfolio of stocks for practice and not use your real money learning about investments before you have money is the best so that when you have money you are entering this stage more confidently in some situations we have had minor children under age 19 in british columbia who want to start investing with real money the money to be invested can be from the minor s savings or it can be gifted from a parent or grandparent unfortunately a minor cannot open an investment account directly in their name it is possible for parents and grandparents to open an informal in trust for investment account on behalf of a minor child or grandchild the nice part of the process of opening the account is the discussion of how to invest the funds within the account one of the concepts to building up wealth is starting early compounding returns and the benefit of time is so powerful day 8 spending on the eighth day of christmas my parents talked to me about spending they explained that it is not just how much you earn it is how much you spend in my experience the individuals that i have seen get into financial difficulty had an inability to control what they spend having the latest and greatest gadgets comes with a cost it can also be the little things that add up too to illustrate we can use two people britney and belinda both have the same earnings but have different savings britney starts each day with a trip to starbucks for her favourite coffee for lunch she will typically go out to a restaurant either sit down or pick up sometimes britney will also get a second starbucks coffee later in the day on average britney spends 25 per day on coffees and lunch belinda will make a coffee at home and have a coffee in the office she also prepares her lunch meal at home on average belinda spends 5 per day on coffees and lunch on these two little items alone belinda is able to save 20 more than britney every single day there are approximately 250 working days in a year by making small lifestyle changes belinda can save an average of 5 000 per year it is very easy to get emotional when it comes to spending have you ever bought anything that you almost immediately regretted sharing your stories with your children is a great way to reduce unnecessary purchases sometimes spending is learned through experience going to a landfill with the children and having them look around at all the purchases that people have made that are now simply disposed of is eye opening people buying cheap items that don t last and end up in the landfill is also bad for the environment the short term satisfaction of spending can often be followed by buyer s remorse as a rule of thumb the bigger the purchase the more time you should think about the purchase before buying even leaving a store and thinking about the purchase for one day often reduces the unnecessary purchases when children see parents talking and slowing down the purchase process this is a great lesson by spending less you can save more and achieve the goals that are most important to you plus it s an added bonus that it is also better for the environment day 9 borrowing and debt on the ninth day of christmas my parents talked to me about debt when you don t have money and you still want to spend there are companies that may lend you money it may be tempting to get promotional deals on short term borrowing those short term deals don t last knowing the difference between good debt versus bad debt is an important financial literacy item to review there are several examples of bad debt credit cards must be top on the list over the years i have dealt with dozens of situations where parents are having to bail out their children who got themselves into credit card problems before your children even know what credit cards are i would start advising them of how credit card companies make money explain to them that if you are not able to pay off the credit card balance in full by the due date indicated on your statement then don t do the charge we recommend pulling out a copy of the charge card account agreement i e visa or mastercard and showing the children the fine print on the interest charges if payments are missed i e 18 per cent those who lack financial literacy typically go a little wild when they first have a credit card it is very easy to charge money on a card some spend more during the holiday season than what they make excessive spending in the short term may result in having to pay huge amounts in interest charges credit card debt is a prime example of bad debt if the balance cannot be paid every month by the due date to illustrate we will use a credit card where 2 000 in charges were made if you only did the minimum payment each month of 60 then the total payments would take 13 years and 10 months with 3 798 88 in total payments 1 798 88 equals the total interest paid some of our wealthiest clients have borrowed money to purchase a business expand a business purchase real estate etc in most of those ventures borrowed money was used in a good way teaching your children the difference between good debt and bad debt is an important lesson day 10 access to information on the 10th day of christmas my parents talked to me about financial information the phrase don t believe everything thing you read is truer today then it ever has been social media is the number one resource for information for young people unfortunately much of the information has very little validity up above we talked about protecting on netflix they have a great show called the social dilemma and it is a great show to watch with your kids it talks about how information is gathered and how information is fed back through the devices they are looking at i e iphone tablet we highly recommend that you have these discussions and point your children in the right direction with respect to the information they are exposed to regarding to financial literacy day 11 understanding taxes on the 11th day of christmas my parents talked to me about taxes when you work and have income you must file a tax return if you have taxes payable the purpose of the tax return is to determine exactly how much taxes are owed to the government explaining the marginal tax brackets and how income tax is only one of many taxes that you must pay is important explaining how property taxes work or excise taxes can provide them with useful knowledge discussing what items have provincial sales tax pst and what items have federal sales tax gst is also a good start nearly all services products and activities have a tax applicable often the price tag that you see on a new item is not the full price one of the ways that i taught my kids about taxes was showing an example of purchasing items used or new if you purchase a used item it often costs significantly less is good for the environment by repurposing and you have the bonus of not having to pay sales tax on it potentially a 12 per cent savings day 12 giving on the 12th day of christmas my grandparents talked to me about giving helping others that are not as well off financially is one of the foundations of support needed in a community many financial education literacy programs have giving as one of the compartments to allocate your earnings throughout life there are many people who will reach out and request a donation donation scams are unfortunately sometimes knocking on your door calling or emailing at many cash registers now the cashier will ask would you like to make a donation i ve always told my children to choose the charities that are most important to them and to do their research never feel pressured to give money when approached in fact always be extra cautious when others reach out to you to ask for money like goal setting we encourage a thoughtful process on dealing with giving not all charities are equal and doing research will ensure your donations are allocated to the best charities kevin greenard cpa ca fma cfp cim is a portfolio manager and director wealth management with the greenard group at scotia wealth management in victoria

photo the canadian press a sign board displays the tsx as women walk past the richmond adelaide centre in the financial district in toronto on wednesday september 29 2021 the canadian press evan buhler after enjoying a spectacular stock market run this past year canadian investors should be prepared for muted returns in 2022 as central banks end the stimulus gravy train experts say candice bangsund said it s a good time to think about portfolio adjustments we expect a more challenging environment for equities going forward after what s been a fairly impressive rally in 2021 said the portfolio manager for fiera capital the s p tsx composite index was up nearly 25 per cent this year the best performance since 2009 until fears about the omicron variant caused a 5 4 per cent drop in the toronto market in just a few days in late november canada s largest stock market index is up19 per cent as of dec 17 well above the long term average of 9 3 per cent it follows a 2 17 per cent gain in 2020 and 19 1 per cent gain in 2019 u s stock markets are heading toward similarly strong results in 2021 with the s p 500 on pace for a 23 per cent gain nasdaq at 17 7 per cent and the dow running at 15 5 per cent but as savvy investors know past performance is no guarantee of future results an impending pullback in the monetary and fiscal stimulus that fed the strong market gains coupled with higher interest rates are expected to weigh on next year s market performance and bonds long seen as key to a balanced portfolio are no longer viewed as a guaranteed good return bangsund said fiera is recommending its clients shift some of their portfolio into non traditional asset classes such as private credit real estate agriculture and infrastructure she also said investors should rotate out of growth sectors of the market that have thrived during pandemic lockdowns technology foremost among them into cyclical value oriented sectors such as resources and financials where there s more room to run in an era of higher inflation commodity prices bond yields and interest rates both of those sectors are heavily represented on the toronto exchange that is really the thesis underscoring our overweight allocation to canadian stocks versus u s stocks heading into the new year ian riach portfolio manager for franklin templeton investment solutions also expects a widening gulf between the canadian and american markets in 2022 because u s shares are relatively expensive valuations are generally more reasonable here in canada riach said during an online event unveiling franklin templeton s outlook for 2022 lower valuations tend to indicate higher return potential over the longer term like bangsund he pointed to resources and financials as likely sources of healthy earnings energy prices have surged in recent months while banks have benefited from a steepening yield curve and reduced loan loss provisions however risks remain canadian consumers are carrying heavier debt loads than their u s counterparts because of a scorching housing market which could make us vulnerable to a policy mistake if say the bank of canada raises rates too much too early but riachsays what worries him the most are risks that aren t yet known with valuations being high we may be vulnerable to a larger pullback if something unforeseen arises he said pointing for example to volatility earlier this month over concerns about omicron that so called black swan event could cause a larger pullback given where valuations are and so it s going to make it for an interesting environment he said opportunities in the next phase of the market cycle will come from high quality companies that trade at reasonable valuations and can provide some protection from downside risk should there be a larger pullback even though the s p tsx composite has surged 84 per cent since the latest bull market started in march 2020 it still has upside potential says mona mahajan senior investment strategist at edward jones bull markets usually continue unless a recession is on the horizon or central banks are closer to the end of their tightening cycle we don t see either of those conditions in place this year or next year and so in that scenario we think the bull market does have room to run probably at more moderate return levels than we ve seen in the past three years and perhaps more volatility but still positive returns she said from new york city we still continue to believe single digit returns are feasible but along the way you might get some bumpiness mahajan foresees market returns coming in next year in line with historical averages and suggests investors use pullbacks and corrections of five to 10 per cent as opportunities to enhance or diversify portfolios allan small senior investment adviser at ia private wealth says he s warning clients to prepare for market choppiness as interest rates rise i m not fearful of that he said history tells us rates and the stock market can go up together at the same time so i don t think it s a bad thing significantly higher rates in the three to five per cent range would be a game changer but small said coming off zero to about two per cent shouldn t prevent markets from rallying it ll be bumpy because you know investors are going to get nervous he said i would look for more normalized returns in the seven eight per cent range anything above that i think is gravy for next year

financial show well folks 2021 is just about a wrap for those of you who ve listened for a while now you know that one of my favorite shows to do is my partner in crime s preview of the year to come that s right folks its certified financial planner matt frankel and his count of five bold predictions for the stock market in 2022 matt what s going on matt frankel not much it s a beautiful but a little chilly day here in south carolina but pretty nice though i see a christmas tree behind you jason moser yeah matt frankel it s festive everywhere jason moser let s get in the festive it s nice i think that weather is contagious it s up here too it s nice it s a little chilly but it s starting to feel like christmas which is nice i m excited for the holiday season hope everyone else out there is too matt much like the masters kicks off spring in augusta your five bold predictions to me really do tell us that the new year is upon us i always enjoy going through this piece because i m always learning something new from you but i just enjoy the perspective i like the bold nature of the predictions as you say they are not meant to all come true maybe because they re bold predictions but nevertheless it seems like you have a good time putting this list together matt frankel they re really bold predictions but not so bold that they re not going to happen they are things that could possibly happen but not the most likely jason moser well let s talk about the plausibility then because as we like to do we hit rewind and look at your 2021 predictions and how that has unfolded about a year ago we did another show like this where we talked about your bold predictions for 2021 as we get the show kicked off here let s talk about those 2021 predictions and how that s gone so far matt frankel yeah for whatever reason i only made four predictions in 2021 maybe i wanted to give myself a chance of going 50 50 maybe that s what was going on here i ll go through them one at a time number 1 i predicted that the economic reopening of the us will be quicker than anticipated especially in regards to vaccine availability remember at first a lot of people thought we wouldn t have widespread availability to october it was going to take to the fall before anyone could get a vaccine that turned out not to be the case it turned out to be earlier than anticipated i think it was by may in most places where you can just walk in and get a vaccine whenever you wanted to that made the economic reopening happen quicker than expected a lot of people didn t think everything was going to essentially reopen by the summer last year and it did i call that one a success in terms of prediction jason moser i agree matt frankel number 2 it s a little bit not as black and white here number 2 i predicted that the reopening stocks would outperform the s p 500 generally that has been the case the s p is up by about 25 percent year to date most reopening stocks have had a good year hotel stocks have done really well a lot of the real estate stocks we talked about the retail basket that s done really well but i specifically called out some stocks that happened to underperform i specifically called out empire state realty the office reit which office space is still up in the air at this point delta airlines is what i called out that underperformed reopening stocks as a group outperformed but the ones that i called out other than simon property group which destroyed the market haven t done so hard i ll call that one a 50 50 i ll call that neutral jason moser what about number 3 because this was like you said it was like the george constanza of bold predictions right matt frankel number 3 i was clearly wrong jason moser yeah it did the opposite matt frankel yeah i predicted the s p would decline the reason being the s p has gotten so top heavy with companies like apple microsoft google like making up so much of your index i thought those companies would have a rough year during the reopening i was wrong apple is about to hit a three trillion dollar market cap for the first time ever as an apple shareholder i m not that mad about it but my prediction was wrong jason moser the emotional hedge what about number 4 matt frankel four was oil i predicted oil would be over 70 a barrel by the end of the year at the time that was probably the boldest prediction on this list i think oil was something in the 40s when i made that prediction people were saying we re going to have cheap gas and cheap oil for a long time but right now it s just over 70 i ve spent 71 50 as i m talking jason moser yeah matt frankel with a few weeks left in the year it s too early to call that one but so far it s definitely headed in the right direction especially being how low it was when i made the call i feel good about that one jason moser yeah i think it makes perfect sense i would give it to you but i appreciate your integrity there we ll wait till the end of the year but either way i think even if it s just slightly below i d at least give you a half it s what you have matt frankel that was probably the boldest out of the original four jason moser well ok let s go ahead and talk about 2022 here because it s december 13th we ve only got really just a handful of days here left in the year and 2022 is just going to get ready to get started here what are your bold predictions for 2022 matt frankel these are in order from least bold to most i guess you would say number 1 is that value stocks are finally going to start to outperform growth stocks jason moser oh man i would love for you just to go ahead and tweet that out after we get done taping and just watch all the growth investors just descend on you matt frankel it s pretty bold over the past decade growth stocks have doubled the return of value stocks as a whole like the vanguard growth etf versus the vanguard value etf it s been about doubled the total return over the past decade in most individual years growth has outperformed i just think that value stocks have generally a lot more to gain and the market is tiring of these high valuations jason moser well it feels like we re seeing a little bit of that rotation now when you say it that i know it s a buzzword rotation out of once like a little bit of reality the matter is that is what happens you see this bigger picture interest shifting from one sector of the market to another there is a rotation out of growth into something else and it does feel like what you re saying there maybe there is some more interesting value matt frankel there s a lot that can cause it for example when interest rates rise it makes investors think twice about the high value growth stocks jason moser right matt frankel things like that i just think that the growth stocks have had their moment at this point but i thought that last year that s the one that i got wrong i think this year might be finally the time for value jason moser well we will obviously be paying close attention to that what about number 2 matt frankel the fed will raise rates quicker than expected but will have a tough time getting inflation under control jason moser i like that i don t like inflation don t get me wrong but i like the prediction matt frankel we ve already seen that the transitory inflation figures on the day i wrote this article the fed announced that they were going to retire the word transitory because that was obviously wrong but right now even today the predictions still call for either no rate hikes or one rate hike in 2022 between zero and one i m predicting that the fed will raise interest rates at least twice in 2022 if not three times and that it s going to find inflation a lot more difficult to control than they think i think inflation will run over three percent for the foreseeable future jason moser yeah i tend to agree with you there i was never really on board with transitory i think it s money that they decided they needed to retire the word from their verbiage in the meetings because i think they ve finally realized it s not really the case but that strikes me as a pretty possible scenario what about bold prediction number 3 matt frankel i will say before i get to that people my age and your age we really haven t had to deal with inflation in our adult lifetimes jason moser no not really matt frankel most of the people like making these predictions they really don t know what to think about it jason moser yeah well it s really interesting in either just before we get to the next prediction inflation is one of those things that we taught like when we were doing that full school stuff at hq back when hq was open we even have kids come in 5th 6th 7th grade and we would teach them about inflation we would just hey this was the price of a gallon of milk back in 1990 this is what it is today this is what it was back in bananas bread you could see it really does exist and trying to explain to them that over time if you put that 100 bill into a piggy bank that s great you are protecting that wealth but the longer you leave it there the more destructive it becomes because inflation really does eat that up matt frankel i was born during a very inflationary time in the early 1980s through the 90s it remain elevated the 4 5 percent year range certain years but in the 2000s 2010s we really have not seen big inflation jason moser yeah matt frankel it ll be interesting to see how that plays out but with that in mind let s get to number 3 jason moser let s do it matt frankel now we re starting to get a little bit bolder the housing market will have another double digit gain in 2022 jason moser whoa really matt frankel that s one i ve gotten the most push back on so far surprisingly to me jason moser interesting matt frankel it s like don t bet against the trend in the third quarter us home prices increased by 18 5 percent year over year just throughout the nation that s the average so some markets where in the 20s and 30s now that s a high increase there are things driving it though like lower mortgage rates and unfortunately high demand and low inventory of houses those things might sound temporary but i think there are some permanent catalysts where they keep prices going higher for example they recently announced that the conforming mortgage limit s going to rise by about 100 000 next year which makes it easier for buyers to finance homes that have appreciated in value the fha has announced a similar increase to the fha lending limits supply is limiting home builders ability to make new homes right now supply chain and labor disruptions rather but we re seeing massive backlogs in the home builders one of the ones that i follow dream finders homes that i ve talked about on this show they announced their highest backlog ever just recently other home builders are seeing the same i just feel like there s so much pent up demand that it s going to keep the price increases going for at least another year jason moser yeah it does feel like the attitude on the ground out there today is still very high demand we had a little home down on the river here that we just decided to sell we don t get to use it that often and so we put it on the market and i think within three days just immediately three offers all well above what we were asking the demand is just out there it s the middle of december so it feels like that is going to bleed into 2022 actually like that i like that call too what about number 4 because this was really a big theme of 2021 leaving some investors out there who can t see the forest for the trees a little bit salty but what about number 4 here matt frankel yes i m getting to my bolder predictions now number 4 is that spacs will make a comeback i m not saying that we re going to see early 2021 happen again i think one of the shows we did there was something like 12 spacs that went public that day jason moser probably we did that all series we did four shows just a series of spacs matt frankel i think each show i gave the statistics on how many went public that week and it was like in the 40s and 50s certainty i don t think we re going to see that again but what i do think is we are going to see a wave of more prominent companies go public by spac again we re going to see some more high profile sponsors decide to get back into the spac game some of these companies that were issuing more than two or three spacs or whatever in 2021 virgin for example to have pumped the brakes and haven t put out any new blank check companies virgin s took public 23 they just announced their second one it s taken public the grove collaborative it s organic foods company i believe jason moser yeah matt frankel but they hadn t put out once since the second one which was in the middle of the year i could see these companies that are finally starting to get their stacks work through the process getting back into it and i think early 2022 you re not necessarily going to see what we saw last year but you re going to see a resurgence in the spac boom jason moser yeah we just saw harley davidson they are going to spin out their electric bike business livewire that s going to go public in 2022 via spac i think you re right i think we re going to continue to see it maybe not the same headline news that we saw through 2021 but it does give businesses a chance to go public earlier and not to say that every one of those businesses is a good one but there are some good businesses that come from this and maybe met in mind don t throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say matt i guess brings us to the final and fifth bold prediction for 2022 i got to say this is another bold one you re going to get some push back i m sure matt frankel if you thought the growth stock thing was going to make people mad on twitter number 5 is the cryptocurrencies are going to have a rough year in 2022 jason moser what makes you say that matt frankel along the same lines as my thoughts about growth stocks is that the appetite for speculation is just running out higher interest rates things like that it s going to cause investors to pump the brakes on speculation it s going to trickle down to the cryptocurrency markets because at the end of the day cryptocurrencies and growth stocks are more linked than people like to think in terms of who invested them you re going to see a lot of investors start to pump the brakes since i wrote this article bitcoin s already down by like 10 percent technically the clock starts in january jason moser somebody leaked the info someone leaked our show notes matt frankel tim just said it was my fault but since the beginning of 2020 pre pandemic bitcoin is up by about 700 percent ethereum is up by 3 400 percent since the beginning of 2020 that was already after a big multiyear rally look at a 5 6 year chart of bitcoin you ll be kicking yourself for not buying it but i think that s going to start to run out i think it s going to take a step backward we got a surge of institutional interest in 2021 if i m right and growth stocks have a rough year you re also going to see a lot of institutions start to pump the brakes on crypto i m predicting a decline of 20 percent or more i put a number on it 20 percent or more in 2022 jason moser well you ve quantified it crypto is just a tricky one you re right i think the risk profile is very similar folks who are part of that growth movement very similar risk profile for those who invested in this cryptocurrency it will be interesting to see maybe as 2022 unfolds if we see the tail ends of any stimulus and the impact that s had on helping people pad their bank accounts start to get people back to work and those accounts become a little bit more depleted if maybe that tolerance for risk doesn t start to bait at some point in 2022 for something you just don t see as much about crypto and meme stocks and things like that but it ll certainly be stuff worth following for sure but matt hey listen this is always a lot of fun i think you know i m a big fan of these lists that you publish and i appreciate you taking the time to sit in and review your 2021 predictions and preview the boldness of your 2022 predictions matt frankel of course always fun to be here and go through all these things with you hopefully i get at least get two out of the five jason moser oh well we re going to keep track and we will come back to it i promise folks that s going to do it for us this week remember you can always reach out to us on twitter at mf industry focus or drop us an email at as always people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against don t buy yourself stocks based solely on what you hear thanks as always to tim sparks for putting the show together for us for matt frankel i m jason moser thanks for listening and we ll see you next week

new england s commercial shrimp fishery will remain shut down because of concerns about the health of the crustacean s population amid warming ocean temperatures the cold water shrimp were once a winter delicacy in maine and beyond but the fishery has been shut down since 2013 a board of the regulatory atlantic states marine fisheries commission voted on friday to keep the fishery shuttered for at least three more years the shrimp prefer cold water and their population health is imperiled by the warming of the ocean off new england the gulf of maine in particular is warming faster than most of the world s oceans scientists have also said recently that warming waters led to increased predation from a species of squid that feeds on shrimp the board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018 the board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry on friday but chose not to in the face of discouraging news from scientists the decision followed a report earlier this month from a technical committee that said it made sense to keep the fishery closed because of the poor condition of the resource the extremely low likelihood of being able to fish sustainably and the value of maximizing spawning potential to rebuild the stock if environmental conditions improve advertisement recent surveys of the shrimp show far less of them than historical averages and there have been seven consecutive years of low abundance said maggie hunter a scientist with the maine department of marine resources warming waters remain a problem hunter said temperature data continues to show unfavorable conditions for northern shrimp hunter said the status of the stock continues to be poor the loss of the shrimp fishery has been an economic hardship for maine fishermen as it was previously a way for lobster fishermen and others to make money during the cold winter months the domestic cold water shrimping industry was based almost entirely in maine though some shrimp came to the docks in massachusetts and new hampshire canadian fishermen harvest the same species and they are sometimes still available to consumers in the u s they re often called northern shrimp or maine shrimp and are small pink shrimp valued in the culinary world for their sweet meat the shrimp are a small piece of the worldwide shrimp fishing and farming industry that produces the popular protein around the globe maine fishermen harvested more than 10 million pounds of the shrimp per year as recently as 2011 the catch fell to less than 5 million pounds in 2012 and less than 600 000 pounds in 2013 after which the ban took effect the regulatory board also voted to explore the possibility of allowing personal use fishing for the shrimp send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

financial show well folks 2021 is just about a wrap for those of you who ve listened for a while now you know that one of my favorite shows to do is my partner in crime s preview of the year to come that s right folks its certified financial planner matt frankel and his count of five bold predictions for the stock market in 2022 matt what s going on matt frankel not much it s a beautiful but a little chilly day here in south carolina but pretty nice though i see a christmas tree behind you jason moser yeah matt frankel it s festive everywhere jason moser let s get in the festive it s nice i think that weather is contagious it s up here too it s nice it s a little chilly but it s starting to feel like christmas which is nice i m excited for the holiday season hope everyone else out there is too matt much like the masters kicks off spring in augusta your five bold predictions to me really do tell us that the new year is upon us i always enjoy going through this piece because i m always learning something new from you but i just enjoy the perspective i like the bold nature of the predictions as you say they are not meant to all come true maybe because they re bold predictions but nevertheless it seems like you have a good time putting this list together matt frankel they re really bold predictions but not so bold that they re not going to happen they are things that could possibly happen but not the most likely jason moser well let s talk about the plausibility then because as we like to do we hit rewind and look at your 2021 predictions and how that has unfolded about a year ago we did another show like this where we talked about your bold predictions for 2021 as we get the show kicked off here let s talk about those 2021 predictions and how that s gone so far matt frankel yeah for whatever reason i only made four predictions in 2021 maybe i wanted to give myself a chance of going 50 50 maybe that s what was going on here i ll go through them one at a time number 1 i predicted that the economic reopening of the us will be quicker than anticipated especially in regards to vaccine availability remember at first a lot of people thought we wouldn t have widespread availability to october it was going to take to the fall before anyone could get a vaccine that turned out not to be the case it turned out to be earlier than anticipated i think it was by may in most places where you can just walk in and get a vaccine whenever you wanted to that made the economic reopening happen quicker than expected a lot of people didn t think everything was going to essentially reopen by the summer last year and it did i call that one a success in terms of prediction jason moser i agree matt frankel number 2 it s a little bit not as black and white here number 2 i predicted that the reopening stocks would outperform the s p 500 generally that has been the case the s p is up by about 25 percent year to date most reopening stocks have had a good year hotel stocks have done really well a lot of the real estate stocks we talked about the retail basket that s done really well but i specifically called out some stocks that happened to underperform i specifically called out empire state realty the office reit which office space is still up in the air at this point delta airlines is what i called out that underperformed reopening stocks as a group outperformed but the ones that i called out other than simon property group which destroyed the market haven t done so hard i ll call that one a 50 50 i ll call that neutral jason moser what about number 3 because this was like you said it was like the george constanza of bold predictions right matt frankel number 3 i was clearly wrong jason moser yeah it did the opposite matt frankel yeah i predicted the s p would decline the reason being the s p has gotten so top heavy with companies like apple microsoft google like making up so much of your index i thought those companies would have a rough year during the reopening i was wrong apple is about to hit a three trillion dollar market cap for the first time ever as an apple shareholder i m not that mad about it but my prediction was wrong jason moser the emotional hedge what about number 4 matt frankel four was oil i predicted oil would be over 70 a barrel by the end of the year at the time that was probably the boldest prediction on this list i think oil was something in the 40s when i made that prediction people were saying we re going to have cheap gas and cheap oil for a long time but right now it s just over 70 i ve spent 71 50 as i m talking jason moser yeah matt frankel with a few weeks left in the year it s too early to call that one but so far it s definitely headed in the right direction especially being how low it was when i made the call i feel good about that one jason moser yeah i think it makes perfect sense i would give it to you but i appreciate your integrity there we ll wait till the end of the year but either way i think even if it s just slightly below i d at least give you a half it s what you have matt frankel that was probably the boldest out of the original four jason moser well ok let s go ahead and talk about 2022 here because it s december 13th we ve only got really just a handful of days here left in the year and 2022 is just going to get ready to get started here what are your bold predictions for 2022 matt frankel these are in order from least bold to most i guess you would say number 1 is that value stocks are finally going to start to outperform growth stocks jason moser oh man i would love for you just to go ahead and tweet that out after we get done taping and just watch all the growth investors just descend on you matt frankel it s pretty bold over the past decade growth stocks have doubled the return of value stocks as a whole like the vanguard growth etf versus the vanguard value etf it s been about doubled the total return over the past decade in most individual years growth has outperformed i just think that value stocks have generally a lot more to gain and the market is tiring of these high valuations jason moser well it feels like we re seeing a little bit of that rotation now when you say it that i know it s a buzzword rotation out of once like a little bit of reality the matter is that is what happens you see this bigger picture interest shifting from one sector of the market to another there is a rotation out of growth into something else and it does feel like what you re saying there maybe there is some more interesting value matt frankel there s a lot that can cause it for example when interest rates rise it makes investors think twice about the high value growth stocks jason moser right matt frankel things like that i just think that the growth stocks have had their moment at this point but i thought that last year that s the one that i got wrong i think this year might be finally the time for value jason moser well we will obviously be paying close attention to that what about number 2 matt frankel the fed will raise rates quicker than expected but will have a tough time getting inflation under control jason moser i like that i don t like inflation don t get me wrong but i like the prediction matt frankel we ve already seen that the transitory inflation figures on the day i wrote this article the fed announced that they were going to retire the word transitory because that was obviously wrong but right now even today the predictions still call for either no rate hikes or one rate hike in 2022 between zero and one i m predicting that the fed will raise interest rates at least twice in 2022 if not three times and that it s going to find inflation a lot more difficult to control than they think i think inflation will run over three percent for the foreseeable future jason moser yeah i tend to agree with you there i was never really on board with transitory i think it s money that they decided they needed to retire the word from their verbiage in the meetings because i think they ve finally realized it s not really the case but that strikes me as a pretty possible scenario what about bold prediction number 3 matt frankel i will say before i get to that people my age and your age we really haven t had to deal with inflation in our adult lifetimes jason moser no not really matt frankel most of the people like making these predictions they really don t know what to think about it jason moser yeah well it s really interesting in either just before we get to the next prediction inflation is one of those things that we taught like when we were doing that full school stuff at hq back when hq was open we even have kids come in 5th 6th 7th grade and we would teach them about inflation we would just hey this was the price of a gallon of milk back in 1990 this is what it is today this is what it was back in bananas bread you could see it really does exist and trying to explain to them that over time if you put that 100 bill into a piggy bank that s great you are protecting that wealth but the longer you leave it there the more destructive it becomes because inflation really does eat that up matt frankel i was born during a very inflationary time in the early 1980s through the 90s it remain elevated the 4 5 percent year range certain years but in the 2000s 2010s we really have not seen big inflation jason moser yeah matt frankel it ll be interesting to see how that plays out but with that in mind let s get to number 3 jason moser let s do it matt frankel now we re starting to get a little bit bolder the housing market will have another double digit gain in 2022 jason moser whoa really matt frankel that s one i ve gotten the most push back on so far surprisingly to me jason moser interesting matt frankel it s like don t bet against the trend in the third quarter us home prices increased by 18 5 percent year over year just throughout the nation that s the average so some markets where in the 20s and 30s now that s a high increase there are things driving it though like lower mortgage rates and unfortunately high demand and low inventory of houses those things might sound temporary but i think there are some permanent catalysts where they keep prices going higher for example they recently announced that the conforming mortgage limit s going to rise by about 100 000 next year which makes it easier for buyers to finance homes that have appreciated in value the fha has announced a similar increase to the fha lending limits supply is limiting home builders ability to make new homes right now supply chain and labor disruptions rather but we re seeing massive backlogs in the home builders one of the ones that i follow dream finders homes that i ve talked about on this show they announced their highest backlog ever just recently other home builders are seeing the same i just feel like there s so much pent up demand that it s going to keep the price increases going for at least another year jason moser yeah it does feel like the attitude on the ground out there today is still very high demand we had a little home down on the river here that we just decided to sell we don t get to use it that often and so we put it on the market and i think within three days just immediately three offers all well above what we were asking the demand is just out there it s the middle of december so it feels like that is going to bleed into 2022 actually like that i like that call too what about number 4 because this was really a big theme of 2021 leaving some investors out there who can t see the forest for the trees a little bit salty but what about number 4 here matt frankel yes i m getting to my bolder predictions now number 4 is that spacs will make a comeback i m not saying that we re going to see early 2021 happen again i think one of the shows we did there was something like 12 spacs that went public that day jason moser probably we did that all series we did four shows just a series of spacs matt frankel i think each show i gave the statistics on how many went public that week and it was like in the 40s and 50s certainty i don t think we re going to see that again but what i do think is we are going to see a wave of more prominent companies go public by spac again we re going to see some more high profile sponsors decide to get back into the spac game some of these companies that were issuing more than two or three spacs or whatever in 2021 virgin for example to have pumped the brakes and haven t put out any new blank check companies virgin s took public 23 they just announced their second one it s taken public the grove collaborative it s organic foods company i believe jason moser yeah matt frankel but they hadn t put out once since the second one which was in the middle of the year i could see these companies that are finally starting to get their stacks work through the process getting back into it and i think early 2022 you re not necessarily going to see what we saw last year but you re going to see a resurgence in the spac boom jason moser yeah we just saw harley davidson they are going to spin out their electric bike business livewire that s going to go public in 2022 via spac i think you re right i think we re going to continue to see it maybe not the same headline news that we saw through 2021 but it does give businesses a chance to go public earlier and not to say that every one of those businesses is a good one but there are some good businesses that come from this and maybe met in mind don t throw the baby out with the bathwater as they say matt i guess brings us to the final and fifth bold prediction for 2022 i got to say this is another bold one you re going to get some push back i m sure matt frankel if you thought the growth stock thing was going to make people mad on twitter number 5 is the cryptocurrencies are going to have a rough year in 2022 jason moser what makes you say that matt frankel along the same lines as my thoughts about growth stocks is that the appetite for speculation is just running out higher interest rates things like that it s going to cause investors to pump the brakes on speculation it s going to trickle down to the cryptocurrency markets because at the end of the day cryptocurrencies and growth stocks are more linked than people like to think in terms of who invested them you re going to see a lot of investors start to pump the brakes since i wrote this article bitcoin s already down by like 10 percent technically the clock starts in january jason moser somebody leaked the info someone leaked our show notes matt frankel tim just said it was my fault but since the beginning of 2020 pre pandemic bitcoin is up by about 700 percent ethereum is up by 3 400 percent since the beginning of 2020 that was already after a big multiyear rally look at a 5 6 year chart of bitcoin you ll be kicking yourself for not buying it but i think that s going to start to run out i think it s going to take a step backward we got a surge of institutional interest in 2021 if i m right and growth stocks have a rough year you re also going to see a lot of institutions start to pump the brakes on crypto i m predicting a decline of 20 percent or more i put a number on it 20 percent or more in 2022 jason moser well you ve quantified it crypto is just a tricky one you re right i think the risk profile is very similar folks who are part of that growth movement very similar risk profile for those who invested in this cryptocurrency it will be interesting to see maybe as 2022 unfolds if we see the tail ends of any stimulus and the impact that s had on helping people pad their bank accounts start to get people back to work and those accounts become a little bit more depleted if maybe that tolerance for risk doesn t start to bait at some point in 2022 for something you just don t see as much about crypto and meme stocks and things like that but it ll certainly be stuff worth following for sure but matt hey listen this is always a lot of fun i think you know i m a big fan of these lists that you publish and i appreciate you taking the time to sit in and review your 2021 predictions and preview the boldness of your 2022 predictions matt frankel of course always fun to be

than 14 weeks of extensive testimony and an array of other evidence that includes more than 900 exhibits bostic returned to many of the themes touched upon in thursday s arguments when fellow prosecutor jeffrey schenk cast her as a charlatan who brazenly lied to become rich and famous those purported goals were achieved in 2014 when holmes became a media sensation with an estimated fortune of 4 5 billion based on her 50 stake in theranos holmes now 37 is facing 11 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy alleging she duped investors business partners and patients about theranos technology she repeatedly claimed that the company s new testing device could scan for hundreds of diseases and other problems with a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick instead of a needle stuck in a vein the concept was so compelling theranos and holmes were able to raise more than 900 million from billionaire investors such as media magnate rupert murdoch and software titan larry ellison the palo alto california company also negotiated potentially lucrative deals with major retailers walgreens and safeway and holmes quickly began to grace the covers of national magazines as a wunderkind unknown to most people outside theranos the company s blood testing technology was flawed often producing inaccurate results that could have endangered the lives of patients who took the tests after the flaws were exposed in 2015 and 2016 theranos eventually collapsed the justice department filed its criminal case in 2018 people lost money downey acknowledged friday that is a bad event and a failure on holmes part but he added none of it was criminal downey told the jury that holmes didn t realize the scope of the problems until a theranos laboratory director informed her in march 2016 that the company had to invalidate 60 000 of its past blood tests had holmes thought any crimes been committed downey posited she would have tried to cover them up and perhaps sell some of her stock not only did she never sell a share downey said she continued to try to salvage the company her turnaround efforts included ousting theranos chief operating officer sunny balwani who also had been her lover in a dramatic turnon the witness stand last month holmes testified that balwani had been covertly controlling everything from her diet to friendships while subjecting her to mental emotional and sexual abuse although the testimony cast holmes as balwani s pawn downey never mentioned the alleged abuse and its effects on her during his closing arguments that omission will leave it to the jury to consider whether partner abuse may have affected some of her decisions at theranos in the prosecution s closing argument schenk reminded the jurors that if they finding holmes guilty of fraud won t mean they discounted her abuse allegations balwani s lawyer adamantly denied holmes accusations in court documents that the jury never saw jurors also never heard from balwani who intended to invoke his fifth amendment right against self incrimination had been called to testify balwani 56 faces similar fraud charges in a separate trial scheduled to begin in february
