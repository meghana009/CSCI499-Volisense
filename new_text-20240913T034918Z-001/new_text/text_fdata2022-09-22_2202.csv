tumor agnostic data supporting approval demonstrated an overall response rate orr of 44 across multiple tumor types fda simultaneously grants traditional approval in adults with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc with a ret gene fusion as detected by an fda approved test indianapolis sept 21 2022 prnewswire eli lilly and company nyse lly today announced the u s food and drug administration fda has granted approval to retevmo selpercatinib 40 mg 80 mg capsules for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a rearranged during transfection ret gene fusion that have progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options this indication is approved under accelerated approval based on orr and duration of response dor continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in the confirmatory trial in the libretto 001 trial selpercatinib demonstrated clinically meaningful and durable responses across a variety of tumor types in patients with ret driven cancers including pancreatic colon and other cancers in need of new treatment options said vivek subbiah m d associate professor of investigational cancer therapeutics at the university of texas md anderson cancer center and co investigator for libretto 001 these data and fda approval of the tumor agnostic indication underscore the importance of routine comprehensive genomic testing for patients across a wide variety of tumor types in addition to the tumor agnostic approval the fda has granted traditional approval for retevmo in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non small cell lung cancer nsclc with a ret gene fusion as detected by an fda approved test this fda action broadens the retevmo label to include patients with locally advanced disease and converts the may 2020 accelerated approval for nsclc to a traditional approval the labeling for retevmo contains warnings and precautions for hepatotoxicity evidence of liver dysfunction interstitial lung disease ild pneumonitis hypertension qt interval prolongation hemorrhagic events hypersensitivity tumor lysis syndrome risk of impaired wound healing hypothyroidism and embryo fetal toxicity since its initial accelerated approval retevmo has shifted the treatment paradigm for patients with ret altered cancers said david hyman m d chief medical officer loxo lilly retevmo is the first and only ret inhibitor to receive both tumor agnostic accelerated approval and traditional approval in nsclc further supporting its ability to deliver meaningful clinical benefit for patients across diverse tumor types the two approvals are supported by data from the pivotal libretto 001 trial which is the largest clinical trial of patients with ret driven cancers treated with a ret inhibitor the multicenter open label multi cohort study enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic ret driven solid tumors including nsclc major efficacy outcomes were orr and dor assessed by a blinded independent review committee birc prespecified secondary endpoints

earlier access for patients who needed new treatment options we are now pleased to see the conversion from an accelerated approval to a traditional approval said andrea ferris president and chief executive officer lungevity foundation as a targeted treatment this traditional approval further reinforces the need for comprehensive biomarker testing for lung cancer patients with the hope that as

washington the federal reserve barreled ahead with a third straight outsize interest rate hike wednesday in an effort to squash high inflation but economists worry the campaign is increasingly risking a recession by next year the fed raised its key short term rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3 to 3 25 a higher than normal level designed to ease inflation by slowing the economy it also significantly bumped up its forecast for what that rate will be at the end of both this year and 2023 fed officials now predict the key rate will end 2022 at a range of 4 25 to 4 5 a full percentage point above the 3 25 to 3 5 they projected in june and close out next year at 4 5 to 4 75 according to their median estimate that suggests the central bank could approve another three quarter point hike at its november meeting and then a half point rate rise in december but within the next year or two as higher rates restrict economic activity fed policymakers expect growth to weaken substantially the central bank expects to cut the fed funds rate by about three quarters of a point in 2024 presumably in response to a slowing economy or possibly a recession rate hike impact on you here s how it could hit your wallet and portfolio how the fed works why does the fed raise interest rates and how do those hikes slow inflation at a news conference chair jerome powell said the fed s chief goal is bringing down high inflation we can t fail to do that he said but he said achieving that will probably mean some pain for the economy and millions of americans i think there s a very high likelihood we will have a period of much lower growth and it could give rise to an increase in unemployment he said will that mean a recession no one knows whether that process will lead to a recession or how significant a recession it will be powell said i don t know the odds what could cause a recession a recession is now likely in 2023 here s what could trigger a sharp downturn in the economy his comments mark a notable change in tone from just a few months ago when he voiced confidence the fed could boost rates to fight inflation without triggering a downturn still he said we haven t given up on the idea that we can have a very modest increase in unemployment the economy is already pulling back in a statement after the two day meeting the fed said recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production but job gains have been robust and the unemployment rate has remained low it added it anticipates that ongoing increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate 2 year treasury yield and stocks react stocks ended the day lower with the dow jones industrial average s p 500 and nasdaq composite all falling around 1 7 stocks experienced high levels of volatility after the fed announcement swinging between gains and losses multiple times throughout the final trading hours yields on 2 year treasury notes were above 4 the highest level since 2007 signaling that investors believe the fight to contain inflation will be prolonged what was the fed rate hike today wednesday s rate increase of 0 75 percentage point is expected to reverberate through the economy driving up rates for credit cards home equity line of credit and other loans fixed 30 year mortgage rates have jumped above 6 from 3 22 early this year at the same time households especially seniors are finally reaping higher bank savings yields after years of piddling returns barclays says fed policymakers had little choice but to lift rates sharply again after a report last week revealed that inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi rose 8 3 annually in august below june s 40 year high of 9 1 but above the 8 expected also employers added a healthy 315 000 jobs in august and average hourly pay increased a hefty 5 2 annually that could fuel further price increases as companies struggle to maintain profit margins markets that try to predict where rates are headed figured there was an 18 chance fed policymakers would hoist rates by a full percentage point wednesday are we in a recession in 2022 but goldman sachs economist david mericle says little has changed since powell told reporters in late july that the pace of rate hikes probably would slow to account for the increased risk of recession rather he says the fed is partly trying to deliver a message to stock markets that until recently had grown complacent about the prospect of more rate increases growth is slowing as the fed pushes borrowing costs higher the fed said wednesday it expects the economy to grow just 0 2 this year and 1 2 in 2023 below its june estimate of 1 7 for both years according to officials median estimate it predicts the 3 7 unemployment will rise to 4 4 by the end of next year well above its prior forecast of 3 9 and the fed s preferred measure of annual inflation which is different than the cpi is expected to decline from 6 3 in august to 5 4 by the end of the year slightly above fed officials previous 5 2 forecast and 2 8 by the end of 2023 that would be moderately above the fed s 2 target even without big fed rate increases inflation is expected to slow as supply chain bottlenecks ease commodity prices fall a strong dollar lowers import costs and retailers offer big discounts to thin bloated inventories powell though has said it s critical that the fed raise rates to tamp down consumers inflation expectations which can affect actual price increases he also said wednesday that improving supply troubles so far haven t moderated price increases as the fed expected inflation really hasn t come down as a result of those gains a growing number of economists believe the fed s aggressive campaign its key rate began 2022 near zero will tip the economy into recession economists says there s a 54 chance of a downturn next year up from 39 odds in june according to a survey by wolters kluwer blue chip economic indicators for months fed chair jerome powell said he thought the central bank could tame inflation without sparking a recession but in a speech last month at the fed s annual conference in jackson hole wyoming he acknowledged that higher rates and slower growth will also bring some pain to households and businesses these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation says nationwide economist ben ayers the fed sent another clear message in september that its fight against inflation is not finished

a database that follows the world s fossil fuel production reserves and release of carbon launched on monday the launch comes out at the same time as two important climate talks happening at the international level one is the climate talks at the united nation s general assembly in new york which began on september 13 the other is cop27 in sharm el skeikh which begins in november the database is called the global registry of fossil fuels it includes data from over 50 000 oil gas and coal fields in 89 countries that covers 75 percent of the world s reserves production and release of carbon into the atmosphere and it is available for public use a first for a collection of this size until now there has been private data available for purchase and research of the world s fossil fuel usage and reserves the international energy agency also keeps public data on oil gas and coal but it centers on the demand for those fossil fuels this new database however looks at what is yet to be burned the information could help environmental groups to pressure leaders for stronger policies reducing the amount of carbon they release the database was developed by carbon tracker it is a nonprofit organization that researches changes in energy use and their effects on financial markets global energy monitor also helped develop the database it is an organization that follows different energy projects around the world mark campanale is a founder of carbon tracker he said he hopes the database will empower groups to hold governments accountable campanale said that civil groups need to have more information on what governments are planning to do in terms of giving permits for coal oil and gas he said they need to actually begin to challenge this permitting process he added that it is very important that the world reduces carbon output carbon tracker research in the research carbon tracker found that the united states and russia still have enough underground and unused fossil fuel to go over the world s remaining amount of carbon budget the carbon budget is the point at which the world will go over the set amount of 1 5 degrees celsius of warming campanale said investors and shareholders should be holding the world s largest fossil fuel companies responsible when they approve new fuel mining projects campanale said the hope is the investment community will use the data to begin to challenge the investment plans of companies still planning to expand oil gas and coal projects rob jackson is a stanford university climate scientist who was not involved with the database research he added we already have enough extractable fossil fuels to cook the planet we can t afford to use them all or almost any of them at this point i m gregory stachel drew costley reported this story for the associated press gregory stachel adapted it for voa learning english _______________________________________________________________________ words in this story reserve n a supply of something that is stored so that it can be used at a later time accountable adj required to be responsible for something challenge v to say or show that something may not be true correct or legal extract v to remove something by pulling it out or cutting it out _______________________________________________________________________ what do you think of fossil fuels we want to hear from you we have a new comment system here is how it works write your comment in the box under the box you can see four images for social media accounts they are for disqus facebook twitter and google click on one image and a box appears enter the login for your social media account or you may create one on the disqus system it is the blue circle with d on it it is free each time you return to comment on the learning english site you can use your account and see your comments and replies to them our comment policy is here

barbados s prime minister mia mottley speaks during a press conference at an event where leaders of caribbean nations meet for a two day conference to discuss the region s approach to the cop27 climate talks in nassau bahamas on august 17 2022 reuters dante carrer reuters london barbados has issued the world s first government bond with a clause allowing payments to be suspended in the event of another global pandemic a move expected to attract interest from dozens of other countries savaged by the covid 19 crisis the caribbean has become something of a test region for sovereign debt innovation in recent years in 2015 grenada became the first to put a hurricane clause in one of its bonds sparking a flurry of copy cat natural disaster deals barbados new bond finalised in a deal with bankers on wednesday is likely to leave an even bigger imprint especially with smaller tourism dependent countries that were pushed to the brink of economic collapse during the covid 19 pandemic the bond to be repaid over the next 15 years will be the first to allow a government to suspend its payments if another outbreak similar to covid 19 happens payments can be suspended for up to two years at a time and twice if necessary but cannot be cancelled altogether the country s prime minister mia mottley believes that if this kind of option had been available in 2020 to many of the countries now in trouble much of the financial turmoil could have been avoided it would have unlocked just under a trillion dollars across the developing world mottley told reuters and hence we would not be facing the kind of debt crises that many countries are about to face credit suisse banker ramzi issa who led on some of the key financing aspects on the bond deal which involved a buyback said it was hugely significant it sounds like a simple concept but it took quite a bit of time issa said this a very valuable tool for governments to utilise is probably going to be a precedent for other sovereign financings the clause also covers tropical storms earthquakes and flooding but it is the pandemic element that is unique dose of vaccine to be triggered the world health organization who would have to formally declare a pandemic or public health emergency of international concern in its wording and barbados itself would have to be diverting significant amounts of its resources sovereign debt experts and bankers who have been heavily involved through this crisis and others over the years say the bond is a major milestone for the global borrowing markets it is like a dose of vaccine for your debt said sui jim ho a partner at cleary gottlieb the law firm that helped craft the clause for barbados you put it in and it protects you if another pandemic occurs the bond deal has an ecological feature too credit guarantees provided by the inter american development bank and an organisation called the nature conservancy tnc means barbados can borrow more cheaply saving itself between 40 50 million compared to its replaced old bond that money will be used specifically for protecting and rehabilitating the surrounding caribbean sea according to the terms of the deal making it what is known as a blue bond barbados marine territory is 430 times larger than its land area mottley estimates and its image of crystal clear waters lapping palm fringed beaches are crucial for tourism which accounts for over 40 of the nation s gdp and provides roughly 40 of jobs we are very much hopeful that others will follow tnc s managing director of sustainable debt slav gatchev said referring to barbados using tnc and inter american development bank as guarantors we have a pretty robust pipeline of half a dozen opportunities and we re hopeful that we are going to close two or three of those in the next 12 months

millennials are self centered and allergic to commitment they switch jobs every six months and will never buy homes and don t get them started on marriage and kids so go the clichés about the generation whose oldest members were born in the early 1980s but as more and more millennials enter their 40s they re proving that they re not so different from the generations before them raising families buying homes moving up in their careers and building wealth the average millennial net worth has increased 23 each year since 2016 topping 278 000 in 2021 according to research firm cerulli associates while that s significantly lower than gen x s 978 964 millennials saw the highest growth rate of any generation as a result of their rising wealth many millennials are seeking out a financial advisor for the first time finding a trusted advisor can be daunting if you ve never done it before here s a guide to what kind of planner may be a good fit how to vet them and what it will cost get started a good place to start looking is on the websites of planner networks including the national association of personal financial advisors the financial planning association the garrett planning network and the xy planning network you may be able to search by specialty whether it s working with the lgbtq community expatriates or first generation americans or by area of expertise such as taxes insurance divorce and stock options know what you want be clear on what you want to focus on with a planner do you want a few zoom meetings to discuss repaying student loans or the tradeoffs between paying down debt and saving for a down payment on a home some advisors offer packages on specific financial issues for an overall analysis of your finances a written plan can cost from around 1 000 to a few thousand or more depending on the level of detail from there you can implement any recommended changes on your own or pay for a longer term engagement with a planner instead of spending thousands of dollars a year on ongoing financial planning when you might not be ready for that doing a one time check in in the area you re most concerned with can be really great said sophia bera daigle 38 founder of gen y planning check advisor backgrounds a simple linkedin search can show an advisor s work history and their training where to do a more formal check depends on whether an advisor works for a brokerage house or is independent for brokers the self regulatory organization finra has a search engine that shows experience and disciplinary history it s pretty bare bones if an advisor is an independent registered investment advisor ria the sec s investment advisor public disclosure website is the place to go you ll see two important documents there form adv shows the number of clients a firm has assets under management the fee structure and more for an even more in depth look check out a firm s part 2 brochures rias are held to the fiduciary standard meaning they re legally obligated to put your financial interests before theirs brokers on the other hand can invest your money in products that earn them higher fees or commissions as long as the product is deemed suitable for your age risk tolerance and so on some advisors are fiduciaries for money they manage for clients but also take commissions for selling products like annuities know the credentials one acronym you ll see is cfp for certified financial planner cfps must have a bachelor s degree do extensive coursework in areas including retirement and estate planning pass two three hour tests and have at least two years of experience with financial planning another acronym to know is cfa for chartered financial analyst a cfa has expertise in investment management so the designation may come into play if you want someone to manage money the cfa institute says it takes an average of more than 1 000 hours of study and cfas must pass multiple four to five hour exams and have four years of professional experience if you re searching for help with student loans you may see the acronym cslp certified student loan professional it s not in the same league as cfps and cfas but it shows someone has a good understanding of the complexities of student loans if you re interested in tax advice a certified public accountant cpa or enrolled agent ea may make sense for help with life insurance and estate planning a clu for chartered life underwriter is a well respected credential check out the vibe after you ve zeroed in on a few planners it s time to set up a call some advisors offer first calls for free and others for a small fee key questions to ask your prospective advisor include who is their typical client what s their philosophy about financial planning and investing how will you meet many planners are 100 virtual now and how often what do they charge and a crucial question to ask yourself are they listening to you and asking good questions about your values and goals or is it more of a sales presentation jim marrocco runs thinking big financial which specializes in lgbtq customers he starts every client relationship with a discovery period to better understand their history values and vision money is such an intimate thing that you want to feel comfortable in the environment where you re talking about this marrocco said be clear on fees the cost of advisors varies greatly often depending on the complexity of your finances generally they re paid either by commissions on investments and products or with a set fee those fees can be charged by the hour month quarter year or by project if you want someone to manage money as opposed to help you with a financial plan they ll charge a percentage of assets managed rates vary widely depending on the planner s experience areas of expertise and the depth and length of the engagement said jeff jones director of financial planning at longview financial advisors and chair of the national association of personal financial advisors he s seen hourly rates range from 100 to 500 and said project based and flat fees can range from hundreds to tens of thousands of dollars

by james rickards government officials say all the right things about inflation and how they re trying to combat it but secretly they re not that upset about inflation why because inflation makes debt much easier to bear for a government with over 31 trillion of debt it can use all the help it can get let s see how we got here the u s government bond market was invented by alexander hamilton early in the first administration of george washington around 1790 the newly formed united states of america was facing claims from creditors who had financed the revolutionary war the congress had a simple solution default that s the american way but hamilton had a better idea he said the new government should borrow more money and use that to pay off the old creditors once we did that we would be deemed creditworthy and we could borrow even more money to pay off the money borrowed in the first round this plan was so successful that the u s treasury market has been around for 230 years that s how long the u s has been borrowing new money to pay off old debt in 1835 andrew jackson became the first and only president who cut the national debt to zero inflation is the only way out the story of u s debt is not one in which the debt went up steadily for 230 years the actual history is that the debt went up in times of war and it was paid back in times of peace debt went up in the war of 1812 the mexican american war of 1846 1848 the civil war world war i world war ii korea vietnam and under reagan to win the cold war the only major debt increase without war prior to 2000 was during the great depression but the war debt was paid off during times of peace including the 1820s 1870s 1920s and 1990s it was only after 2000 that things went off the rails and government debt went straight up under george w bush barack obama donald trump and joe biden now the debt is unmanageable without inflation inflation favors debtors because they get to pay back the debt with depreciating dollars it s easier to pay down debt because you re paying back debt with dollars that are less valuable than when you originally borrowed them so inflation eases the real value of debt on the other hand deflation increases the real value of debt with deflation the value of money increases making it more burdensome to pay off debt this is why debtors hate deflation the other way to deal with the debt is to default but there s no reason for the u s to default because the debt is in dollars and we can print the dollars that s the great advantage of having the world s leading reserve currency what french finance minister valéry giscard d estaing termed the exorbitant privilege in the 1960s the debt death trap people who say we can t pay off the national debt don t understand this market there s no need to pay off the national debt we just have to keep rolling it over but to do that we need to maintain our credit standing as hamilton understood once our credit is called into question the entire house of cards collapses we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this shows up first in higher interest rates then in a devaluation of the dollar and finally in illiquid markets where the debt just can t be sold except to the fed the final stage is hyperinflation and complete collapse of the currency and the bonds it s not going to happen tomorrow but we re getting closer to that endgame than many realize i ve said before that the u s is caught in a debt death trap monetary policy won t get us out because the velocity of money the rate at which money changes hands is dropping printing more money alone will not change that fiscal policy won t work either because of high debt ratios at current debt to gdp ratios each additional dollar spent yields less than a dollar of growth but because it must be borrowed it does add a dollar to the debt debt becomes an actual drag on growth the ratio gets higher and the situation grows more desperate the economy barely grows at all while the debt mounts you basically become japan the national debt is 31 5 trillion a 31 5 trillion debt would not be a serious issue if we had a 50 trillion economy but we don t have a 50 trillion economy we have about a 23 trillion economy which means our debt is bigger than our economy and it s stalling is it a recession yet we ve already had two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth which is the textbook definition of recession now we re facing the real possibility of a third quarter of negative growth the federal reserve bank of atlanta has published its estimate for third quarter growth using the data we have so far the result is a forecast of 0 5 gdp growth down from 1 3 last week don t be surprised if it goes down even further or that third quarter gdp will be negative what would the recession deniers say then now the fed is preparing to raise rates again this coming week the hot august inflation data means the fed will make another aggressive move probably 75 basis points but the fed is tightening into weakness which it ll discover once it s too late heading for a sovereign debt crisis in basic terms in the bigger picture the united states is going broke we re heading for a sovereign debt crisis i don t say that for effect i m not looking to scare people or to make a splash that s just an honest assessment based on the numbers tax cuts won t bring us out of it neither can structural changes to the economy both would help if done properly but the problem is simply far too large you can t grow yourself out of this kind of debt so an economic time bomb is ticking velocity is dropping debt is growing while growth is slowing the explosion will come in the form of asset bubbles bursting and stocks crashing which is already underway there s no way out of the debt death trap except through inflation and that s why they re not as upset about inflation as they d like you to believe

us fed set to raise interest rates as recession fears mount the us federal reserve is set to announce its interest rate decision as concerns grow that the aggressive actions could tip the economy into recession next year washington the federal reserve opened its second day of deliberations wednesday that are expected to produce another big increase in interest rates as it tries to cool the economy to tamp down the highest inflation in 40 years but recession fears are rising soaring prices are putting the squeeze on american families and businesses and already have become a political liability for president joe biden as he faces midterm congressional elections in early november but a contraction of the world s largest economy would be a more damaging blow to biden to the fed s credibility and the world at large economist diane swonk of kpmg warned the central bank will come under increasing pressure especially if unemployment begins to rise and fed officials will become political pinatas federal reserve chair jerome powell has made it clear that officials will continue to act aggressively to cool the economy and avoid a repeat of the 1970s and early 1980s the last time us inflation got out of control it took tough action and a recession to finally bring prices down in the 1980s and the fed is unwilling to give up its hard won inflation fighting credibility many economists are expecting a third straight three quarter point rate hike when the meeting concludes wednesday which would be an unprecedented action since that era but there is a chance the fed could opt for a full point increase powell and other central bankers have been sending the same message a downturn is better than continued high inflation given the pain that would inflict especially on those least able to withstand it since inflation began to accelerate in early 2021 fed officials have been overly optimistic that it would quickly recede to the central bank s 2 percent target economists mickey levy and andrew levin wrote in the wall street journal the economy now faces a serious risk of persistent high inflation the fed s policy setting federal open market committee fomc is scheduled to announce its decision at 1800 gmt wednesday powell s press conference after the meeting will be closely scrutinized for clues on how much more he thinks the fed will have to do before it declares victory in the inflation fight markets have been roiled in recent days by the fed s resolve to continue its forceful action but stocks opened higher on wall street wednesday ahead of the decision with investors perhaps hopefully powell will soften his tone avoiding a downturn inflation is a global phenomenon amid the russian war in ukraine on top of global supply chain snarls and covid lockdowns in china and other major central banks are taking action as well european central bank president christine lagarde said tuesday that more increases will be needed to stop inflation from taking hold us policymakers have the luxury of a strong job market and low unemployment which gives it some leeway to tackle high prices even so many economists say at least a short period of negative gdp in the first half of 2023 will be needed before inflation starts coming down despite a welcome drop in gasoline prices at the pump in recent weeks the disappointing consumer price report for august showed widespread increases but ian shepherdson of pantheon macroeconomics who believes inflation has peaked said incomes are growing amid rising wages which bodes well for the outlook the us economy is not in recession or headed there he said in an analysis the fed has front loaded its rate hikes cranking up the benchmark lending rate four times this year including two straight three quarter point hikes in june and july the aim is to raise the cost of borrowing and cool demand and it is having an impact the housing market has slowed as mortgage rates have surged recent statements from fed officials indicate more rate hikes are coming and no cuts until inflation is under control dousing hopes that had built up in markets following the july policy meeting the irony here is that just as the fed is ratcheting up the anti inflation rhetoric to fever pitch the forces needed to drive down inflation over the next year are now in place shepherdson said the fomc also will release the quarterly forecasts from members which will show how they feel about the direction of the economy and the impact of the policy moves and how soon inflation will come down
there s now little doubt esg has gone mainstream even the creator of the dilbert cartoon is taking potshots at an investment strategy that focuses on risks tied to the environment social and corporate governance in a series of illustrations published last week author scott adams criticized esg comparing it to a colicky baby with firehouse diarrhea adams is known for his strong opinions and his position on esg matches the political rhetoric coming from the governors of florida and texas as well as other republican leaders they say they want to obliterate the investment philosophy from the american corporate landscape adams is onboard in a youtube video that aired last week he said i am going to destroy esg or at least take a shot at it adams is a cartoonist politicians like florida s ron desantis arguably present a more clear and present danger to esg which is probably why pension giants representing the interests of millions of workers have turned their attention to him and other right wing american politicians efforts to attack esg based on an assessment of short term returns are ridiculous and meaningless said matti leppala chief executive of pensionseurope brian graff ceo of the american retirement association said savers ought to be free to invest in esg integrated plans if that s what they want the fact is that esg is now so hardwired into financial markets that effectuating wholesale abandonment of the principles behind it especially given intensifying crises in the environmental and societal spheres seems like a stretch at least in the near term esg how the esg industrial complex blurs the lines for do good investors sustainability benchmarks are taking over companies and funds that hold their stock it s how an hermès birkin bag can get tagged as good for democracy june 8 esg related assets are likely to exceed 50 trillion by 2025 when they will represent more than one third of the projected 140 5 trillion in total global assets under management analysts at bloomberg intelligence estimate additionally more than 90 of s p 500 companies now publish esg reports according to mckinsey and the securities and exchange commission is planning mandatory esg related disclosure rules that will apply to a large swath of corporate america but these realities aren t stopping republicans from focusing on what they see as some of the underlying hypocrisies of esg in some ways the criticisms leveled by adams and his fictional characters have come to be emblematic of that position dilbert is a syndicated comic strip that appears in more than 2 000 newspapers 57 countries and 19 languages adams says on his website in one of his cartoons adams pokes fun at the esg rating system with one character saying he can help improve his client s rating for 1 million the client asks don t you own an independent esg rating service and the character responds i didn t say it would be hard criticisms like that centered on the epidemic of greenwashing that s besmirched esg s reputation are certainly having an impact on some of the investing strategy s biggest adherents though perhaps not directly because of the cartoons nicolai tangen who runs norway s 1 2 trillion sovereign wealth fund called on investors to stay focused on esg related issues if they don t there s a real danger issues like protecting the environment will slip even further down the agenda he told the financial times
fewer deals are getting done to buy self storage properties fewer owners are offering their properties up for sale and fewer potential buyers are bidding the main culprit for the slowdown higher interest rates one reason is because most potential self storage investors rely on loans to leverage when making purchases in the sector as interest rates jumped higher that has cut into the yield on their potential investments so even though the income from self storage properties is as high as it has ever been and self storage properties seem likely to keep performing well in the future deals are harder to get done as buyers and sellers work out new market cap rates related reits private equity investors pile into self storage assets values are down slightly relative to march but still meaningfully higher compared to 24 months ago says steve mellon managing director of capital markets for jll working in the firm s houston offices that s a direct response to an uptick in costs of capital higher yields are needed to get to the same levered total returns high rents few vacancies for self storage properties related hines launches 1 billion fund for undervalued u s properties self storage properties are still earning record high rents with few vacant units self storage continues to outperform due to additional demand fueled by the pandemic says doug ressler manager of business intelligence for yardi matrix average street rents remained at the peak levels reached in june for both 10 ft by 10 ft non climate controlled units 132 and climate controlled units 151 those are very high rents compared to just two years ago back then average street rents hovered around 115 for non climate controlled units and 130 for climate controlled units much of that increase in rents came in just a few months in the spring of 2021 we had 20 percent to 25 percent rent growth say noah mehrkam ceo of self storage plus since then street rents have risen more moderately now we have normalized down to the mid teens nationwide average street rents grew 2 1 percent in july 2022 compared to the year before high rents at self storage properties are unlikely to be undercut on average by competition from hastily built new properties the amount of new supply delivered across the nation in 2022 will be equal to 3 2 percent of the existing inventory and annual deliveries will moderate to 2 5 percent of total stock by 2027 according to the latest forecast from yardi as construction loans have become more expensive and construction costs have increased we have seen a slowdown of new development says scott schoettlin managing director of skyview advisors investors are also drawn to self storage properties because they seem likely to weather the challenges that now seem most likely in the u s economy for example if inflation continues self storage properties can adapt by quickly raising rents as demand allows coupling the attractiveness of short lease periods with its history of relatively strong operating fundamentals during periods of economic slowdown self storage continues to attract new capital says skyview s schoettlin we expect that trend to continue in a high profile deal announced this week extra space storage inc a self storage reit and management company acquired storage express including 107 remote managed properties in illinois indiana kentucky and ohio in addition storage express founder and owner jefferson shreve has been appointed to the reit s board of directors total consideration for the purchase was approximately 590 million high interest rates stop many deals from getting done but interest rates have risen sharply since the beginning of the year the interest rates for many fixed rate loans are based in the yield on 10 year treasury bonds and that yield was 3 5 percent on sept 20 that s up more than 200 basis points since the beginning of the year so far investors are still interested in storage properties even if financing those properties is becoming more expensive according to a recent investor sentiment survey from marcus millichap interest rate increases have not changed self storage investor s position on buying or selling stephen weinstock national director of the self storage division for marcus millichap while self storage remains attractive given its recession resistant qualities investors shared that a significant increase in interest rates such as 150 basis points or more might influence their decision to continue to add self storage to their portfolios the federal reserve has pushed interest rates higher to fight inflation their efforts have certainly slowed the growth in prices for self storage properties potential buyers have trimmed a few basis points from the cap rates they are willing to accept and there are fewer buyers in the market to buy properties according to the experts interviewed for this story instead of 20 offers for a property there are now seven says anthony piscitelli senior vice president of investments at arcland based in washington d c however cap rates are still very strong not far from their lowest lows the equity community is still trying to find ways into our sector it still preservers our cap rates potential buyers are also more selective about what properties they bid on fully stabilized properties in top metropolitan statistical areas continue to draw strong interest says skyview s schoettlin secondary and tertiary market deals early lease up and certificate of occupancy deals are still seeing interest but typically have fewer bidders than what we saw at the peak sellers are less willing to offer properties for sale there is less volume because sellers are not as confident that they can get the price they want says piscitelli clearly this is not a great time to sell however many investors are still eager to put their money into self storage once there is clarity with interest rates we expect numerous bidders to be active says self storage plus mehrkam
for the first time california based electric vertical takeoff and landing evtol aircraft developer wisk aero and its major backer boeing nyse ba have released a comprehensive concept operations report for their uncrewed self flying air taxis the 64 page document represents the next step in wisk s plan to move ahead of its competitors by launching service with automated air taxis operated by multi vehicle supervisors mvs on the ground wisk s competitors including archer aviation nyse achr and joby aviation nyse joby intend to fly passengers initially using on board pilots before eventually transitioning to an automated platform wisk archer joby and others are flight testing full size prototypes of their evtols both archer and joby have said they expect to achieve faa certification in time to enter service in 2024 investors and leaders across the air taxi industry believe scalability is the key to unlocking the economic potential of this entirely new form of air transportation which aims to provide short on demand emission free flights above urban traffic gridlock operating fleets of self flying aircraft supervised by a human in the loop is seen by many as critical to successful and profitable scaled operations released tuesday the document titled concept of operations for uncrewed urban air mobility is a culmination of studies by experts across boeing wisk aurora flight sciences skygrid and other industry affiliates although wisk has been planning to operate self flying air taxis for quite some time the topic continues to spark lively discussions on social media while autonomy does well at the routine repetitive and sometimes boring tasks it cannot replace that unique human ability to do extraordinary things in an emergency that a person has never been taught learnt or programmed to do like the landing on the hudson or qantas flight 72 or the lion air pilots on a 737 max the day before the 737 max tragedy writes techno economics consultant gary vermaak on linkedin the remote supervisor will help somewhat but lacks not only the situational awareness of an onboard pilot and also like the pilot of the navy drone downed by the iranians may not have enough time to react virtually no mention of noise the report offers details about technology regulatory and social recommendations to help make uncrewed uam a safe reality but it virtually ignores a key topic central to the success of evtol air taxis it s an amazingly comprehensive conops document to help bring the industry forward said longtime evtol engineering pioneer mark moore formerly at nasa and uber elevate and now ceo at whisper aero but it has a major oversight it fails to address noise and community acceptance none of these vertiports happen unless the communities sign off on them it s not up to the faa it s not up to the industry it is literally the communities that have to agree to have these vertiports inserted into their communities and especially in terms of the noise the major acceptance criteria you don t have a transportation system for evtol only briefly does the report mention the noise issue saying electric propulsion will minimize aircraft noise and eliminate direct carbon emissions in a wisk white paper from 2021 the company claims the lower environmental and noise impact of evtol aircraft offers the potential to provide even closer connectivity between the airport and its surrounding communities highlights key elements of the boeing wisk report include a roadmap to integrate self flying uam into the u s national airspace system and an aggressive timeframe aiming to create a pathway forward for more equitable access to mobility across socioeconomic levels by the end of the decade a call to action for new flight rules a goal of boosting stakeholder engagement and convergence by key aviation stakeholders across manufacturing standards organizations testing agencies trade associations lawmakers and regulatory entities including the faa easa caa and others wisk and boeing make it clear they support making safe and affordable urban flight available for everyone the important work we re sharing today provides a stepping stone in the advancement of uam in the u s and the world said wisk ceo gary gysin in a news release the vision we have outlined is the result of many years of collaboration with boeing the faa nasa and key industry stakeholders as a result this document offers the most comprehensive framework proposed to date with a vision for enabling uam in the national airspace the boeing and wisk aero concept for advanced air mobility in urban environments multi vehicle supervisors the paper specifically addresses what it calls a critical element to safely scaling up the tempo of uam flight operations enhanced automation and a shift in how we define the role of pilots instead of individual pilots wisk intends to use a person on the ground who monitors multiple aircraft simultaneously in a role it calls multi vehicle supervisor working inside facilities called fleet operations centers the ground facilities will provide not only the usual airline fleet operations management and flight dispatch functions but also some essential functions currently performed by onboard pilots that will be allocated by design to automation and personnel on the ground the report says operations will be conducted during both day and night under visual and instrument meteorological conditions according to the white paper third party service providers will provide ground based solutions to replace key functions that are currently provided by onboard pilots the aircraft will be designed to automatically take off and land the plan outlines key roles within the fleet operations center detect and avoid the air taxis will be equipped with hazard detection and avoidance technology aimed at quickly and effectively identifying operational hazards including traffic weather terrain and obstacles according to the report the aircraft will autonomically execute avoidance maneuvers if appropriate interestingly the paper states that supervisory oversight and intervention will be possible but will not be required uam aircraft will be operated in accordance with applicable collision avoidance remain well clear and right of way regulations the report describes off nominal diversion flight paths emergency landing sites the paper details alternative landing sites in case an event forces a precautionary or emergency landing before they reach their destination vertiport three types of alternative landing sites are listed including diversion vertiports secure emergency landing zones elz that offer requirements for safe approach and landing and non secure elzs sites that have been determined safe for landing with minimal disruption such as golf courses airspace and instrument procedures the paper specifies that uam aircraft will depart from operate in and land in g e d c and b class airspace flight operations will use published required navigation performance rnp route and instrument flight procedures ifp including low altitude airways instrument approach procedures iap including missed approach procedures and transitions and standard instrument departures sid with departure transitions routes the report encourages the use of dedicated uam routes although dedicated uam routes and airspace will not be required their use would contribute to operational efficiency gains and would reduce atc interventions to resolve traffic conflicts the paper says by design uam routes will not interfere with other published routes and airspaces and thus will provide some procedural separation together with boeing we re releasing a roadmap for transitioning to a future where automated and uncrewed aircraft can safely carry passengers and cargo in urban and suburban areas wisk wiskaero september 20 2022 vertiports the concept of operations paper comes five months after wisk released a detailed report describing how evtol vertiports along with related systems and infrastructure could best accommodate automated air taxis wisk a privately held company backed by google co founder larry page was formed in 2019 but its roots date back to 2010 when it started as zee aero before merging with kittyhawk and then spinning off into its current company wisk is expected to reveal its sixth generation evtol soon eventually wisk says it plans to operate an automated air taxi service as a 14 cfr part 135 airline flying nearly 14 million annual flights and transporting 40 million passengers per year across 20 cities all with zero emissions wisk says its fleet will be the largest in the industry wisk has revealed very little about its timeframe expectations for entering service saying the answer to that question is largely out of its hands dependent on decisions of the faa and other industry regulators
triblive s daily and weekly email newsletters deliver the news you want and information you need right to your inbox federal reserve chair jerome powell vowed officials would crush inflation after they raised interest rates by 75 basis points for a third straight time and signaled even more aggressive hikes ahead than investors had expected we have got to get inflation behind us i wish there were a painless way to do that there isn t powell told a press conference in washington on wednesday after officials lifted the target for the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 3 to 3 25 higher interest rates slower growth and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve but they re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and having to come back and do it down the road again he said today the federal reserve raised interest rates adding to the sharpest series of hikes since the 1980s fed chair jerome powell said there s still a way to go economic correspondent paulsolman looks at what this means pic twitter com 0w3dghjxlb pbs newshour newshour september 21 2022 the s p 500 stock index ended near session lows pushing its slide from a january record to more than 20 the gauge struggled to find direction in the aftermath of the fed announcement climbing as much as 1 3 at one point yields on the two year treasury note topped 4 piercing that mark for the first time since 2007 the dollar rallied officials forecast that rates would reach 4 4 by the end of this year and 4 6 in 2023 a more hawkish shift in their so called dot plot than anticipated that implies a fourth straight 75 basis point hike could be on the table for the next gathering in november about a week before the u s midterm elections the fed chief agreed that the median of quarterly projections submitted by policy makers implied a further 125 basis points of tightening this year but he said there had been no decision taken on the size of the rate increase at the next meeting and stressed that a fairly large group of officials preferred to only lift rates by a percentage point by year end powell said his main message was that he and his colleagues were determined to bring inflation down to the fed s 2 goal they will keep at it until the job is done the phrase invoked the title of former fed chief paul volcker s memoir keeping at it we ve written down what we think is is a plausible path for the federal funds rate the path that we actually execute will be enough it will be enough to restore price stability he said that was a strong signal that officials would not hesitate to raise rates by more than they currently expect if that s what it takes to cool inflation further ahead rates were seen stepping down to 3 9 in 2024 and 2 9 in 2025 their projections showed this is powell s last roll of the dice and he is going all in said derek tang an economist at lh meyer in washington the higher unemployment forecasts are fair

events unfolding in the russia ukraine war this week represent the most dramatic escalation since the initial invasion in february russian president vladimir putin announced the mobilization of up to 300 000 reservists to active duty confirmed that four elections will be held to annex occupied ukraine territory and implied that nuclear weapons are on the table warning this is not a bluff president joe biden in a speech to the united nations wednesday shot back that the west would continue to stand in solidarity against russia s aggression which he slammed as having shamelessly violated the u n s principles biden did not reveal what actions if any the u s might take but the stakes for america couldn t be higher if the u s gets too aggressive in its support for kyiv we risk expanding the war in ways that could draw us in and in a worst case scenario trigger a nuclear escalation if the u s gets too aggressive in its support for kyiv we risk expanding the war in ways that could draw us in and in a worst case scenario trigger a nuclear escalation there is plenty of justification for condemning russia s war against ukraine as inexcusable and violating the u n s provisions and it s understandable that the white house and american public are sympathetic to ukraine but however much we may not like the war at this point it represents no threat to american national security as russia s shocking inability to defeat even the far weaker foe on its border demonstrates putin s conventional forces can t seriously challenge any other nato country much less the united states instead the real risk biden has to carefully manage right now is the degree to which the united states continues its military support to ukraine as too much help could lead putin to conclude his country may face an existential threat if putin feels too threatened he could genuinely consider resorting to tactical nuclear weapons part of putin s justification of this war last february was that he feared nato he would therefore likely only use them if he felt russia was in danger from nato itself such fears could lead him to use nuclear weapons most likely a low yield tactical nuclear weapon limited to ukrainian territory with the explicit warning that if nato came further he might escalate to strategic nuclear missiles which could reach u s territory it could be telling that biden ended his speech by declaring a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought in a march 2020 issue of foreign affairs biden wrote that he believed the sole purpose of the u s nuclear arsenal should be deterring and if necessary retaliation against a nuclear attack thus if biden s 2020 statement remains true and it should there is no cause to even consider the u s using nuclear weapons indeed it should be the primary concern of the president regardless of who holds the office to keep the needs of the united states first and foremost in view when deciding on actions up to this point biden has mostly threaded that needle and kept u s support to ukraine limited this russian escalation however will undoubtedly put pressure on him to do more ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy cannot allow part of his territory to be expressly annexed by a neighboring power via sham elections and will need to escalate his own actions in response these are certain to include new pleas to the west for longer range rockets fighter jets and top of the line tanks personnel carriers and self propelled artillery systems zelenskyy has long lobbied for more and heavier weapons from the west but until now his pleas haven t produced the outcome he desires when looking at the sum total of all the heavy weapons provided to ukraine by the west to date there are remarkably few of the types that kyiv would most need to drive russian troops out of ukrainian territory and win its war in fact the last two tranches of war supplies provided by the u s included large amounts of ammunition and supporting equipment but just four 105mm howitzers the smallest artillery pieces in the u s inventory missing from this cumulative western total were any modern weapons of the type that would be necessary to launch a truly large scale offensive to date i have seen no evidence that a western nation has even offered much less provided weapons such as the u s m1a2 tank m2a3 bradley fighting vehicle m109 paladin self propelled howitzers or modern fighter planes and air defense systems such as the patriot missile defense systems the reason the costs are enormous and surrendering sufficient quantities of each would weaken the defensive capacity of any western nation that provided them even the united states is not immune from this dynamic the pentagon admitted the u s had given so many 155mm artillery shells to ukraine almost 1 million that u s stocks were uncomfortably low putting at risk our ability to defend our own country if we had to fight an unexpected conflict it s logical that the u s has been reluctant to do more and putin s new moves shouldn t change that this is especially true given russia s call up won t be able to produce new combat formations for some four to six months at the absolute minimum it will take many weeks for russia to identify the 300 000 reservists and then transport them to training facilities which themselves have to be prepared with equipment clothing food and instructors to handle such major numbers the troops must then be given refresher training formed into new units and equipped with sufficient combat gear before being ready for deployment though zelenskyy will no doubt try to use his advantage in the meantime the expected fall rains should keep his window small and once putin has these new troops he will be in a much better position to overwhelm ukrainian positions augmenting his already large advantage in firepower with mass that makes it all the more important for biden to stay resolved to keep the u s footprint in the war small biden s speech before the u n on wednesday reflected our country s revulsion at the war raging in ukraine but was careful to avoid getting us more deeply involved in ways that could eventually get american troops involved in the war american national security is not presently at risk from the war between kyiv and moscow and biden must keep it that way

antiguan child refused admission to adventist school over dreadlocks and more news a five year old girl was denied admission at the new bethel seventh day adventist academy in liberta antiqua because of her dreadlocks hairstyle jordan mason the girl s mother told the antiqua observer that she was given an ultimatum to chop off her daughter s hair or not to return some critics suggested that the denial represented discrimination against the rastafarian community three groups condemned the school s decision saying no child should be barred from getting an education because of their hairstyle dr carson greene president of the south leeward conference of seventh day adventists said i posit that the charge of discrimination is most unfortunate and ill conceived the seventh day adventist church has long been an advocate of religious liberty i daresay that there has not been a stronger advocate and there is unarguably no other religious denomination within the christian faith that advocates more profoundly for religious freedom than the seventh day adventist church according to the observer dr greene said in the release that the new bethel sda academy like all our schools sees every child as one who is loved by god and as such desires the best for them he said this is with the understanding that parents are aware that the institution is a seventh day adventist christian school and is governed by christian values as articulated in its student handbook greene also said children do not have the right to do everything that adults do and uniforms and standards in school are designed to assist with the process of development of discipline it is for this reason why our handbook addresses matter of discipline in several areas and not just hairstyles it should not be strange to think that a private institution has standards involving hairstyles that are contrary to another religious group the reality is the seventh day adventist school is not the only institution that enforces such a rule leaders have also indicated that the situation has been amicably resolved and both parents and school are reasonably satisfied with the outcome reports the observer the child in question has been transferred to another school and the mother fully refunded for the fees she had paid out from the antigua observer seventh day adventist church defends controversial school

torturous in 2019 the general conference sued the ncc over its use of the adventist name trademark and logo asking kenya s high court for the ncc to be stopped from operating as a religious entity the gc argued that the ncc was registered as a private company the elders from gosere said the decision to join ncc has not made members non seventh day adventists the star reports we what to tell the world that we are still loyal members of the seventh day adventist church and we dispel the false narratives being spread that we have ditched the faith said alloys mokono church elder s chairman

full percentage point above the 3 25 to 3 5 they projected in june and close out next year at 4 5 to 4 75 according to their median estimate that suggests the central bank could approve another three

by gabriel stargardter uberaba brazil reuters in august last year brazilian farmer reinaldo huijsmans reported a break in at his house in the town of maracaju where thieves stole six legally registered weapons including a t4 taurus assault rifle huijsmans 39 is one of hundreds of thousands of brazilians now registered to own guns a group whose ranks have surged six fold since far right president jair bolsonaro was elected in 2018 and began loosening gun laws two months later huijsmans t4 turned up 1 300 kilometers 800 miles away in the hands of a heavily armed gang of alleged bank robbers ambushed and killed by cops near the city of varginha in minas gerais state according to an inventory of weapons apprehended from the gang seen by reuters the unexpected journey of huijsmans assault rifle which reuters traced using the t4 s serial number provided in his original statement to police has not previously been reported its presence in the hands of a group of alleged bank thieves highlights what federal police and public security experts say is an inevitable consequence of bolsonaro s gun liberalizations the criminal use of brazil s fast growing stock of legal weapons there is mounting evidence that legitimately acquired high caliber weapons are leaking onto the black market while the fragmented structure of brazil s security forces makes it difficult to tally how many such weapons have appeared at crime scenes over a dozen federal and state police officers told reuters that an increasing number of legally bought firearms are being used to commit crimes across the continent sized nation many of those have reached the most violent criminals in brazil the country with the world s highest number of murders the men holed up in varginha were part of a new breed of bank robbers conducting a wave of high impact assaults across the interior of the country police say known locally as novo cangaco gangs these specialized crews terrorize cities blow up bank safes and use human shields to escape often stealing millions of dollars reuters reported in a related story bolsonaro a nationalist former soldier has made it easier for brazilians to bulk buy firearms by registering with the army as hunters marksmen or collectors known as cacs with his encouragement nearly 700 000 brazilians have now accredited as cacs up almost 500 since 2018 bolsonaro says those weapons are being bought by good brazilians helping to reduce the murder rate which has fallen steadily since before he took office from 27 per 100 000 in 2017 to 19 last year experts dispute his theory warning there is a strong long term link between gun deaths and the number of firearms in circulation in july reuters reported that brazil s federal police disapproved of bolsonaro s gun policies arguing they would put more weapons in the hands of criminals there are now signs those fears are becoming a reality we constantly have issues with weapons bought by people with cac permits said one senior federal police officer speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the politically sensitive subject sadly we re going to have problems with this for decades bolsonaro s office did not respond to a request for comment the federal police directed questions to the army which grants cac permits it too did not respond neo banditry named after cangaceiros the ragtag bandits who roamed the arid northeast in the late 19th century brazil s novo cangaco gangs have benefited from bolsonaro s looser gun laws according to police probes and interviews with officers involved in gun control and organized crime investigations in december last year a group disguised in police uniforms robbed nearly 4 5 million reais from an armored truck in the southern city of guaiba investigators located one of the weapons used in the assault a brazilian made imbel 7 62 mm assault rifle and found it had been bought by a 36 year old cac permit holder paid 2 000 reais to buy the weapon on behalf of the gang according to rio grande do sul state civil police in july police in the southern city of itajai arrested three alleged bank robbers suspected of stealing around 230 000 reais in two bank heists the group which police said was planning another imminent assault was found with two pistols a shotgun and two t4s all of which were legally acquired by one of the cac registered gang members eduardo ferraz the lead detective on the case told reuters of all the weapons now available to brazil s gun fans the t4 has emerged as the weapon of choice for its gangsters manufactured by brazilian gunmaker taurus sa the t4 hit the local market in 2019 as a direct result of bolsonaro s newly liberalized gun laws it has been a huge success for the company which has sold around 60 000 units of the 5 56 mm semi automatic carbine helping to lift its share price around 350 since the start of 2019 before the looser rules an imported 5 56 mm assault rifle equivalent to the t4 cost 60 000 reais on the black market according to ivan marques managing director of the international action network on small arms but now marques said anyone registered as a cac can legally buy a t4 for 16 000 reais with a factory guarantee half a dozen federal officers told reuters that brazil s gangs and particularly sao paulo s first capital command pcc south america s most powerful criminal franchise are increasingly using legalized gun owners as straw buyers to replenish arsenals that one officer said will last a hundred years a common tactic used by gangs as seen in the case of huijsman s t4 is to steal weapons from cac permit holders homes but sometimes police say the legal buyer is in on the ruse last month sao paulo state civil police said they had arrested a cac permit holder with 700 5 56mm rounds in his car he confessed to having sold weapons to the pcc that he had previously reported as stolen huijsmans told reuters he was an innocent victim of a burglary jackson frederico vale the detective probing huijsmans case said he didn t suspect the farmer of foul play in other cases gangsters are withholding their criminal pasts when they apply for cac permits banking on overworked army bureaucrats to wave through their applications in july federal police in the minas gerais city of uberaba arrested a well known local criminal with family ties to the pcc for failing to alert army cac certifiers to his criminal background the 36 year old who had previously been charged with murder drug trafficking and theft was found with seven firearms including a t4 novo cangaco situated on a major cocaine trafficking route between paraguay and brazil s atlantic ports uberaba and nearby towns in minas gerais have proven fertile ground for novo cangaco raids the wealthy beef farming city has suffered two major bank robberies in the last five years including the 2019 assault of its main banco do brasil branch on oct 31 2021 minas gerais military police and brazil s federal highway police carried out two raids against alleged bank robbers hiding out near varginha killing 26 of them no cops were injured with the lopsided toll leading to accusations of illegal executions that are now being probed by the federal police as justification for the raids minas gerais military police briefed reporters that the gang was about to rob 65 million reais 13 million from varginha s banco do brasil they also said they believed the alleged robbers were the same crew that had hit a banco do brasil branch in the city of aracatuba a few months earlier although they presented no evidence many of the 26 people killed were career criminals with checkered pasts including murder theft and drugs charges according to investigators at least four were from uberaba a federal police officer involved in the investigation of the killings agreed the crew was planning a robbery but the officer speaking anonymously to discuss an ongoing probe said the target was an armored vehicle carrying 20 30 million reais after the raids police combed through the gang s arsenal they found a 50 machine gun capable of taking down a low flying helicopter two 7 62 mm assault rifles and around a dozen 5 56 mm carbines including huijsmans t4 marques the gun expert said huijsmans rifle wouldn t be the last legally acquired firearm to turn up at a crime scene it s certain that many of those weapons which entered circulation in the last four years will end up in the hands of criminals he said 1 5 1964 reais reporting by gabriel stargardter editing by brad haynes and frank jack daniel
the federal reserve s interest rate hike has investors in a near panic stock investors have been waiting to hear from the federal reserve about the central bank s plans for interest rate policy in the next year or two and what they found out on wednesday wasn t good news in their minds after oscillating in both directions following the 2 p m edt announcement and subsequent press conference the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 s p 500 gspc 1 20 and nasdaq composite ixic 1 79 all started heading lower with losses ending up just short of 2 on the day index daily percentage change daily point change dow 1 70 522 s p 500 1 71 66 nasdaq 1 79 205 the fed s decision indicated its resolve to put fighting inflation ahead of protecting economic growth calling the bluff of wall street bulls who had hoped that the central bank would turn more dovish as gasoline prices peaked perhaps the biggest indication that the stock market now fully expects a recession is the fact that the single stock among the dow jones industrials that posted a rise in stock price today was retail giant walmart wmt 0 35 read on for a more complete explanation of what the fed did and how walmart s gain could be the economy s pain higher rates for longer much of what the federal reserve chose to do on wednesday was fully expected the central bank boosted its federal funds rate by three quarters of a percentage point setting a new range of 3 to 3 25 in doing so it chose not to make the more aggressive full point move that some economists had started to see as a distinct possibility however what did seem to surprise investors was the resolve with which fed chair jerome powell remained committed to fighting inflation even at the cost of economic growth and a possible recession powell acknowledged that high rates will cause economic pain for millions of americans with the potential to weaken the labor market and raise borrowing costs for consumers yet as the fed chair sees it adding up all that pain still leaves the central bank s aggressive action as a preferable alternative to allowing inflation expectations to become entrenched within the economy sacrificing price stability would simply require even more draconian measures in the future as powell sees it making it better to get the difficult work out of the way sooner rather than later fed officials expect further increases to take short term rates far above the 4 mark moreover it could be two or three years before rates start to fall again walmart s history of recession protection for students of stock market history walmart s 1 gain on wednesday brought back memories of the great recession in 2008 and 2009 during 2008 the s p 500 fell 37 with many large cap stocks falling even more sharply yet walmart stood out as one of the only dow stocks to post even modest gains during that year it s easy to understand walmart s appeal during tough economic times shoppers don t stop needing the things they buy in the retail industry just because money s tight but they do find ways to economize one common thing shoppers naturally do is to stop going to more expensive retailers and instead take advantage of lower prices from companies like walmart dollar store retailers have seen similar trends during times of economic stress it s premature to call a recession a certainty at this point however investors are clearly positioning their portfolios as though the likelihood of a recession was high that could continue to benefit walmart even if the rest of the stock market sees steep declines like the ones major indexes suffered wednesday

and the weak consumer sentiment our solid second quarter results underscore the resilience of our defensive business models and our commitment to building and strengthening our brand s trustworthiness before taking a closer look at business updates i would like to start with a brief recap of the milestone regulatory developments in our industry beginning in the first quarter of 2022 the relevant government authorities in china have issued a series of implementing rules and guiding opinions to strengthen oversight of e cigarette products and regulate the e cigarette industry including the administrative measures for e cigarettes that s coming to effect in may and the new national standards that will become effective on october 1 2022 now let me share our progress on the relevant license applications as required by the administration measures to date two of our subsidiaries have obtained the license for manufacturing enterprise from the state tobacco monopoly administration stma to conduct manufacturing activities under the regulatory guidance specifically one is approved to manufacture e liquids and the other is approved to own the relx brand and manufacture relx brand e vapor rechargeable devices cartridge products and other relevant products obtaining this license marked an important milestone in our strategic road map that will actively embrace the new paradigm that comes from regulatory compliance we believe our solid fundamentals industry leading research and development capabilities and seasoned teams illustrates furthering our mission to achieve full regulatory compliance to our operation according to standards to build on this progress we have redoubled our efforts to develop new products that meet the applicable requirements while fulfilling users demands some of our new products were among the first flagship products in the industry to obtain approvals under the new national standards a powerful validation of our industry leading r d capabilities we look forward to bringing the approved products to market that assume in our confidence that our products quality performance and safety will continue to resonant well with our users currently we have several additional newly developed products in the process of technical reviews and many more in the application pipeline in the future we will remain committed to fulfilling our users demand for safe high quality products new strict compliance with regulations while exploring new growth opportunities in the industry in particular we strongly believe that r d is a key to our success in the sustainable future growth it is r d s to quickly rollout compliant new products and maintain our brand s competitiveness here are a set of metrics tracking our r d spending our non gaap r d expense ratio has increased from 1 5 in 2018 to 3 6 in the first half of 2022 and is expected to further increase in the coming years beyond product r d we are also dedicated to fundamental scientific research to protect our users health working relentlessly to better understand and minimize the health risks associated with the products to that end in addition to swarming our own scientific labs we have partnered with various leading research institutions including 10 universities two hospitals and several independent academic research houses to conduct related research and development building a firm foundation for ongoing product development and innovation furthermore in the second quarter we collaborated with shenzhen institutes of advanced technology and chinese academy of sciences and e vapor cooling agent inhalation studies which concludes that e vapor products containing ws 23 have lower rewarding effects than pure nicotine products a breakthrough we believe that afford us to deliver better safer for adult smokers turning now to our operations alongside our efforts to comply with applicable regulations we continue to streamline our business structure and operational workflow during the second quarter to enhance our ability and flexibility our approach has yield good initial results with non gaap expense we show decreasing quarter over quarter chao will elaborate on this further a bit later we believe the comprehensive operational enhancements will enable us to tackle critical changes and swiftly adapt to the market evolution

leading technologies and scientific advancements high quality user base resilient business model and agile overall execution our fundamental essence that will empower us to sustainable quality growth in the long run and further strengthen our leadership position in the industry more importantly we will continue to seek regulatory approval to meet all applicable requirements on schedule while

our cfo chao lu who will elaborate further on some of our last quarter initiatives and go over our operational and financial results in more detail chao please go ahead chao lu chief financial officer thank you kate and hello everyone i will now provide a summary overview of our financial results for the second quarter of 2022 in the context of a challenging macro environment and covid resurgence consumer sentiment went to a record low in the second quarter according to the national bureau of statistics of china the overall consumer confidence index fell from 121 5 in january 2022 to 88 9 in june 2022 also overall retail sales in china decreased by 0 7 year over year in the first half of 2022 proactively adapting our business to the market and diligently improving our operational efficiencies we delivered solid and healthy results for the second quarter recording net revenue of rmb 2 2 billion however we believe that elevated level of revenue in the second quarter was primarily due to frontloading of sales in the downstream value chain in anticipation of the discontinuation of our older products as the industry transition period neared its end in the third quarter revenue decreased year over year however it was mainly due to the suspension of store expansions and new product launches during the regulatory transition period as work to strictly comply with the relevant requirements our gross profit was approximately rmb 1 billion in the second quarter with gross margin growth 43 8 for the second quarter compared with 45 1 in the same quarter of 2021 the decrease was primarily due to an unfavorable product mix shift an increase in inventory provision and an impairment loss recognized for pp e to comply with recent regulatory developments due to a significant increase in share based compensation expenses to rmb 193 2 million from a positive rmb 172 5 million in the same quarter of last year our operating expenses reached rmb 530 9 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with rmb 167 2 million in the same period of last year specifically our selling expenses decreased by 2 7 to rmb 122 6 million in the second quarter of 2022 from rmb 126 million in the same period of 2021 mainly driven by a decrease in salaries welfare benefits and branding material expenses while partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expenses general and administrative expenses increased to rmb 290 7 million in the second quarter of 2022 from rmb 46 1 million in the same quarter of 2021 mainly driven by the increases in share based compensation salaries and welfare benefits as we remain focused on strengthening our r d capability our research and development expenses were rmb 117 6 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with a positive rmb 4 9 million in the same period of 2021 the increase was mainly driven by increases share based compensation expenses salaries and welfare benefits and consulting expenses to echo what kate mentioned about our business structure enhancements our proactive cost optimization initiatives also continued to bear fruits this quarter if we exclude share based compensation our non gaap expense ratio decreased to 15 1 in the second quarter from 20 9 in the prior quarter notably non gaap selling expense ratio decreased to 4 7 in the second quarter from 6 9 in the preceding quarter if we exclude the impact of one off items such as impairment loss our adjusted expense ratio was similar to that of similar to the level than same period of last year we believe the adjusted metrics may better reflect our efforts and achievements with respect to operational improvements during the quarter as a result our non gaap net income increased to rmb 634 7 million from rmb 351 8 in the prior quarter non gaap basic and diluted net income per ads were rmb 0 494 and rmb 0 492 respectively in the second quarter of 2022 moving on to our balance sheet we have a solid balance sheet in particular our cash position remains strong with cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term bank deposits short term investments and long term bank deposits net of rmb 16 8 billion as of the end of june 2022 compared with rmb14 9 billion a year ago in addition we generated a positive cash operating cash flow of rmb 1 4 billion with an increase in the operating cash flow over non gaap net income ratio to 228 in the second quarter of 2022 from 100 in the same period of last year our strong cash position and sufficient operating cash flow cash inflow enable us to agilely adjust our business while facing challenges and support our efforts to capture potential growth opportunities in the industry in light of the regulatory changes we are off to a slow but steady start of the sales of our new products that are compliant with the national standards through the new transaction system amended by the regulatory in closing we believe that e vapor products will continue playing a vital part in harm reduction for adult smokers in the new industry new regulatory era with our product s superior quality and safety our brand will continue to resonate well with adult smokers moving forward we will focus on cost optimization while continuing to reinforce our product competitiveness to create sustainable long term growth for our shareholders this concludes our prepared remarks today we will now open the call to questions operator please go ahead questions answers operator our first question comes from lydia ling from citi please go ahead lydia ling citi analyst hi everyone thanks management and this is lydia from citibank and it s also for your presentation and if ok i have three questions and the first one is actually some of the new products that you introduced in the lesser regions so one what s the user feedback so far and also as transition period and upgrade it later and so what s your thoughts on new flavors impact on the sales volume in the following quarters so this is the first question and the second question is actually we saw that the retailers now may have over three brands at the store level so we want to know your view on the competitive landscape looking forward and the last question is actually now we are in september so could you share with us order to date performance and also your outlook for the fourth quarter and 2023 thank you chao lu chief financial officer thank you very much lydia so the first question is mainly on the sales volume 43 and the second one is mainly on how the competitive landscape goes and the final one is on the outlook for the fourth quarter and so so regarding the first one how would be the impact after we launch products that comply with the national standards as we just launched these products a few weeks ago so to be honest i think the vast majority of our business happened to have the chance to try our products and given that we are still in the transition period which will last until the september 30 it s difficult for us to give a quantitative guidance regarding future quarters given that there are some products are still being approved at the moment but when we look back the lessons and data learned from the in the united states effect in 2020 we put few quarter for users in the u s market to adapt to the new flavors and we covered the industry volume so there have been more and more products been approved in the past few weeks which we believe to be launched very soon and to cater more user needs so we ll have more clearer picture of our user demand changed in the late 4q after users have adapted their flavor inventories on hand and regarding the second question that the multiple brands selling in one single store going forward so the ultimate goal for the retailer is to maximize their store publicity and their own profitability instead of selling only one brand in a single store so retailers have to sell multiple brands under the new regime we don t expect any material impacts on the competitive landscape as retailers have always have the chance to select their definitive brand to collaborate so we believe the brand share of the store should be determined by product quality brand equity and user base and based on our observations our brand share remains solid in the past few months but in the future we will continue to invest in strengthening our r d capabilities and our non gaap r d expense has been steadily increasing in the past quarters and we expect it to further increase in the coming quarters with our increased efforts in r d we will continue to offer a better safer experience for adult smokers so the last question is on the fourth quarter s outlook as we prepared in our opening remarks our second quarter revenue benefited from the frontloading of sales in the downstream value chain in anticipation of the discontinuation of our older products as the industry transition period near its end in the third quarter the resulting prior periods for comparison will impact our sequential third quarter results and meanwhile we gradually decreased our shipments of old products throughout the third quarter to better transit into the new regime which will affect our fourth quarter number so given that the transition period will end on the september 30 it will take more time for us to further project the future outlook especially for the fourth quarter thank you for your questions lydia ling citi analyst thank you operator our next question comes from charlie chen from china renaissance please go ahead charlie chen china renaissance analyst thank you management for taking my questions i ve got two questions the first one is regarding your product pipeline especially the new products which should be abide with the new regulations or new national standard so what i want to ask is what is the status of your new product application in particular how many has been approved how many now still pending and also how many has been rejected if there is any and what is your product portfolio plan for the coming year for the next twelve months or so so that s my first question and my second question is about the schedule of your product recycling or any reshuffling i remember last time you said you planned to phase out your older products in the second quarter or third quarter so i just want to know when exactly have you phased out or stopped producing older products which is not abide by the national new national standards and when is the time when you have new products started production or started to sell to the markets so that s my two questions thank you chao lu chief financial officer thanks charlie so the first one is mainly on the product approvals and the second one is on the old product results so i mean for the new regime every new product must get approval before in launch and the allocation result will be an ongoing process so we will continue diversifying our product portfolio under the new regime and other quality products for adult smokers as of today we have retained product approvals for low teens of devices and low teens of cartridge products and some of our applications are still under review and we expect the number of our approved products will keep growing and regarding the second one is about the old product phase outs we gradually slower our pace in production throughout the third quarter with the majority of our production occurring in the first half of third quarter our products that comply with national standards we began and participate the testing of the transition platform this month we have been receiving more approvals in the past few weeks and they are probably are still in the early stage of approving of these new products our front sales of these new products may not be accurately discussed demand as our users still have access to our old products and these new products are just being approved for instance so we will be able to provide more updates after the transition period thank you charlie chen china renaissance analyst thank you operator the next question comes from peihang lyu from cicc please go ahead peihang lyu citi analyst hi there management this is peihang at cicc and thank you for the opportunity to take my questions i have three questions actually and the first one is could you please introduce a bit about the current inventory level of your original products and will there be any further inventory impairment the second question is i would love to know what are your recent adjustments after stores cannot be operated exclusively and my last one is since the national e cigarette online trading platform had been launched i would like to know what is your latest progress with regard to the cooperation with tobacco administration and other thank you chao lu chief financial officer thank you peihang so the first one is on the inventory lack and also inventory impairment practice and the second one is on the exclusivity time that we are pretty happy about store owners and the final one is latest developments regarding the transition platform so regarding the inventory lack for our new products and requirement inventory impairments there has been a gradual but steady start with our sales of our new product compliant with national standards and also our users will need more time to digest the inventories and adjust their user behaviors so the inventory level for new products is relatively low compared with the lack that we have for obviously we had before the transition period and regarding the inventory positions the current inventory positions for our product sets do not comply with new national standards and raw materials that are no longer applicable since the fourth quarter of 2021 we don t expect we can incur more significant inventory provisions regarding products in compliance with national standards in the coming quarters and the second question is on the exclusivity term that we have for store owners previously after the stma announced the rule that the exclusive distribution agreements are not allowed for branded stores in march 2022 we began terminating our agreements with store owners and returning their deposits so as of the end of second quarter most of this work has been completed in our non exclusivity will enable us to carry out only at a brand in the future brands with substantial brand equity and user mindshare i will relax there still be retailer platform owners and such process will help them to include they have based on our own observations since the termination of their exclusivity many additional store owners have started selling relx branded products and finally regarding the process that we have for the trends at launch so in these months beginning several regions across the country have begun to track the national transition platform as a leader in china s e vapor industry we were pleased to be among the first two brands selected to participate the transition process has been smooth and we are grateful for the products provided by the stma for instance our stock has been offered trainings from researched industries quality supervision test vendors and the clinical testing cooperation by the stma on the national standards thanks for their help and assistance our new products were among the first batch of products in the industry to obtain approval under the new regime thank you peihang lyu citi analyst that s very clear thank you very much operator due to time constraints now i would like to turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks sam tsang head of investor relations thank you once again for joining us today if you have further questions please feel free to

a tough legal defeat is making analysts much more bearish on the company what happened the hits keep coming for sotera health shc 2 39 the beleaguered company that just suffered a stinging legal defeat for the third day in a row the company s stock fell hard diving by nearly 11 this was due to yet another analyst lowering his recommendation on the shares so what jpmorgan chase prognosticator tycho peterson weighed in with a new take on sotera stock before market hours to no one s surprise he has become notably more bearish on the company s future due largely to those legal woes he knocked his recommendation down two pegs to underweight sell in other words from the previous overweight buy commensurately he also radically reduced his price target to 9 per share from 26 peterson isn t the only analyst scrambling to make adjustments to their takes on the healthcare company his move comes a day after another high profile bank goldman sachs reduced its recommendation on the stock although this modification wasn t as drastic in goldman s case analyst amit hazan lowered his to neutral from the preceding buy these come quickly on the heels of a major loss in an illinois county court in which a jury awarded a plaintiff a 363 million payment from sotera and two related businesses the three had been accused by the plaintiff susan kamuda of causing breast cancer in herself and hodgkin s lymphoma in her son via emissions from a factory in the chicago area now what kamuda is only one of a multitude of parties suing sotera and the pair of other businesses one of which is the subsidiary sterigenics that operated the facility the future certainly looks challenging at the very least for the company due to the looming lawsuits so the new analyst takes are entirely justified

mortgage rates have jumped home sales have slumped and credit cards and auto loans have gotten pricier savings rates are slightly juicier though as the federal reserve has rapidly increased interest rates many economists say they fear that a recession is inevitable in the coming months and with it job losses that could cause hardship for households already hurt worst by inflation wednesday the federal reserve sharply raised its key short term rate by three quarters of a point for a third straight time even as its previous rate increases are being felt by households at all income levels the fed s latest move has raised its benchmark rate to a range of 3 to 3 25 the highest level in 14 years its steady rate increases have already made it increasingly costly for consumers and businesses to borrow for homes autos and other purchases and more hikes are almost surely coming fed officials are expected to signal wednesday that their benchmark rate could reach as high as 4 5 by early next year here s what to know how does raising interest rates reduce inflation if one definition of inflation is too much money chasing too few goods then by making it more expensive to borrow money the fed hopes to reduce the amount of money in circulation eventually lowering prices which consumers are most affected anyone borrowing money to make a large purchase such as a home car or large appliance will take a hit said scott hoyt an analyst with moody s analytics the new rate pretty dramatically increases your monthly payments and your cost he said it also affects consumers who have a lot of credit card debt that will hit right away that said hoyt noted that household debt payments as a proportion of income remain relatively low though they have risen lately so even as borrowing rates steadily rise many households might not feel a much heavier debt burden immediately i m not sure interest rates are top of mind for most consumers right now hoyt said they seem more worried about groceriesand what s going on at the gas pump rates can be something tricky for consumers to wrap their minds around how will this affect credit card rates even before the fed s decision wednesday credit card borrowing rates have reached their highest level since 1996 according to bankrate com and these will likely continue to rise and with inflation raging there are signs that americans are increasingly relying on credit cards to help maintain their spending total credit card balances have topped 900 billion according to the federal reserve a record high though that amount isn t adjusted for inflation john leer chief economist at morning consult a survey research firm said its polling suggests that more americans are spending down the savings they accumulated during the pandemic and are using credit instead eventually rising rates could make it harder for those households to pay off their debts those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards because of weak credit scores are already paying significantly higher interest on their balances and they ll continue to as rates have risen zero percent loans marketed as buy now pay later have also become popular with consumers yet longer term loans of more than four payments that these companies offer are subject to the same increased borrowing rates as credit cards for people who have home equity lines of credit or other variable interest debt rates will increase by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which follows the fed s what if i want to buy a car auto loans are at their highest levels since 2012 according to bankrate com s greg mcbride rates on new auto loans are likely to go up by nearly as much as the fed s rate increase that could knock some lower income buyers out of the new vehicle market said jessica caldwell executive director at edmunds com caldwell added that the entire increase isn t passed on to consumers some automakers are subsidizing rates to attract buyers bankrate com says a 60 month new vehicle loan averaged just over 5 last week up from 3 86 in january a 48 month used vehicle loan was 5 6 up from 4 4 in january many lower income buyers have already been priced out of the new vehicle market according to caldwell automakers have been able to get top dollar for their vehicles because demand is high and supply is low for more than a year the industry has been grappling with a shortage of computer chips that has slowed factories worldwide how are savers affected the rising returns on high yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit cds have put them at levels not seen since 2009 which means households may want to boost savings wherever possible you can also now earn more on bonds and other fixed income investments though savings cds and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes online banks and others that offer high yield savings accounts can be exceptions these institutions typically compete aggressively for depositors the catch they sometimes require significantly high deposits in general banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to boost their profits by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering juicer rates to savers will this affect rents home ownership last week the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6 its highest point in 14 years meaning that rates on home loans are about twice as expensive as they were a year ago mortgage rates don t always move perfectly in tandem with the fed increase instead tracking the expected yield on the 10 year treasury note the yield on the 10 year treasury note has reached nearly 3 6 its highest level since 2011 asking rents are up 11 from last year said daryl fairweather an economist with the brokerage redfin but price growth has slowed and some renters are moving to more affordable areas will it be easier to find a house if i m still looking to buy if you re financially able to proceed with a home purchase you re likely to have more options than at any time in the past year sales of both new and existing homes have dropped steadily for months how have the rate hikes influenced crypto cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have dropped in value since the fed began raising rates so have many previously high valued technology stocks bitcoin has plunged from a peak of about 68 000 to under 20 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like treasuries have become more attractive to investors because their yields have increased that makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive in turn still bitcoin continues to suffer from problems separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed shaking the confidence of crypto investors what s prompting the rate increases the short answer inflation over the past year inflation has clocked in at a painful 8 3 so called core prices which exclude food and energy also rose faster than expected fed chair jerome powell warned last month that our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional a remark widely interpreted to mean the fed will fight inflation with rate increases even if it leads to deep job losses or a recession the goal is to slow consumer spending thereby reducing demand for homes cars and other goods and services eventually cooling the economy and lowering prices powell acknowledged that aggressively raising interest rates would bring some pain what about my job some economists argue that widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices one argument is that a tight labor market is fueling wage growth and higher inflation in august the economy gained 315 000 jobs there are roughly two job openings advertised for every unemployed worker job openings continue to exceed job hires indicating employers are still struggling to fill vacancies noted odeta kushi an economist with first american as a result some argue higher unemployment might cool wage pressures and tame inflation research published earlier this month by the brookings institution stated that unemployment might have to go as high as 7 5 to reduce inflation to the fed s 2 target will this affect student loans borrowers who take out new private student loans should prepare to pay more as as rates increase the current range for federal loans is between about 5 and 7 5 that said payments on federal student loans are suspended with zero interest until dec 31 as part of an emergency measure put in place early in the pandemic president joe biden has also announced some loan forgiveness of up to 10 000 for most borrowers and up to 20 000 for pell grant recipients is there a chance the rate hikes will be reversed stock prices rose in august based on hopes that the fed would reverse course but it looks increasingly unlikely that rates will come down anytime soon economists expect fed officials to forecast that the key rate could reach 4 by the end of this year they re also likely to signal additional increases in 2023 even to 4 5 will there be a recession short term rates at these levels will make a recession likelier by increasing the cost of mortgages car loans and business loans while the fed hopes that higher borrowing costs will slow growth by cooling the hot job market and capping wage growth the risk is that the fed could weaken the economy causing a recession that would produce significant job losses

introduction effective as of august 1 2022 the delaware legislature adopted an amendment to section 102 b 7 of the delaware general corporation law dgcl that permits a delaware corporation to implement a provision in its certificate of incorporation to eliminate or limit the personal liability of certain officers of the corporation for monetary damages to the corporation or its stockholders for the breach of the fiduciary duty of care an exculpation provision prior to such amendment and since 1986 section 102 b 7 of the dgcl was only available to exculpate directors of a corporation from personal liability for the breach of the fiduciary duty of care but remained unavailable to corporate officers the delaware general assembly originally enacted section 102 b 7 to address a perceived crisis in the market for directors and officers liability insurance this article will address 1 key considerations concerning newly amended section 102 b 7 including among other things the limitations placed on exculpation the types of claims subject to exculpation the remedies that remain available with respect to exculpatory claims the types of corporate officers to which exculpation may apply and temporal requirements concerning the effectiveness of an exculpation provision in a corporation s certificate of incorporation and 2 a model exculpation provision including a discussion of its common features and the various terms and conditions to consider when drafting such a provision key considerations concerning newly amended section 102 b 7 a delaware corporation itself does not owe fiduciary duties to its stockholders and cannot be sued by its stockholders for breach fiduciary duties are owed by the directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders and therefore they are personally liable for any such breach section 102 b 7 of the dgcl allows a delaware corporation to include an exculpatory provision in its certificate of incorporation that eliminates or limits the personal liability of an officer to the corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for a breach of fiduciary duty subject to the following conditions and limitations 1 only applicable to the fiduciary duty of care officers of delaware corporations owe a fiduciary duty of care and such duty is the same as that owed by directors of a delaware corporation if officers actions qualify for the presumptions of the business judgment rule the standard for a finding of a breach of the duty of care is gross negligence therefore delaware courts have held that in essence section 102 b 7 given the other limitations on exculpation set forth in subsections i ii and iv of section 102 b 7 discussed below permits a corporation to protect its officers for duty of care violations only that is liability for gross negligence 2 not applicable to the fiduciary duty of loyalty including bad faith conduct and obtaining an improper personal benefit section 102 b 7 i provides that exculpation provisions may not apply to officer for any breach of the duty of loyalty generally speaking the duty of loyalty requires officers to act in good faith for the benefit of the corporation and its stockholders not for their own personal gain further the duty of loyalty requires officers to refrain from engaging in conduct that could harm the corporation and its stockholders so that the duty may be applicable to conduct that involves a conflict of interest or involves bad faith on the part of an officer for that reason and in support and augmentation of the exclusion of duty of loyalty claims from exculpation pursuant to subsection i of section 102 b 7 subsections ii and iv of section 102 b 7 also prohibit exculpation provisions from applying to officer for acts or omissions not in good faith and to officer for any transaction from which the officer derived an improper personal benefit respectively thus officers may still be found personally liable for monetary damages for breach of the fiduciary duty of loyalty 3 not applicable to intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law section 102 b 7 ii provides that exculpation provisions may not eliminate or limit the liability of officer for acts or omissions which involve intentional misconduct or knowing violation of law these categories of exemptions attempt to distinguish between wrongful conduct that involves officer intent and conduct that is the result of an officer s lack of due care 4 only eliminates or limits monetary damages not equitable relief or related claims the plain language of section 102 b 7 makes it clear that the statute applies to the elimination of an officer s monetary liability only and does not exculpate the underlying breach of the fiduciary duty therefore under delaware law officers continue to be subject to the fiduciary duty of care and an officer s conduct is still subject to equitable remedies including rescissory and injunctive relief as a practical matter however the unavailability of monetary damages against officers may effectively eliminate any real remedy when a stockholder has no knowledge of the corporate action of the officers until after such action is taken subject to any derivative claims that remain available as discussed in item 7 below further because the breach of the duty of care is not eliminated notwithstanding an exculpation provision a third party advisor such as an attorney accountant or financial expert can also be held liable for aiding and abetting an officer s breach of the fiduciary duty of care even if such officer is exculpated pursuant to section 102 b 7 5 only applies to certain corporate officers section 102 b 7 provides that the term officer shall mean only a person at the time of an act or omission as to which liability is asserted is deemed to have consented to service of process pursuant to 3114 b of title 10 in practice this means that the officer must have been at the time of the act or omission a president chief executive officer chief operating officer chief financial officer chief legal officer controller treasurer or chief accounting officer of the corporation or is or was identified in the corporation s public filings with the sec as a highly compensated executive officer of the corporation or is a person who has consented in writing to be identified as an officer for purposes of accepting service of process all other officers employees or agents of a delaware corporation are not entitled to the protection of an exculpation provision adopted pursuant to section 102 b 7 6 not self executing considerations when adopting including rationale for adoption and proxy advisory firm positions section 102 b 7 of the dgcl is an enabling provision only and it is not self executing in order for a delaware corporation to provide for the limitation of liability authorized by section 102 b 7 corporate action must be taken to affirmatively adopt an exculpation provision in its certificate of incorporation or an amendment thereto when a corporation is being formed or if it is going public via an initial public offering a de spac business combination a spin off or similar transaction the organizer can consider including an exculpation provision in the initial or in the case of an ipo a de spac business combination a spin off or similar transaction the new surviving public corporation s certificate of incorporation that includes both directors and officers if a delaware corporation is already in existence and is not going public then it should consider amending its certificate of incorporation to expressly include officers if there is already a director exculpation provision in effect which may require both board and stockholder approval depending upon its organizational and governance documents if the corporation is public this may also involve a board sponsored proposal in the proxy statement to be filed with the sec which would subsequently be approved by the stockholders after obtaining approval of any certificate of incorporation or certificate of amendment containing an exculpation provision such charter or charter amendment must be filed with the delaware secretary of state s office in order for the exculpation provision to become effective given that board and stockholder approval will likely be required for both private and public companies including companies anticipating going public to adopt or extend the protections of an exculpation provision to officers of a delaware corporation the board seeking this adoption or extension would want to present to the stockholders the rationale behind such action and why it is in the best interests of the corporation to make such changes the board would also need to address any potential objections thereto boards may want to emphasize that the amendment to section 102 b 7 of the dgcl partially remedies the inconsistent treatment of directors and officers both of whom have fiduciary duty obligations additionally the desire to recruit and retain the talent of a corporation and the protection from personal financial liability due to claims against officers would further support the board s proposal to adopt such a provision in the certificate of a corporation or amend it to reflect the same while it is unclear whether d o insurance carriers will give companies any credit on their premiums for including such a provision it is expected that the adoption of the officer exculpation provision would help temper insurance premiums which can be expensive and therefore might not be available to all companies however some stockholders may deem it unnecessary to extend exculpation protections to officers others may claim that officer exculpation could lead to careless behavior at the officer level which would hinder the development of a company s esg risk management and oversight existing public companies would also want to consider how proxy advisory firms such as institutional shareholders services iss and glass lewis co llc glass lewis view the change at the time of this writing neither has published a position on this topic however based on the 2022 u s proxy voting guidelines published by iss where the general voting guideline is to vote proposals on officer indemnification and liability protection on a case by case basis iss recommends voting against proposals that would liminate entirely directors and officers liability for monetary damages for violating the duty of care in light of that if iss updates its 2023 proxy voting guidelines to reflect the officer exculpation we may see iss either oppose officer exculpation and recommend against a related proposal to include such a provision or adopt an unfavorable policy with respect to the same however given that section 102 b 7 v prohibits exculpation provisions from eliminating personal liability of an officer for the breach of the duty of care if a litigation claim is derivative see the discussion in item 7 below then iss may not voice its opposition the 2022 u s proxy voting policy guidelines published by glass lewis takes a relatively mild position on this matter although it strongly believes that directors and officers should be held to the highest standard when carrying out their duties to shareholders some protection from liability is reasonable to protect them against certain suits so that these officers feel comfortable taking measured risks that may benefit shareholders and therefore find it appropriate for a company to provide indemnification and or enroll in liability insurance to cover its directors and officers so long as the terms of such agreements are reasonable still we would not be able to tell how glass lewis would weigh in on this topic in any case if the proxy advisory firms support the proposals to extend the protections of an exculpation provision to officers of a delaware corporation we would expect most public companies will pursue the charter amendments in their next stockholder meeting not necessarily in the upcoming proxy season and typically in their next annual general meeting of stockholders in addition to proxy advisory firms the board would also want to assess the view of large institutional investors 7 only applies to direct claims including class actions and not to derivative claims against officers subsection v of section 102 b 7 provides that exculpation is not available to n officer in any action by or in the right of the corporation i e a derivative claim this is a litigation claim brought by a stockholder on behalf of the corporation against its directors or officers typically alleging breach of fiduciary duty fraud or mismanagement generally harm to the corporation or to all stockholders pro rata in proportion with their ownership gives rise to a derivative claim while harm to the stockholders independent of any harm to the corporation gives rise to a direct claim unlike directors who may be exculpated for derivative claims under section 102 b 7 subsection v makes this protection unavailable to corporate officers however any damages from a successful derivative claim accrue to the corporation rather than to the stockholders so it is less attractive to stockholder plaintiffs than direct claims 8 exculpation of claims may not be retroactive exculpation provisions under section 102 b 7 are only available to corporate officers as of august 1 2022 further section 102 b 7 provides that no shall eliminate or limit liability of officer for any act or omission occurring prior to the date when such provision becomes effective i e when the certificate of incorporation or charter amendment is approved by the stockholders and then filed and accepted by the delaware secretary of state therefore any amendment will have a prospective effect only and shall not affect acts or omissions occurring prior to the effectiveness of the exculpatory provision however and as also discussed in the next section below exculpatory provisions may also be drafted in such a way so that any amendment or repeal of an effective exculpation provision in a corporation s certificate of incorporation by subsequent stockholder or legislative action shall not affect exculpation of personal liability of an officer for any acts or omissions occurring prior to the date of such amendment or repeal in this way corporations cannot retroactively weaken or eliminate protection for officers for otherwise exculpatory claims that already occurred 9 not applicable to other laws a section 102 b 7 exculpation provision cannot limit or eliminate liability if an officer is liable for an infraction of a federal law this limitation would include damages under without limitation the federal securities laws the antitrust laws or the racketeer influenced and corrupt practices act common features of an exculpation provision set forth below is an example of a standard exculpation provision that may be included in the certificate of incorporation of a delaware corporation limitation of liability a director or officer of the corporation shall not be personally liable to the corporation or to its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer v of an officer in any action by or in the right of the corporation per officer to the fullest extent permitted by law clause in some cases the board of directors and the stockholders of the corporation may elect to adopt an exculpation provision that essentially tracks the current language of section 102 b 7 so that they are relatively confident in the parameters and limitations of the exculpation applicable to the directors and officers in other cases as used in the model language above an exculpation provision may be proposed providing for elimination of liability in much broader language such as to the fullest extent permitted by the dgcl by doing so it would permit the corporation to not only exculpate officers and directors from personal liability for the matters currently set forth in section 102 b 7 but also any permissible limitations on liability embodied in future amendments of the dgcl conversely to the extent that limitations on liability are culled back in section 102 b 7 or elsewhere in the dgcl by future legislative action this would automatically become effective and would limit directors and officers use of the exculpation provision as a defense subject to the no amendments or modifications clause discussed below corporations may not be comfortable with this uncertainty given that such changes to the exculpation provision would automatically become effective upon any amendment to the dgcl elimination vs limitation of personal liability depending upon the preference of the board of directors the stockholders or both a corporation may seek to eliminate the personal liability of the corporate officers entirely or instead opt to partially limit such personal liability examples of ways to limit personal liability pursuant to an exculpation provision without eliminating all liability include instituting a dollar cap per corporate officer applying an aggregate dollar cap to the entire slate of corporate officers who were in office when the claim arose making exculpation applicable to only certain corporate matters but not others or a combination of these options in the example above there is bracketed language that places a dollar cap per officer on the amount of the limitation of personal liability for monetary damages further limitation or elimination of liability could be conditioned upon corporate officer action in connection with specific matters as provided in the model language above as a matter of practice it seems that the vast majority of delaware corporations have adopted provisions that entirely eliminate personal liability rather than partially limit it no amendment or modification clause the last sentence of the model exculpation provision provides that future amendments to the provision cannot be retroactively applied to impose monetary liability on a director or an officer for acts or omissions occurring prior to such amendment as discussed above this provision attempts to protect directors and officers against the uncertainties of a future stockholder or legislative action if a director only exculpation provision is already in effect corporations with existing director only exculpation provisions might consider adopting a stand alone officer exculpation provision that is customized for the specific limitations and conditions applicable to a corporate officer under section 102 b 7 of the dgcl given its disparate treatment of directors and officers on certain matters e g derivative claims the unlawful payment of dividends and unlawful stock purchases and redemptions endnotes subscribe to viewpoints

jerome powell took up arms against a sea of troubles on wednesday powell s federal reserve announced on wednesday the expected 75 basis point hike in the benchmark federal funds rate the thing that caught the market s attention however was that the summary of economic projections of fed officials has the fed funds rate rising to 4 4 percent this year and 4 6 percent next year that s an additional 125 basis points this year and at least one more hike next year most analysts had the fed funds rate rising to four percent by the end of the year or by the february meeting so the new projection is significantly more aggressive than what economists were expecting and the fed s so called terminal rate the highest it is expected to go in this cycle had been pegged at a range of four percent to 4 25 on the dovish end and 4 25 percent to 4 50 percent on the hawkish side the new projections assume a rise to 4 50 to 4 75 to put that into a timeline it appears that fed officials now expect another 75 basis point hike in november 50 basis points in december and 25 at the march meeting some think the fed is likely to go even higher we now expect hikes of 75 basis points in november 50 basis points in december followed by two 25 basis points rate hikes by march of next year bank of america said in a report on wednesday the bank added that its new terminal target range is 4 75 5 0 percent up from 4 0 4 25 previously there s room for criticism of the projections of fed officials as powell has acknowledged the fed s projections have been immensely inaccurate a year ago fed officials projected the economy would grow 3 8 percent this year now it sees growth at an almost zero to 0 2 percent the projection for inflation was just 2 2 percent last august back in the glory days of transitory inflation the latest projection is for inflation to end the year at 5 4 percent the fed is not even a good projector of its own policies a year ago it saw the fed funds rate ending 2022 at 0 3 percent we re already ten times that and the fed s end of year projection is 410 basis points above that powell made an interesting and overlooked point about the fed s errant projections at the meeting he insisted that the public should look at the projections dynamically if the fed turns out to be wrong about how high rates need to go to bring down inflation then rates will be higher than projected the fed he insisted will bring down inflation even if it has to go beyond the levels of interest rates and unemployment it expects in that way the evidence of the fed s errors above is also evidence of the fed s flexibility central bankers do not feel constrained by their past projections so how realistic are the fed s projections not very the fed sees unemployment rising to just 4 4 percent next year and staying there the year after that this mild rise in unemployment to a level that would be considered historically quite low does not seem likely to bring down inflation from the current 6 3 percent year over year level down to the fed s estimate of 2 8 percent even the year end estimate of 5 4 percent seems like a stretch it appears that once again the fed is underestimating what it will take to bring inflation more in line with its target powell almost immediately came under attack from the left on wednesday chair powell just announced another extreme interest rate hike while forecasting higher unemployment i ve been warning that chair powell s fed would throw millions of americans out of work and i fear he s already on the path to doing so sen elizabeth warren d ma a member of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs wrote on twitter there is a kind of logic to this attack president joe biden has insisted that inflation is over it moved up barely an inch an oddly inapt way of measuring price changes biden told 60 minutes this weekend democrat officials who are convinced inflation is not a problem naturally will object to powell s attempt to soften the labor market without inflation there would be no justification for it of course the democrats and president biden are wrong there is plenty of inflation powell appeared to anticipate the warren objection at his press conference higher interest rates slower growth and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve but they are not as painful as failing to restore price stability he added powell s position is that it is not nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous inflation he chooses to take up arms against the sea of troubles and he hopes by opposing end them
washington sept 21 xinhua the u s dow jones industrial average took a nosedive on wednesday amid the u s federal reserve s announcement that it would implement another big rate hike the index dropped more than 500 points that s on top of the fall earlier this month that marked the biggest one day decline since june 2020 trading has been volatile in recent weeks as inflation remains stubbornly high and has caused jittery investors to worry that continued fed rate hikes could trigger a rapid increase in unemployment possibly by year s end the nasdaq fell 1 79 percent and the tech heavy index went down a whopping 29 percent year to date on the worst inflation in 40 years indeed many tech startups and young tech firms rely on a steady flow of cash investment and rising interest rates make borrowing and capital investment much more difficult the nation s record inflation is due mostly to the current administration s profligate spending and the fed s slow reaction to contain inflation economists said with high energy prices also contributing to the problem in a press conference at the conclusion of a two day meeting ended wednesday fed chief jerome powell vowed the bank would kill inflation the statement came after the central bank raised interest rates by 75 basis points the rate hike marked the third consecutive time this year for such a boost and foreshadowed more aggressive increases than investors had predicted we have got to get inflation behind us i wish there were a painless way to do that there isn t powell told reporters at a press conference wednesday afternoon higher interest rates slower growth and a softening labor market are all painful for the public that we serve but they re not as painful as failing to restore price stability and having to come back and do it down the road again he said critics however blasted the move desmond lachman resident fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua it seems that the fed is unnecessarily risking the attainment of its employment objective by pursuing an overly aggressive monetary policy to regain control over inflation not only has the fed now raised interest rates in 75 basis point steps for the third time and clearly signaled that interest rates will stay higher for longer it is also now withdrawing market liquidity at the unprecedented rate of 95 billion u s dollars a month said lachman a former international monetary fund official one reason to fear a full blown economic recession is the acute difficulties already being experienced in the housing market lachman said another reason for concern is that the fed s hawkish monetary policy stance has already caused the bursting of the equity and credit market bubble lachman said in addition by causing a surge in the dollar and the repatriation of capital from the emerging markets it is compounding an already very troubled world economy lachman said he believes that the fed might have been better served by a 50 basis point interest rate hike today and by waiting to see the lagged impact of its monetary policy tightening to date aside from bad news about inflation recent warnings from major shipping firm fedex have spooked investors the company s stock on friday lost more than 21 percent after a disappointing earnings report that came in well below consensus estimates in an interview thursday on cnbc fedex ceo raj subramaniam was asked if his company s slowdown signaled the start of a worldwide recession i think so he responded these numbers they don t portend very well
drug users and harm reduction workers in delaware report the veterinary tranquilizer xylazine is increasingly seen in the state s drug supply especially in fentanyl sold in new castle county xylazine isn t yet well understood by drug and public health researchers leaving users and outreach workers to begin searching for ways to adapt xylazine is appearing more frequently in pills and powders tested by the delaware state police forensic chemistry unit about 15 of evidence tested between october 2021 and july 2022 found some xylazine also called tranq however because xylazine is not a controlled substance those tests were only conducted for research purposes and its presence was not officially confirmed but participants in a new castle county needle exchange program say that the drug may be more widespread than the state s testing suggests they describe an array new challenges presented by xylazine christina who asked to be identified by her first name alone says the initial high can be overwhelmingly intense sometimes causing falls in which users can seriously injure themselves it slows you down so much that even when you try to stand up slowly you feel like you re going to pass out no matter what she said your head feels like a bowling ball and your ears ring you re going to pass out christina suggests that users lay down before injecting to avoid falls claire zagorski a research assistant at in the school of pharmacology at the university of texas in austin says there s another reason for xylazine users to lay down tranq is so sedating that we re seeing people who don t respond to pain for 18 to 24 hours she said in a couple of instances at least that i know of people have sat bent over on a doorstep for so long that they cut off blood flow to their legs that should be horribly painful but with xylazine people are waking up too late with hugely swollen discolored limbs they have to be rushed to the hospital to try and save them but there s sometimes nothing to do but amputate zagorski adds that xylazine users try laying on their side with their knees tucked into their stomach to maintain circulation christina and other participants in the needle exchange program also suggested that caffeine pills could help them recover from the most intense phase of the high dr nabarun dasgupta who runs the street drug analysis lab at the university of north carolina says the pills could make sense in the absence of a clearer medical understanding of xylazine s impact the next question i would be asking he said is what is it like when they wake up zagorski notes that some xylazine users may also use stimulants to balance the effect of the tranquilizer it s becoming more and more common to see folks that are injecting a little bit of cocaine or meth with their tranq she said though she underscored that accidentally injecting stimulants into muscle can damage tissue and require medical attention caffeine she said may be the safest and most easily available option for people at the moment dasgupta added that while the value of caffeine pills as a stimulant hasn t been proven medically the pills sugar content or any other sugar rich food may be useful in and of itself xylazine causes a temporary and pretty massive drop in blood sugar he said and it could be that sugar could help someone feel better as they re coming back more visibly christina and others point to ulcers in their skin some so deep as to expose bone left after injecting xylazine c who asked not to be identified by name recommends outreach workers distribute wound care supplies like gauze saline solution and antibiotics a lesson she learned after an ulcer claimed a large portion of her forearm things like these and bandages she said i get a cream from the pharmacy too wound cleaning is very helpful dasgupta says these wounds resemble burns and should be treated similarly it s going to heal like a burn from the inside up and not like an abscess that heals from the outside in he explained suggesting that outreach teams could consider distributing water based antibiotics and burn kits while the ulcers can appear if a user accidentally injects xylazine into their muscle or fat instead of into a vein dasgupta notes that the drug is unusual in that users report ulcers in places where they ve never injected jessica another participant in the needle exchange program offered her own experience as an example it s not like the abscesses we used to get when you would miss a vein she said it can happen in weird places and you re just left with a hole in her case an ulcer on her wrist left her unable to use one of her hands yonah hicks a member brandywine counseling and community service s mobile outreach team in dover pointed out that after wounds form scar tissue users need longer and thicker needles to reach a vein she says her team have seen a spike in demand for the longest needles they have in stock there s been a really serious shift in what people are asking for hicks said and that s part of adapting so we can help people as tranq shows up everywhere meanwhile the increasing presence of xylazine could present some more fundamental messaging problems for harm reduction programs dasgupta pointed out that because xylazine is not an opioid people who regularly use it in combination with fentanyl might have trouble transitioning into a medication assisted treatment program for opioid use disorder programs that use weaker opioids like methadone to help people scale down their drug use while mitigating the potentially lethal effects of withdrawal similarly because xylazine does not respond to the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone some users expressed concerns that they may not know whether naloxone will help revive a person who has lost consciousness dasgupta says those sentiments could become a problem for harm reduction efforts which often rely heavily on distributing naloxone if the rumor that isn t working gets purchase then it will falsely weaken the resolve of having naloxone on hand he said what we ask is that people count breaths when they encounter someone who has gone out after using drugs not just gauge unresponsiveness even when unconscious from xylazine he said a person will likely breathe normally if they are overdosing from fentanyl they will not dasgupta and zargoski emphasized that while xylazine has existed as a veterinary drug for decades substantial research into its impact on humans has only just begun the suggestions and stories offered by users like those in new castle county zargoski added are vital to helping shape a public health response at this point we have to crowdsource she said

its nuclear program which iran insists is for peaceful energy purposes is seen as an extension of its defiance of an american led world order united nations ap iran s president insisted wednesday that his country is serious about reviving a deal meant to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear bomb but questioned whether tehran could trust america s commitment to any eventual accord the u s had already trampled on a previous deal president ebrahim raisi told the u n general assembly referring to america s decision to pull out of the accord in 2018 ever since iran s 1979 revolution that overthrew its western backed shah tehran has been at odds with the united states and has sought to project itself as a counterweight to american power courthouse news podcast sidebar tackles the stories you need to know from the legal world join our hosts as they take you in and out of courtrooms in the u s and beyond tehran s resolve to resist u s pressure has seen it build close ties with countries like russia develop a domestic ballistic missile program and attempt to export its narrow revolutionary ideals to countries across the mideast through shiite militias and proxies its nuclear program which iran insists is for peaceful energy purposes is seen as an extension of its defiance of an american led world order after former u s president donald trump walked away from the deal brokered by the obama administration tehran steadily abandoned every limitation the accord imposed on its nuclear enrichment but efforts to salvage the deal are now nearing a take it or leave it inflection point european union officials have warned the window for securing a nuclear deal is about to close in exchange for agreeing to the terms of the new nuclear deal iran would receive relief on economic sanctions and be given greater access to global financial markets and the flow of u s dollars there is a great and serious will to resolve all issues in the nuclear talks raisi said but he added our wish is only one thing observance of commitments can we truly trust without guarantees and assurances that they will this time live up to their commitment he asked of the u s swings in american foreign policy with successive administrations have concerned not only iran but also u s allies who have questioned america s reliability and its commitment to agreements ranging from climate to security even as he expressed a desire to reach a deal raisi criticized what he said was lopsided scrutiny of iran s nuclear activities while other nations atomic programs remain secret a reference to israel which has never confirmed nor denied having such weapons israel which is vehemently opposed to the nuclear deal accuses iran of concealing aspects of its nuclear program from u n inspectors we will not allow iran to acquire a nuclear weapon u s president joe biden said in his own speech at the u n but he stressed the u s is ready to rejoin the accord if iran steps up its commitments raisi who was previously chief of iran s judiciary also denounced western double standards on human rights he accused israel of creating the world s largest prison through its blockade of the palestinian gaza strip he also cited mass graves of indigenous people found in canada and the manner in which the u s detains migrants and refugees on its southern border wearing a traditional black turban identified with shiite clerics raisi held up a photo of slain gen qassem soleimani whom he described as a freedom seeking man the revolutionary guard chief who oversaw iranian militias and proxy armed groups in syria iraq lebanon and beyond was assassinated in a strike authorized by trump in 2020 at the height of tensions with iran raisi who was sworn in as president only a year ago has been described as a protege of iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei he spoke for the first time from the podium at the u n in his role as president last year he delivered remarks to the assembly virtually due to covid 19 restrictions he told the gathered leaders iran wants to have extensive relations with all our neighbors an apparent reference to foe saudi arabia and other arab countries in the region saudi arabia and iran have held a number of direct talks over the past year though tensions remain high between the two meanwhile the united arab emirates recently reopened its embassy in tehran and sent an ambassador there raisi s speech comes at a sensitive time in iran israel s shadow war against iran continues it is widely believed to have been behind the killing of iranian nuclear scientists and sabotage attacks on iran s nuclear program meanwhile western sanctions which raisi described as a punishment on the people of iran have eaten away at iran s reserves exacerbated inflation and devalued iran s currency against the u s dollar economic protests have flared and frequently are met with lethal force in recent days protesters have clashed with police in cities across the country including the capital over the death of a 22 year old woman who was held by the morality police for allegedly violating the islamic republic s strictly enforced dress code raisi has offered condolences to the woman s family and promised an investigation while other iranian officials have accused unnamed foreign countries of seizing on the incident to foment unrest her death has ignited long simmering anger

mile casm and that excluded fuel expenses which nearly doubled year over year to 3 36 per gallon the ongoing war in ukraine could keep fuel prices elevated for the foreseeable future a headwind southwest and its peers can do little about southwest is also dealing with pilot shortages which is forcing it to spend more on recruitment and training efforts in the wake of this summer s pilot protests southwest is scrambling to mend ties with employees over pay and working conditions earlier this month it reached a tentative agreement with an aircraft technicians union the terms of which haven t been disclosed continued progress with labor negotiations are a must to prevent further flight cancellations and alienating a loyal customer base over time southwest should benefit from the uptrend in demand along with the things that have historically made it a go to for many travelers simple fares and superior customer service until there are signs that the cost structure is improving however even the best of fare structures will matter little what is american airlines biggest concern american airlines group inc nasdaq aal is also no stranger to higher expenses which have been the main reason the stock went sideways throughout the summer it too is grappling with increased fuel prices and pilot salaries that overshadowed a 79 surge in revenue last quarter management projected that full year casm will be up 10 to 12 with higher labor costs playing a big part just as fuel prices are out of american s control so too is the recent wave of pilot retirements that took hold during the pandemic like fast food operators and others who are facing labor shortages the airliner has had a limited supply of replacements to turn to meanwhile it has been forced to increase the wages of existing pilots so as to not make labor shortage matters worse in june a pair of american airlines regional subsidiaries announced a 50 pay hike for pilots through august 2024 with piedmont airlines and envoy air pilots now the highest paid among regional airlines recruitment pressures should ease but will others demand similar raises an additional concern with american is that it has a heavier debt burden than most u s airliners debt accounts for 120 of the company s capital structure roughly 1 5x the industry average already challenged by elevated costs management s ability to reduce debt is limited especially in a rising rate environment where refinancing options aren t great even with passenger traffic on the upswing leverage is likely to be an overhang on the stock for

claw its way back from june 2022 its worst monthly drop since the covid onset the q2 report helped spark a mini rally but delta is far from out of the woods unfortunately for delta bulls the sharp turnaround to positive earnings came with a gloomier outlook that has limited the stock s upside amid lowered capacity and labor shortages management struck a more cautious tone than in previous quarters demand growth is expected to be minimal in the third quarter which could put the near term excitement around profits on hold for longer with industry capacity constrained and ticket prices

on everything from food to clothing during his press conference powell stressed his resolve to lift rates high enough to slow the economy and drive inflation back toward the central bank s 2 goal powell said the fed has just started to get to that level with this most recent increase the central bank s latest rate hike lifted its benchmark rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 3 to 3 25 the highest level in 14 years and up from zero at the start of the year the fed is pivoting but not in the direction that many hoped for said willie delwiche investment strategist at all star charts not only are they indicating that rates will be higher for longer but they expect to persist even as the economy slows more dramatically remains weaker longer than they were expecting as recently as june the fed s goal is to slow economic growth and cool inflation but wall street is worried that it could hit the brakes too hard on an already slowing economy and cause a recession those concerns have been reinforced by reports showing that inflation remains stubbornly high and statements from fed officials they will keep raising rates until they are sure inflation is coming under control central banks worldwide are also dealing with inflation the bank of japan began a two day monetary policy meeting wednesday although analysts expect the central bank to stick to its easy monetary policy rate decisions from norway switzerland and the bank of england are next sweden surprised economists this week with a full point hike global tensions remain high as russia s

higher mortgage rates are throwing a bucket of ice water on the super heated housing market home prices in august were down about 6 from their peak in june the biggest 2 month drop in prices in nearly a decade the pace of home sales slowed for the 7th straight month the housing market certainly reacts to the monetary policy change says lawrence yun the chief economist for the national association of realtors which just released the new existing home sales numbers the federal reserve has been raising interest rates to fight inflation mortgage rates anticipate future moves by the fed and bond markets more broadly so they rose very sharply earlier this year from around 3 to up above 6 that magnitude of the mortgage rate increase is one of the largest quickest increases in such a short span of time says yun he says the number of home sales each month is now down about 20 percent from a year ago don t call it a housing crash that s not to say we re in a housing crash just about all economists agree this is different than in 2008 when the bottom fell out of the housing market right now the nation is in the midst of a severe housing shortage for a decade following the 2008 crash builders didn t build enough homes today homes are still getting snapped up by buyers and put under agreement in near record time just 16 days on average home prices nationally are still up about 8 from a year ago according to the realtor s group low supply and strong demand should continue to buoy up prices also congress changed the rules for mortgages after the housing bubble when subprime lenders put millions of americans into loans they couldn t afford today homebuyers have to demonstrate that they can afford their loans home prices probably will keep falling home prices likely will continue to drop that s because super low interest rates combined with super heated demand during the pandemic pushed prices up so dramatically so quickly up about 30 40 in just the past 2 years mark zandy with moody s analytics predicts home prices across the nation will fall about 10 percent from their peak areas that experienced the most dramatic price increases could see even bigger drops he says the previously most juiced up markets like a phoenix or orlando will see peak to trough declines of closer to 20 zandi estimates that s if the country doesn t fall into a recession economists say it s quite possible that in its fight against inflation the federal reserve could slow the economy so much that it does tip the country into recession if the economy suffers a recession zandi says national house prices will decline as much as 15 peak to trough and close to 30 in the hardest hit markets copyright 2023 npr to see more visit
intensifying its fight against high inflation the federal reserve raised its key interest rate wednesday by a substantial three quarters of a point for a third straight time and signaled more large rate hikes to come an aggressive pace that will heighten the risk of an eventual recession the fed s move boosted its benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 3 to 3 25 the highest level since early 2008 the officials also forecast that they will further raise their benchmark rate to roughly 4 4 by year s end a full percentage point higher than they had forecast as recently as june and they expect to raise the rate further next year to about 4 6 that would be the highest level since 2007 on wall street stock prices fell and bond yields rose in response to the fed s projection of further steep rate hikes ahead u s stocks fall broadly ahead of key fed decision on rates u s stocks fall broadly ahead of key fed decision on rates more than 90 of stocks and every sector in the benchmark index lost ground as traders wait to see how far the fed will raise interest rates learn more the central bank s action wednesday followed a government report last week that showed high costs spreading more broadly through the economy with price spikes for rents and other services worsening even though some previous drivers of inflation such as gas prices have eased by raising borrowing rates the fed makes it costlier to take out a mortgage or an auto or business loan consumers and businesses then presumably borrow and spend less cooling the economy and slowing inflation fed officials have said they re seeking a soft landing by which they would manage to slow growth enough to tame inflation but not so much as to trigger a recession yet economists increasingly say they think the fed s steep rate hikes will lead over time to job cuts rising unemployment and a full blown recession late this year or early next year in their updated economic forecasts the fed s policymakers project that economic growth will remain weak for the next few years with rising unemployment it expects the jobless rate to reach 4 4 by the end of 2023 up from its current level of 3 7 historically economists say any time the unemployment rate has risen by a half point over several months a recession has always followed fed officials now see the economy expanding just 0 2 this year sharply lower than its forecast of 1 7 growth just three months ago and it expects sluggish growth below 2 from 2023 through 2025 and even with the steep rate hikes the fed foresees it still expects core inflation which excludes the volatile food and gas categories to be 3 1 at the end of next year well above its 2 target chair jerome powell acknowledged wednesday what many economists have been saying for months that the fed s goal of engineering a soft landing in which it would manage to slow growth enough to curb inflation but not so much as to cause a recession looks increasingly unlikely the chances of a soft landing powell said are likely to diminish as the fed steadily raises borrowing costs to slow the worst streak of inflation in four decades no one knows whether this process will lead to a recession or if so how significant that recession would be falling gas prices have slightly lowered headline inflation which was a still painful 8 3 in august compared with a year earlier declining gas prices might have contributed to a recent rise in president joe biden s public approval ratings which democrats hope will boost their prospects in the november midterm elections long term mortgage rates now at highest point since 2008 long term mortgage rates now at highest point since 2008 the 30 year mortgage rate jumped to 5 89 from 5 66 last week according to mortgage buyer freddie mac one year ago the rate stood at 2 88 learn more short term rates at a level the fed is now envisioning would make a recession likelier next year by sharply raising the costs of mortgages car loans and business loans the economy hasn t seen rates as high as the fed is projecting since before the 2008 financial crisis last week the average fixed mortgage rate topped 6 its highest point in 14 years credit card borrowing costs have reached their highest level since 1996 according to bankrate com inflation now appears increasingly fueled by higher wages and by consumers steady desire to spend and less by the supply shortages that had bedeviled the economy during the pandemic recession on sunday though president biden said on cbs 60 minutes that he believed a soft landing for the economy was still possible suggesting that his administration s recent energy and health care legislation would lower prices for pharmaceuticals and health care some economists are beginning to express concern that the fed s rapid rate hikes the fastest since the early 1980s will cause more economic damage than necessary to tame inflation mike konczal an economist at the roosevelt institute noted that the economy is already slowing and that wage increases a key driver of inflation are levelling off and by some measures even declining a bit surveys also show that americans are expecting inflation to ease significantly over the next five years that is an important trend because inflation expectations can become self fulfilling if people expect inflation to ease some will feel less pressure to accelerate their purchases less spending would then help moderate price increases konczal said there is a case to be made for the fed to slow its rate hikes over the next two meetings given the cooling that s coming he said you don t want to rush into this the fed s rapid rate hikes mirror steps that other major central banks are taking contributing to concerns about a potential global recession the european central bank last week raised its benchmark rate by three quarters of a percentage point the bank of england the reserve bank of australia and the bank of canada have all carried out hefty rate increases in recent weeks and in china the world s second largest economy growth is already suffering from the government s repeated covid lockdowns if recession sweeps through most large economies that could derail the u s economy too even at the fed s accelerated pace of rate hikes some economists and some fed officials argue that they have yet to raise rates to a level that would actually restrict borrowing and spending and slow growth many economists sound convinced that widespread layoffs will be necessary to slow rising prices research published earlier this month under the auspices of the brookings institution concluded that unemployment might have to go as high as 7 5 to get inflation back to the fed s 2 target only a downturn that harsh would reduce wage growth and consumer spending enough to cool inflation according to the research by johns hopkins university economist laurence ball and two economists at the international monetary fund additional reporting by the associated press

mitchell john paul ii was one of the most popular and well known popes in recent history and one who possessed a special connection to the youth of the catholic church because of that popularity and renown his name has adorned john paul ii elementary school in mitchell since 2001 now after over two decades with his name used as the official moniker of the pre k through grade 6 catholic school officials are announcing the name of the institution will change to st john paul ii elementary school to reflect the canonization of the former pope john paul ii officially became a saint 2014 so it was a good time for a change in name to reflect that he is one of the most well known saints of our time quite honestly said nicole fuhrer director for the mitchell catholic foundation cardinal karol wojtyla who served as the archbishop of krakow was elected pope in 1978 and chose the name john paul ii in honor of the late john paul i john paul ii was the first slavic pope elected and was the youngest elected pope in over a century advertisement during his 26 years as pope he was known for traveling visiting 129 countries including seven visits to the united states he died in 2005 was beatified by pope benedict xvi in 2011 and canonized by pope francis in 2014 officially making him a saint according to the united states conference of catholic bishops website john paul ii elementary school in mitchell is in the process of updating its signage after it officially announced it was changing its name to add st to reflect the 2014 canonization of the former pope erik kaufman mitchell republic there have been catholic schools in mitchell dating back to 1886 fuhrer said and local schools associated with the church have gone under several names since john paul ii elementary school formed after the consolidation of two previous elementary schools and an addition was added in 2001 john paul ii was pope at the time and his active lifestyle and enjoyment of outdoor activities like skiing endeared him to young people it made sense to give the school where young people spent their days learning his name the name came because he was the pope at the time and he was known as the young people s pope he started world youth days and traveled the country and the youth just loved him and he loved them fuhrer said of course that has continued there is even a personal connection between the former pope and the school father andrew swietochowski a priest who served the local mitchell parish from 2001 to 2010 knew john paul ii personally having been confirmed and ordained by the former pope swietochowski remained close with john paul ii attending his beatification and canonization in rome swietochowski 68 remains in contact with the school to this day he had a relationship with him throughout his life so this school is so important to him he has such a love for this school because it s named after his great friend fuhrer said the move to change the name came from local parish members dick and darlene muth who shared a close friendship with swietochowski and began an endowment through the mitchell catholic foundation for the school to distribute funds to the organization for improvements and school needs advertisement the muths love the school very much and they have a particularly close relationship with father andrew and they wanted to do something to honor him as well fuhrer said they decided they wanted the distribution this year to go toward renaming the school the official portion of the process to change the name is largely complete there were some official channels to go through but the process went smoothly said robin cahoy principal of john paul ii elementary we went through the diocese and the bishop of course the education committee discussed it and then it went to the bishop and he approved it right away honestly it was a very quick process now it s just changing everything changing the signage changing the letterhead the logo cahoy said st john paul ii the namesake of john paul ii elementary school in mitchell was pope from 1978 to 2005 he was canonized in 2014 making him a saint the school has announced it is officially changing its name to st john paul ii elementary school to reflect that canonization erik kaufman mitchell republic officials are making arrangements to change the signage that adorns the school and preparations have been made for new letterhead although current stock will be used until it s gone so it doesn t go to waste new t shirts have been made and school booster yard signs printed and put up at the start of the school year already have the new name it s an exciting time but it will probably take some getting used to even when you answer the phone it s really tough to remember that because you want to make sure you are being the first ones to make that effort cahoy said teachers are sharing details about the change with their students in the classroom and cahoy expects more lessons and discussions on the name will take place around oct 22 which is designated as the feast day for st john paul ii an official announcement on the name change came wednesday evening sept 21 at the school s annual fall festival which was to feature a catered meal pumpkin painting and other activities the event is a chance for families associated with the school to mingle and enjoy each other s company but the public in general is invited said renee lebrun development director for st john paul ii elementary school as it is now being referred to by staffers it will also serve as a chance to thank the muth family for their contributions advertisement it s great to have a celebration of our school where families can get together and enjoy each other s company and it s open to all of the community lebrun said it will be a fun evening maybe a little chilly but throw on a sweatshirt and a smile and come on it school officials have announced that john paul ii elementary school in mitchell is changing its name to st john paul ii elementary school to reflect the canonization of the former pope in 2014 while some signage at the school still awaits modification to the new name the new name can be seen in other places such as booster yard signs erik kaufman mitchell republic school officials will gradually add the st portion of the new name to signage and letterhead and school staffers will eventually get used to saying saint john paul ii elementary when they answer the phones the 129 pre kindergarten through grade 6 students will also have to get used to the name but one thing that is expected to remain the same is the school s dedication to education and connecting their students strongly to their faith like the events at the fall festival wednesday they re always willing to welcome new students and families to the school fuhrer said new families are always welcome all are welcome fuhrer said

inflation as a disruptive force surveyed people in the united states germany and brazil to determine why inflation had always produced so much anger wounded national pride and a feeling that an unwritten social contract between citizens and their government had been broken facing deep feelings of insecurity anxiety and unfairness not a single respondent volunteered anywhere on the questionnaire that he or she benefited from inflation he marveled image representative nancy mace released her first ad of the general election last week focusing on the economy i m nancy mace and i

center their campaigns on abortion rights and democratic pluralism and republican strategists test other themes like crime the border and democratic radicalism representative kim schrier a democrat in the suburbs of seattle who is locked in a tossup contest for re election has gone after her republican opponent matt larkin on abortion using her background as a physician to press a persona of

elected mr larkin s response the price of eggs up 52 percent in washington state he said thursday and milk way way up in the eighth district voters he said in an interview are very very concerned and in a country where one party controls the house the senate and the white house and in a state where democrats control pretty much everything there s also a sense that the democrats in general are doing this mr larkin added that too is consistent with economic history citizens of countries suffering from inflation have routinely sought to assign blame to the government to greedy companies or to politicians inflationary periods often yield labor strife as workers and unions press for wage increases to keep up with rising prices point fingers at price gouging companies and more than anything

1982 as the federal reserve was engineering a recession to finally get control of price gains and ronald reagan was absorbing the blame democrats beat republicans by nearly 12 percentage points in the midterm elections and padded their house majority by 27 seats from bitter historical experience we know how quickly inflation destroys confidence in the reliability of political institutions and ends up endangering democracy helmut kohl the chancellor of germany said in 1995 harking back to the hyperinflation of the weimar republic in 2022 republicans like state senator jen kiggans who is challenging representative elaine luria in southeast virginia are using inflation not only to go after the party in power but also to deflect democratic charges of radicalism by portraying themselves as ordinary family folks in touch with consumer reality for voters however the signals from the actual economy are mixed the official inflation report last tuesday showed that prices in august rose 8 3 percent from a year earlier only slightly better than july s 8 5 percent but because of rapidly falling gasoline prices overall consumer costs from the month before rose a barely noticeable 0 1 percent prices at the pump the most visible inflationary signal to consumers are expected to continue their fall in the weeks leading up to the election that could offer at least psychological relief

in the weeks leading up to the november elections credit carlos bernate for the new york times if you re going to have 8 percent inflation over the year before up to the election you d like to have the last three months at zero so the sequencing is about as good as it could be for democrats mr furman said mr barrett conceded that these fresh signals could blunt the political impact to some degree they boiled the frog then turned the temperature down a notch on the stove he said but it s still raging hot and his democratic opponent ms slotkin has taken pains to address the issue too ticking off legislation and administrative actions that she said she supported to address inflation they include suspending the federal gas tax releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve pressing companies on price gouging and granting medicare the authority to negotiate drug prices certainly if there was a silver bullet to fix it it would have been fired she said adding leaders need to do all they can not just use it as a political issue republicans say that as children go back to school higher prices on clothes food and school supplies will come more into focus and cold weather will bring the sticker shock of soaring heating bills the disorienting power of price increases is all the more potent experts say because americans have not weathered them in four decades democrats hope to turn voters minds elsewhere on the lengthy issues web page of mr nunn s opponent representative cindy axne the word inflation does not appear though she does mention inflation in one campaign ad as being among a litany of travails hitting iowans recently in another ad ms axne acknowledges that rising costs are hurting iowa families everywhere image representative cindy axne mentioned inflation in one campaign ad among a list of problems facing iowans credit cheriss may for the new york times on friday emilia sykes the democratic candidate for an open house seat in northeast ohio released a new ad saying she has a plan to lower costs though she avoided the word inflation elsewhere democrats are focusing almost exclusively on abortion democracy and the overall theme that republicans who have undermined the integrity of elections and democratic institutions cannot be trusted with power in that sense the parties are entering the final sprint to nov 8 largely talking past each other but the unique ability of inflation to anger voters and undermine authorities in power should not be underestimated economists say wage increases though stronger than they have been in years have not kept pace with inflation this year but in 2021 when voters anger showed up most clearly in polling average family incomes far exceeded price gains thanks in large part to temporary tax cuts and income supplements approved in successive pandemic relief measures said austan goolsbee a university of chicago economist average actual real incomes went up not down he said so it s still a puzzle for republicans there is no mystery only the challenge of staying on the issue as democrats try to direct voters attention anywhere else this stuff is real mr barrett said on thursday the democrats are whistling past the graveyard
being the monarch one day may not have been on the cards when princess elizabeth was born but after her father took over the role following her uncle s abdication she gracefully accepted that it was her future too however when she pledged during a speech to mark her 21st birthday to devote her life to service she would never have expected that just five years later her father s untimely death would mean she was queen at 26 with george vi still in his 50s it was anticipated that it would 20 years or so before elizabeth stepped into the job but fate had other plans in 1951 he was diagnosed with lung cancer and part of his left lung was removed he covered up the illness elizabeth was not told but took the unusual step of waving off her plane in january 1952 at london airport as she and philip set off on a royal tour that was scheduled to include new zealand it was the last time she saw her father first stop was kenya elizabeth s private secretary martin charteris had taken the precaution of bringing the documents of accession with him on february 6 the king died not of cancer but of a heart attack while sleeping unknowing the new queen was in a remote part of kenya centred on the treetops safari camp as one headline put it she climbed a tree as a princess and came down a queen the truth was more prosaic elizabeth and philip were actually at a fishing camp called sagana 20 miles away martin at treetops was phoned by the editor of the east african standard and told that news wires had reported the king s death martin immediately telephoned philip who responded this will be such a blow he took elizabeth into the garden at 2 45pm and told her the new queen was very composed master of her fate said martin and she spent the rest of the afternoon writing notes of apology for cancelling the tour she was driven to the nearest airfield to be taken back to london only after they took off did she crack retreating to the toilets when she came out again it was obvious she had been crying her eyes out said a fellow passenger back in london black mourning clothes and a veil were delivered to the aircraft and she was greeted by prime minister winston churchill from that day on all royals on tour carry mourning dress with them just in case dressed in black following the death of her father elizabeth sets foot on british soil for the first time since her accession after a day and night flight from kenya informal planning for the coronation had begun when she was only 11 king george vi had insisted she note down all she saw at his so she could understand what it meant she also wrote that it was rather boring towards the end because it was all prayers westminster abbey has been used for coronations since 1066 while the essence of the ceremony remained much the same the queen wanted a degree of modernisation and knew just the person to oversee the changes her husband some of the innovations were small and easy for example until then the archbishop of canterbury alone had conducted the service the queen wanted the moderator of the church of scotland james pitt watson to be involved as well philip chair of the coronation commission pushed it through posing with philip for a portrait at the palace in december 1958 he also wanted the coronation to be televised the archbishop of canterbury geoffrey fisher objected as did churchill who told the house of commons it would be unfitting that the whole ceremony not only in its secular but also in its religious and spiritual aspects should be presented as if it were a theatrical performance elizabeth put her foot down she wanted to use the coronation to show she d serve all her subjects not just the elite the decision led to a boom in uk television sets 27 million out of a population of 36 million watched all in black and white a further 11 million listened on the radio some were watching and listening at the same time worldwide 200 million followed the proceedings by radio the queen with prince philip queen elizabeth the queen mother and princess margaret centre in the throne room of buckingham palace after her coronation ceremony the coronation began at 11 15am on june 2 1953 and lasted three hours many aristocrats were said to have put sandwiches in their coronets to see them through everything was filmed a colour version too for cinemas except the act of consecration at that point the queen removed her crimson robe of state necklace and diadem and sat in king edward s chair in a white pleated dress symbolising humility under the anointing canopy knights of the garter sheltered her from the congregation and fisher poured blessed oil onto her breast hand and head while whispering a blessing she was then invested as head of state by being presented with the symbols of sovereignty a jewelled sword gold spurs for chivalry and gold bracelets representing sincerity and wisdom next she was dressed in the coronation robe the stole royal and the imperial mantle then came the orb coronation ring coronation glove and two sceptres finally the imperial state crown was placed on her head the queen stood stock still and in 2018 explained why you can t look down because if you did your neck would break it would fall off so there are disadvantages to crowns but otherwise they re quite important things elizabeth had officially become elizabeth the second by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and of her other realms and territories queen head of the commonwealth defender of the faith the congregation roared god save the queen three times her majesty with her maids of honour in the green drawing room at buckingham palace in selecting maids of honour instead of pages to bear her velvet train throughout the ceremony she followed the precedent of queen victoria it took hours to process back to the palace the parade was so long halfway around london as the queen later put it it took 45 minutes before it passed any single point the route was packed with hundreds of thousands watching 16 000 participants walk ride and march past back at buckingham palace the queen and her entire family appeared on the balcony she appeared again at 9 45pm to switch on the lights of london which flowed down the mall a fitting end to a momentous day the queen and philip wave to crowds on the day of the coronation at buckingham palace all the coronation details philip wore full dress naval uniform for the journey to and from the abbey in the abbey he added a coronet and his duke s robe he was the first to swear allegiance to the queen as her liege man of life and limb the blessed oil is made of orange roses cinnamon musk and ambergris enough was made for king charles coronation as well among the journalist in the abbey was the washington times herald s correspondent jacqueline bouvier later jackie kennedy the imperial state crown also known as st edward s crown was made in 1661 it weighs 2 15kg and is solid gold and gems jewel in the imperial crown st edward s chair was made in 1300 for edward i and has been used at every coronation since designed by sir norman hartnell the coronation dress was made of white sain and embroidered with the emblems of the uk and the commonwealth in gold and silver thread including new zealand s silver fern the queen wore the dress on a further six occasions including at the opening of parliament in nz in 1954 the queen in her coronation dress for the opening of new zealand s parliament on january 18 1954 processing to the coronation the queen wore the george iv state diadem the one that was on british stamps made in 1820 it includes roses shamrocks and thistles and contains 1333 diamonds and 169 pearls an extra shamrock on the dress for luck charles was the only child to witness a mother s coronation anne was thought too young to attend
judge andrew edison issued an order denying apache corporation s motion to dismiss the class action securities suit against them the judge ruled that the plaintiff s claims of securities fraud met the standard to proceed with the case apache corporation is an independent energy company that explores for develops and produces natural gas crude oil and natural gas liquids as described in the complaint prior to the class period apache s stock value was steadily dropping to stop this trend on september 7 2016 the executives allegedly falsely played up the prospects of their new alpine heights venture the lead plaintiffs argue citing numerous unnamed witnesses that the executives hid the findings of their geological surveys from the public and much of the company itself findings which outlined the much dimmer picture of how poorly the wells in the region were performing on february 26 2020 apache announced the discontinuation of its alpine high project in february 2021 the plymouth county retirement system filed suit for securities fraud and in december the trustees of the teamsters union no 142 pension fund joined onto the class action one year later in february 2022 apache filed a motion to dismiss arguing that the lead plaintiffs did not adequately plead actionable misrepresentations that the defendants statements are covered under the private securities litigation reform act s pslra safe harbor provision that the defendants statements were merely opinion and that the lead plaintiffs did not adequately plead scienter to the claim that the plaintiffs did not adequately plead actionable misrepresentations the judge said despite their usual length many of those filings are cut and paste jobs that unquestionably fail to properly allege a false or misleading statement this is not one of those complaints on the safe harbor claim the judge ruled that while the pslra s safe harbor does protect most forward looking statements the allegedly misleading statements in question are primarily current or historical fact and even if the judge granted that the claims were forward looking they did not contain suitable warning to warrant safe harbor status on the claim that the statements in question are merely non actionable opinions judge edison was unconvinced he states that even if he did grant that the statements were matters of opinion supreme court precedent grants that they are still actionable the judge gave a mixed decision on scienter on the one hand the lead plaintiffs argued that the executives at appache were desperate to reverse the slow decline of the company so made these allegedly false statements to save the stock prices on the other the defendants argued that these statements were merely overly optimistic and represented the genuine hopes of said executives judge edison ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in part because of the southland case which set precedent for a tie between the parties going in favor of the plaintiff at the dismissal stage the ruling also found the resignation of the lead technical advisor apache s 2020 announcement of a 3 billion write down and ceasing drilling in alpine high and the executives pay structure as plausible evidence for intent to mislead the case is set in the southern district of texas where apache is based the lead plaintiffs are represented by thomas ajamie kessler topaz meltzer and check llp and saxena white p a the defendants are represented by baker botts

washington the federal reserve barreled ahead with a third straight outsize interest rate hike wednesday in an effort to squash high inflation but economists worry the campaign is increasingly risking a recession by next year the fed raised its key short term rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of 3 to 3 25 a higher than normal level designed to ease inflation by slowing the economy it also significantly bumped up its forecast for what that rate will be at the end of both this year and 2023 fed officials now predict the key rate will end 2022 at a range of 4 25 to 4 5 a full percentage point above the 3 25 to 3 5 they projected in june and close out next year at 4 5 to 4 75 according to their median estimate that suggests the central bank could approve another three quarter point hike at its november meeting and then a half point rate rise in december but within the next year or two as higher rates restrict economic activity fed policymakers expect growth to weaken substantially the central bank expects to cut the fed funds rate by about three quarters of a point in 2024 presumably in response to a slowing economy or possibly a recession rate hike impact on you here s how it could hit your wallet and portfolio how the fed works why does the fed raise interest rates and how do those hikes slow inflation at a news conference chair jerome powell said the fed s chief goal is bringing down high inflation we can t fail to do that he said but he said achieving that will probably mean some pain for the economy and millions of americans i think there s a very high likelihood we will have a period of much lower growth and it could give rise to an increase in unemployment he said will that mean a recession no one knows whether that process will lead to a recession or how significant a recession it will be powell said i don t know the odds what could cause a recession a recession is now likely in 2023 here s what could trigger a sharp downturn in the economy his comments mark a notable change in tone from just a few months ago when he voiced confidence the fed could boost rates to fight inflation without triggering a downturn still he said we haven t given up on the idea that we can have a very modest increase in unemployment the economy is already pulling back in a statement after the two day meeting the fed said recent indicators point to modest growth in spending and production but job gains have been robust and the unemployment rate has remained low it added it anticipates that ongoing increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate 2 year treasury yield and stocks react stocks ended the day lower with the dow jones industrial average s p 500 and nasdaq composite all falling around 1 7 stocks experienced high levels of volatility after the fed announcement swinging between gains and losses multiple times throughout the final trading hours yields on 2 year treasury notes were above 4 the highest level since 2007 signaling that investors believe the fight to contain inflation will be prolonged what was the fed rate hike today wednesday s rate increase of 0 75 percentage point is expected to reverberate through the economy driving up rates for credit cards home equity line of credit and other loans fixed 30 year mortgage rates have jumped above 6 from 3 22 early this year at the same time households especially seniors are finally reaping higher bank savings yields after years of piddling returns barclays says fed policymakers had little choice but to lift rates sharply again after a report last week revealed that inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi rose 8 3 annually in august below june s 40 year high of 9 1 but above the 8 expected also employers added a healthy 315 000 jobs in august and average hourly pay increased a hefty 5 2 annually that could fuel further price increases as companies struggle to maintain profit margins markets that try to predict where rates are headed figured there was an 18 chance fed policymakers would hoist rates by a full percentage point wednesday are we in a recession in 2022 but goldman sachs economist david mericle says little has changed since powell told reporters in late july that the pace of rate hikes probably would slow to account for the increased risk of recession rather he says the fed is partly trying to deliver a message to stock markets that until recently had grown complacent about the prospect of more rate increases growth is slowing as the fed pushes borrowing costs higher the fed said wednesday it expects the economy to grow just 0 2 this year and 1 2 in 2023 below its june estimate of 1 7 for both years according to officials median estimate it predicts the 3 7 unemployment will rise to 4 4 by the end of next year well above its prior forecast of 3 9 and the fed s preferred measure of annual inflation which is different than the cpi is expected to decline from 6 3 in august to 5 4 by the end of the year slightly above fed officials previous 5 2 forecast and 2 8 by the end of 2023 that would be moderately above the fed s 2 target even without big fed rate increases inflation is expected to slow as supply chain bottlenecks ease commodity prices fall a strong dollar lowers import costs and retailers offer big discounts to thin bloated inventories powell though has said it s critical that the fed raise rates to tamp down consumers inflation expectations which can affect actual price increases he also said wednesday that improving supply troubles so far haven t moderated price increases as the fed expected inflation really hasn t come down as a result of those gains a growing number of economists believe the fed s aggressive campaign its key rate began 2022 near zero will tip the economy into recession economists says there s a 54 chance of a downturn next year up from 39 odds in june according to a survey by wolters kluwer blue chip economic indicators for months fed chair jerome powell said he thought the central bank could tame inflation without sparking a recession but in a speech last month at the fed s annual conference in jackson hole wyoming he acknowledged that higher rates and slower growth will also bring some pain to households and businesses these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation says nationwide economist ben ayers the fed sent another clear message in september that its fight against inflation is not finished
illustration by cameron law ikon images sometime over the summer energy markets in europe broke down our voracious appetite for energy had run up against a series of intractable phenomena geopolitical chaos the climate crisis and the limits of existing technology placed a stop order on energy supplies when economic agents no longer trusted the market to balance demand and supply prices exploded the european commission eventually intervened announcing new price caps on renewables and a levy on revenues from fossil fuel companies britain opted for price caps for consumers but across europe the underlying problem of energy scarcity remains unaddressed europeans have now realised that the transition to renewable energy is less like flipping a switch and something more akin to regime change for decades the military and financial might of the united states has been in the service of securing a deep network of extraction and energy flows spanning the world today a reliable sign of us imperial decline is the growing strain on that network one after another large energy producers venezuela russia iran are becoming international outcasts excluded from the ruling global order for europe this is catastrophic because the continent remains dependent on global flows of fossil fuels and since the suez crisis in 1956 is unable to direct them as for renewables their limits have been painfully exposed by the current crisis a record 12 per cent of electricity in the eu this summer was generated from solar but this remained below the 16 per cent that came from coal over the same

communications thank you close it is no coincidence that the limits of us power are being tested at a time when fossil fuel reserves are being exhausted taken in isolation stocks of oil and natural gas could last for a few more centuries but that is the wrong way to look at the problem what we have been consuming is not gas or oil but degrees of warming from the burning of fossil fuels when you have consumed all the degrees that humanity can bear the energy supply has been spent the share of energy in the total costs of production has traditionally been very small so economists tend to neglect its foundational role its contribution has been overshadowed by the overall share of capital about 25 per cent of production costs in recent decades and that of labour roughly 70 per cent but the impression of energy abundance is always the product of a previous energy regime the main reason a permanent flow of energy is often taken for granted is our tendency to adapt our economic expectations to available energy supplies it is only at moments of crisis that one realises energy is central to the economic process the economy as a whole could be regarded as an engine using energy to transform inputs into outputs for the time being we are still living with the fundamental inheritance of the energy revolution of the late 19th and early 20th centuries that period s advances include above all large scale electricity generation and the use of innovations such as internal combustion engines and electric motors as the environmental scientist vaclav smil convincingly shows most of these advances are still with us not as inconsequential survivors from a bygone age but as the foundations of our industrial civilisation the only new primary energy source that made a substantial commercial difference in the 20th century was nuclear fission and its impact remains limited well short of initial hopes that it would be transformational from here two paths seem possible economic and social stagnation or an energy revolution we may be forced to accept that energy revolutions are rare episodes in human history perhaps we ll be forced to live with the decaying structures of the previous energy regime renewables will mitigate some of the impact of climate change but geopolitical conflict to control energy sources will intensify and everyone will have to adapt to a world of energy scarcity the alternative perhaps as a result of this painful new reality is that the sense of impending crisis instigates a new energy revolution technological revolutions are not the product of free market processes they are the product of historical forces resulting from the way societies deal with acute crises and the conscious need to overcome them in the late 19th and early 20th centuries the second industrial revolution in the us for example was a way to build a continental economy and manage social conflict in a large democracy we hear about all kinds of miracle solutions to reignite economic growth lower taxes and higher taxes investment in education or a radical reform of the education system economic nationalism and economic globalisation i can plausibly imagine how these solutions might work but none would compare to a techno economic breakthrough that would change everything i have in mind the discovery of a genuinely inexhaustible source of energy such as nuclear fusion energy would replace labour and capital as the single driver of production since every kind of machine could be built and operated in a world of genuine energy abundance addressing climate change will force us to replace our existing energy system but that system is the foundation of modern civilisation it is utopian to hope it could be fully transformed by renewables in their current form with energy sources that often have densities and efficiencies lower than those of fossil fuels you cannot replace something with its negation you replace it with a successor a higher synthesis related

candidates running in saxman metlakatla and on prince of wales island here s a rundown of what s on the ballot in ketchikan borough mayor pick one rodney dial incumbent is seeking a second three year term in office though the mayor s office doesn t have a ton of formal power in ketchikan s weak mayor strong manager form of government the retired state trooper touted his commitment to advocating for ketchikan as a full time mayor during a krbd forum this month i believe that years ago we outgrew a ceremonial mayor probably sometime after the pulp mill and we started transitioning into tourism dial said during the roughly 80 minute forum dial refused to say whether he supported or opposed proposition 2 a measure that ll go before voters outside ketchikan and saxman city limits that would prevent the borough from collecting a tax that provides roughly 40 of the ketchikan public library s funding more on that under ballot propositions at the end of this voter guide if i as an elected official said something either for or against it people would say that i m trying to influence the election dial said it wouldn t be appropriate for me to do that but dial did say that if proposition 2 passes he would not use his veto power to prevent the borough assembly from funding the library another way the assembly which represents everybody on the island can make the decision that we re going to fund it a different way and that would be their call he said dial said he d use his veto sparingly adding that he d only used his veto pen on two occasions one of those was a veto of a resolution asking the alaska legislature to protect lgbtq civil rights and more recently to eliminate a 1 638 borough grant to the ketchikan pride alliance for education and outreach events the assembly overrode his veto both times katie parrott the school district finance official who s challenging dial took aim at the vetoes i ll admit and be quite frank that it has felt sometimes that an organization like ketchikan pride alliance is kind of unfairly characterized in ways in community conversations that have come up she said other organizations in this community haven t had to combat the same kinds of concerns about their group being too political parrott also explicitly opposed proposition 2 the library funding ballot question the library provides so many critical resources and services to this community that go so far beyond being able to check out a book she said literally for some people for young families and vulnerable people and people who can t necessarily afford maybe internet services and those kinds of things the library is a lifesaver parrott who already has a full time job as the school district s business manager says the mayor s role should be nonpartisan and ceremonial a sharp contrast from dial s vision of the position while i know that having a very active mayor is a benefit to the community we do have a strong manager form of government she said adding that advocacy for federal funds and other community priorities should be done in concert with the borough administration and the assembly as a whole and speaking of parrott s day job her role has been the subject of some scrutiny since the borough partially funds ketchikan s school district though parrott and dial didn t spar on that topic during the forum dial previously said parrott s job creates an unavoidable conflict of interest that could prevent her from participating in discussions about the borough s education funding and other related subjects update ketchikan borough mayor candidate katie parrott plans to quit school district job parrott for her part doesn t see a conflict as she said in an interview last month whether it s in my capacity serving the community at the school district or in my capacity as an elected official in this community i serve one master and that one master is the citizens of ketchikan she said read more and listen to or watch the whole forum here city council there are two separate races for city council two full three year terms are up for grabs and there s a separate race for a lone one year seat krbd held a forum with the three year and one year candidates on sept 15 the roughly two hour forum is available to rewatch on facebook three year city council candidates pick two lallette kistler incumbent is looking to build on her one year of experience on the city council she was appointed to the council last year to fill a vacancy one thing she s got her eye on is restructuring the city s sales tax cap currently only the first 2 000 of most purchases are subject to sales taxes and sales tax is only charged on the first 1 000 of residential rent so someone paying 2 500 a month pays the same in sales taxes as someone making 1 000 the people that are getting the most relief are the people that are at the higher income brackets and the people that are at the lower income brackets assuming because they re in the lower rent categories are paying 100 on taxes on their rent and so it really just doesn t make any sense kistler said shortly after filing for office in august kistler pitches herself as a problem solver with a wide variety of personal experiences i have a background in a lot of different things insurance banking securities the arts self employment construction grocery and restaurant business she said mark flora incumbent has been on the council for six years and says he d provide a steady hand during a time of transition for the city with a new city manager coming in and the amount of turnover that we ve had in some high level staff positions i think there may be some value for the community in having some continuity on the council flora said last month flora says he s proud of his accomplishments on the council so far he points to a new lease with hospital operator peacehealth and the city s work securing a federal grant for a new domestic violence shelter as highlights i think what i m most proud of actually though is i ve tried to be very prepared i ve been objective i ve got no agendas i m not aligned with any special interest in anything and i think that s actually maybe one of the very best things i bring to the council flora said dion booth is a political newcomer and he says homelessness and public safety are top of mind our homeless issue is a big one for me he said it s not just the local guys who are down on their luck or whatever it s a lot of new faces and a lot more of them and it s scary as a parent to let your kid go play outside by themselves he says the city should study the issue to come up with a solution booth says too often city council members vote against the will of their constituents most recently the property tax issue that was very obvious people didn t want that and it was still a close call he said an effort to raise property taxes to fund raises for city workers failed by a 1 6 vote in may and the council ultimately instituted a seasonal sales tax plan instead asked for other ideas to raise revenue he suggested an unconventional approach writing tickets to people who leave shopping carts from the local safeway grocery store on the docks of the nearby bar harbor marina kevin kristovich another first time municipal candidate is appealing to voters as a voice for change he says he opposes the council s recent decision to raise sales taxes during the summer to capitalize on visitor traffic then cut them in the winter he says he would prefer to place the tax burden more squarely on visitors instead he also says ketchikan s city government should not expand its downtown port he says that with four downtown berths and two north of town it already feels too crowded and congested when cruise ships are in town as my father would have said they re trying to make a booming metropolis out of this little whistle stop town and that s exactly what happened he said last month and kristovich says he s looking for solutions to ketchikan s housing crisis he suggested taxing vacant homes and apartments to encourage landlords to rent to locals just vote for the name you know he said my family name has been here a long time we go back a long way i ve seen this town develop over the decades and it seems like it s getting out of control jamie king is also seeking her first elected office she says she s lived in ketchikan for most of her life save for a stint in the navy s construction battalion and some time as an exchange student in sweden these days she s an administrative assistant for the ketchikan borough transit department king says she thinks a seat on the city council would be an interesting job and a way to serve the community she says she doesn t have her eye on any particular key issues but she says she wants to help shape ketchikan s future the future should look like a riot of ideas and things to do and new businesses and opportunities while really looking at what works for ketchikan she said we as a city i think are so personable and innovative and i feel like not everybody gets to experience that even amongst our community she says she s relatively satisfied with the city council s recent work she said she couldn t name an issue she would have decided differently she says she s a hard worker who s ready to serve amy williams name will appear on the city council ballot but williams told krbd in an email this month that she has ended her campaign i m really disappointed and i hope next year will be better timing for me she said one year city council candidates pick one jack finnegan is a sport fishing guide and first time candidate and he says he s especially interested in addressing ketchikan s housing shortage he says it s clear there are no easy solutions but he says he d like to do something about the proliferation of short term rental properties i know it s been a useful source of income for a lot of people i know there s a lot of attraction for people who want to come to ketchikan and visit but i think there s an adverse and unintended tradeoff if in the pursuit of getting short term rentals going we eliminate or restrict the number of rentals that are available to people who want to live here and make this place their home and contribute to this community finnegan said finnegan says he s always open to hearing new and different points of view even from people whose politics don t align with his own he says he s a good listener and is willing to compromise to get things done christopher cumings a teacher s aide at ketchikan charter school has run for office before he entered statewide races for u s house in 2018 and u s senate in 2020 but he s still looking for his first victory like other candidates he says housing is a pressing problem the city should address cumings also points to mental health as a top issue and says the city should partner with other organizations to improve treatment in ketchikan i ve experienced what it s like to be in a mental health crisis and get sent out of town to try to get better from breaking down because we don t have anything to offer people here we can only help them for a couple of days and then we ve got to send them out he said we re setting a really vulnerable population up for failure he says he s also interested in limiting the impact of tourism on residents cumings pitches himself as an unconventional candidate someone unlike most others on the council dave timmerman s name will appear on the ballot but timmerman asked voters to pick someone else after krbd published an investigation into his criminal history borough assembly pick two krbd held a forum with the candidates for ketchikan gateway borough assembly on sept 15 listen to the whole forum below or watch the video on facebook austin otos incumbent is seeking his second three year term in office and housing is his no 1 priority i kind of want to focus refocus our efforts what we have been doing on housing in particular he said looking at some new larger subdivisions to use some of the infrastructure money to build roads and then increase your housing stock he says he s also proud of the programs the borough put in place during the pandemic to help keep local businesses afloat and ensure renters could afford to stay in their homes otos says he d also like to close a deficit in the borough s education funding account with the roughly 1 2 million the borough receives annually from the federal government through the payment in lieu of taxes program that money currently goes to the borough s general fund he said at a recent meeting that he d like to increase the sales tax cap to 4 000 to raise additional revenue josh titus is a base manager for guardian flight a private medevac provider he s a newcomer to local politics he says an assembly seat would be his first time in elected office some of my biggest things are the economy and housing i m interested in a sustainable government and so that would be decreased spending titus said he says he d also like to cut taxes though local government races are officially nonpartisan titus pitches himself as a small government conservative smaller government conservative thinking titus said i want to return the power and control back to the people in the community not have it in the hands of bureaucrats michael iann martin says he d like to see the borough promote the development of more year round businesses in ketchikan possibly with loans to small companies he says he d also like to boost school funding and increase ketchikan s supply of housing opening up new land is great i know we ve been looking at that but initial development is really cost prohibitive to a lot of people martin said so beyond just opening up land we need to make sure we re developing land and making it accessible to everybody martin is currently an appointed member of ketchikan s planning commission but an assembly seat would be his first time in elected office martin says he s worked with youth in the community for the last 20 years he s currently with residential youth care a local behavioral health nonprofit i really enjoy this community i fell in love with it the moment i got off the airplane and i want to continue to see it grow and thrive i want it to be a place my children grow up to love and either want to stay in or at least come back to visit in my old age he said i think we have a lot of resources available to us to continue to grow and i d like to be a main piece of helping that happen glen thompson is looking to make a comeback in local elected politics he s seeking a fifth three year term on the assembly after a few years away from local government he pitches himself as a budget hawk we need to be fiscally responsible he said we need to figure out how to make sure that the budget is solid and sustainable over time thompson who also served on the school board for just under two years before resigning in 2019 says he d like to keep the borough s funding to the school district about the same or slightly higher than it is but he says he s concerned about the state of the borough s deficit plagued education funding account and wants to balance the fund by dedicating more of the borough s revenue towards education thompson does take issue with one major line item in the borough s budget he s among the roughly 300 people who signed a petition to ask voters to cut borough funding for the ketchikan public library i think the library should be paid for by city taxes and they can pull it out of the sales tax that everybody pays into he said now if the city believes that that s not adequate or not fair and they decide they want to charge folks who don t live inside the city limits a fee to use the library i m fine with that school board pick two krbd held a forum with the candidates for ketchikan s school board on sept 15 listen to the whole forum below or watch the video on facebook tom heutte has been appointed to two partial terms on the board in prior years he touts his experience on nonprofit boards including for full disclosure krbd s board which does not direct news coverage heutte says he has a knack for listening organizing and making decisions i enjoy the process i enjoy rolling up my sleeves and working on topics that are really important for the functioning of the school district in our schools heutte said sometimes it s behind the scenes stuff like working on finding the best insurance plans for school district employees and sometimes it s more controversial upfront issues that come before the board from the public he says he sees serving on the school board as public service i want to give back to the community that has welcomed me and has been such a great place heutte said and because i understand to keep our community working well we need a broad base of people from the community helping out and serving in roles that they re well suited for melissa o bryan says she would bring a unique perspective to the school board she s a parent of four kids a graduate of ketchikan s school system a former teacher s aide and a disability advocate i feel like i have a well rounded balance of issues that the district faces she said i just really want to figure out the best way to support the kids in our district and support the staff we have and the families we have o bryan is currently in project development for ketchikan indian community s housing department she says she s focused on helping students continue to recover from pandemic disruptions i think the biggest thing right now is how it looks coming out of covid she said what it looks like for supporting staff burnout how our kids are doing the pandemic was hard on everybody virtual learning was hard on everybody she also says she supports the use of southeast traditional tribal values in schools that s currently the subject of a lawsuit against the district by

state ferry system who says he d like to improve teacher retention and student graduation rates they re just begging for teachers and aides and all that kind of stuff so i m wondering what s going on arnold said and that s the other thing i think there s a lot of politics in school now and that s one of my things is to keep politics out of the classroom and let the kids learn arnold says that means he s opposed to things like mask mandates and school closures he says more needs to be done to understand why it s difficult to recruit and retain teachers he also says he supports the use of tribal values in school i don t have a problem with that i ve seen that poster and i think it s great he said arnold also says he d like to expand ketchikan s vocational education to teach students

no borough ballot propositions are listed on the borough ballot along with the borough mayor assembly and school board races proposition 1 borough wide proposition 1 asks voters whether borough assembly members should continue to be elected on an at large basis under the current system assembly members represent the borough as a whole and are elected by voters all across ketchikan rather than representing certain districts the at large system was first approved in 1980 and has been in effect ever since the borough is required to ask voters whether to change the system of representation after each decennial census if approved with a yes vote there would be no change to assembly representation if more than 50 vote no on the proposition the borough would be required to ask voters how the system should be modified in a special election there are more details on page 4 of the borough s voter information pamphlet proposition 2 for voters outside of ketchikan and saxman city limits proposition 2 asks voters whether to repeal the borough s nonareawide library powers that would remove the borough s ability to collect a property tax on homes and businesses outside city limits that is specifically earmarked for the ketchikan public library sponsors of the initiative which collected more than 300 signatures to place the item on the ballot say it s a response to the library s decision to host a storytime with a drag queen during pride month in june the tax currently set at 70 cents per 1 000 of assessed value provides about 38 of the library s annual funding or about 516 000 without that funding city officials say the library would be forced to dramatically cut its hours lay off half its staff eliminate most programming for children teens and adults and restrict residents who live outside city limits from checking out books and end and would require major changes to the library s agreement to share books and online resources with the ketchikan gateway borough school district a yes vote would remove the library tax a no vote would retain the library tax if the measure passes the borough assembly could fund the library through other means

here are the highlights of events related to the war in ukraine over the past 24 hours putin announced an immediate partial military mobilization russian president vladimir putin surprisingly announced a partial military mobilization and threatened nato with nuclear weapons in addition he announced that he supports yesterday s apparently coordinated calls by the occupation authorities in the territories of ukraine occupied by the russian army to hold referendums on joining russia from friday we have no moral right to abandon these people putin said signaling yet another round of annexation of a foreign country s territory the relevant decree has already been signed mobilization activities will begin from september 21 wednesday he announced in a televised address the call for military service will belong only to those citizens who are in the reserve and above all those who have served in the armed forces have certain military specialties and relevant experience putin emphasized this is an unprecedented decision for russia since the end of world war ii shortly after that defense minister sergei shoigu made a speech according to whom 300 000 people will be called up for military service the minister assured that we have huge resources of 25 million people and the mobilization is for those who have passed military service have specialties in missiles artillery tank and liaison units are on military record or have combat experience russian laws stipulate that from today all borders of russia are closed for them to leave it groups such as students or conscripts for example will not be affected he officially increased the number of russian soldiers killed to almost 6 000 in the ministry s first data since march on the dead soldiers in ukraine the presidential decree states that those actually working in the military industrial complex will receive a deferment from mobilization and the government is ordered to determine other categories of citizens who will benefit from this exception putin justified his decision not with the war in ukraine but because the west crossed all lines in its aggression against russia which he wanted to destroy therefore he took the necessary urgent steps to protect the sovereignty security and territorial integrity of russia in his video address he returned to his most extreme statements since the beginning of the war talking about the neo nazi regime that seized power in ukraine in 2014 as a result of an armed coup about our brothers and sisters residents of donetsk and the luhansk people s republics kherson and zaporizhzhia regions and other regions freed from the neo nazi regime and about the cleansing of cities and villages from neo nazis in donbas after saying that the west crudely imposes its will on other countries and peoples and instills its pseudo values on them putin added the goal of this west is to weaken divide and ultimately destroy our country they already directly say that in 1991 they managed to split the soviet union and now the time has come for russia itself to break up into regions and districts at war with each other the ruble immediately began to depreciate on the moscow stock exchange losing 2 3 of its value minutes after putin s speech falling below 62 rubles to the dollar mykhailo podolyak a key adviser to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky told reuters that putin s statement was predictable because the war was not going according to his initial plans the rest of what he said was about blaming the west for the war and the deteriorating economic situation he added in ukraine they issued a warning to all men in the occupied territories to flee immediately because after the referendums ending on september 27 they will be forced into the trenches to fight under russian laws as was already done in the lpr and dpr germany putin must understand that he cannot win the war putin will give up his imperial ambitions which risk destroying ukraine and russia only if he realizes he cannot win the war this was stated by german chancellor olaf scholz in his speech before the 77th session of the un general assembly which began on tuesday evening the chancellor of europe s biggest economy said the return of imperialism with putin s war on ukraine was not only a disaster for europe but also for the rules based world order he called on the un to protect them from those who would prefer a world in which the strong rule the weak shall we watch helplessly as some seek to catapult us back into a world order where war is a common vehicle of politics independent nations must align themselves with their stronger neighbors or colonial masters and prosperity and human rights are the privilege of the lucky few or do we manage it together to ensure that the multipolar world of the 21st century remains a multilateral world my answer as a german and a european is we have to manage it stated olaf scholz the us and the eu will not recognize the referendums in ukraine on joining russia pro russian leaders of the occupied four ukrainian regions have announced plans to hold referendums on joining russia in the coming days these intentions were strongly condemned by world leaders at the un general assembly in what appeared to be a concerted move pro russian representatives announced referendums between september 23 and 27 in luhansk donetsk kherson and zaporizhzhia regions which account for about 15 percent of ukraine s territory about the size of hungary some of the pro russian authorities in these regions described the polls which have been in the works for several months as an ultimatum to the west to accept russian territorial gains or face all out war in a similar model the crimean peninsula was annexed in 2014 russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said from the very beginning of the special military operation and even before that we claim that the peoples in these territories must decide their own destiny the eu s top diplomat josep borrell said the bloc would not recognize the results of the referendums us national security adviser jake sullivan said washington unequivocally rejects these referendums we know that these referendums will be manipulated we know that russia will use these sham referendums as a basis to annex these territories now or in the future let me be clear if this happens and this is not yet certain the us will never to recognize russia s claims we unequivocally reject russia s actions and will continue to work with our allies and partners to make moscow pay and support ukraine french president emmanuel macron described the referendum plans as a travesty on the sidelines of the 77th session of the united nations general assembly in new york these referendums will have no legal value let alone the annexation of territories where hostilities are taking place what russia has announced is a travesty the only real thing is the war that russia has decided on and the resistance of ukraine referendums will be rigged according to german chancellor olaf scholz ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky downplayed the plans of the pro russian authorities there are many questions on this occasion but what actually happened what sounded from what was not heard before our positions are known only this should interest us not what sounds somewhere but the things which are our task but at the same time he stressed there are some countries that today want to be on the sidelines but there should not be a balance between good and evil light and darkness in the war of the aggressor and the colonizer the russian federation which is at war exactly against us with open occupation these countries must to choose a side in kherson where the regional capital is the only major city russia still holds ukraine launched a counteroffensive one is also being prepared in luhansk with the goal being the restoration of the entire region said governor serhii gaidai russia currently controls 60 percent of the donetsk region after its forces were driven out of neighboring kharkiv province this month in the south russia controls most of the zaporizhzhia region but not the regional capital lavrov arrived in new york after over 12 hours of flight russian foreign minister sergey lavrov arrived in new york at the 77th session of the un general assembly he will hardly keep good memories of this trip the diplomat spent more than 12 hours on the plane because the aircraft had to bypass airspace closed by unfriendly countries and was not even allowed to land this is clear from a tass report russian planes are banned from flying over eu airspace as well as european countries such as the united kingdom norway or switzerland in addition to canada and the united states itself for the united states lavrov and his delegation received the visas necessary to enter the country but only to attend the annual meeting of the un general assembly yesterday russian president vladimir putin announced that in his speech to the organization lavrov would defend moscow s position on ending the unipolar world putin accused the us of wanting to impose hegemony on the un general assembly the development of multipolarity meets resistance from those who seek to maintain a hegemonic role in world affairs and control everything latin america europe asia and africa but this cannot last forever it is impossible said putin yesterday we in russia will not give up our sovereign path as a permanent member of the un security council we want to advance a unifying international agenda and contribute to the resolution of serious regional crises he assured the war in ukraine emphasized in the speeches of the un general assembly the war in ukraine could lead to a new division in the world at a time when climate change and rising food prices could lead to instability these are some of the highlights of the speeches of world leaders at the 77th un general assembly taking place in new york yesterday french president emmanuel macron described russia s invasion of ukraine as a new era of imperialism and warned that inaction could destroy the world order without which peace is not possible one of the highlights of today is the speech of us president joe biden the forum at the un this week is an opportunity for the us to confirm the condemnation of russia s actions and isolate it even more on the international stage president joe biden will speak during the sixth plenary session which begins today at 4 p m bulgarian time biden who relies on direct contact with leaders will look for opportunities to use his touted acquaintances with world leaders stemming from his five decades of experience as a public figure expectations are for busy meetings with global leaders with an emphasis on the war in ukraine global inflation china s growing influence climate change and the president s key topic of threats to democracy around the world this is the first un general assembly since the start of the covid 19 pandemic where world leaders will be able to see each other live instead of during hybrid and virtual formats ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky will participate virtually the leaders of china and russia will not be in new york and their representatives will be there instead the bulgarian

washington reuters how much faith federal reserve officials still have in prospects for a soft landing as they take aggressive action to quash the highest inflation in 40 years will be revealed on wednesday when the central bank releases fresh policymaker forecasts the projections from the 19 policymakers to be published in tandem with the announcement of what is likely to be the fed s third straight 75 basis point interest rate hike are not expected to coalesce around a massive jump in unemployment or a contraction of the economy those were the outcomes the last time the fed under paul volcker s leadership battled super high inflation in the 1980s earlier this month fed chair jerome powell said he believes that this time around the fed can avoid such very high social costs in part because households and businesses haven t internalized the kind of inflationary mindset that back then required double digit interest rates to vanquish at the same time he said americans are in for some pain ahead as the fed works to end inflation and prevent what would otherwise be even worse outcomes while the fed is still likely to view a soft landing as a modal outcome the window appears to be narrowing bank of america economists wrote recent fed communications have acknowledged this in part by leaning more strongly in the direction of needing to slow labor markets and accepting the risks to activity that come with it unemployment forecast in focus and while the new quarterly summary of policymaker projections may appear to rule out a volcker style hard landing it is widely expected to point to notably higher unemployment and slower economic growth in the coming year that by at least one well known benchmark could signal a recession of some stripe that benchmark known as the sahm rule after former fed staffer claudia sahm who identified and formalized it says the u s economy is typically in recession once the 3 month moving average of the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above the rate s lowest three month average over the preceding 12 months that low currently is around 3 56 economists polled by reuters expect the unemployment rate to rise to 4 1 by the second quarter of 2023 and to 4 3 by the fourth quarter far lower than the 14 7 reached in the pandemic crisis or the 10 8 peak during the volcker recession but high enough to meet the sahm rule test historically once the unemployment rate rises by half a percentage point it continues to rise another point or two if not more policymaker projections for the economy hinge on their views of the appropriate setting of monetary policy a window into which will also be published on wednesday as part of the fed s quarterly summary of economic projections or seps this week s decision is expected to take the fed policy rate to a range of 3 3 25 from the current 2 25 2 50 the so called dot plot incorporated in the seps will indicate each policymaker s view of where rates should be at the end of each year through 2025 we expect the dot plot to show a peak fed funds rate of 4 4 next year which will push the unemployment rate to near 4 5 over the forecast horizon wrote economists at deutsche bank in the most recent forecasts issued in june the fed funds rate was seen peaking at 3 8 in 2023 with the jobless rate climbing to 4 1 the following year recession ahead since the dot plot s advent in 2012 only one policymaker has ever forecast rates to rise that high and that forecast in late 2012 and early 2013 for end of year 2015 rates to reach 4 5 turned out to be spectacularly wrong the fed instead kept the policy rate at near zero until december 2015 when it lifted it by just a quarter of a percentage point this time around though financial markets are pricing in a top fed funds rate of 4 5 next year with a rate cut or two seen as more than likely toward the second half of 2023 wednesday s projections will also give a read on how quickly fed policymakers expect their actions to take a bite out of inflation and how much the economy is likely to slow in june inflation was seen remaining above the fed s 2 target through 2024 while not even the most pessimistic policymaker expected the economy to contract in coming quarters most penciled in gross domestic product growth of between 1 3 and 2 for each of the next three years the new economic projections will highlight the fed s pain tolerance with real gdp growth likely to be revised significantly lower wrote ey parthenon chief economist gregory daco adding that the forecast for next year s unemployment rate could very well exceed 4 5 inflation projections however could stick close to those laid out in june he said amid dueling forces from inflation persistence and a more aggressive fed stance and likely recession reporting by ann saphir and howard schneider editing by dan burns and andrea ricci by ann saphir and howard schneider
