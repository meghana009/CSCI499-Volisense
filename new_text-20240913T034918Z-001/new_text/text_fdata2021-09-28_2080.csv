yield rose up to 1 54 overnight the highest since june there s a growing concern that higher inflation is not transitory something fed chief jerome powell will likely address in his congressional

years u s natural gas futures jumped 10 after spiking monday natgas futures are at their highest since 2014 higher energy prices are good news for oil and gas plays while the higher and widening

democrats who believe the bipartisan infrastructure package with some 550 billion in extra funding was being held hostage with a 3 seat democratic majority in the house pelosi has little room to maneuver it s unclear if left wing democrats will vote for the infrastructure deal which will likely get only a handful of gop house votes without some sort of assurances on the reconciliation package pelosi has recently signaled the reconciliation bill will be smaller than the long targeted 3 5 trillion with sen joe manchin d w v pushing for 1 trillion to 1 5 trillion the infrastructure bill vote

washington ap in a rare moment of ethical controversy for the federal reserve two top officials resigned monday in the wake of revelations about their financial trading that exposed potential shortcomings in the fed s rules on investments eric rosengren the president of the federal reserve bank of boston said he would step down this week for health reasons meanwhile robert kaplan the president of the dallas fed said he would resign oct 8 to avoid becoming a distraction from the fed s broader mission the two officials financial disclosures sparked criticism from government watchdogs after they revealed extensive stock trading in 2020 when the fed was spending trillions of dollars stabilizing financial markets and boosting the economy because of their trading the two officials could potentially have profited from the fed s actions though the investments by rosengren and kaplan were permitted under the fed s rules they raised at least the appearance of conflicts of interest which fed policy discourages sen elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat sharply criticized the trades and called for a ban on stock ownership by fed officials fed chair jerome powell will testify tuesday before the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee which includes warren and will likely face questioning about the fed s ethics rules the resignations will give powell a specific response he can point to observers said the departure of rosengren and kaplan should ease pressure on powell who notably failed to express confidence in the two presidents at a news conference last week said krishna guha an analyst at the investment bank evercore isi the presidents of the 12 regional banks participate in the fed s private policymaking meetings in which they discuss the central bank s interest rate policies and are privy to economic data not always available to the public the fed s decisions can cause sharp swings in financial markets so can the presidents speeches and comments to the media fed chair jerome powell said last week that the fed would change its ethics policies in the wake of the disclosures yet the fed may still face pressure to allow an outside investigation into whether the two officials or any others traded based on inside information about the fed s actions after this egregious breach of public trust nothing but a full investigation and a referral to the securities and exchange commission is acceptable said jeff hauser director of the revolving door project a nonprofit group that monitors government appointments last year kaplan made trades worth at least 1 million in 22 stocks and index funds including amazon chevron facebook and johnson johnson the federal reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy kaplan said in a written statement unfortunately the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction kaplan said he would resign oct 8 rosengren had invested in funds that owned mortgage backed bonds the same kind that the fed has been buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth this year rosengren said he became eligible last year for a kidney transplant and said the stress of working at the fed during the pandemic recession worsened his health it has become clear that i should aim to reduce my stress so that i can focus on my health issues he said rosengren and kaplan were not voting members of the fed s policymaking committee this year but they contributed to forecasts of the fed s interest rate policy which last week showed the fed was considering hiking its short term rate currently at nearly zero by the end of 2022 that was a shift from june when the fed s projections did not show any hike until 2023 both are considered relatively hawkish policymakers meaning that they often favor higher interest rates to counter inflation powell s own financial disclosures show that he owned municipal bonds in 2020 even though the fed began purchasing such bonds for the first time last year in order to stabilize that market powell who was a private equity executive before being appointed to the fed s board in 2012 said last week he had owned munis for years and cleared his continued ownership with the office of government ethics at last week s press conference powell touched on a reason that these ethics concerns have flared previously municipal bonds were seen as a safe asset for fed officials to own because the fed didn t buy or sell them yet last year it did and it also began buying corporate bonds for the first time the boston fed s first vice president kenneth c montgomery will take over as acting president and ceo dallas fed first vice president meredith black will become

dallas fed president robert kaplan will soon be retiring according to an announcement from the central bank that came just hours after news broke that boston fed chief eric rosengren would be stepping down early for health reasons both regional presidents have been under fire after financial disclosures showed each made significant stock trades last year drawing the attention of critics who said the rules need to be tightened regarding what assets fed officials may hold jerome powell says fed to change trading rules for central bank officials it has been my great honor to serve as the president and ceo of the federal reserve bank of dallas for the past six years and to work with the superbly talented professionals at the bank who are helping to build a stronger economy for all communities in the eleventh district and our nation kaplan said in a statement accompanying the announcement of his oct 8 departure he added during my tenure i have adhered to all federal reserve ethical standards and policies my securities investing activities and disclosures met bank compliance rules and standards in announcing rosengren s retirement earlier in the day the boston fed said in a statement that in a message to the bank s staff dr rosengren revealed for the first time that he qualified for the kidney transplant list in june of 2020 during the pandemic upon the worsening of a kidney condition he has had for many years saying that delaying the need for dialysis might be improved if he makes lifestyle changes now to lessen the risks of his condition rosengren was already due to retire in nine months but the will now retire on thursday after 35 years at the boston fed kaplan was a senior associate dean at harvard business school prior to his time at the dallas fed while neither kaplan nor rosengren broke any of the rules federal reserve officials are beholden to their trades caught the attention of lawmakers and others who argued that similar trades such as those involving individual stocks or real estate investment trusts could be a conflict of interest get fox business on the go by clicking here earlier this month the fed announced that chairman jerome powell had ordered a review of the central bank s ethics policies to determine whether changes were needed within days of that announcement powell vowed that changes were definitely coming we need to make changes and we re going to do that as a consequence of this powell told reporters last week regarding the trades made by the fed officials no one is happy about this
success racing on two wheels doesn t guarantee success on four wheels but paul goldsmith crossed that bridge and never slowed down a nationally known star in motorcycle racing in the early 1950s goldsmith with the considerable help of mechanic crew chief racing guru smokey yunick transitioned to stock cars and became one of nascar s finest he raced in the cup series from 1956 to 1969 scoring nine wins and 44 top fives despite running only partial schedules he and engineer team owner ray nichels a 2021 motorsports hall of fame of america inductee were a dynamic duo for part of that period goldsmith s most notable nascar achievement will keep his name in stock car racing record books forever he won the final race on the famous daytona beach fla beach road course steering a yunick owned pontiac to a five car length win in 1958 a year later daytona international speedway opened a few miles from the shoreline and the beach road course which combined racing on the atlantic sand with the parallel two lane paved highway lost to the tide of the times racingone getty images paul goldsmith drives his smokey yunick prepared machine to the final nascar win on the daytona beach course on the beach in 1958 as with several other race locations goldsmith used experience racing motorcycles to help navigate the difficulties of the daytona beach road course goldsmith also had won on motorcycles on the course goldmith tamed langhorne langhorne speedway was nascar s killing field the same dynamic helped goldsmith score his first cup victory sept 23 1956 at the storied langhorne speedway in pennsylvania known as the track that ate the heroes langhorne was one of the most dangerous speedways in the country at least 23 competitors died in accidents on the near circular one mile track a lead driver for harley davidson goldsmith won at langhorne in 1953 one of the highlights of a motorcycle racing career that would earn him entry into the american motorcyclist association hall of fame racingone getty images langhorne speedway circa 1957 three years later goldsmith returned to langhorne in a stock car and used his mental blueprint of the track to win in nascar for the first time outdistancing series veteran lee petty by an embarrassing seven laps he led 182 of the 300 laps it was a terrible track said goldsmith echoing the opinions of many drivers who ran langhorne it was mainly about the kind of surface it was some of it was deep some of it shallow it was a lot of work but i didn t have much trouble i could run just about wide open around the track because i knew where to go i knew where the bumps were and where the surface changed the race was a grueling affair 300 laps around the wicked langhorne circle twenty four of the 44 starters failed to finish the race and the fifth place finisher herb thomas was a full 10 laps behind few were surprised at the power of the track to decimate the field driver cotton owens said racing at langhorne was like jumping a fresh plowed field racingone getty images paul goldsmith s no 3 ford in action during the 1957 nascar season the race was entertaining however particularly as goldsmith and emerging star fireball roberts who would win five times that season exchanged the lead over a tense series of laps roberts challenge to goldsmith ended however when he parked his ford with a broken oil line the langhorne win came in goldsmith s eighth nascar race and made him the first competitor to take checkered flags there in motorcycle and stock car events racingone getty images paul goldsmith left and smokey yunick were a nascar dream team of sorts in the late 50s yunick had been goldsmith s agent as he shifted from two wheels to four i met smokey racing motorcycles on the beach at daytona goldsmith said remembering the moment 65 years later he saw me running on the sand and came over and said why don t we take your motorcycle out on this highway and so some things to it and make it go a little faster we went out there on a back road and i ran with another bike i could stay even with him we kept tinkering with mine changing different things over a four day period and pretty soon i outran the other bike pretty bad that helped me win the 200 mile bike race on the beach yunick a mechanical genius who also had a good eye for talented drivers pushed goldsmith into stock cars and they returned to the beach and the tough 4 1 mile test with four wheels it was difficult to get a car set up for both the beach and the highway goldsmith said and the highway was rough the car wouldn t handle unless you had the right suspension smokey helped me with that quite a bit we went out on a back road there about four miles north of daytona and worked on different shocks tire pressures and suspensions that s where we learned how to do it and i had raced motorcycles there so that helped racingone getty images goldsmith s no 3 fishtails coming out of a turn on the old daytona beach road course in 1957 goldsmith outran curtis turner the driver he later would classify as the toughest to beat to win the beach road course finale in a pontiac carrying sponsorship from yunick s famous best damn garage in town goldsmith won once in cup in 1956 four times in 1957 once in 1958 and three times in 1966 his best season by the time goldsmith who also raced at indianapolis motor speedway and in usac stock cars retired from competition in 1969 to concentrate on business interests his home and office were filled with trophies from a spectrum of racing disciplines including oddly one for a brief foray into harness racing mike hembree paul goldsmith is a member of both the american motorcycle association hall of fame and the motorsports hall of fame of america at 95 years old he turns 96 on oct 2 goldsmith remains active his office at the griffith merrillville ind airport which he owns contains some racing memorabilia but his trophies were scattered to the winds over the years some going to friends and relatives i had a truckload in here he said i had to get rid of them but wait there s more goldsmith s worst racing injury occurred during his motorcycle career in a race at a track near cleveland he ran his bike into a fence to avoid hitting another rider he slid off the track banking and into race traffic a following driver ran across his feet breaking both goldsmith born oct 2 1925 is the oldest surviving winner of a cup series race goldsmith probably could have challenged for a cup championship but he never ran anything close to a full season he finished fifth in points in 1966

español the solution to california s housing crisis is simple scrap the california environmental quality act at least according to the major republican candidates in the sept 14 recall election i believe one of the reasons we have a homeless problem in california is because of laws like ceqa front runner larry elder told calmatters during a recent interview john cox a republican businessman also running to unseat gov gavin newsom said he would work with the legislature to make sure ceqa is scaled down or eliminated kevin kiley a state assembly member from rocklin called ceqa a huge part of the problem democrat and youtube personality kevin paffrath said he too would reform ceqa ceqa is landmark legislation signed into law in 1970 by republican gov ronald reagan it requires public agencies to reduce or mitigate the environmental impacts of development wherever feasible essentially the law tells developers to study a project to see how it could harm the environment and explain how they will lessen the damage the law has been invoked by nimbys to block or delay multiple high profile housing projects but is this law really the culprit behind the state s housing woes or just an easy target overall experts said ceqa is a huge headache for developers and there are ample opportunities for reform but getting rid of ceqa doesn t get at the heart of the matter because it s only one of many tools cities and local neighborhood groups use to block housing and the recall candidates have much less to say about those other tools because local control remains politically sacrosanct ceqa is the boogeyman or the poster child for housing delays but it s an oversimplification of our challenges said dan dunmoyer president and ceo of the california building industry association it s an important component of it but there are many projects that we have a hard time getting to yes that have not had ceqa pulled on them a tool for nimbys or environmentalists in most other states if a developer wants to build a project and it complies with the city s general plan they can go ahead but in california even if land is zoned to allow the exact type of development proposed a majority of projects must undergo a public hearing process that gives a platform to any neighbor or group to voice their concerns explained christopher elmendorf a law professor at uc davis who focuses on land use ceqa is the boogeyman or the poster child for housing delays but it s an oversimplification of our challenges dan dunmoyer president and ceo of california building industry association ceqa is one of many tools a group can wield to raise those concerns a developer has to review whether a project will have an adverse impact on a historical resource or if the site is hazardous and propose ways to mitigate those effects if a person or group even anonymously says those issues haven t been adequately addressed they can file a lawsuit or multiple lawsuits without a deadline said jennifer hernandez a san francisco and los angeles based attorney who often defends developers from ceqa litigation ceqa lurks behind so many reasons we don t have housing she said instead of three months getting approval we can spend 10 years in 39 public hearings getting sued four times over still there s little data to quantify exactly how much time or money developers spend to bulletproof their projects against lawsuits or to pay off interest groups and there s no real data to estimate how many projects are never proposed because of the threat of litigation but in studying existing lawsuits hernandez found in 2018 that 60 of ceqa lawsuits filed between 2010 and 2012 targeted residential housing developments and the vast majority of them were urban infill developments not projects in outlying areas other lawyers have contested these findings she also found 64 of plaintiffs in ceqa lawsuits have no track record of environmental advocacy showing she says that the law was being abused by unions and nimbys ceqa lurks behind so many reasons we don t have housing jennifer hernandez attorney who defends developers against ceqa litigation still supporters of ceqa argue it s crucial in preserving existing housing stock as well as protecting air and water ashley werner senior attorney with leadership counsel for justice and accountability in fresno has sued multiple industrial developments including an amazon warehouse over the impact it could have on residents of the surrounding area issues such as houses shaking when thousands of trucks roll by dust from construction seeping into existing housing structures or worsening air pollution for mostly low income communities of color near industrial developments would never be addressed if it weren t for ceqa she said but when no one s watching as in many san joaquin valley developments she argued the law goes unused and environmental damage happens hernandez said she s never called for getting rid of ceqa she believes those filing lawsuits should be forced to disclose their identity and motivation wants to eliminate duplicative lawsuits and argues that ceqa should only apply to projects that truly harm the environment public health or tribal resources the power of local control while hernandez has studied existing lawsuits at length other researchers who looked at project approvals in general found most developments never reach the point of litigation in a 2016 review of ceqa lawsuits filed between 2013 and 2015 researchers for the environmental nonprofit rose foundation concluded that fewer than 1 of projects subject to environmental review housing or not faced lawsuits a no to upzoning sign placed on the lawn of an east sacramento home on aug 4 2021 photo by anne wernikoff calmatters a more recent unpublished study found that fewer than 3 of 2 001 total projects with more than five housing units approved in 20 california jurisdictions between 2014 and 2017 were ever litigated and only 30 of those lawsuits relied exclusively on ceqa according to moira o neill senior research fellow at uc berkeley s center for law energy the environment the majority of suits also argued violations of local land use law o neill and her colleagues also found the number of steps and time it took to get a project approved varied wildly between jurisdictions even though ceqa applied to all of them in oakland for example projects took an average of five months to approve compared to more than two years in san francisco by reforming ceqa you re not solving the problem because the biggest problem is local governments placing obstacles in the way of housing development o neill said dunmoyer from the california building industry association supports ceqa reform but he said he s had projects that took 15 years to approve that never encountered environmental litigation a city council can demand a developer swap building materials or push a setback from 15 to 20 feet instead of having another hearing as soon as the changes are made the council can delay the hearing for months or even years there are other tools just as simple as i don t want any more houses here and the neighbors are lining up and committing to recall me and i want nothing to do with this dunmoyer said so how do you fix ceqa attempts to change ceqa or even limit which projects it applies to are massive political undertakings just ask newsom former gov jerry brown or any state lawmaker even with a democratic supermajority bills that seek ceqa waivers struggle to even get out of policy committees in the legislature one obstacle labor unions one of the most powerful interest groups at the capitol who can use litigation or the threat of it to get concessions such as requiring union workers to build the new development buy in from the california state building and construction trades was essential to pass a ceqa streamlining bill to build large housing projects with a minimum number of affordable housing units in 2017 for example so if elected how would the recall candidates get anything done even if they were to waive ceqa using an executive order dunmoyer said they d be subject to litigation fast and when asked in calmatters interviews about engaging the interest groups so effective at killing legislation the candidates lacked a clear plan elder said he would use his bully pulpit to take on special interest groups kiley said he would campaign against legislative opponents and paffrath said he would work with the legislature to enact change the candidates have criticized newsom for not making more progress toward his goal of adding 3 5 million housing units by 2025 housing costs they say are forcing californians to leave but besides killing ceqa they have not proposed many solutions the candidates also said they supported shorter timelines for permitting approvals and slashing impact fees which are levied to pay for a project s infrastructure costs but vary widely across the state and can amount to 18 of a project s total cost assemblymember tim grayson whose bill to bring more transparency and consistency to impact fees is now winding its way through the legislature said impact fees are just as important if not more important than ceqa in raising housing costs but even his modest reform bill has taken years of collaboration did we get everything we wanted no that s where politics came in i think that s how we make the soup here at the capitol the concord democrat said when asked what they would do about local control the recall candidates said they would leave it untouched cox said he would be open to applying a carrot maybe a stick in the right circumstance i think the best decisions whether it s housing or anything else is better done at the local level elder said if you get rid of ceqa that doesn t mean much new housing is going to get built because they re not for zoning reform they re not for any of these other things that we ve identified are important to spur housing development david garcia policy director at uc berkeley s terner center and what of local zoning which often delays housing projects in a recent debate kiley cox and former san diego mayor kevin faulconer agreed they would not sign any bills to increase density on single family zoned land instead most of the candidates proposed developing land outside of major cities which is often blocked by the government established boundaries that separate urban areas from rural land according to a recent cato institute study on housing affordability paffrath proposed the development of new communities master plan style communities outside of our large cities so that way we re not going into santa monica and trying to infill a ton of new housing to counter the environmental harms of urban sprawl he also proposed building solar or wind farms but david garcia policy director for uc berkeley s terner center called it hypocritical to use ceqa as a punching bag without a clear plan to tackle some of the most powerful interest groups that often block housing legislation and production i think it s a bit of a red herring garcia said if you get rid of ceqa that doesn t mean much new housing is going to get built because they re not for zoning reform they re not for any of these other things that we ve identified are important to spur housing development weakling or bully the battle over ceqa the state s iconic environmental law inside the capitol s corridors and pro development quarters around the state the california environmental quality act is increasingly disparaged as a villain in the state s housing crisis but the act s environmentalist defenders are pushing back saying many projects slip too easily through leading to overdrawn groundwater tables and disappearing forests and whatever the urgency to build more

california has led the nation in fighting climate change by encouraging the use of renewable energy and electric cars now the state is taking on an even harder challenge reducing emissions from homes businesses and other buildings that have to be heated cooled and powered this month state regulators updated california s building code to require some new homes and commercial buildings to have solar panels and batteries and the wiring needed to switch from heaters that burn natural gas to heat pumps that run on electricity energy experts say it is one of the most sweeping single environmental updates to building codes ever attempted by a government agency but some energy and building experts warn that california may be taking on too much too quickly and focusing on the wrong target new buildings rather than the much larger universe of existing structures their biggest fear is that these new requirements will drive up the state s already high construction costs putting new homes out of reach of middle and lower income families that cannot as easily afford the higher upfront costs of cleaner energy and heating equipment which typically pays for itself over years through savings on monthly utility bills

menafn afp two senior federal reserve officials who recently drew intense criticism for their stock trading will retire in the coming week they announced monday although only one mentioned the controversy dallas fed bank robert kaplan said he will leave his post on october 8 while eric rosengren who leads the boston fed moved his already scheduled retirement up by several months to september 30 the two officials engaged in large stock trades in 2020 at a time when the federal reserve was aggressively acting to support the us economy amid the impact of the covid 19 pandemic according to financial disclosures first reported by the wall street journal while fed chair jerome powell stressed that the officials had not violated any existing rules he nonetheless announced plans to review the ethics rules regarding investing in announcing his retirement after six years at dallas fed kaplan noted that the us central bank is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy unfortunately the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the federal reserve s execution of that vital work he said in a statement in contrast rosengren who served as president of the boston fed for 14 years and a total of 35 years with the bank pointed to health issues and a likely kidney transplant as the reason for accelerating his departure and did not mention the controversy it has become clear that i should aim to reduce my stress so that i can focus on my health issues he said kaplan was due to retire in june when he will hit the fed s mandatory retirement age of 65 powell praised the work of both officials pointing to rosengren s relentless focus on financial stability and kaplan s passionate and forceful public voice but in a press briefing last week powell acknowledged the need to take another look at the fed s rules on investments we understand very well that the trust of the american people is essential for us to effectively carry out our mission and that is why i directed the fed to begin a comprehensive review around the ethics rules around activity by federal officials he said in the decentralized system the local boards of directors of the regional banks will pick a new president subject to approval by the fed board

none of it has anything to do with business fundamentals the stock market was deeply divided on monday with certain sectors doing far better than others in a relatively unusual development the nasdaq composite ixic 1 68 found itself on the short end of the stick with the index falling almost half a percent in mid afternoon trading even as other stock market benchmarks were up on the day overarching the nasdaq s underperformance on monday was one factor it has nothing to do with the fundamental performance of the businesses that has driven stock prices so much higher over the past 18 months however it s a key factor that many stock analysts use in determining valuation and that explains the seemingly irrational aversion to high growth stocks monday below we ll look more closely at what s happening interest rates on the rise what appears to be sending the nasdaq lower is a reaction from growth investors to a completely different side of the financial markets treasury bond yields have been on the rise lately and that s leading to a revaluation of some of the leaders in the stock market recently specifically 10 year treasury yields have gone up sharply less than a week ago the bonds were yielding just 1 3 that jumped as high as 1 52 on monday that s a very quick move for treasuries driving higher bond yields is the expectation that the federal reserve will make moves as appropriate to try to normalize monetary policy the fed probably won t make sudden unexpected rate hikes as it has done everything it can to signal a gradual return to normalcy however markets are anticipating the likelihood of tapering of bond purchases as a precursor to rate hikes the eventual exit of the fed from the treasury market could reduce demand and build more upward pressure on interest rates what does this have to do with high growth stocks what s happening in the bond market has little direct impact on high growth companies however some valuation methods for companies apply a discount rate to future profits based on how far into the future they re expected to come in the higher the discount rate the lower the value of earnings that are still several years or even a decade or more out that s likely the reason why some particular favorites on the nasdaq are doing poorly today workplace collaboration software specialist atlassian team 4 84 is down 6 latin american e commerce giant mercadolibre meli 2 00 posted a 5 decline as did veterinary diagnostics specialist idexx laboratories idxx 0 21 some decliners on the nasdaq also had company specific fundamental factors weighing them down in the vaccine space for instance expectations that the covid 19 pandemic will eventually come under control weighed on moderna mrna 0 12 biontech bntx 1 85 and novavax nvax 0 94 to the tune of 4 to 7 monday afternoon don t panic it s never fun to watch the stocks you own go down for apparently poor reasons however keep in mind that as a long term investor you don t have to worry about short term moves in the long run stocks gain ground because their fundamental business prospects are sound and lead to sustained growth if you still have confidence that the stocks you own have promising futures then be patient eventually stock prices match up well with the health of real businesses and if yours do well you can expect to profit in the end

by jonnelle marte ann saphir and howard schneider washington reuters two federal reserve officials who came under scrutiny for investment trades they made last year announced their retirements on monday in a controversy that has already sparked a planned review of the fed s ethics rules dallas fed president robert kaplan said he will retire on oct 8 citing the distraction of the controversy over his investments while boston fed president eric rosengren said he will retire on sept 30 pointing to a long term health condition the two are among 12 regional fed presidents that get rotating seats on the central bank s powerful monetary policy committee which sets u s interest rates kaplan and rosengren had faced calls to step down for investment trades made in 2020 a year in which the fed took unprecedented action to steady the economy while news of the transactions revealed in recent financial disclosures raised questions about the effectiveness of fed trading guidelines for policymakers their departure came after fed chair jerome powell who is nearing the end of his term and under consideration for reappointment as fed chief called earlier this month for a review of the central bank s ethics rules and said the policies need to change powell is due to testify before the senate banking committee on tuesday where he may face questions from democratic senator elizabeth warren who has demanded stricter ethics rules at the regional fed banks according to financial disclosures first reported by the wall street journal kaplan made multiple million dollar trades in individual stocks in 2020 rosengren invested in real estate investment trusts on a smaller scale but he was criticized for making the moves while also calling out risks in the real estate sector the financial disclosures did not look strikingly different from prior years and both officials said their investment trades were cleared by ethics officers and did not violate fed policy they also previously agreed to sell their stock holdings by the end of september to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest but the actions were still viewed as problematic during a year when millions of americans lost their jobs and the fed took sweeping action to stabilize financial markets and the economy in the wake of the rapidly unfolding pandemic when asked if he trusted the two regional fed bank presidents to do their jobs powell said last week that in terms of having confidence and that sort of thing i think no one is happy calls for broader reform of fed ethics rules continued monday despite the resignations with outside groups pressing powell to take stronger action distraction kaplan said on monday afternoon unfortunately the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the federal reserve s execution of that vital work rosengren earlier cited a long term health condition in his decision to step down in a statement that did not mention the investment controversy rosengren revealed that he qualified for the kidney transplant list in june of 2020 and wanted to make lifestyle changes to protect his health while rosengren was facing mandatory retirement next june fed rules would have allowed kaplan to stay on until 2025 the last such high profile departure from the fed was in 2017 when then richmond fed president jeffrey lacker resigned while acknowledging he had five years earlier been the source of information used in a report by medley advisors that included at that point unreleased information lacker took explicit blame saying his conduct was inconsistent with confidentiality policies neither rosengren or kaplan have acknowledged any breach of the fed ethics rules that require them to abide by certain trading practices and avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest new leadership kaplan 64 was hired to lead the dallas fed just over six year ago the son of a traveling jewelry salesman kaplan had taught at harvard business school for about 10 years and before that was an executive at goldman sachs nyse where he worked for 23 years rosengren a phd economist has been the president of the boston fed since 2007 and has been part of its staff since 1985 prior to becoming president he was head of the bank s supervision and regulation division dallas fed first vice president meredith nyse black will serve as interim president after kaplan steps down boston fed first vice president kenneth c montgomery will take over as interim president during the search for rosengren s replacement which is already underway given his approaching retirement date the back to back resignations leave a suddenly wider opening for a potential overhaul of fed leadership u s president joe biden is assessing whether to reappoint powell and is poised to nominate as many as three others to the seven member washington based board of governors a group long criticized for mostly being comprised of white men the departure of the two fed bank presidents could allow for a more diverse group of regional bank presidents who are chosen by local boards of directors with the approval of the fed governors currently seven of 12 bank presidents are white men three are white women and two are non white men

in a rare moment of ethical controversy for the federal reserve two top officials resigned monday in the wake of revelations about their financial trading that exposed potential shortcomings in the fed s rules on investments eric rosengren the president of the federal reserve bank of boston said he would step down this week for health reasons meanwhile robert kaplan the president of the dallas fed said he would resign oct 8 to avoid becoming a distraction from the fed s broader mission the two officials financial disclosures sparked criticism from government watchdogs after they revealed extensive stock trading in 2020 when the fed was spending trillions of dollars stabilizing financial markets and boosting the economy because of their trading the two officials could potentially have profited from the fed s actions though the investments by rosengren and kaplan were permitted under the fed s rules they raised at least the appearance of conflicts of interest which fed policy discourages sen elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat sharply criticized the trades and called for a ban on stock ownership by fed officials get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters fed chair jerome powell will testify tuesday before the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee which includes warren and will likely face questioning about the fed s ethics rules the resignations will give powell a specific response he can point to observers said the departure of rosengren and kaplan should ease pressure on powell who notably failed to express confidence in the two presidents at a news conference last week said krishna guha an analyst at the investment bank evercore isi the presidents of the 12 regional banks participate in the fed s private policymaking meetings in which they discuss the central bank s interest rate policies and are privy to economic data not always available to the public the fed s decisions can cause sharp swings in financial markets so can the presidents speeches and comments to the media fed chair jerome powell said last week that the fed would change its ethics policies in the wake of the disclosures yet the fed may still face pressure to allow an outside investigation into whether the two officials or any others traded based on inside information about the fed s actions after this egregious breach of public trust nothing but a full investigation and a referral to the securities and exchange commission is acceptable said jeff hauser director of the revolving door project a nonprofit group that monitors government appointments last year kaplan made trades worth at least 1 million in 22 stocks and index funds including amazon chevron facebook and johnson johnson the federal reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy kaplan said in a written statement unfortunately the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction kaplan said he would resign oct 8 rosengren had invested in funds that owned mortgage backed bonds the same kind that the fed has been buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth this year rosengren said he became eligible last year for a kidney transplant and said the stress of working at the fed during the pandemic recession worsened his health it has become clear that i should aim to reduce my stress so that i can focus on my health issues he said rosengren and kaplan were not voting members of the fed s policymaking committee this year but they contributed to forecasts of the fed s interest rate policy whichlast week showed the fed was considering hiking its short term rate currently at nearly zero by the end of 2022 that was a shift from june when the fed s projections did not show any hike until 2023 both are considered relatively hawkish policymakers meaning that they often favor higher interest rates to counter inflation powell s own financial disclosures show that he owned municipal bonds in 2020 even though the fed began purchasing such bonds for the first time last year in order to stabilize that market powell who was a private equity executive before being appointed to the fed s board in 2012 said last week he had owned munis for years and cleared his continued ownership with the office of government ethics at last week s press conference powell touched on a reason that these ethics concerns have flared previously municipal bonds were seen as a safe asset for fed officials to own because the fed didn t buy or sell them yet last year it did and it also began buying corporate bonds for the first time the boston fed s first vice president kenneth c montgomery will take over as acting president and ceo dallas fed first vice president meredith black will become interim president fed regional bank presidents are chosen by the six members of each bank s board of directors who are not bankers directors who are affiliated with banks are prohibited by law from participating
the battered wooden ghost boats drift through the sea of japan for months their only cargo the corpses of starved north korean fishermen whose bodies have been reduced to skeletons in 2019 more than 150 of these macabre vessels washed ashore in japan and there have been more than 500 in the past five years for years the grisly phenomenon mystified japanese police whose best guess was that climate change pushed the squid population further from north korea driving the country s desperate fishermen dangerous distances from shore where they become stranded and die from exposure but an investigation conducted by an international team of academic researchers ian urbina a former new york times investigative reporter who now directs the outlaw ocean project and global fishing watch has revealed what marine researchers now say is a more likely explanation china is sending a previously invisible armada of industrial boats to illegally fish in north korean waters violently displacing smaller north korean boats and spearheading a decline in once abundant squid stocks of more than 70 percent the chinese vessels nearly 800 in 2019 appear to be in violation of u n sanctions that forbid foreign fishing in north korean waters the sanctions imposed in 2017 in response to the country s nuclear tests were intended to punish north korea by not allowing it to sell fishing rights in its waters in exchange for valuable foreign currency this is the largest known case of illegal fishing perpetrated by a single industrial fleet operating in another nation s waters said jaeyoon park a data scientist from global fishing watch china is a member of the u n security council which unanimously signed the recent north korean sanctions but the flotilla violating this ban comprises nearly a third of the entire chinese distant water fishing fleet according to global fishing watch presented with the findings of the investigation the chinese ministry of foreign affairs said that china has consistently and conscientiously enforced the resolutions of the security council relating to north korea the ministry added that china has consistently punished illegal fishing in march 2020 two countries anonymously complained in a report to the united nations about china s violations of these sanctions and they provided evidence of the crimes including satellite imagery of the chinese ships fishing in north korean waters and testimony from chinese fishing crew who said they had alerted their government of their plans to fish in north korean waters the fishing grounds in the sea of japan known in the koreas as the east sea are located between the koreas japan and russia and include some of the world s most contested and poorly monitored waters up to now the huge presence of chinese boats in this area was largely hidden because their captains routinely turn off their transponders making them invisible to on land authorities which under most conditions is illegal global fishing watch and its partner researchers were able to document these vessels however using several types of satellite technology including one that spots bright lights at night many squid boats use extremely strong lights to draw their prey nearer to the ocean surface making the squid easier to catch the chinese also use what are called pair trawlers which consist of two side by side boats with a net strung between them that combs the seas which are easier to track by satellite since the two travel together so many north koreans have disappeared at sea in recent years that some north korean port towns including chongjin along the country s eastern shore are now called widows villages in 2019 more than 50 bodies of north koreans washed onto japanese beaches according to the japanese coast guard the grim uptick of these ghost boats washing ashore has stoked paranoia and inflamed a tense history between japan and north korea leading some in japan to speculate that the ghost boats are carrying spies thieves or possibly even weaponized carriers of contagious disease if a korean ship lost its way it would be destroyed by the time it lands on our beaches said kazuhiro araki ceo of the abduction research organization a group that studies the history of hundreds of japanese citizens who were allegedly kidnapped by north korea in the 70s and 80s but some ships arrived to our coast intact and with no men on board and its possible those people are spies who made it to land encrusted with shells and algae these flat bottom wooden boats are 15 to 20 feet long and typically carry five to 10 men they have no toilets or beds just small jugs of clean water fishing nets and tackle according to japanese coast guard investigation reports they fly tattered north korean flags and their hulls are often emblazoned with painted numbers or markings in korean script including state security department and korean people s army all of the bodies found on board these ghost boats appear to be male though some were so badly decomposed that japanese investigators struggled to say for sure political tensions between the countries and a lack of transparency in the so called hermit state of north korea make it difficult to get an official explanation of the phenomenon in 2004 china signed a multi million dollar fishing license agreement with north korea that led to a drastic increase in the number of chinese boats in north korean waters but international sanctions imposed in 2017 in response to north korea s intercontinental ballistic missile launches and nuclear tests were meant to squeeze key sources of north korean revenue a long time benefactor of north korea china signed the sanctions after being pressured by the united states and in august 2017 china s minister of commerce publicly reiterated his government s commitment to enforce these new rules seafood remains north korea s sixth biggest export and in recent speeches the country s dictator kim jong un has pushed the state owned seafood industry to increase its haul fish are like bullets and artillery shells an editorial in the rodong sinmun the official newspaper of the ruling workers party of korea said in 2017 fishing boats are like warships protecting the people and the motherland in the wake of the u n sanctions and as foreign currency reserves have dwindled the north korean government has tried to bolster its fishing industry by turning soldiers into fishermen dispatching these poorly trained seafarers onto notoriously turbulent waters the sanctions have also intensified north korea s gasoline shortage japanese investigators say that some of the korean fishing boats washing onto japanese beaches suffered from engine failure or simply ran out of fuel since 2013 at least 50 survivors have been rescued from these dilapidated boats but in interviews with japanese police the men rarely say more than that they were stranded at sea and that they want to be returned home to north korea autopsies on the bodies found on these boats usually indicate that the men starved or died from hypothermia or dehydration in 2013 north korean fishermen were limited by the capacity of their 12 horsepower engines and they typically only traveled several dozen miles from land said a former north korean fisherman who defected to south korea in 2016 and now lives in seoul government pressure is greater now and there are 38 horsepower engines said the defector who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions for his family people are more desperate and they can go farther from shore but marine researchers say that pressure from the north korean government is not the only factor competition from the industrial chinese trawlers is likely displacing the north korean fishers pushing them into neighboring russian waters said jungsam lee whose institute also found hundreds of north korean vessels fished illegally in russian waters in 2018 in 2017 the japanese coast guard also reported spotting more than 2 000 north korean fishing boats fishing illegally in their waters in more than 300 instances the japanese coast guard used water cannons to force these boats to leave the area powerful chinese fleet around the globe many kinds of fish and sea creatures are disappearing at an unsustainable rate due to climate change overfishing and illegal fishing by industrial fleets as these fishing stocks shrink competition grows and offshore clashes between fishing nations become more common seafood loving countries like japan and south korea are being edged out by growing fleets from taiwan vietnam and most of all china with a population of over 1 38 billion china is the world s biggest consumer of seafood and its global catches have grown by over 20 percent in the past five years many of the fishing stocks closest to china s shores have collapsed from overfishing and industrialization which is why the chinese government heavily subsidizes its fishermen who sail the world in search of new grounds fishing fleets from china accounted for 50 to 70 percent of the squid caught on the high seas in recent years according to an estimate by the chinese government often these boats are fishing illegally in other countries national waters according to analysis by c4ads a marine research firm the sea of japan includes disputed patches of water where the surrounding countries russia japan and the two koreas do not recognize each other s sea borders the incursion of the chinese in this region has only intensified local tensions chinese fishing boats are famously aggressive often armed and known for ramming competitors or foreign patrol vessels chinese media often depict the country s maritime clashes with other nearby asian nations as an extension of ancient china s three kingdoms which fought a fierce three way battle for supremacy tensions between seoul and beijing increased in 2016 after a chinese vessel illegally fishing in south korean waters sank a south korean coast guard cutter the cutter was in south korean waters and was trying to stop a chinese fishing ship that allegedly had been caught illegally fishing when another chinese ship rear ended the marine officers similarly while reporting at sea for this investigation reporters for this article filmed 10 of these illegal chinese fishing ships crossing into north korean waters however the reporting team was forced to divert its course to avoid a dangerous collision after one of the chinese fishing captains suddenly swerved toward the team s boat coming within 10 meters likely intending to ward off the boat spotted at night and roughly 100 miles from shore the chinese squid ships would not respond to radio calls and were traveling with their transponders off a yearly migratory species the so called pacific flying squid spawn in waters near the southeastern port city of busan or off south korea s southernmost island of jeju they swim north in the spring before returning south to their birthplace between july and september in 2017 and 2018 the illegal chinese boats which are typically about 10 times larger than north korean boats caught as much of the squid as japan and south korea combined an estimated 160 000 tons worth more than 440 million annually marine researchers fear a full collapse of this squid colony which has declined by 63 percent and 78 percent in south korean and japanese waters respectively since 2003 the chinese fleet is a primary culprit of this precipitous drop because in targeting north korea waters these industrial boats are catching the squid before they grow big enough to procreate said park the scientist from global fishing watch since chinese authorities do not make their fishing licenses public global fishing watch said that there is no way to verify that all of the ships entering north korean waters were authorized by the chinese government however the organization corroborated that the vessels were of chinese origin through various other sources of information among these corroborating sources were transponder and other types of radio transmissions records from south korean coast guard officials who routinely board and inspect fishing ships on their way into north korean waters data showing the ships departed from chinese ports or waters that are strictly limited chinese vessels records indicating the use of distinctly chinese gear type or ship design and satellite information showing that the ships previously fished in chinese waters that are closely policed and forbidden to foreign ships all of the roughly two dozen fishing ships that the reporting team witnessed heading into north korean waters were flying chinese flags when they come they take over said kim byong su the mayor of ulleung island located in the east sea about 75 miles east of the korean peninsula a tiny spit of land belonging to south korea ulleung is the closest port to the north korean fishing grounds kim said that the chinese squid boats have decimated the island s two primary sources of income tourism and fishing in the jeodong market near the pier rows of the squid are draped across lines like folded laundry as they sun dry into fish jerky squid sellers estimated that the per pound cost of squid is roughly three times what it was less than five years ago most of the island s men older than 40 are squid fishermen but a third of them are now unemployed because of the decline in stock the mayor said that a creature so central to the local culture could disappear has shaken this community whose identity has been defined by squid fishing for centuries historically most of the ulleung s restaurants served fried dried or raw squid as a free appetizer but these dishes are now absent from many menus local animosity toward the chinese fleet has been made only worse the mayor said because a few times a year when bad weather strikes an armada of more than 200 chinese squid boats arrive simultaneously to the ulleung s port to ride out the storm the mayor said he is powerless to tell them to leave they dump oil throw litter run loud smoky generators all night and when leaving drag their anchors destroying the island s freshwater pipes he said the outside world needs to know what s happening here mr kim said ian urbina is the director of the outlaw ocean

chocolate is one of the most popular sweet treats on the planet global annual sales are nearing 150 billion as consumers in developing countries acquire more wealth chocolate consumption is rising along with it some estimates point to sales of cocoa products reaching 200 billion per year by the end of the 2020s representing an average annual growth of about 5 chocolate is a favorite for many investors too the industry is dominated by a handful of snack food conglomerates though and average growth for these companies is pedestrian but if slower but more stable growth paired with dividend

when we think of forests we mostly think of tree filled landscapes but the ocean also holds emerald stands of trees so vast they line one quarter of our coastlines the area is probably equivalent to about the size of the amazon rainforest if you add it all up says karen filbee dexter a marine ecologist doing a research fellowship at the university of western australia these are kelp forests one of earth s most beneficial ecosystems kelps are a type of seaweed or macroalgae made up of roughly 33 genera and 112 species though there remains some disagreement over what constitutes a kelp what makes them unique amongst other seaweeds is mainly their large size giant kelp from the genus macrocystis and the biggest of the kelps can reach heights of 45 meters they tend to grow in cooler waters where they create lush habitats rich in biodiversity as ecosystems they are as important as coral reefs and mangrove forests to the overall health of the ocean and as filbee dexter points out it s also really important to understand the benefits that these ecosystems provide to humans as a nursery and refuge for many marine animals they support our fisheries they store carbon in their photosynthesising fronds and their wave buffering bodies are the surest defence some coastlines have against violent storms they also clean up our waste kelps can rapidly absorb nutrient pollution caused by fertilizers running off from farmland into the sea they use it to fuel their own growth and this averts the development of algal blooms which are so harmful to other marine life in addition to all this kelps have immense cultural value for many coastal communities illustration ricardo macía lalinde china dialogue ocean but the world is losing kelp at an unprecedented rate water pollution off kilter predator prey dynamics and the warming waters brought by climate change are driving marine deforestation and eradicating some kelp forests altogether meanwhile just a fraction of these forests is protected in the northeast pacific ocean where some of earth s largest kelp populations occur only four percent of the area covered by giant kelp falls inside marine protected areas now though an increasing number of researchers conservation organizations and governments believe we need to better protect and restore our ocean s once mighty oases of kelp otherwise we risk losing a significant carbon store and a foundation of food security a loss that many compare to the deforestation of the amazon ignored for too long part of the reason kelp forests have not received the attention they deserve is that more charismatic marine ecosystems like coral reefs have become synonymous with ocean biodiversity and thus the focus of conservation says filbee dexter who studies how climate change affects kelp populations in norway australia and the canadian arctic she explains that with rising temperatures expanding layers of warm water are beginning to develop at the ocean s surface this is a problem because warmer water contains less oxygen and it s also more buoyant than the nutrient rich cold waters below as the warm layers thicken there is less mixing of oxygen and nutrients between deeper layers and the surface where these ingredients are needed to fuel the growth of kelps as well as other marine organisms warming may also be contributing to kelp bleaching which disrupts their ability to photosynthesize at points along the coasts of mainland australia and tasmania mexico the united states and other countries marine heatwaves and other anthropogenic impacts like pollution have already permanently wiped out whole forests despite this kelp forests have been left off the priority list for the un decade on ecosystem restoration which began in january 2021 in the oceans they talk about coral reefs and mangroves but there s not a single mention of kelp despite it being one of the largest coastal ecosystems filbee dexter says another reason kelps have been ignored is perhaps the historic lack of research into the ecosystem services they provide scientists know they can sequester huge amounts of carbon thanks to their large biomass and high productivity giant kelp can grow 45 centimeters a day it s been estimated that wild seaweeds of all sorts not just kelp sequester about 173 million metric tonnes of carbon each year when they die and get buried in sediment on the ocean floor but definitive calculations are difficult to make because wild seaweed is always on the move when kelp dies or is torn off the rocks by storms it breaks loose carrying its carbon store out to sea without knowing where all this loose kelp ultimately goes it could end up rotting on a beach and discharging its carbon or be buried forever in the deep sea it s difficult to calculate the carbon locked away by an individual forest the benefits of farming seaweed seaweed farms offer a more stable environment for researchers in china as well as japan and korea seaweed aquaculture has been practiced for centuries there are thousands of farms along china s long coastline where seaweed is grown for food and for use in pharmaceuticals and biofuels we have seven types of cultivated seaweeds in china but kelp is the major one with the highest yield it accounts for two thirds of all china s seaweed yield says jiaping wu a professor of marine science at china s zhejiang university wu is interested in how seaweeds ecological and commercial value combine in this farming context his research shows that farmed seaweeds can significantly offset agricultural pollution removing phosphates and nitrogen that spill into coastal waters and fuel mass algal blooms such blooms strip oxygen from the water and create dead zones devoid of marine life in another study wu calculated that at their current growth rate china s seaweed farms would remove 100 of phosphorus pollution from the country s coastal waters by 2026 seaweed is a perfect solution to marine eutrophication he says traditional seaweed farming in china s fujian province where species such as saccharina japonica konbu are grown on ropes hung between bamboo poles in tidal areas image alex berger flickr cc by nc 2 0 research is also ongoing to show the role seaweed farms could play in mitigating climate change an organization called oceans 2050 which wu is part of is leading an effort to definitively calculate how much carbon farmed seaweed locks in based on a survey of 23 farms around the world when the unharvested parts of farmed seaweed die they fall to the bottom directly below the farms locking their carbon in the sediments in an easy to measure way the farmer by controlling the location of the farm can control where the carbon ends up explains carlos duarte distinguished professor of marine science at the king abdullah university of science and technology author of several papers on the carbon storing potential of macroalgae and principal investigator of the seaweed project at oceans 2050 farming could gain recognition for seaweeds in programs like the un blue carbon initiative this organization raises awareness about the carbon trapping potential of mangroves seagrasses and salt marshes but has historically excluded seaweeds because of their unpredictability in the wild eventually the goal is to incorporate seaweed farms into carbon accreditation schemes because seaweed farming is scalable and accountable duarte says i think oceans 2050 is going to deliver the first robust science to underpin the inclusion of seaweed farming in blue carbon duarte adds that seaweed aquaculture also provides jobs as well as social mobility for women who make up the majority of seaweed farmers worldwide optimism for wild seaweed filbee dexter believes that the growing interest in farmed seaweed is also translating to seaweed forests this is important she says because the enthusiasm for seaweed aquaculture shouldn t override the importance of protecting and restoring natural ecosystems especially kelps wild kelp forests are worth more than the carbon they lock away this has become increasingly evident in tasmania where 95 percent of the giant kelp that used to line its shores has been wiped out by warming waters taking with them the rich fish stocks upon which local fishers had long relied but for the past two years cayne layton and craig johnson marine ecologists at the university of tasmania have been trying to revive these once great forests by breeding some of the few kelps that survived after warm waters swept through during the 2015 16 el niño event a climate phenomenon that research suggests is intensifying with climate change believing these species might be more resilient to warming seas layton and johnson began in 2019 by culturing samples of reproductive tissues from the remaining kelp stands from which they bred baby kelp in 2020 they planted these saplings out in the wild on 100 meter squared plots off tasmania s coast out of three test sites two grew successfully now ten months on the duo s hypothesis has proven correct several hundred resilient kelps are thriving on those plots layton says perhaps most encouraging was that despite our warmer than average el niño summer our super kelp seemed to withstand the warm temperatures and looked healthy and had nice dark pigmentation with no bleaching or necrosis he says this was in contrast to the natural giant kelp which was shabby bleached and pretty unhappy although seaweed breeding has a long history in countries such as japan layton thinks this may be the first time kelps have been bred explicitly to withstand climate change the discovery could aid other restoration projects and possibly provide a solution for kelp farms that struggle with climate related declines in the future we ve demonstrated the potential to use selective breeding to future proof restoration efforts layton says conservation and protection but climate change isn t the only threat kelps are facing many forests are under attack from kelp eating sea urchins which have thrived with the decline of their natural predators like sea otters along the southern coast of california a local ngo called the bay foundation has taken a simple but highly effective approach to tackle this threat they ve partnered with fishers who cull the urchins by hand and have managed to restore 23 hectares of forest to its former glory this simple approach has also brought back hectares of kelp forest around japan s hokkaido island thanks to voluntary divers schemes while the reintroduction of sea otters in norway has helped kelps regain a foothold there once more others are pushing kelp conservation in a new direction not by restoring seaweed forests but by creating entirely new ones in china jiaping wu is involved in the development of 150 floating marine ranches that span the length of the coast where multiple species of seaweed including kelps are being cultivated without any commercial intent the requirement is to restore seaweeds primarily for ecological conservation the ranches are never harvested says wu the goal is ultimately to incorporate these carbon sequestering biodiversity supporting life rafts into china s climate mitigation plan he explains we re thinking of all kinds of ways to capture carbon carbon sequestration is of course not the only ecosystem service kelp provides but developing more sophisticated measures of wild kelps sequestration potential could be a good way of getting these ecosystems the protections they need says filbee dexter along with colleagues she s now developing models to precisely map where kelps end up in the ocean when they break loose to try and reliably account for the amount of carbon individual kelp forests lock away if we don t account for ecosystem services then often there s less of a push to restore and protect and people care less what happens to these ecosystems she says alongside this there are small but positive signs that kelps are beginning to receive more protection in australia giant kelp forests were granted endangered status in 2012 a world first for macroalgae earlier this year us president joe biden s executive order on tackling climate change mentioned the protection and restoration of wild kelp forests as a priority and now researchers from the university of queensland are embarking on a pioneering project to comprehensively map the planet s kelp so we know what we have and where marine protected areas might better safeguard these ecosystems there are very large areas of kelp forests that have no protection no monitoring and haven t even been seen by a human eye from a global standpoint we re far away from any similar knowledge that we have about forests on land filbee dexter says but things are changing in research circles there s an argument that we should stop calling them kelp beds she says because it minimizes the magnitude of what these ecosystems do in our oceans in other words it s time to start seeing seaweeds and their giant mascots kelps for what they are the rainforests of the sea this article appears

the global chip shortage will become less severe in the second half of 2022 amd ceo lisa su said on monday we ve always gone through cycles of ups and downs where demand has exceeded supply or vice versa su said at the code conference in beverly hills california this time it s different manufacturing plants that were planned last year will likely start producing chips in the coming months helping to alleviate shortages for pc parts and other microchips su said the global chip shortage will become less severe in the second half of 2022 amd ceo lisa su said on monday though she warned that the first half of the year will be likely tight chipmakers are still catching up to demand following severe supply chain bottlenecks created by the pandemic but manufacturing plants that were planned last year will likely start producing chips in the coming months helping to alleviate shortages for pc parts and other microchips su said we ve always gone through cycles of ups and downs where demand has exceeded supply or vice versa su said at the code conference in beverly hills california this time it s different get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters the improvements will be gradual as more manufacturing capacity becomes available su said it might take you know 18 to 24 months to put on a new plant and in some cases even longer than that she said these investments were started perhaps a year ago amd primarily sells processors and graphics chips for pcs gaming consoles and servers since the covid 19 pandemic started in 2020 pc sales have jumped as consumers across the globe bought new computers for their homes and so their kids could attend school remotely the pandemic has just taken demand to a new level su said but the demand for chips and pc parts has stayed high even as economies reopened and shortages spread to other industries including cars that s helped boost amd s stock more than 120 since the beginning of last year to just over 108 su said that amd supports the chips act which became law earlier this year and includes subsidies to encourage microchip manufacturing in the u s amd doesn t manufacturer its own chips and instead outsources production to foundries or chip factories amd rival intel said this year that it would continue to invest in microchip manufacturing and would be a foundry to other chip companies last year amd announced it planned to buy xilinx in a deal worth 35 billion but the company has not yet received all the approvals it needs to complete the acquisition su said that amd still sees the deal closing by the end of the year she added that there will likely be more dealmaking in the semiconductor industry consolidation is inevitable su said start ups can do really cool things i have tremendous respect for these these folks who start their own companies but if you want to do something very large for the industry you know scale is important watch what s the best way to solve the chip shortage crisis
few people have ever heard of the tiny country of nauru even fewer ever think about what happens at the bottom of the world s oceans but that may soon change the seafloor is thought to hold trillions of dollar s worth of metals and this pacific island nation is making bold moves to get a jump on the global competition to plumb these depths the targets of these companies are potato sized rocks that scientists call polymetallic nodules sitting on the ocean floor these prized clusters can take more than three million years to form they are valuable because they are rich in manganese copper nickel cobalt that are claimed to be essential for electrifying transport and decarbonizing the economy amid the green technological revolution that has emerged to counter the climate crisis to vacuum up these treasured chunks requires industrial extraction by massive excavators typically 30 times the weight of regular bulldozers these machines are lifted by cranes over the sides of ships then dropped miles underwater where they drive along the seafloor suctioning up the rocks crushing them and sending a slurry of crushed nodules and seabed sediments from 4 000 6 000 meters depth through a series of pipes to the vessel above after separating out the minerals the processed waters sediment and mining fines small particles of the ground up nodule ore are piped overboard to depths as yet unclear but a growing number of marine biologists ocean conservationists government regulators and environmentally conscious companies are sounding the alarm about a variety of environmental food security financial and biodiversity concerns associated with seabed mining these critics worry whether the ships doing this mining will dump back into the sea the huge amounts of toxic waste and sediments produced by grinding up and pumping the rocks to the surface impacting larger fish further up the food chain such as tunas and contaminating the global seafood supply chain they also worry that the mining may be counterproductive in relation to climate change because it may in fact diminish the ocean floor s distinct carbon sequestration capacity their concern is that in stirring up the ocean floor the mining companies will release carbon into the environment undercutting some of the very benefits intended by switching to electric cars wind turbines and long life batteries douglas mccauley who is also the director of the benioff ocean institute at the university of california santa barbara warned against trying to counter the climate crisis with solutions that rely on a paradigm of just ripping up a new part of the planet if the goal is to slow climate change he said it makes little sense to obliterate the deep sea ecosystems and marine life that presently play a role in capturing and storing more carbon than all the world s forests if the high seas represent the last frontier on earth then the deep seabed outside of national waters is a frontier beyond that a realm subject to a unique regime under international law deeming the international seabed area and its resources to be managed by an international organization called the international seabed authority isa on behalf of humankind as whole but who benefits and how from this new rush to seabed mining remains unclear said kristina gjerde high seas policy advisor for the iucn global marine program and what constitutes benefits to humankind is also unclear as the deep seafloor is filled with untold biodiversity much of it vitally important to the survival of our planet still nauru hopes to forge ahead with seabed mining located in micronesia northeast of australia the tiny island is among the smallest countries on the planet with a landmass of eight square miles and a population of around 12 000 by moving faster than its competition this cash strapped developing nation hopes to get an early edge on a potentially multi billion dollar market even though nauru itself is only likely to receive a small fraction of the financial benefits of seabed mining from the canadian company it is sponsoring in june nauru took the first step in launching the industry it announced plans to submit an application for commercial extraction on behalf of its sponsored entity nori as early as 2023 to the international seabed authority such an application will be judged against whatever the deep sea mining rules are at that time finalized or otherwise over a dozen other countries including russia the uk india and china have 15 year exploration contracts the government of india has recently set aside 544 million to stoke private sector investments and technological research in this industry but nauru is taking the lead partially because its sponsored company nori is a wholly owned subsidiary of a canadian company that thinks it may benefit from being the first based on its arguments that the minerals are necessary to enable the transition to a new green economy international interest in seabed mining has been stoked partly by new advances in robotics computer mapping and underwater drilling combined with historically high but fluctuating commodities prices mining companies globally are said to be scouring for fresh reserves having depleted much of the world s easy to access veins the metals they seek are used in magnets batteries and electronic components for smartphones wind turbines fuel cells hybrid cars catalytic converters and other high tech gadgetry these metals are commonly found on land but some raise concerns that these may not be enough with dwindling resources on land with exponential growth of demand and a shortage in circulation recycling there is a need to find alternative sources of critical metals needed to allow the energy transition to zero net carbon economies said bramley murton a marine researcher at the uk s national oceanography centre it has been estimated that collectively the nodules on the bottom of the ocean contain six times as much cobalt three times as much nickel and four times as much of the rare earth metal yttrium as there is on land mining companies and states have set their eyes on a specific part of the sea an area bigger than the size of continental united states that stretches from hawaii to mexico neighboring nauru s exclusive economic zone the ocean floor under that area known as the clarion clipperton zone is estimated to contain metals valued at between 8 trillion and 16 trillion nauru has teamed up with nori which is owned by a canada based firm called the metals company to explore this area we are proud that pacific nations have been leaders in the deep sea minerals industry a statement co authored by nauru s representative to the international seabed authority recently declared scientists have conservatively estimated that each mining license will permit direct strip mining of some 8 000 square kilometers of seabed over the course of a 20 year mining license from the isa and easily impact a further 8 000 24 000 square kilometers of surrounding seabed life by sediment plumes generated by the mining the ocean floor they estimate that the nodule obligate species the animals living on the nodules or like deep sea octopuses that otherwise need the nodules to survive will take millions of years to recover and even the animals living in the surrounding sediment may take hundreds to thousands of years to recover from the impact of mining some corporate stakeholders are voicing skepticism in march bmw and volvo group along with samsung and google pledged to abstain from sourcing deep sea minerals in its most recent global report the international energy agency a global body that advises countries on policy concluded that seabed mining machines often cause seafloor disturbance which could alter deep sea habitats and release pollutants stirring up fine sediments could also affect ecosystems which take a long time to recover in june the european parliament also asked the executive branch of the european union to stop financing deepsea mining technology and called for a delay in more exploration operations the uk house of commons environment audit committee in 2019 concluded that deep sea mining would have catastrophic impacts on the seafloor the international seabed authority benefiting from revenues from issuing mining licenses is a clear conflict of interest and that the case for deep sea mining has not yet been made one worry among seabed mining critics is that the industry s giant suction grinding and harvesting machines will kick up huge and suffocating clouds of sediment both along the seabed and high in the water column that block light crowd out oxygen produce harmful amounts of noise pollution and disperse toxins which decimate life and contaminate seafood such contamination could also pose a threat to the food security for developing and coastal nations whose fishing stocks and other seafloor marine life would be decimated we need much more time for research to be carried out not by mining companies but by independent seabed ecologists said kelvin passfield who runs the te ipukarea society in the cook islands and is part of a group of non profit organizations in fiji vanuatu and elsewhere in the pacific islands that are concerned about the impacts of such plumes on local fishermen and food security other critics see the mining as a ponzi scheme of sorts that is meant to draw venture capital investment but in fact has little real chance to make money in the long term matthew gianni co founder of the deep sea conservation coalition said that seabed mining companies are trying to peddle a false choice between having to mine cobalt and nickel on land or in the deep sea when they claim we need hundreds of million of tons of these metals to build batteries for electric vehicles and other renewable energy storage technologies we don t need to build batteries with either nickel or cobalt tesla and byd the world s second largest ev manufacturer are making cars with lithium iron phosphate lfp batteries with little to no nickel or cobalt which are selling unexpectedly well he said there is massive investment now being put into developing batteries that don t use these metals at all better product design recycling and reuse of metals already in circulation urban mining and other circular economy initiatives can vastly reduce the need for new sources of metals he said once thought to be relatively lifeless the deep sea is now seen by most scientists as a species rich environment populated by creatures that thrive under conditions that seem impossibly extreme and yet much of its biodiversity on the seafloor is distinctly vulnerable to change because their habitat is so far removed and thus rarely disturbed the oceans already face a daunting list of threats ranging from overfishing sonar testing oil dumping and plastic pollution to sea level and temperature rise acidification oxygen depletion algal blooms and ghost nets add to those the additional strains faced by deep sea marine life on the seafloor internet cables bottom trawling treasure hunting oil and gas drilling coral bleaching the sinking of retired drilling rigs in 2019 the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services ipbes issued its global assessment report which estimated that a million species are at risk of extinction many within the next several decades unless we reverse the drivers of biodiversity loss one of the biggest challenges in stoking concern about this type of mining is that the seabed is so far removed geographically emotionally and intellectually from the public that benefits from it most of the world s seafloor is not even mapped but less properly or fully understood or robustly governed deep below the waterline it is always dark its many of its inhabitants defy categorizations into the traditional animal plant mineral taxonomy no solution to a problem as complex as the climate crisis will come without difficult decisions and heavy costs especially as the global public tries to wean itself from fossil fuels the hard part though

earning passive income image source getty images top monthly dividend stocks for 2023 top monthly dividend stocks for 2023 dozens of dividend stocks pay monthly dividends in 2023 however not all of them are worth an investor s consideration some don t make the cut because of a below average dividend yield or slow dividend growth meanwhile others are at a higher risk of reducing their dividends if market conditions deteriorate that narrows the options considerably here s a list of the best monthly dividend stocks to consider in 2023 data source calculations based on company filings dividend

than the average stock in the s p 500 1 6 as of may 18 2023 1 epr properties 1 epr properties epr properties is a real estate investment trust reit that specializes in owning experiential real estate such as movie theaters eat and play venues ski resorts and gaming facilities it secures these properties by signing triple net leases with the venue operators meaning the tenants bear the responsibility for building insurance maintenance and real estate taxes the covid 19 pandemic had a significant impact on experiential real estate many of these facilities had to temporarily close their doors or operate at reduced capacity and that impacted their ability to pay rent forcing epr properties to suspend its monthly dividend in 2020 the good news is that most of its tenants have seen a return to business as usual over the past couple of years and in some cases even higher demand for the in person social experiences they offer the bad news most isn t all and epr s largest group of tenants movie theaters continue to struggle with revenues well below pre pandemic levels one of its larger tenants cineworld which owns regal theatres filed for bankruptcy in 2022 and is going through a reorganization with more than 40 of its business tied to movie theaters management is trying to reduce its exposure to this struggling industry but there s still reason to be hopeful as box office revenues are improving though still well below 2019 levels epr should be able to make the transition while supporting its dividend but this represents a not insubstantial risk to epr s ability to maintain its dividend 2 agree realty 2 agree realty agree realty is another reit these companies often make for good monthly dividend stocks because they generate recurring rental income this reit owns freestanding retail properties secured by triple net leases it focuses on owning properties leased to essential retailers such as grocery home improvement dollar stores and drug stores which are less susceptible to disruption from e commerce or a recession this strategy enables agree realty to generate steady rental income to support its dividend definition icon e commerce e commerce is the buying and selling of goods online and the related businesses that facilitate it agree realty switched from a quarterly to a monthly dividend payment schedule in january 2021 it has an excellent dividend track record overall this reit has increased its dividend at a 5 5 compound annual rate over the past decade though payout growth has slowed to 3 8 more recently nonetheless that upward trend should continue as the company keeps expanding its portfolio the retail reit acquired a record 1 4 billion of properties in 2021 though it has recently moderated more management expects the total to be 1 2 billion in 2023 between that steady portfolio growth and strong tenant relationships it has over 13 years in average lease term under contract agree realty should remain a modest reliable monthly dividend grower for years to come 3 gladstone commercial corporation 3 gladstone commercial corporation gladstone commercial is a diversified reit focused on net leased office and industrial properties in the u s each representing 48 of its portfolio along with some retail and medical office buildings this reit also concentrates on secondary markets because they offer higher investment yields this strategy has enabled gladstone to generate very stable income but its streak of more than 200 consecutive monthly dividends either at or above the prior month s level came to an end in 2023 the culprit poorly performing office properties led to a 20 dividend cut as the company worked through its portfolio to offload unprofitable properties while we can t count out another dividend cut management seems to have stabilized the business and is back on the offensive acquiring high demand industrial properties and ensuring its office properties are well tenanted for the long term image source getty images 4 ltc properties 4 ltc properties ltc properties is a healthcare reit it primarily invests in senior housing and skilled nursing properties secured by triple net leases mortgage loans and other cash generating investment structures this strategy gives the reit a relatively steady income to support its monthly dividend the pandemic hit the senior housing sector hard impacting ltc properties tenants several struggled to pay rent leading some to file for bankruptcy however this reit s financial strength helped it weather the storm and offset some of the lost income with new investments allowing it to maintain its monthly dividend yet ltc has been unable to increase its payout for more than a half decade since 2016 to be exact ltc faces some good long term trends but operates in a tough industry in 2030 the number of americans 65 and older will be double 2010 s 65 and up population a positive tailwind for the company but it must continue to stabilize its tenants and align itself with the best operators for the big picture tailwind to reward patient shareholders meanwhile investors can earn almost 7 in yield for being patient 5 realty income 5 realty income when it comes to monthly dividend stocks realty income is the clear leader it bills itself as the monthly dividend company having paid more than 635 consecutive monthly dividends as of may 2023 since its initial public offering ipo in 1994 realty income has increased its dividend more than 100 times while raising the payout at a 4 4 compound annual rate giving this reit more than 25 years of dividend increases realty income has lots of room to grow despite most of its tenants being relatively slower growth businesses the company estimates the global market opportunity for the single tenant net lease real estate it targets to be 12 trillion that s a big opportunity to continue consolidating its tenants properties under its ownership growing the payout and generally rewarding patient investors monthly year in and year out image source getty images 6 sl green 6 sl green sl green is another reit and the largest office landlord in new york city for years owning manhattan office buildings some of the most highly demanded irreplaceable real estate assets on earth was a huge strength but the pandemic and the acceleration in changes to how and where people work continue to weigh on the office reit sl green s management is adapting to the new reality by selling its least desirable and non core assets and focusing on tenanting its vacant properties at competitive profitable rates it used the proceeds of those sales to reduce its debt by 9 in 2022 repurchase stock and start going back on offense the bad news for longtime investors is these moves didn t happen quickly enough to save its status as a dividend achiever sl green lowered its monthly payout by 13 at the start of 2023 while the office environment remains a bit fluid and another dividend cut could still be on the table the worst is likely over for sl green more risk tolerant investors should consider it a compelling turnaround investment 7 stag industrial 7 stag industrial stag industrial another reit focuses on owning industrial real estate such as warehouses and light industrial facilities which are in high demand the pandemic accelerated e commerce adoption and increased manufacturing in the u s to combat supply chain issues that has kept occupancy levels high while pushing up rental rates enabling stag to generate steadily rising rental income stag has boosted its dividend over the years with growth driven largely by the reit s ability to consistently expand its portfolio stag has added more than 400 properties to its portfolio since its ipo a decade ago increasing its portfolio to more than 500 buildings this industrial reit expects the steady expansion to continue it s targeting 1 billion to 1 2 billion of property purchases each year add that to the growing rental income from its existing properties and stag should be able to continue increasing its monthly dividend so long as you re not expecting big raises its most recent increase was less than 1 and over the past five years the payout has only risen 3 5 related dividend stocks topics earning recurring income invest in monthly dividend stocks for recurring income monthly dividend stocks

in a rare moment of ethical controversy for the federal reserve two top officials resigned monday in the wake of revelations about their financial trading that exposed potential shortcomings in the fed s rules on investments eric rosengren the president of the federal reserve bank of boston said he would step down this week for health reasons meanwhile robert kaplan the president of the dallas fed said he would resign oct 8 to avoid becoming a distraction from the fed s broader mission the two officials financial disclosures sparked criticism from government watchdogs after they revealed extensive stock trading in 2020 when the fed was spending trillions of dollars stabilizing financial markets and boosting the economy because of their trading the two officials could potentially have profited from the fed s actions though the investments by rosengren and kaplan were permitted under the fed s rules they raised at least the appearance of conflicts of interest which fed policy discourages sen elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat sharply criticized the trades and called for a ban on stock ownership by fed officials get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters fed chair jerome powell will testify tuesday before the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee which includes warren and will likely face questioning about the fed s ethics rules the resignations will give powell a specific response he can point to observers said the departure of rosengren and kaplan should ease pressure on powell who notably failed to express confidence in the two presidents at a news conference last week said krishna guha an analyst at the investment bank evercore isi the presidents of the 12 regional banks participate in the fed s private policymaking meetings in which they discuss the central bank s interest rate policies and are privy to economic data not always available to the public the fed s decisions can cause sharp swings in financial markets so can the presidents speeches and comments to the media fed chair jerome powell said last week that the fed would change its ethics policies in the wake of the disclosures yet the fed may still face pressure to allow an outside investigation into whether the two officials or any others traded based on inside information about the fed s actions after this egregious breach of public trust nothing but a full investigation and a referral to the securities and exchange commission is acceptable said jeff hauser director of the revolving door project a nonprofit group that monitors government appointments last year kaplan made trades worth at least 1 million in 22 stocks and index funds including amazon chevron facebook and johnson johnson the federal reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy kaplan said in a written statement unfortunately the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction kaplan said he would resign oct 8 rosengren had invested in funds that owned mortgage backed bonds the same kind that the fed has been buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth this year rosengren said he became eligible last year for a kidney transplant and said the stress of working at the fed during the pandemic recession worsened his health it has become clear that i should aim to reduce my stress so that i can focus on my health issues he said rosengren and kaplan were not voting members of the fed s policymaking committee this year but they contributed to forecasts of the fed s interest rate policy whichlast week showed the fed was considering hiking its short term rate currently at nearly zero by the end of 2022 that was a shift from june when the fed s projections did not show any hike until 2023 both are considered relatively hawkish policymakers meaning that they often favor higher interest rates to counter inflation powell s own financial disclosures show that he owned municipal bonds in 2020 even though the fed began purchasing such bonds for the first time last year in order to stabilize that market powell who was a private equity executive before being appointed to the fed s board in 2012 said last week he had owned munis for years and cleared his continued ownership with the office of government ethics at last week s press conference powell touched on a reason that these ethics concerns have flared previously municipal bonds were seen as a safe asset for fed officials to own because the fed didn t buy or sell them yet last year it did and it also began buying corporate bonds for the first time the boston fed s first vice president kenneth c montgomery will take over as acting president and ceo dallas fed first vice president meredith black will become interim president fed regional bank presidents are chosen by the six members of each bank s board

votes being scheduled this week but as usual these may slip hopefully a continuing resolution will be passed to at least avoid a shutdown on october 1 it also appears that the debt ceiling will be reached in mid october so there will probably be a lot of headlines about this until it is raised overall stocks may move on these headlines but the impact should be limited as these will need to be

reserve adding over 4 trillion to its balance sheet has driven the sharp increase in the index after stocks plunged in early 2020 due to covid 19 the subsequent decrease in interest rates has forced investors to look for returns in the equity markets this leads to equities being more highly valued which increases their risk federal reserve assets federal reserve federal reserve of st louis the biggest question surrounding the fed is when will tapering of its buying 120 billion in assets per month start and by how much it appears the announcement is teed up for november but this could always slip farther out but valuations have been pulling back the s p 500 s p e multiple peaked around september last year due to a combination of stock prices moving higher and earnings forecasts being too low since then earnings projections have increased at a faster pace than stock prices which has led to historically high valuations except for the tech bubble and recession timeframes when earnings

like many other successful business people israeli serial entrepreneur dov moran â best known as one of the geniuses behind the disk on key â has a deep dark secret he is a hunt and peck typist when he started wearing multifocals in his 50s emailing got even more laborious as moran adjusted his field of vision from keyboard to screen and back spread the word â email this article to friends or colleagues â share this article on facebook or twitter â write about and link to this article on your blog â local relevancy send this article to your local press the result of moranâ s frustration is smartype an updated keyboard now hitting the e market at just a hair under 100 intended to transform typing for people of all ages and keyboarding abilities itâ s expected to roll out gradually to brick and mortar stores in the us europe and asia in 2013 smartypeâ s main feature is a built in liquid crystal display lcd screen just above the keys this cuts down on eye and neck strain allowing users to see what theyâ re typing in real time while minimizing keystroke errors the product also comes loaded with basic widgets including email notification clock photo viewer and weather updates additional bells and whistles such as a scrolling news reader and stock ticker as well as social network apps are soon to follow hands off my qwerty moran had previously invested in comfyware a developer of keyboards for kids but he never planned to revolutionize typing a casual conversation with uri brison then head of a group evaluating user experience at the ill fated moran smartphone startup modu provided the spark for smartype â i came into dovâ s office one day while he was writing emails â brison relates to israel21c â and he told me that he felt the setup of his desktop wasnâ t comfortable enough he said that maybe we could improve on this and he came up with the simple idea of embedding an lcd screen in a keyboard to make it easier to type without having to lift your eyes up to the screen constantly â dov moran with his invention photo by dan lev studio in 2010 moran and brison founded keyview to give life to moranâ s idea â i had looked at the literature and found there was a known split focus problem with classic keyboards â says brison â most people hunt and peck even good touch typists spend six to 10 second bursts typing and then turn their focus momentarily to the keyboard to reorient their hands this slows down typing and makes the experience less productive than it can be â the keyview team at first thought to revamp the qwerty keyboard layout which is virtually unchanged from the time it was patented in 1867 despite the fact that it was designed to optimize the movement of the letter hammers striking the ink ribbon in a manual typewriter and has nothing to do with efficient typing another israeli startup snapkeys is working to replace qwerty with a radically new form of typing for smartphones and brison learned that several companies tried different approaches to reconfiguring pc keyboards in years past but their efforts didnâ t catch on with the public â we therefore decided we cannot touch the layout but could play with the physical structure and design â says brison â we made some subtle changes and will introduce more but weâ re starting with the screen and not everything at once â what began as a project to simplify typing led to the realization that an lcd screen close to the fingers is also a perfect display space for all sorts of information and keyboard apps â we have an open api so that third party or independent developers can make apps that reside in our keyboard â says brison â we think there are lot of interesting things that can be done â thumbs up from buyers set up on the bucolic moshav cooperative village yarkona near hod hasharon which also houses moranâ s smart tv startup comigo keyview employs a team of 10 dedicated to software and electronics design based on the companyâ s patents an embedded screen lets smartype users see what theyâ re typing without looking up at the screen photo by amos bar ze ev outside experts in ergonomics electronics plastics mechanics structural design programming and manufacturing were brought in to perfect the product which was debuted by keyview at the january 2012 consumer electronics show in las vegas â we showed our first prototypes there got the thumbs up from buyers from large retail chains and then raised money for actual manufacturing â says brison manufacturing and assembly takes place in china while all the electronic mechanical and plastic design and software is done in israel smartype hebrew english launches first via ecommerce sites at the beginning of november in the following months models geared to different languages will become available brison explains that the software is multilingual so itâ s just a matter of changing the letters on the keys â we will work with local distributors in each country with experience in the computer peripherals market accompanied by ecommerce sales â brison says advertisement

mai nguyen grew up in san diego to refugee parents from vietnam and studied geography at university of california berkeley before becoming a farmer in between they have worked on refugee resettlements farmers markets and waste management a journey that s taken them from farms in mendocino california to camps in southeast asia the common thread in their work is settlement of people and seeds and equity for nguyen what started as wanting to grow a full diet locally now has other farmers calling them the grain queen they see climate change and social inequality as the most pressing issues we face and makes explicit that the conditions in which crops thrive are linked to the conditions that allow people to thrive to that end nguyen has organized young farmers in groups like the national young farmers coalition to advocate for the next generation of growers as a child of displaced people nguyen s take on farming as a link between past and present is even more meaningful this interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity ys as a farmer how do you see the problem of hunger mn hunger is a structural human made problem anyone who s ever grown food finds that plants create abundance when you scatter seeds they try to produce more so that they can survive and there can be more of them in turn for us as people harvesting we have a lot then through human intervention we ve created even more through genetic modifications the problems of hunger today have so much to do with distribution and what people call food apartheid certain geographies and people become the centers of infrastructure that creates food and then in other regions people are left out it s been clear that we overproduce particular kinds of crops those get dumped onto other countries and have created dependencies that are volatile we look at our southern border and all the people who have come there because of climate change and catastrophes in their regions they were also forced to rely on the u s for food supply which has been shrinking because of climate change and our decreasing yields all of those have been push factors for people to move of course we know that there are neighborhoods or even cities and rural areas where food is produced and sent away for example farmers in fresno who are the main producers of food in california don t get to eat the fruits and vegetables that they ve grown they have the highest rates of diabetes and diet related illnesses as a result of not having fresh food despite having grown it ys how do your other experiences inform how you approach the problem of hunger mn having worked in refugee camps and on resettlement projects has led me to ask what does it mean to be resettled what does it mean to try to create a home permanently maybe never going back for us there s absolutely no choice in both what it takes to acclimate to a new place and ideally to set new roots there s a component of food we ate vietnamese food almost exclusively it was really important to be able to have produce so that we could eat something it was just one less thing to worry about as a farmer i have a greater appreciation for this idea of resettlement and how it relates to food it takes 20 generations for the seed to adapt to a new place adaptation relies on us being able to be in one place which is really challenging as a newcomer farmer land is unaffordable people can relate it s hard to buy a home then there s the issue of seed availability there are seed monopolies that have decreased our seed stock such that we only have 6 percent of our seed diversity from a century ago which correlates with the decline of cultural diversity through colonialism think about the intuit up in the arctic they can digest fat and have very different metabolic rates than those of us in equatorial latitudes that s a key adaptation for them to be in that place where they re eating those kinds of foods as a farmer and a person who is only the second generation here i think what am i doing for the next 18 generations to set them up so that they can adapt to this place ys how does farming relate to your family history mn it s an honor to be a part of such an old system with so many elders it s essentially a network of people to learn from in terms of how people have approached this i acknowledge my dual lineage as a vietnamese person where farming and liberation is a very fraught notion for us i hear that when i talk with my cambodian peers and those who are from china and went through the cultural revolution the communist ideal was that you work with factory and agricultural workers for this transformation of the land for liberation that transformation took the form of massacres really violent atrocious acts that were a part of a civil war that has left us homeless a large part of my farming is looking at how our current commodity and industrial systems also mirror how it treats humans and how we think about both differently how can farming for the whole also be fighting for a whole society and yet there is a very recent lived reality of pain that i also have to hold and contend with ys what might a business model centered on family and communities look like under this capitalist system mn capitalism coupled with neoliberalism has really eroded a lot of our structures but when we talk about our economy it also means care exchange and maintenance some communities like the indigenous have really strong economies of care we don t have as strong of a language for those elements in the capitalist financial economy but as we ve seen during the pandemic it s our neighbors checking in on us it s friends family these forms of the economy of care are what s gotten us through we can tap into what we already have it s not creating something totally new that template of the economy of care already exists it s still sometimes dominated by a transactional apparatus but it also has corporate and international principles that center community and responsibility for each other in my work with cooperative development a lot of immigrants from all over the world very quickly resonated with that model because it speaks so deeply to their own ways of being with each other i think about how our capitalist system takes so much labor for granted it s creating the language for articulating these elements so they don t seem so invisible when we name it we can own it and wield that for collective power photo credit mai nguyen ys what do you wish people knew about farmers are there any misconceptions that you often hear mn i do a lot of organizing with farmers of color the assumption is that when they bring up farmers of color people imagine farm workers or people farming in urban areas according to farm reports the vast majority of agricultural labor that gets us our food is being done by people of color mostly women at the same time there are farm owner operators such as myself who are people of color there s this assumption that a farm owner is white and while that is the most prevalent case by ignoring the fact that the rest of us exist it becomes a major problem when it comes to representation around policies in terms of trying to get relief funds for farmers of color any time you ask about including farmers of color policymakers will say yes we are definitely working on urban farming incentive programs there s this very 90s idea that people of color only exist in cities with urban as a codeword for black and brown people it makes it really hard when we talk about politics that was acute in 2016 and trump s election people are like we re just going to write off rural white america there are black and brown people there when it comes to size there s this assumption that people of color only farm on a small scale it s a self reinforcing perspective i was on a call yesterday with the california department of food and agriculture and they wanted this new relief program to benefit farmers of color they put an acreage cap i asked is this an equity proposal or is this a small scale producer proposal because if it s an equity proposal you should not put an acreage cap on it if it s a small scale producer proposal it doesn t say anything about farmers of color those are some of the primary misconceptions that have real limiting impacts on our ability to thrive the future of farming and beyond although the future of farming might look bleak nguyen and other young farmers aren t shying away from it nguyen founded the asian american farmers alliance and is a co director at minnow which secures farmland tenure for california s farmers of color while advancing indigenous sovereignty and land rematriation together they advocate for solutions that support production that is going to sustain us versus continuing to put toxins into our environment that are going to outlive us for young farmers of color equity is a must in the future of farming equity would be connecting local farmers ideally farmworkers who have been able to become farm owners to get the food that they re producing to their counterparts in urban areas nguyen said it turns out that their vision is not so far away the way that we structure that is even written out by community based organizations who read proposals to the local food promotion program we already have the blueprints for it we just need the investment as for what part consumers play in this vision nguyen makes it clear that we all have a stake people see that california has the most intense wildfires ever floods happen and all the green that s been destroyed because the frost in texas caused a power outage anytime people see these extreme weather situations it means that there s less food so we really need people to make those investments and pay us upfront if people can t afford that that is even more reason to take the time to vote on a farm bill where our society our government uses our tax dollars to support farmers for doing the most fundamental work for our collective livelihoods you can follow mai nguyen on instagram farmermainguyen cover photo credit arfb this article is part of

two of the trading associates at the jerome powell and associates firm inside the eccles building will be retiring dallas federal reserve bank president robert kaplan announced on monday that he will be retiring on october 8 alluding to the distraction of his multi million dollar stock transactions the federal reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy kaplan said unfortunately the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the federal reserve s execution of that vital work boston fed president eric rosengren also confirmed that he will retire on september 30 citing a long term health condition both men completed multi million dollar transactions in individual stocks in 2020 and purchased the same equities that the u s central bank did at the height of the coronavirus pandemic and here is an interesting final paragraph from reuters the departure of the two fed bank presidents could allow for a more diverse group of regional bank presidents who are chosen by local boards of directors with the approval of the fed governors currently seven of 12 bank presidents are white men three are white women and two are non white men when did the newswire become focused on skin color like this article get ecn delivered to your inbox daily subscribe here
in a rare moment of ethical controversy for the federal reserve two top officials resigned monday in the wake of revelations about their financial trading that exposed potential shortcomings in the fed s rules on investments eric rosengren the president of the federal reserve bank of boston said he would step down this week for health reasons meanwhile robert kaplan the president of the dallas fed said he would resign oct 8 to avoid becoming a distraction from the fed s broader mission the two officials financial disclosures sparked criticism from government watchdogs after they revealed extensive stock trading in 2020 when the fed was spending trillions of dollars stabilizing financial markets and boosting the economy because of their trading the two officials could potentially have profited from the fed s actions though the investments by rosengren and kaplan were permitted under the fed s rules they raised at least the appearance of conflicts of interest which fed policy discourages sen elizabeth warren a massachusetts democrat sharply criticized the trades and called for a ban on stock ownership by fed officials feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here fed chair jerome powell will testify tuesday before the senate banking housing and urban affairs committee which includes warren and will likely face questioning about the fed s ethics rules the resignations will give powell a specific response he can point to observers said the departure of rosengren and kaplan should ease pressure on powell who notably failed to express confidence in the two presidents at a news conference last week said krishna guha an analyst at the investment bank evercore isi the presidents of the 12 regional banks participate in the fed s private policymaking meetings in which they discuss the central bank s interest rate policies and are privy to economic data not always available to the public the fed s decisions can cause sharp swings in financial markets so can the presidents speeches and comments to the media fed chair jerome powell said last week that the fed would change its ethics policies in the wake of the disclosures yet the fed may still face pressure to allow an outside investigation into whether the two officials or any others traded based on inside information about the fed s actions after this egregious breach of public trust nothing but a full investigation and a referral to the securities and exchange commission is acceptable said jeff hauser director of the revolving door project a nonprofit group that monitors government appointments last year kaplan made trades worth at least 1 million in 22 stocks and index funds including amazon chevron facebook and johnson johnson the federal reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy kaplan said in a written statement unfortunately the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction kaplan said he would resign oct 8 rosengren had invested in funds that owned mortgage backed bonds the same kind that the fed has been buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth this year rosengren said he became eligible last year for a kidney transplant and said the stress of working at the fed during the pandemic recession worsened his health it has become clear that i should aim to reduce my stress so that i can focus on my health issues he said rosengren and kaplan were not voting members of the fed s policymaking committee this year but they contributed to forecasts of the fed s interest rate policy whichlast week showed the fed was considering hiking its short term rate currently at nearly zero by the end of 2022 that was a shift from june when the fed s projections did not show any hike until 2023 both are considered relatively hawkish policymakers meaning that they often favor higher interest rates to counter inflation powell s own financial disclosures show that he owned municipal bonds in 2020 even though the fed began purchasing such bonds for the first time last year in order to stabilize that market powell who was a private equity executive before being appointed to the fed s board in 2012 said last week he had owned munis for years and cleared his continued ownership with the office of government ethics at last week s press conference powell touched on a reason that these ethics concerns have flared previously municipal bonds were seen as a safe asset for fed officials to own because the fed didn t buy or sell them yet last year it did and it also began buying corporate bonds for the first time the boston fed s first vice president kenneth c montgomery will take over as acting president and ceo dallas fed first vice president meredith black will become interim president fed regional bank presidents are chosen by the six members of each

anna moneymaker getty images washington the senate is poised to vote on a measure aimed at averting a government shutdown and raising the federal debt limit monday evening but republicans have promised to block it if monday s vote fails as it is expected to congress will be left with just four days to cobble together a government funding bill the measure being considered by senators monday would extend federal funding at the current levels through early december and provide billions in emergency relief funds for afghan refugee resettlement and hurricane ida relief it also includes raising the federal debt limit through december 2022 the debt limit must be dealt with by mid october if lawmakers hope to avert potential financial calamity experts warn that failure to act could lead to the stock market crashing rising rates for mortgages loans and credit cards and businesses finding it more expensive to do basic business leading to layoffs treasury secretary janet yellen put it in stark terms in a recent wall street journal op ed saying in a matter of days millions of americans could be strapped for cash nearly 50 million seniors could stop receiving social security checks for a time she wrote troops could go unpaid millions of families who rely on the monthly child tax credit could see delays but republicans are nearly united in their resolve to block any hike to the debt limit from moving forward though louisiana sen john kennedy may vote to advance it because he feels his state desperately needs the hurricane relief on monday republicans are expected to deny democrats the 60 votes necessary to move forward on a stopgap funding bill because it would raise the debt limit senate majority leader chuck schumer scolded republicans for signaling they won t come together to vote yes on monday s continuing resolution calling their refusal unhinged and radical there is no scenario on god s green earth where it should be worth risking millions of jobs trillions in household wealth people s social security checks veterans benefits and another recession just to score short term meaningless political points schumer said we re facing a parade of horrible that will hurt every single american in this country he added senate minority leader mitch mcconnell argued republicans have been transparent for weeks that they will not support a continuing resolution that raises the debt ceiling we will support a clean continuing resolution that will prevent a government shutdown get disaster relief to louisiana help properly vetted afghan refugees who put themselves on the line for america and support the iron dome assistance for our ally israel mcconnell said we will not provide republican votes for raising the debt limit mcconnell has argued that democrats can and should be responsible for raising the debt limit on their own to offset the cost of a not yet passed massive social spending bill that encompasses many of president joe biden s agenda items that social spending bill is exempt from the normal 60 vote threshold in the senate democrats can pass it without any gop support and a raise in the debt limit should be tied to that bill republicans argue my advice to this democratic government the president the house and the senate don t play russian roulette with our economy step up and raise the debt ceiling to cover all that you ve been engaged in all year long mcconnell said last week this is a totally democratic government they have an obligation to raise the debt ceiling and they will do it but raising the debt limit is traditionally a bipartisan objective senate democrats have cried foul alleging that mcconnell is being inconsistent in his position democrats worked with republicans under the trump administration to raise the debt limit on multiple occasions and the limit now needs to be raised largely to pay for legislation passed during the trump presidency new proposals from the biden administration haven t yet been factored in for republicans to suddenly throw their hands in the air and abscond from their responsibility to pay debt that they proudly supported is nothing short of a dine and dash of historic proportions schumer said last week republicans wracked trillions of dollars in debt under president trump and are demanding american families foot the bill it s not clear exactly how the senate might proceed in the coming days to stop a shutdown house speaker nancy pelosi suggested last week that congress would likely consider a stopgap funding measure that does not impact the debt limit buying lawmakers more time to strategize on how to proceed mcconnell said republicans would support this but the clock is ticking democrats must address both the debt limit and government funding in the coming weeks while simultaneously juggling the fate of many of biden s most ambitious domestic policy priorities without the 60 votes necessary to advance a debt limit hike in the senate lawmakers will have little choice but to include it in their massive 3 5 trillion social spending bill but that bill s fate is anything but certain in the house moderates are threatening to withhold votes unless a separate 1 trillion infrastructure bill that passed the senate in august clears the lower chamber the house is expected to vote on the bipartisan bill later this week but progressives want to see more progression the larger social bill before they lend their support to it biden addressed the big week on capitol hill while receiving his booster shot earlier monday we ve got three things to do the debt ceiling continuing resolution and the two pieces of legislation we do that the country is going to be in great shape biden told reporters echoing the president at a briefing monday afternoon white house press secretary jen psaki indicated congressional negotiations could stretch beyond this week you said it could go into next week that s your expectations one

article article body as the 26th annual un climate summit cop26 in glasgow approaches we are seeing a good deal of movement or at least positioning from the morrison coalition government the first of four core areas for discussion at cop26 is the most important securing net zero the government finally seems to be accepting that it s going to have to commit to net zero by 2050 and unlike folks in some countries australians will demand that it does what it says wentworth mp dave sharma led the charge from within the coalition for more aggressive interim emissions reduction targets in remarks at unsw s energy institute he said a 2035 target of 40 45 below our 2005 levels is achievable on the technology and policy levers available today and will put us on a managed transition to net zero by 2050 bigger news still was a volley pun kind of intended of media appearances by treasurer josh frydenberg making the point that australia would be punished by international capital markets if it was seen as recalcitrant and that punishment would have tangible effects on ordinary folks reduced access to these capital markets would increase borrowing costs impacting everything from interest rates on home loans and small business loans to the financial viability of large scale infrastructure projects he said australia has a lot at stake it was tempting to see this as a case of shots fired within coalition ranks but even barnaby joyce the government s fossil in chief seemed to accept this reality on abc s insiders he said the australian coal industry shouldn t decline because of any domestic policy but shrugged that if it happened because of world markets then you know whatever curiously host david speers interpreted this as a case of joyce digging in the better reading was that joyce was heeding simpsons character chief wiggum s aphorism dig up stupid in case you were in any doubt about frydenberg s strategy it s this point out the truth that capital markets are demanding serious action on emissions reduction and are punishing those who fail to take such action from his position as the chief australian authority on what financial markets mean for the country note that it doesn t matter whether we want to be green or not we re going to lose out big time if we don t embrace net zero stand back and let joyce use markets as air cover for grudgingly agreeing to serious action on emissions reduction smart what needs to happen now though is twofold first ensure that australia doesn t unnecessarily constrain itself in achieving net zero by exempting whole sectors of the economy from climate action the idea that it would commit to net zero but exempt agriculture is bizarre not only are there huge economic opportunities for the agriculture sector in the green economy the rationale for net zero is that australia can still have emissions in some parts of the economy provided they are offset in other parts second and there s really no getting around this is australia needs a price on carbon in the economy the government s technology not taxes bumper sticker completely misses the point australia won t get technological innovation and adoption without a price on carbon pursuing technology alone risks a misguided detour into 1970s style industry policy complete with waste gaming rent seeking and worse technology and taxes or more precisely subsidies for green tech and a price on carbon are what economists call complements as opposed to substitutes doing more of one makes it more appealing to do more of the other adopting green tech is more appealing when the alternative is paying more through a price on carbon if one doesn t and putting a price on carbon is more attractive when technologies are around for it to help drive efficiency and change technology and taxes aren t binary alternatives as i observed previously in crikey in language to which our pm might relate they re like a beer and a pie or a hi vis vest and a camera the coalition is finally moving on climate at least a bit it is tempting for people like me who have long been advocates of strong action to see this as giving in to domestic electoral and international political pressure but so what there s movement that s good for the country and good for the planet and when people finally do some of the things critics want rather than cry hypocrisy we should as american baseball fans say just take the w this article was first published by crikey
as always propaganda masquerades as news at the associated press one recent dose assures us that there s enough of the jab to poison much of the world and all americans including children incredibly to the ap however more than 70 million americans remain unvaccinated now come on goebbels far more than 70 million of us have balked despite the enticement of lottery prizes free food or gifts and pleas from exhausted health care workers as the average number of deaths per day climbed to more than 1 900 in recent weeks among the challenges states face is not ordering too many doses and letting them go to waste but u s officials holding out hope that some of the unvaccinated will change their minds are trying to keep enough vaccines in stock so all americans can get them that balancing act is tricky and can lead to consternation around the globe as the u s sits on unused vaccines while many countries in places such as africa can t get enough vaccines i m certain i speak for all the unjabbed when i say please go ahead and send my dose overseas better yet dump it in the sea 8 16 pm on september 27 2021 the best of becky akers

rachel johnson introducing the mail on sunday s brilliant new columnist from a southall council flat to royal supergran this week we ve all felt some sympathetic contractions and unease as the world s press camped outside a cluster of cells in marylebone well i did anyway first i worried for the duchess long before she would have heard the sad news that the nurse jacintha saldanha who took the prank phone call from the australian djs had apparently killed herself when it s your first child you know for a fact that you are the only woman in the history of the world to have ever had a baby but you soon learn that your epoch making pregnancy is not box office plenty of others have done it before carole middleton leaves the king edward vii hospital in london where her daughter catherine duchess of cambridge was treated kate and her husband the duke of cambridge leave hospital after she was treated for hyperemesis gravidarum and in any case most men are not interested or are actively uninterested in your condition and would given any choice actually pay you not to tell them any details of the birth itself or the current top thousand names for girls and boys this is not true in the case of the duchess for whom friday s ghastly news was an unnecessary reminder that every detail of her life is the subject of a global media feeding frenzy for the next seven months the poor scrap really will be the only woman in the known universe having a baby she is not merely with child but with the royal child of destiny and her womb is the biggest show in town then i worried for the baby this foetus of only a couple of months gestation is already a monarch in waiting he she is third in line to the throne and will some day be king queen only someone of limited imagination could envy the life that fate has dished out for the cambridges first born this baby won t ever have what we ve all had the chance to make our own way in the world to be poor anonymous average just to be normal but then and i date my recovery to the moment the duchess emerged from hospital clutching a yellow posy not long after a visit from her mother i brightened i felt better i could perhaps nibble at a ginger nut after all for i d forgotten the one person who is going to make everything all right for the little mite carole middleton unto us a child is born unto us a gift is given because alleluia a woman who started life in a council flat in southall and went to a local state school who made a fortune flogging party bags and is probably even now designing an exclusive range of red white and blue bootees is going to be ruling the roost from now on which is absolutely in keeping with the current trend of the monarchy an institution that has cleverly embraced what might be called downward

unruined by a surfeit of raisins i ve spent years of my life picking the spoor out of cereal and giving them to the dog it s from rude health which is wise enough to realise that the missing ingredient is its usp and has called the variety no flamin raisins i m proud of my booby prize paxo jeremy paxman pictured introduced me as a bad sex prizewinner and sister of boris the annual bad sex award took place at london s in out club last week this is as everyone must know a literary booby prize designed to discourage authors from inserting disgusting and unnecessary sex scenes in their books my favourite entry ok i ll stop now was craig raine s for two short sentences in his new novel and he came like a wubbering springboard i won the prize in 2008 for what i felt was a stirring lovemaking scene in my novel shire hell that combined moths cats and slug clearance and a goat named cumberbatch in one paragraph this distinction is one of the two things i won t ever get away from as i was reminded last week when jeremy paxman introduced me as a bad sex prizewinner and sister of boris for a forthcoming tv show i am not contractually allowed to mention university challenge i didn t really mind as life s too short not that i d admit this to anyone let alone jeremy but i m secretly proud of my award which i collected in person unlike this year s winner who stayed safely in paris to try to protect her reputation the semi abstract plaster trophy of a sandalled foot it is supposed to represent sex in the fifties sits in my garden and does indeed continue to discourage me from ever writing about sex again so it has served a very useful purpose
