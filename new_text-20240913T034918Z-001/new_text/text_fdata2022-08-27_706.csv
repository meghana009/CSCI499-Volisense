wall street recoiled overnight after the head of the us federal reserve delivered a stern warning that the central bank s campaign to lower inflation by raising interest rates is unconditional even if it leads to pain for households businesses and in turn stock prices the s p 500 fell 3 4 per cent its worst daily showing since mid june taking its losses for the week to 4 per cent the slump was broad with every sector of the index lower stocks sank as jerome powell gave a short and clear message that rates will stay high for some time credit bloomberg bond investors also quickly adjusted for more rate increases from the fed with the two year treasury yield which is sensitive to rising interest rates moving close to its highest level of the year at 3 44 per cent before easing back to 3 38 per cent while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses jerome powell the fed chair said during a speech at the kansas city fed s annual conference in wyoming these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain
federal reserve chairman jerome powell suggested that the fight against inflation will cause economic pain during his keynote speech at the jackson hole economic symposium in wyoming powell vowed that the fed would forcefully fight inflation to bring it down closer to the goal of 2 powell said that reaching that goal requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance however he warned that those efforts could slow economic growth and result in a softer labor market while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses he said these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain stocks fell following his speech with the dow jones industrial average down by over 500 points the nasdaq was over 300 points in the red while the s p 500 was down over 80 points in mid day trading
however much republicans hated the substance of president joe biden s so called inflation reduction act democrats could at least boast that they passed a sizable deficit reduction but no longer but whatever goodwill the democratic party earned with its social and environmental spending bill s 300 billion 10 year deficit reduction biden has single handedly incinerated it and in doing so he has signaled to the federal reserve that it s on its own to save the country from ruinous stagflation if ruling democrats cannot even feign commitment to monetary contraction for longer than a fortnight why would fed chairman jerome powell and the fed not go all in on the war on inflation it s not that the legislation was ever actually going to reduce inflation in any meaningful or immediate way but at least it wasn t going to make things worse it was a show of good enough faith that the fed felt entitled to pretend it had a partner in tightening the money supply at minimum the joe manchins and tim ryans of washington could boast that democrats wouldn t go out of their ways to make the fed s path forward even more austere but now all bets are off with his student loan order biden has unilaterally voided whatever deficit reduction the bill theoretically generated and in practice it may cost much more than that up to 1 trillion powell was late to see through the idea that inflation was transitory or that it had peaked after two inadequate federal funds rate hikes of 75 basis points markets had settled on their decadelong assumption that the fed would keep saving them forever but now at last powell has refused to save them in jackson hole wyoming he sent stocks plunging when he promised some pain for households as he follows through on the fed s unconditional duty to deliver price stability powell was finally appropriately hawkish despite a spate of ok news about personal consumption expenditures inflation the fed s preferred measure of price stability that s because powell now understands that he s no longer working around biden s washington he s working against it to save the country against a president who would rather score political points with his party s far left than acknowledge and fight the worst inflation in four decades powell once worried that he would overshoot in his fight against inflation and stagnate the economy if jackson hole made one thing clear it s that that s not true anymore biden has his own hubris to thank

washington ap the u s and china have reached a tentative agreement to allow u s regulators to inspect the audits washington ap the u s and china have reached a tentative agreement to allow u s regulators to inspect the audits of chinese companies whose stocks are traded on u s exchanges in a long festering dispute u s regulators have threatened to boot a number of chinese companies off the new york stock exchange and nasdaq if china doesn t permit inspections the deal announced friday by market regulators in the u s and china is preliminary securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler said the proof will be in the pudding while important this framework is merely a step in the process gensler said in a prepared statement this agreement will be meaningful only if u s regulators actually can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in china if they cannot roughly 200 china based issuers will face prohibitions on trading of their securities in the u s if they continue to use those audit firms an agreement would mean that u s investors will maintain access to shares of important chinese companies while at the same time being protected by the integrity of company audits this is unequivocally positive news and a major step toward averting mass delisting of chinese companies in the u s analyst tobin marcus at evercore isi said in a note to clients however he said a deal is only the first step toward avoiding delisting what ultimately needs to happen is that u s inspectors need to show up and complete inspections he said the inspections could take months the u s regulators plan to have inspection teams on the ground in china by mid september the public company accounting oversight board is due to determine by year s end whether the chinese government is continuing to block access to the audit books a negative finding could result in u s actions such as stock trading bans although it s preliminary the agreement is a rare instance of accord at a time when relations between the u s and china are fraught by sparring over trade the war in ukraine and human rights the tension was ratcheted higher by u s house speaker nancy pelosi s recent trip to taiwan the self governing island that china claims as its territory the chinese responded to the visit by pelosi second in line to the u s presidency with military drills around the island u s regulators had warned that without an agreement some 200 companies including alibaba group the world s biggest e commerce competitor might be ejected from u s exchanges or face trading restrictions the americans said that other governments have agreed to allow such audit reviews which are required by u s law and that china and hong kong are the only holdouts three of china s biggest state owned companies announced this month they would remove their shares from the new york stock exchange but gave no indication that the action was related to the audit dispute petrochina ltd china life insurance ltd and china petroleum chemical co cited the small volume of trading of their shares in the new york market and the expense of complying with regulations in a foreign market the companies said their shares still would be traded in hong kong which is chinese territory but open to non chinese investors the dispute over audits of chinese companies dates back more than a decade scores of chinese companies were suspended or kicked off u s exchanges most of them for failing to file timely financial reports at least two dozen were hit with sec fraud or accounting charges but investigations stalled because the companies audit papers were in china beyond the sec s reach under terms of the new agreement u s accounting inspectors in the pcaob would have independent discretion to select any chinese company audit for inspection or investigation and they would get direct access to interview all personnel of the audit firms whose work is being inspected the inspectors could see complete audit work papers with no redactions in beijing the china securities regulatory commission called the agreement an important step in resolving the issue of common concern of audit and regulatory cooperation investors and companies on both sides will benefit from keeping chinese shares trading on u s exchanges the commission said the terms the commission outlined would give chinese officials a role in any possible investigations china won the right to conduct similar reviews of u s audit firms where relevant according to the chinese regulators allowing beijing to portray the agreement as mutually positive rather than an instance of china giving in to american pressure china has yet to express any need to carry out such reviews of its own chinese regulators also would be allowed to participate in interviews with audit personnel __ mcdonald reported from beijing __ follow marcy gordon at copyright 2024 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast written or redistributed

federal reserve chair jerome powell delivered a stark message friday the fed is determined to fight inflation with more sharp interest rate hikes which will likely cause pain for americans in the form of a weaker economy and job losses these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation powell said in a high profile speech at the fed s annual economic symposium in jackson hole but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain investors had been hoping for a signal from powell that the fed might soon moderate its rate increases later this year if inflation were to show further signs of easing but the fed chair indicated that that time may not be near runaway price increases have soured most americans on the economy even as the unemployment rate has fallen to a half century low of 3 5 it has also created political risks for president joe biden and congressional democrats in this fall s elections with republicans denouncing biden s 1 9 trillion financial support package approved last year as having fueled inflation stocks tumbled after powell s remarks and bond yields rose a sign that investors foresee more large interest rate hikes ahead some on wall street expect the economy to fall into recession later this year or early next year after which they expect the fed to reverse itself and reduce rates a number of fed officials though have pushed back against that notion powell s remarks suggested that the fed is aiming to raise its benchmark rate to about 3 75 to 4 by next year yet not so high as to tank the economy in hopes of slowing growth long enough to conquer high inflation the idea they are trying to hammer into the market s head is that their approach makes a rapid pivot to rate cuts unlikely said eric winograd an economist at asset manager alliancebernstein they are going to stay tight even when it hurts after raising its key short term rate by a steep three quarters of a point at each of its past two meetings part of the fed s fastest series of hikes since the early 1980s powell said the fed might ease up on that pace at some point suggesting that any such slowing isn t near powell said the size of the fed s rate increase at its next meeting in late september whether one half or three quarters of a percentage point will depend on inflation and jobs data an increase of either size though would exceed the fed s traditional quarter point hike a reflection of how severe inflation has become the fed chair said that while lower inflation readings that have been reported for july have been welcome he added that a single month s improvement falls far short of what fed policymakers will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down on friday an inflation gauge that is closely monitored by the fed showed that prices actually declined 0 1 from june to july though prices did jump 6 3 in july from 12 months earlier that was down from a 6 8 year over year jump in june which had been the highest since 1982 the drop largely reflected lower gas prices in his speech friday powell noted that the history of high inflation in the 1970s when the central bank sought to counter high prices with only intermittent rate hikes shows that the fed must stay focused the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely lowering interest rates he said we must keep at it until the job is done what particularly worries powell and other fed officials is the prospect that inflation would become entrenched leading consumers and businesses to change their behavior in ways that would perpetuate higher prices if for example workers began demanding higher pay to match higher inflation many employers would then pass on those higher labor costs to consumers in the form of higher prices many analysts speculate that fed officials want to see roughly six months or so of lower monthly inflation readings similar to july s before stopping their rate hikes powell s speech was the marquee event of the the fed s annual economic symposium at jackson hole the first time the conference of central bankers is being held in person since 2019 after it went virtual for two years during the covid 19 pandemic since march the fed has implemented its fastest pace of rate increases in decades to try to curb inflation which has punished households with soaring costs for food gas rent and other necessities the central bank has lifted its benchmark rate by 2 full percentage points in just four meetings to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 those hikes have led to higher costs for mortgages car loans and other consumer and business borrowing home sales have been plunging since the fed first signaled it would raise borrowing costs in june the fed s policymakers signaled that they expected their key rate to end 2022 in a range of 3 25 to 3 5 and then to rise further next year to between 3 75 and 4 if rates reached their projected level at the end of this year they would be at the highest point since 2008 powell is betting that he can engineer a high risk outcome slow the economy enough to ease inflation pressures yet not so much as to trigger a recession his task has been complicated by the economy s cloudy picture on thursday the government said the economy shrank at a 0 6 annual rate in the april june period the second straight quarter of contraction yet employers are still hiring rapidly and the number of people seeking unemployment aid a measure of layoffs remains relatively low at its meeting in july fed policymakers expressed two competing concerns that highlighted their delicate task according to minutes from that meeting the officials who aren t identified by name have prioritized their inflation fight still some officials said there was a risk that the fed would raise borrowing costs more than necessary risking a recession if inflation were to fall closer to the fed s 2 target and the economy weakened further those diverging views could become hard to reconcile at last year s jackson hole symposium powell listed five reasons why he thought inflation would be transitory yet instead it has persisted and many economists have noted that those remarks haven t aged well powell indirectly acknowledged that history at the outset of his remarks friday when he said that at past jackson hole conferences i have discussed broad topics such as the ever changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy today he said my remarks will be shorter my focus narrower and my message more direct

new york ap the dow jones industrial average sank more than 1 000 points friday after the head of the federal reserve dashed wall street s hopes that it may soon ease up on high interest rates in its effort to tame inflation the s p 500 lost 3 4 its biggest drop since mid june after jerome powell said the fed will likely need to keep interest rates high enough to slow the economy for some time in order to beat back the high inflation sweeping the country the dow dropped 3 and the nasdaq composite ended 3 9 lower reflecting a broad sell off led by technology stocks higher rates help corral inflation but they also hurt asset prices the fed has indicated it will raise rates into next year as it tries to quell demand and bring down prices for goods and services but some investors speculated the central bank might pause or even reverse course next year if inflation subsides leading to a rally for stocks in july and early august some analysts expected powell to bat down that talk in friday s speech and he delivered his speech followed up remarks by several other fed officials who also pushed back on speculation the fed might act less aggressively or even pivot he basically said there will be pain and that they won t stop and can t stop hiking until inflation moves a lot lower said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments powell acknowledged the increases will hurt u s households and businesses in perhaps an unspoken nod to the potential for a recession but he also said the pain would be far greater if inflation were allowed to fester and that we must keep at it until the job is done he was speaking at an annual economic symposium in jackson hole wyoming which has been the setting for market moving fed speeches in the past the sell off capped a week of choppy trading that left major indexes down 4 or more for the week all told the s p 500 fell 141 46 points to 4 057 66 the benchmark index is now down almost 15 for the year the dow lost 1 008 38 points to close at 32 283 40 the last time the blue chip average had a 1 000 point drop was in may the nasdaq slid 497 56 points to 12 141 71 its biggest drop since

nasdaq up 10 recent earnings reports were better than some analysts had expected and there are signs that inflation may have peaked although it remains at sharply elevated levels still powell s speech made clear the fed will accept weaker growth for a while for the sake of getting inflation under control analysts said powell reiterated that the fed is worried about rising prices and getting inflation under control is emphatically job number one said jeff klingelhofer co head of investments at thornburg investment management perhaps giving some hope to investors some analysts said powell seemed to indicate expectations for future inflation aren t taking off if that were to happen it could cause a self perpetuating cycle that worsens inflation a report on friday said u s consumers are expecting 2 9 annual inflation over the long run which is at the lower end of the 2 9 to 3 1 range seen in the university of michigan s survey over the last year for now the debate on wall street is whether the fed will raise short term rates by either half a percentage point next month double the usual margin or by three quarters of a point the fed s last two hikes have been by 0 75 points and a slight majority of bets on wall street are favoring a third such increase in september according to cme group a report friday morning showed that the fed s preferred gauge of inflation decelerated last month and wasn t as bad as many economists expected it s a potentially encouraging signal which may embolden more of wall street to say that the worst of inflation has already passed or will soon other data showed that incomes for americans rose less last month than expected while consumer spending growth slowed following the reports and powell s comments the two year treasury yield rose for much of the day but slipped by late afternoon to 3 36 from 3 37 late thursday it tends to track expectations for fed action the 10 year treasury yield which follows expectations for longer term economic growth and inflation initially rose then slipped to 3 02 from 3 03 late thursday the fed has already hiked its key overnight interest rate four times this year in hopes of slowing the worst inflation in decades the hikes have already hurt the housing industry where more expensive mortgage rates have slowed activity but the job market has remained strong helping to prop up the economy

jackson hole wyoming which has been the setting for market moving fed speeches in the past the sell off capped a week of choppy trading that left major indexes down 4 or more for the week all told the s p 500 fell 141 46 points to 4 057 66 the benchmark index is now down almost 15 for the year the dow lost 1 008 38 points to close at 32 283 40 the last time the blue chip average had a 1 000 point drop was in may the nasdaq slid 497 56 points to 12 141 71 its biggest drop since june the russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 64 81 points or 3 3 to finish at 1 899 83 stocks are still showing solid gains for the third quarter with the s p 500 up more than 7 and the nasdaq up 10 recent earnings reports were better than some analysts had expected and there are signs that inflation may have peaked although it remains at sharply elevated levels still powell s speech made clear the fed will accept weaker growth for a while for the sake of getting inflation under control analysts said powell reiterated that the fed is worried about rising prices and getting inflation under control is emphatically job number one said jeff klingelhofer co head of investments at thornburg investment management perhaps giving some hope to investors some analysts said powell seemed to indicate expectations for future inflation aren t taking off if that were to happen it could cause a self perpetuating cycle that worsens inflation a report on friday said u s consumers are expecting 2 9 annual inflation over the long run which is at the lower end of the 2 9 to 3 1 range seen in the university of michigan s survey over the last year for now the debate on wall street is whether the fed will raise short term rates by either half a percentage point next month double the usual margin or by three quarters of a point the fed s last two hikes have been by 0 75 points and a slight majority of bets on wall street are favoring a third such increase in september according to cme group a report friday morning showed that the fed s preferred gauge of inflation decelerated last month and wasn t as bad as many economists expected it s a potentially encouraging signal which may embolden more of wall street to say that the worst of inflation has already passed or will soon other data showed that incomes for americans rose less last month than expected while consumer spending growth slowed following the reports and powell s comments the two year treasury yield rose for much of the day but slipped by late afternoon to 3 36 from 3 37 late thursday it tends to track expectations for fed action the 10 year treasury yield which follows expectations for longer term economic growth and inflation initially rose then slipped to 3 02 from 3 03 late thursday the fed has already hiked its key overnight interest rate four times this year in hopes of slowing the worst inflation in decades the hikes have already hurt the housing industry where more expensive mortgage rates have slowed activity but the job market has remained strong helping to prop up the economy investors got a fresh set of warnings from companies about the persistent impact from inflation and a slowing economy

jackson hole wyoming federal reserve chair jerome powell delivered a stark warning friday about the fed s determination to fight inflation with more sharp interest rate hikes it will likely cause pain for americans in the form of a weaker economy and job losses the message landed with a thud on wall street sending the dow jones industrial average down more than 1 000 points for the day these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation powell said in a high profile speech at the fed s annual economic symposium in jackson hole but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain investors had been hoping for a signal from powell that the fed might moderate its rate increases later this year if inflation were to show further signs of easing but the fed chair indicated that that time may not be near and stocks tumbled in response runaway price increases have soured most americans on the economy even as the unemployment rate has fallen to a half century low of 3 5 it has also created political risks for president joe biden and congressional democrats in this fall s elections with republicans denouncing biden s 1 9 trillion financial support package approved last year as having fueled inflation dow nasdaq sag the dow jones average finished down 3 friday its worst day in three months the tech heavy nasdaq composite shed nearly 4 shorter term treasury yields climbed as traders built up bets for the fed to stay aggressive with rates some on wall street expect the economy to fall into recession later this year or early next year after which they expect the fed to reverse itself and reduce rates a number of fed officials though have pushed back against that notion powell s remarks suggested that the fed is aiming to raise its benchmark rate to about 3 75 to 4 by next year yet not so high as to tank the economy in hopes of slowing growth long enough to conquer high inflation the idea they are trying to hammer into the market s head is that their approach makes a rapid pivot to unlikely said eric winograd an economist at asset manager alliancebernstein they are going to stay tight even when it hurts after raising its key short term rate by a steep three quarters of a point at each of its past two meetings part of the fed s fastest series of hikes since the early 1980s powell said the fed might ease up on that pace at some point suggesting that any such slowing isn t near powell said the size of the fed s rate increase at its next meeting in late september whether one half or three quarters of a percentage point will depend on inflation and jobs data an increase of either size though would exceed the fed s traditional quarter point hike a reflection of how severe inflation has become the fed chair said that while lower inflation readings that have been reported for july have been welcome he added that a single month s improvement falls far short of what will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down drop in inflation on friday an inflation gauge that is closely monitored by the fed showed that prices actually declined 0 1 from june to july though prices did jump 6 3 in july from 12 months earlier that was down from a 6 8 year over year jump in june which had been the highest since 1982 the drop largely reflected lower gas prices in his speech friday powell noted that the history of high inflation in the 1970s when the central bank sought to counter high prices with only intermittent rate hikes shows that the fed must stay focused the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely lowering interest rates he said we must keep at it until the job is done what particularly worries powell and other fed officials is the prospect that inflation would become entrenched leading consumers and businesses to change their behavior in ways that would perpetuate higher prices if for example workers began demanding higher pay to match higher inflation many employers would then pass on those higher labor costs to consumers in the form of higher prices many analysts speculate that fed officials want to see roughly six months or so of lower monthly inflation readings similar to july s before stopping their rate hikes powell s speech was the marquee event of the fed s annual economic symposium at jackson hole the first time the conference of central bankers is being held in person since 2019 after it went virtual for two years during the covid 19 pandemic rapid hikes since march the fed has implemented its fastest pace of rate increases in decades to try to curb inflation which has punished households with soaring costs for food gas rent and other necessities the central bank has lifted its benchmark rate by 2 full percentage points in just four meetings to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 those hikes have led to higher costs for mortgages car loans and other consumer and business borrowing home sales have been plunging since the fed first signaled it would raise borrowing costs at last year s jackson hole symposium powell listed five reasons he thought inflation would be transitory yet it has persisted and many economists have noted that those remarks haven t aged well powell indirectly acknowledged that history at the outset of his remarks friday when he said that at past jackson hole conferences i have discussed broad topics such as the ever changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy today he said my remarks will be shorter my focus narrower and my message more direct

following the drubbing of the crypto markets in june 2022 with bitcoin and ethereum prices down nearly 75 percent and 82 percent respectively from their all time highs many market observers predicted the early death of the crypto industry crypto detractors including regulators and vested interests in the legacy financial system each used the rout as evidence that crypto is a dangerous scam that needs to be more heavily regulated if not completely outlawed the predictions of imminent doom were premature bitcoin is up 37 percent and the price of ether has doubled since the june lows prices will go up and prices will go down volatility will persist this isn t the point while highly correlated with the simultaneous decline and recovery of the equity markets the crypto market had some notable frauds and failures in the quarter among previously large crypto funds and lenders that caused a domino effect across the industry much like the collateral damage caused by the collapse of large hedge funds or banks in traditional financial markets notwithstanding the turbulence sentiment in the industry has remained remarkably strong buoyed by an evangelical zeal among cryptonauts in the underlying mission utility and potential of the crypto revolution to address real world issues such as financial inclusion for the poor and unbanked inflation caused by runaway deficit spending and debt issuance government surveillance and the potential for illegal asset seizures and the oligopolistic dominance of the big banks in traditional financial markets like any disruptive innovation crypto is bound to have some ups and downs false starts and dead ends when newly invented bicycles for example became a popular and efficient alternative to either walking or traveling by horseback government officials and the era s media influencers sought to outlaw them as dangerous nuisances to public safely eventually and despite many crashes and broken bones along the way the obvious mobility benefits overcame such resistance bitcoin ethereum and some other cryptocurrencies represent a transformative innovation that has potential to radically alter the worlds of money finance and much more these opportunities have been detailed elsewhere crypto deserves the chance to develop and succeed just as enlightened u s policy enabled innovation in the internet era however there are at least three major long term risks that could leave this potential unrealized the lack of consumer adoption regulatory interference and unforeseen technological innovation lack of consumer adoption what made the last technology revolution successful was the vast consumer applicability of useful if now annoying and sometimes baneful applications such as email web browsers social media platforms and multifunction smartphones some legislators proposed taxing emails to make up for lost postal service revenue but wiser heads prevailed through the development of tcp ip an internet protocol suite or the handshake between otherwise unconnected computers around the world what we now call the internet migrated from an arcane military then university research tool to a universal application that today is used by an estimated five billion people around the world similarly 6 8 billion people now have access to smartphones of one kind or another however as of today crypto remains largely in the playpen of tech bros and they re mostly bros only an estimated 300 million people 3 75 percent of the world s population of eight billion have used crypto for crypto to thrive it must be made easier to use by the rank and file of individuals who don t know how to navigate a command line prompt or care about the math behind a cryptographic hash to this end many of the products and innovations now coming out of the industry are targeted at demystifying crypto and making it more accessible to the normies outside the highly technical world it has represented heretofore just as aol moved access to the internet from unix programmers to grandma and grandpa so too must crypto defi decentralized finance and web 3 0 make their inevitable migration to simple and widespread consumer use in order to succeed regulatory interference government leaders as diverse and otherwise opposed to one another as u s sec chairman gary gensler european central bank president christine lagarde u s treasury secretary janet yellen former uk prime minister boris johnson and former u s president donald trump each have denounced crypto as a scam that needs substantial regulation and governmental oversight if not outright prohibition on use these criticisms always fail to mention that the amount of fraudulent and criminal transactions that occur with cash or across bank wires dwarfs any such illicit use in crypto china has notoriously taken the lead here banning for all practical purposes the use of bitcoin in the formal economy while via the people s bank of china simultaneously issuing a digital yuan that is ultimately controlled and monitored by the chinese communist party whether issued by china the united states or the european union government sponsored central bank issued digital currencies cbdcs while having many viable use cases are also a potential tool of the surveillance state if not checked regulation will facilitate governments total informational awareness and ultimate control of cbdcs and thus every aspect of their citizens lives bitcoin and ethereum provide alternatives to enable financial privacy and autonomy in the united states the u s treasury department s office of foreign assets control ofac recently sanctioned use of tornado cash a decentralized and non custodial privacy solution built on ethereum that allows users to anonymize transactions that they don t want made visible to anyone who looks at the details publicly available on the transparent blockchain there are many legitimate reasons for individuals and business users to keep the details of their financial transactions private no one wants their medical expenses political or charitable contributions supplier or customer data and other spending visible to the entire world notably this is the first time that ofac s financial crimes sanctions normally targeting terrorists traffickers criminal networks and the like have been deployed against lines of computer code rather than individuals or legal entities and its legality will almost certainly be challenged a wide ranging regulatory confrontation is imminent in the united states and it is entirely possible that regulations are eventually issued that renders use of non cbdc coins illegal or so burdened by regulation as to make them of little practical use unforeseen innovation lack of adoption and regulatory interference are well known and oft discussed risks for crypto what is less frequently considered is pure technology risk this is to say the same relentless advances in technology that enabled secure distributed networks applications for blockchain technology and cryptographic keys may be their undoing for example advances in quantum computing may one day make the unbreakable cryptographic private keys that secure digital wallets vulnerable and thus obsolete unlike normal computer code qubits quantum bits are nonbinary no not that kind and can be both 0 and 1 at the same time or oscillate between them this may eventually allow computations at a speed and complexity impossible today it s not for me to predict what these unforeseen innovations will be i write as a strategist not as a technologist but to remind us that technology advances and materializes in unpredictable unexpected and seemingly sudden ways anyone remember nokia and blackberry we are in the middle of a revolution that has potential to transform everything from finance and economics to government and politics and even democracy itself what advocates see as potential benefits are the very things viewed as threats and dangers by government regimes many revolutions launched with great zeal and enthusiasm are not ultimately successful and end up in the dustbin of history the crypto revolution should be supported by anyone who cares about things like financial decentralization and wresting control from too big to fail banks transaction anonymity and immutability the right to ownership of one s data online privacy and

as the bedrock of our economy without price stability the economy does not work for anyone in particular without price stability we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all the burdens of high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth moreover there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain the u s economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of 2021 which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession while the latest economic data have been mixed in my view our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum the labor market is particularly strong but it is clearly out of balance with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers inflation is running well above 2 percent and high inflation has continued to spread through the economy while the lower inflation readings for july are welcome a single month s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down we are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent at our most recent meeting in july the fomc raised the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 25 to 2 5 percent which is in the summary of economic projection s sep range of estimates of where the federal funds rate is projected to settle in the longer run in current circumstances with inflation running far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight estimates of longer run neutrality are not a place to stop or pause july s increase in the target range was the second 75 basis point increase in as many meetings and i said then that another unusually large increase could be appropriate at our next meeting we are now about halfway through the inter meeting period our decision at the september meeting will depend on the totality of the incoming data and the evolving outlook at some point as the stance of monetary policy tightens further it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy committee participants most recent individual projections from the june sep showed the median federal funds rate running slightly below 4 percent through the end of 2023 participants will update their projections at the september meeting our monetary policy deliberations and decisions build on what we have learned about inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and 1980s and from the low and stable inflation of the past quarter century in particular we are drawing on three important lessons the first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation it may seem strange now that central bankers and others once needed convincing on these two fronts but as former chairman ben bernanke has shown both propositions were widely questioned during the great inflation period 1 today we regard these questions as settled our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional it is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the united states it is also true in my view that the current high inflation in the united states is the product of strong demand and constrained supply and that the fed s tools work principally on aggregate demand none of this diminishes the federal reserve s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability there is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply we are committed to doing that job the second lesson is that the public s expectations about future inflation can play an important role in setting the path of inflation over time today by many measures longer term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored that is broadly true of surveys of households businesses and forecasters and of market based measures as well but that is not grounds for complacency with inflation having run well above our goal for some time if the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time then absent major shocks it likely will unfortunately the same is true of expectations of high and volatile inflation during the 1970s as inflation climbed the anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and businesses the more inflation rose the more people came to expect it to remain high and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions as former chairman paul volcker put it at the height of the great inflation in 1979 inflation feeds in part on itself so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations one useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of rational inattention when inflation is persistently high households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate inflation into their economic decisions when inflation is low and stable they are freer to focus their attention elsewhere former chairman alan greenspan put it this way for all practical purposes price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions of course inflation has just about everyone s attention right now which highlights a particular risk today the longer the current bout of high inflation continues the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched that brings me to the third lesson which is that we must keep at it until the job is done history shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting the successful volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years a lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now these lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down we are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply and to keep inflation expectations anchored we will keep at it until we are confident the job is done

the center square a nationwide survey says that renters in illinois need salaries of 22 to 25 an hour to afford a modest two bedroom apartment the annual survey named out of reach is a joint venture of housing action illinois and the national low income housing coalition median rents for two bedroom apartments in illinois increased nearly 18 between the first quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 the report said rents are too high something needs to be done to contain rental prices john bartlett executive director of the metropolitan tenants organization in chicago told the center square the demise of mom and pop landlords is one reason for high rents bartlett said single buyers for two flats and small multi family properties have been shut out of the market in the past 12 years by corporate real estate companies who outbid the little guys and pay cash for properties bartlett said large corporate entities are running the rental housing market they own 58 of all rental housing units bartlett said the mom and pops are going away he said it s tough being a small landlord these days bartlett said that is unfortunate because the small mom and pops provide affordable housing they live in one unit and rent out the other because they know the tenants they tend to keep prices down a little because they see the advantage of keeping someone for a long period of time minimum wage earners in illinois make 12 an hour a 40 hour work week at 12 an hour won t pay the rent on a modest one bedroom apartment in illinois the out of reach report said in chicago starting salaries are higher 15 40 in the city and 13 35 in cook county but that is not enough to afford the rent on a modest two bedroom apartment a full time worker in chicago needs to make 25 77 an hour to be able to pay the rent on a modest two bedroom apartment the report said the metropolitan tenants organization has found that a lot of people are paying 40 and 50 of their take home pay for housing bartlett said that situation is not tenable everybody runs into a crisis at some point bartlett said if a person is paying 50 of their income in rent and their car breaks down they can wind up getting evicted he said with an eviction on your record that makes it even harder to rent bartlett said a permanent housing stock of affordable housing would pay off in lower crime rates and stronger communities bartlett said
women whose menstrual cycles last less than 26 days are more likely to experience early menopause study finds scientists also said they were most likely to face menopause signs at midlife researchers led by harvard medical school recruited 600 women for the study they filled in questionnaires at age of recruitment about 33 years old and at midlife about 18 years later on their menopause symptoms those with shorter cycles hit menopause at 49 years old on average but those with longer cycles reached it around age 52 years the study found women who have shorter menstrual cycles start menopause two years earlier than others and face the most symptoms in midlife a study has found researchers led by harvard medical school monitored 600 women from the ages of 33 to at least 51 years old and asked them to self report symptoms of menopause and when their cycles stopped those with shorter cycles less than 26 days hit menopause at age 49 on average the study found while those with normal cycles from 26 to 34 days reached it at about 51 years old women with shorter cycles were also more likely to report symptoms including sleep and heart problems and depression scientists behind the paper said the age at menopause when the menstrual cycle stops was a good marker of overall health they called for more research into the topic to establish the health impacts of a shorter cycle it comes after a doctor warned that earlier menopause could shorten a woman s lifespan because it shifts the hormone balance sparking a more rapid decline and raising the risk of conditions including heart disease stroke and arthritis the above graph shows the results from the study it reveals that women who have shorter menstrual cycles hit the menopause at age 49 on average while those with normal cycles from 26 to 34 days reach it at age 51 years for the study published this week in the journal menopause scientists recruited women within their first 22 weeks of pregnancy at clinics in massachusetts between 1999 and 2000 and asked them to report the length of their menstrual cycle about 72 percent of participants were white and 80 percent had obtained a college degree they were split into three groups based on the length of their menstrual cycle 90 women in the short group 505 in normal and 39 in long more than 34 days what is menopause menopause is defined as the changes a woman goes through just before and after she stops her periods and is no longer able to get pregnant naturally some women go through this time with few if any symptoms around 60 percent experience symptoms resulting in behavioral changes and one in four will suffer severely common symptoms include hot flashes night sweats vaginal dryness leading to discomfort during sex disrupted sleep decreased sex drive problems with memory and concentration and mood swings menopause happens when your ovaries stop producing as much of the hormone estrogen and no longer release an egg each month american experts say women go through menopause at the age of 51 years on average although it can begin when someone is anywhere between 40 and 58 years old advertisement about 18 years later the midlife point they were asked to return to report whether they were suffering any symptoms and the age at which they reached menopause cycle length symptoms and the age of menopause were self reported meaning they were not independently assessed by a doctor results showed women with shorter cycles were about 67 percent more likely to experience an early menopause than those with normal cycles those with longer cycles took the most amount of time to reach menopause hitting it at about 52 years old on average women with shorter cycles also reported the most menopause symptoms at midlife on average compared to the other two groups against those with a normal cycle they were 92 percent more likely to say they had sleep problems 85 percent more likely to report depression symptoms and 68 percent more likely to say they had heart problems they were also more likely to say they had exhaustion 52 percent hot flashes 38 percent and muscle problems 14 percent the study also found women with shorter cycles were less likely to be white have a college degree or a household income above 70 000 per year dr lidia minguez alarcon the human fertility researcher who led the study and others said we observed that women with short menstrual cycles during reproductive years had a higher frequency of total menopausal symptoms and an earlier age of natural menopause at midlife using the menstrual cycle as an additional vital sign adds a powerful tool to the assessment of physical and mental health menopause is a natural part of ageing with symptoms emerging up to ten years before cycles stop to help ease these symptoms doctors recommend getting plenty of rest eating calcium rich food like milk and exercising regularly they also say it is important to talk to others going through the same thing but women can also be offered patches to help boost levels of hormones that the body stops manufacturing during menopause it comes after an expert suggested that delaying menopause could prolong a woman s lifespan because the hormonal changes it triggers lead to faster aging across the body dr jennifer garrison an award winning scientist who leads the buck institute for research on aging warned the process changes the body s hormone balance sparking a more rapid decline speaking at the life itself conference in san diego california she said that women who begin menopause in their 40s rather than around 51 years old the average age likely age faster than their peers garrison said when a woman is in her late 20s or early 30s the rest of her tissue is functioning at peak performance but her ovaries are already showing overt signs of aging yet most women learn about their ovaries and ovarian function when they go to use them for the first time and find out they re geriatric she added studies show women who have later menopause tend to live longer and have an enhanced ability to repair their dna advertisement but women with natural menopause before the age of 40 are twice as likely to die early compared with women going through natural menopause between the ages of 50 to 54

federal reserve chairman jerome powell suggested that the fight against inflation will cause economic pain during his keynote speech at the jackson hole economic symposium in wyoming powell vowed that the fed would forcefully fight inflation to bring it down closer to the goal of 2 powell said that reaching that goal requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance however he warned that those efforts could slow economic growth and result in a softer labor market while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses he said these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain stocks fell following his speech with the dow jones industrial average down by over 500 points the nasdaq was over 300 points in the red while the s p 500 was down over 80 points in mid day trading

nothing says happy birthday quite like accomplishing a goal a year and a half in the making i bought a synagogue on my birthday stated rebecca stanfel president of the board for the nonprofit montana jewish project mjp on aug 26 a crowd of around 75 people gathered in front of what is historically known as helena s temple emanu el for a ceremonial signing celebrating mjp buying back the temple for jewish use the day before on aug 25 i haven t heard of any other jewish community buying back a synagogue from the catholic church but that did not stop bishop vetter said stanfel the signing opened with a prayer by roman catholic bishop austin vetter and a hebrew blessing by julie bir a board member of mjp i will be saying the jewish prayer shehecheyanu which we say in times of special occasion holidays gathering together for the first time and this is such a special occasion i m going to try not to cry stated bir in english bir stated the prayer means blessed are you eternal spirit who has given us life sustained us and allowed us to arrive in this moment reclaiming montana s first synagogue is more than just buying back bricks and mortar wrote stanfel in an op ed earlier this month our communities are living through an unprecedented rise in antisemitism in montana the anti defamation league reports anti semitic assaults and incidents are at highs not seen since 1976 there is no better time to proudly occupy this synagogue again and anchor our present and future jewish generations to temple emanu el and montana s rich history of inclusivity for the past 15 months mjp has been working to buy back the synagogue the oldest one in montana from the roman catholic church which bought the building from the state of montana for 81 000 in 1981 i can t think of a better thing i ve done since being the bishop for almost three years than being able to sign today the jewish synagogue back to the jewish community said vetter when we talk about interreligious dialogue between the catholic church and the jewish community you can t get a better dialogue than getting a synagogue back to the jews who are a solid rock for this community it is a deep reality for me knowing that in my own faith the catholic faith rests on the rocks of our jewish brothers and sisters mjp officials noted the moral and financial support that came from churches like the montana synod of the evangelical lutheran church in america the episcopal diocese of montana plymouth congregational church the knights of columbus in missoula and others businesses around helena such as montana book company the windbag saloon gulch distillers and headwaters crafthouse supported mjp s journey as well no structural updates need to be done on the synagogue according to stanfel after the mjp board takes around a month break the building will be open to community use the building can be used exactly as is our plan for the present is to rent out the basement and the entry level the top floor will be for jewish community use a part of the strategic planning we ll be doing is laying out five and 10 year plans since december mjp has been programming in helena even before it owned the former temple emanu el the nonprofit sponsored jewish musicians in helena hosted an open discussion on how to counter antisemitism and hate and offered jewish baking classes with the help of park avenue bakery it plans to continue programming throughout the state the famous onion domes of the synagogue were removed when the temple was bought by the state of montana for 1 in 1935 to renovate it into administrative offices the location of the domes is still unknown i know someone is going to ask this but we don t know where the onion domes are said stanfel i really wish we could put them back up an attendee asked stanfel if there was any thought to getting a torah for the synagogue we ve had an offer of a torah being donated to us but we had to hold off on it because we had to have the right insurance which we do have now we re not getting a rabbi mjp and vetter stated how they would like to have a rededication ceremony in the future and possibly lay down another plaque or hang an item inside the temple to commemorate the date that mjp bought back the synagogue for the jewish community champagne sparkling juice bagels and fresh baked challah bread were served in celebration at the event in the hebrew calendar we are here on an extremely auspicious day said stanfel today is the first day of elul which is the month that precedes the holiest jewish holy days of rosh hashanah and yom kippur elul is a time traditionally for reflection and taking stock to see where we ve come from and how we move forward

in this sept 19 2014 photo the alibaba logo is displayed during the company s ipo at the new york stock exchange ap photo mark lennihan washington ap the u s and china have reached a tentative agreement to allow u s regulators to inspect the audits of chinese companies whose stocks are traded on u s exchanges in a long festering dispute u s regulators have threatened to boot a number of chinese companies off the new york stock exchange and nasdaq if china doesn t permit inspections the deal announced friday by market regulators in the u s and china is preliminary securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler said the proof will be in the pudding while important this framework is merely a step in the process gensler said in a prepared statement this agreement will be meaningful only if u s regulators actually can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in china if they cannot roughly 200 china based issuers will face prohibitions on trading of their securities in the u s if they continue to use those audit firms an agreement would mean that u s investors will maintain access to shares of important chinese companies while at the same time being protected by the integrity of company audits this is unequivocally positive news and a major step toward averting mass delisting of chinese companies in the u s analyst tobin marcus at evercore isi said in a note to clients however he said a deal is only the first step toward avoiding delisting what ultimately needs to happen is that u s inspectors need to show up and complete inspections he said the inspections could take months the u s regulators plan to have inspection teams on the ground in china by mid september the public company accounting oversight board is due to determine by year s end whether the chinese government is continuing to block access to the audit books a negative finding could result in u s actions such as stock trading bans although it s preliminary the agreement is a rare instance of accord at a time when relations between the u s and china are fraught by sparring over trade the war in ukraine and human rights the tension was ratcheted higher by u s house speaker nancy pelosi s recent trip to taiwan the self governing island that china claims as its territory the chinese responded to the visit by pelosi second in line to the u s presidency with military drills around the island u s regulators had warned that without an agreement some 200 companies including alibaba group the world s biggest e commerce competitor might be ejected from u s exchanges or face trading restrictions the americans said that other governments have agreed to allow such audit reviews which are required by u s law and that china and hong kong are the only holdouts three of china s biggest state owned companies announced this month they would remove their shares from the new york stock exchange but gave no indication that the action was related to the audit dispute petrochina ltd china life insurance ltd and china petroleum chemical co cited the small volume of trading of their shares in the new york market and the expense of complying with regulations in a foreign market the companies said their shares still would be traded in hong kong which is chinese territory but open to non chinese investors the dispute over audits of chinese companies dates back more than a decade scores of chinese companies were suspended or kicked off u s exchanges most of them for failing to file timely financial reports at least two dozen were hit with sec fraud or accounting charges but investigations stalled because the companies audit papers were in china beyond the sec s reach under terms of the new agreement u s accounting inspectors in the pcaob would have independent discretion to select any chinese company audit for inspection or investigation and they would get direct access to interview all personnel of the audit firms whose work is being inspected the inspectors could see complete audit work papers with no redactions in beijing the china securities regulatory commission called the agreement an important step in resolving the issue of common concern of audit and regulatory cooperation investors and companies on both sides will benefit from keeping chinese shares trading on u s exchanges the commission said the terms the commission outlined would give chinese officials a role in any possible investigations china won the right to conduct similar reviews of u s audit firms where relevant according to the chinese regulators allowing beijing to portray the agreement as mutually positive rather than an instance of china giving in to american pressure china has yet to express any need to carry out such reviews of its own chinese regulators also would be allowed to participate in interviews with audit personnel

may soon ease up on high interest rates in its effort to tame inflation by associated press the dow jones industrial average slumped more than 1 000 points as the stock market had its biggest skid in two months friday after the head of the federal reserve dashed wall street s hopes that it may soon ease up on high interest rates in its effort to tame inflation the s p 500 lost 3 4 its biggest drop since mid june after jerome powell said the fed will likely need to keep interest rates high enough to slow the economy for some time in order to beat back the high inflation sweeping the country the dow dropped 3 and the nasdaq composite ended 3 9 lower reflecting a broad sell off led by technology stocks higher rates help corral inflation but they also hurt asset prices investors initially struggled to make out the meaning of powell s highly anticipated speech stocks fell at first then erased nearly all their losses and then turned decisively lower with all but five of the companies in the s p 500 ending up in the red he focused more on the fed s goals rather than the path said jeffrey kleintop chief global investment strategist at charles schwab that left the market with less to grab onto in terms of the future path for policy powell s speech followed up on several other fed officials who have recently pushed back on speculation the fed may ease up on its interest rate hikes the increases help corral inflation but they also hurt the economy and investment prices powell acknowledged the increases will hurt u s households and businesses in perhaps an unspoken nod to the potential for a recession but he also said the pain would be far greater if inflation were allowed to fester and that we must keep at it until the job is done he was speaking at an annual economic symposium in jackson hole wyoming which has been the setting for market moving fed speeches in the past he basically said there will be pain and that they won t stop and can t stop hiking until inflation moves a lot lower said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments it was a mercifully short speech and to the point powell didn t really break new ground which is good since jackson hole isn t a policy meeting the sell off capped a week of choppy trading that left major indexes down 4 or more for the week all told the s p 500 fell 141 46 points to 4 057 66 the benchmark index is now down almost 15 for the year the dow lost 1 008 38 points to close at 32 283 40 the last time the blue chip average had a 1 000 point drop was in may the nasdaq slid 497 56 points to 12 141 71 its biggest drop since june the russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 64 81 points or 3 3 to finish at 1 899 83 expectations had built through the week that powell would try to to bat down recent talk about a pivot by the fed such speculation had helped stocks surge through the summer some investors were even saying the fed could cut interest rates later in 2023 as pressures on the economy mount and the nation s high inflation hopefully recedes but powell s speech made clear the fed will accept weaker growth for a while for the sake of getting inflation under control analysts said powell reiterated that the fed is worried about rising prices and getting inflation under control is emphatically job number one said jeff klingelhofer co head of investments at thornburg investment management perhaps giving some hope to investors some analysts said powell seemed to indicate expectations for future inflation aren t taking off if that were to happen it could cause a self perpetuating cycle that worsens inflation a report on friday said u s consumers are expecting 2 9 annual inflation over the long run which is at the lower end of the 2 9 to 3 1 range seen in the university of michigan s survey over the last year for now the debate on wall street is whether the fed will raise short term rates by either half a percentage point next month double the usual margin or by three quarters of a point the fed s last two hikes have been by 0 75 points and a slight majority of bets on wall street are favoring a third such increase in september according to cme group a report friday morning showed that the fed s preferred gauge of inflation decelerated last month and wasn t as bad as many economists expected it s a potentially encouraging signal which may embolden more of wall street to say that the worst of inflation has already passed or will soon other data showed that incomes for americans rose less last month than expected while consumer spending growth slowed following the reports and powell s comments the two year treasury yield rose for much of the day but slipped by late afternoon to 3 36 from 3 37 late thursday it tends to track expectations for fed action the 10 year treasury yield which follows expectations for longer term economic growth and inflation initially rose then slipped to 3 02 from 3 03 late thursday the fed has already hiked its key overnight interest rate four times this year in hopes of slowing the worst inflation in decades the hikes have already hurt the housing industry where more expensive mortgage rates have slowed activity but the job market has remained strong helping to prop up the economy investors got a fresh set of warnings from companies about the persistent impact from inflation and a

technology solutions to compete and succeed in the years ahead and we are confident in our long term opportunities what s driving revenue enterprise and commercial sales have been relatively more resilient to the global slowdown and many company companies continue to have a high level of cash on their books consumers overspent in the previous years which led to savings falling on the other hand corporations who are flush with cash are choosing to invest in infrastructure as they try to get ahead of the current inflationary environment and considering that cash levels the spending is likely to continue for a couple of quarters at least until the economy starts to show greater levels of weakness cloud and databases have been in a slight bubble which resulted in slight overinvestment but companies seem to be content investing in them for now cloud solutions will continue to witness strong growth despite a very competitive industry and are expected to continue to grow by around 15 until 2030 but risks to the cloud remain largely as overinvestment in cloud and data centers a number of short sellers have started to short the market citing excessive exuberance but it remains to be seen whether this thesis plays out demand for the enterprise and cloud side of the business is not only witnessing demand from traditional markets such as north america but has plenty of room to grow in countries like japan and china all of which will increasingly adopt cloud based solutions dell s overall finances also remain intact but debt remains a slight concern with

traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse on aug 26 in new york city afp yonhap stocks slumped on friday after federal reserve boss jerome powell pledged to act forcefully against soaring inflation in a battle that will be painful for american families and businesses the fed has been on an aggressive campaign to raise interest rates and powell made it clear at the jackson hole gathering of global monetary policymakers that the fight against inflation is not over restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance he told the gathering held against the backdrop of the majestic grand teton mountains modest signs of slowing in the world s largest economy and easing price pressures had spurred hope in financial markets that the central bank might ease up on its aggressive interest rate hikes and perhaps even start to reverse course next year but powell doused those hopes making it clear that fed policy and the benchmark borrowing rate would have to remain sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to its two percent target while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses powell said but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain wall street stocks tumbled with all three main indices ending with losses of three percent or more
reuters 3m co must face more than 230 000 lawsuits accusing it of selling defective earplugs to the u s military after a u s judge on friday ruled that the bankruptcy of a subsidiary did not stop lawsuits against the non bankrupt parent company companies that file for bankruptcy typically receive an immediate reprieve from lawsuits and 3m subsidiary aearo technologies llc argued that extending those protections to 3m would buy aearo time to address its debts and restructuring goals aearo and 3m had argued that bankruptcy offered a faster and fairer way to compensate veterans who say that earplugs made by aearo caused hearing loss but bankruptcy judge jeffrey j graham in indianapolis said that aearo s bankruptcy restructuring could proceed in parallel with the lawsuits while the sheer size of the consolidated litigation may have spurred 3m and aearo to seek additional leverage through the bankruptcy proceedings that did not create a legal need to protect 3m graham ruled attorneys representing the veterans with hearing loss said they looked forward to continuing their lawsuits against 3m in other courts judge graham s decision is a complete rejection of 3m s attempt to evade accountability and hide in bankruptcy plaintiff attorneys bryan aylstock and christopher seeger said in a statement a spokesman for 3m said it intended to appeal continuing to litigate these cases one by one over the coming years will not provide certainty or fairness for any party 3m spokesman sean lynch said 3m subsidiary aearo technologies llc filed for bankruptcy protection in indiana on july 26 seeking to resolve lawsuits alleging that 3m s combat arms earplugs version 2 caev2 caused hearing loss aearo will continue in the chapter 11 proceedings and 3m will continue to defend its position in the litigation the company said in a statement late on friday 3m continues to expect to complete the pending separation of its food safety business on the targeted closing date of september 1 3m added the lawsuits have been consolidated in federal court in florida and have grown into the largest mass tort litigation in u s history aearo placed 1 billion in a trust to settle them and agreed to indemnify 3m for all liability related to caev2 3m has denied liability saying its earplugs offered protection to soldiers while allowing them to hear on the battlefield the florida judge overseeing the earplug lawsuits u s district judge m casey rodgers has admonished 3m for naked duplicity in attempting to dump its liabilities into a bankrupt subsidiary 3m and aearo have in turn criticized rodgers for allowing the consolidated litigation to balloon pointing out that earplug cases now account for a whopping 30 of all cases pending in u s federal courts 3m has lost 10 of the 16 cases that have gone to trial so far with about 265 million being awarded in total to 13 plaintiffs 3m s stock price was down 12 friday to 129 companies have in recent years increasingly used bankruptcy proceedings to protect non bankrupt owners and affiliates from litigation with johnson johnson nyse s effort to offload lawsuits alleging that its talc based baby powder caused cancer a recent example j j has denied liability and said its talc based baby powder is safe the j j affiliate s bankruptcy case is under review after cancer victims appealed a court ruling that blocked their lawsuits against j j

article covid 19 vaccine maker moderna is suing pfizer and the german drugmaker biontech accusing its main competitors of copying moderna s technology in order to make their own vaccine moderna said friday that pfizer and biontech s vaccine comirnaty infringes on patents moderna filed several years ago protecting the technology behind its preventive shot spikevax the company filed patent infringement lawsuits in both u s federal court and a german court related moderna asks fda to approve covid 19 vaccine for kids under 6 pfizer spokeswoman pam eisele said the company had not fully reviewed moderna s lawsuit but the drugmaker was surprised by it given that their vaccine is based on proprietary technology developed by both biontech and pfizer she said in an email that pfizer inc based in new york would vigorously defend against any allegations in the case biontech did not immediately respond to a request from the associated press seeking comment moderna and pfizer s two shot vaccines both use mrna technology to help people fight the coronavirus when covid 19 emerged neither pfizer nor biontech had moderna s level of experience with developing mrna vaccines for coronaviruses the company said in a complaint filed friday in the u s district court for the district of massachusetts related covid omicron vaccine us reaches deal with moderna for winter booster shots the mrna vaccines work by injecting a genetic code for the spike protein that coats the surface of the coronavirus that code the mrna is encased in a little ball of fat and instructs the body s cells to make some harmless spike copies that train the immune system to recognize the real virus that approach is radically different than how vaccines have traditionally been made moderna said it started developing its mrna technology platform in 2010 and that helped the company quickly produce its covid 19 vaccine after the pandemic arrived in early 2020 by the end of that year u s regulators had cleared shots from both pfizer and moderna for use after clinical research showed that both were highly effective related pfizer ceo 4th shot of vaccine necessary moderna ceo stephane bancel said in a prepared statement that the vaccine developer pioneered that technology and invested billions of dollars in creating it moderna worked with scientists at the national institutes of health to test and develop its covid 19 vaccine the company said its lawsuit is not related to any patent rights generated during that collaboration the company said it believes its rivals vaccine infringes on patents moderna filed between 2010 and 2016 moderna said in its complaint that pfizer and biontech copied some critical features of its technology including making the exact same chemical modification to their mrna that moderna scientists first developed years earlier and went on to use in spikevax related pfizer omicron specific covid 19 vaccine human trials to begin late january moderna said it recognizes the importance of vaccine access and is not seeking to remove comirnaty from the market it also is not asking for an injunction to prevent future sales moderna said in 2020 that it would not enforce its covid 19 related patents while the pandemic continued but the company said in march with vaccine supplies improving globally that it would update that pledge it said it still would not enforce its patents for vaccines used in low and middle income countries but it expected companies like pfizer and biontech to respect its intellectual property and it would consider a commercially reasonable license in other markets if they requested one pfizer and biontech have failed to do so moderna said in a statement the vaccines have swiftly become top selling products globally pfizer s comirnaty brought in more than 36 billion in sales globally last year and analysts expect it to bring in nearly 33 billion this year according to factset moderna inc booked 17 6 billion in revenue from its vaccine last year analysts project more than 21 billion in 2022 spikevax is moderna s only product on the market but it is using developing other vaccines using the mrna technology the cambridge massachusetts company s stock trades publicly under the ticker symbol mrna associated press writers lauran neergaard and frank jordans contributed to this report from washington d c and berlin respectively murphy reported from indianapolis

inflation rates 10 years from now that s like asking the weatherman to tell you whether it will rain next march 17 there is no way that any math wizard can account for all the variables in the external world impacting government spending over the next two years much less 10 could anyone predict covid 19 in advance the ukraine war the current inflation back in 1962 we faced two major threats that should seem familiar today inflated steel prices in the spring and a surprise threat of war with the soviets in the fall things looked very dismal the far larger market drop came in the spring over the steel price wars with only a small market dip during the cuban missile crisis but then the market soared thanks to a tax cut democrats never cut taxes right but on december 14 1962 president kennedy first proposed a tax cut to help spur economic growth it didn t pass in 1963 but lbj passed it and the stock market took off the future is full of surprises like that which means that which we expect most is least likely to happen this summer i ve been going over memories from the seattle world s fair of 60 years ago held april 21 to october 21 1962 between my junior and senior years of high school there i was an avid science student and jazz fan a perfect mix for the music and futuristic offerings of those six magical months as an avid science student i remember gyrocopters the rocket backpacks the elevated monorail and a flying saucer on sticks called the space needle there was a promise of high speed air cars that would cloud our skies it was a thinking man s disneyland by the time it closed century 21 had greeted over 10 million visitors and even made a profit but the fair closed in the middle of that cuban missile crisis oddly the fair sort of predicted our october flirtation with armageddon visitors were channeled into a 40 second bubble ator to enter the world of tomorrow but before reaching tomorrow we had to view the threat via images of a desperate family in a fallout shelter we were invited to choose between destruction and life our visual choice was a mushroom cloud vs marilyn monroe a clear dichotomy alas marilyn monroe took her own life august 5 1962 and we were soon on the brink of nuclear war in late october when president kennedy was scheduled to close the fair we can now see that scientists in seattle were so busy looking 50 years ahead that they missed the big news of 1962 and the big picture of the next decade the rise of feminism civil rights the beatles long hair draft riots and hippies all we could see were white families in their same old roles with the same short hair but with much cooler toys tv s jetsons emulate seattle s jet set futurists in 1962 the jetsons were a prime time abc cartoon series set in orbit city in 2062 the opening theme was jaunty meet george jetson son elroy daughter judy and wife jane that cartoon family was not very far removed from the future pictured at the century 21 fairgrounds even as we look back at the 1962 photos we see crew cut white men in suits and ties inventing ever more exciting toys while wife jane is stuck in her space age kitchen like the nation seattle had a blind spot for minorities then sixty years later the space needle still hovers over seattle but the monorail is chronically broken there are no air cars rocket packs or gyrocopters crashing into each other but the sky is filled with invisible hot spots and internet storage no mushroom clouds or cars and any space copters are amazon drones we were already on the road to personal computers and the internet by the time our fair opened on april 25 1961 robert noyce was awarded a patent for the integrated circuit a chip of electronic components in semi conductive material the start of the computer revolution also in 1962 we were madly trying to put a man on the moon boeing was a big part of that in seattle boeing dominated the employment picture but from 1969 to 1972 the moon landing years the payroll at boeing shrunk from 102 000 to 29 000 there was a sign on the new interstate 5 heading south which read will the last person leaving seattle please turn out the lights once those crew cut engineers like my dad put a man on the moon they became expendable and now we haven t put a man on the moon in nearly 50 years since late 1972 who could have guessed in 1962 that seattle would give birth to a half dozen giant corporations built around the land borne comfort of yuppies first came microsoft then mccaw cellular which became at t wireless which merged back into ma bell then came designer coffee at starbucks costco amazon and nordstrom s meanwhile boeing s corporate team left town to set up shop in chicago my main point is that the future seldom happens as we envision it and that s a good thing i wouldn t want to live in either a bomb shelter or an aerial utopia filled with drunk drivers in the sky likewise the world of 2062 will not be anything like what we envision today new inventions now inconceivable will enter the world and ease our passage through life today s social blind spots will also be revealed therefore it pays to be positive for reasons that nobody can explain in specific detail yet tomorrow will be better but i can t tell you why not yet the safest bet is that the ascent of man will continue it is the greatest megatrend in history but nobody in history has yet published any clear eyed view of our future
in this file photo taken on july 27 federal reserve board chairman jerome powell speaks during a news conference in washington dc afp yonhap americans are headed for a painful period of slow economic growth and possibly rising joblessness as the federal reserve raises interest rates to beat 40 year high inflation fed chair jerome powell warned friday in his bluntest language yet about what is in store for the world s biggest economy in a speech kicking off the jackson hole central banking conference in wyoming on friday powell said the fed will raise borrowing costs as high as needed to restrict growth and would keep them there for some time to bring down inflation that s running at more than three times the fed s 2 percent goal reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below trend growth moreover there will very likely be some softening of labor market conditions powell said while higher interest rates slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation they will also bring some pain to households and businesses these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain as that pain increases powell said people should not expect the fed to dial back its monetary policy quickly until the inflation problem is fixed i thought the message was strong and right said cleveland fed president loretta mester in an interview with bloomberg tv after the speech i think we re going to have to move short term interest rates up above 4 percent and probably need to hold them there next year some investors anticipate the fed will flinch if unemployment rises too fast with some even penciling in interest rate cuts next year to the contrary powell and other policymakers are signaling that even a recession would not budge them if inflation is not convincingly heading back to the fed s 2 percent target powell gave no indication on friday of how high interest rates might rise before the fed is finished only that they will go as high as needed the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy powell said we must keep at it until the job is done history shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay underscoring the same raise and hold message atlanta fed president raphael bostic told bloomberg tv that once the central bank s policy rate is 100 to 125 basis points higher than the current 2 25 percent 2 50 percent range we should stay there for a long time after the remarks interest rate futures traders beefed up bets on a third straight 75 basis point rate hike at the sept 20 21 policy meeting and priced in expectations the policy rate will get to the 3 75 percent 4 00 percent range by next march powell s frank acknowledgment of coming pain to households took investors by surprise and hammers home how serious they are about raising rates to fight inflation said ryan detrick chief market strategist at carson group the hope of a dovish pivot was squashed at least for now but rate futures trading continued to reflect expectations for such a pivot later next year with the fed seen cutting its policy rate by about 35 basis points by the end of 2023 and further in 2024 the fed will get another chance to reset those expectations in september when its 19 policymakers release a fresh set of forecasts including for their own rate hikes traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange nyse on aug 26 in new york city afp yonhap

click to share on facebook opens in new window click to share on linkedin opens in new window click to share on twitter opens in new window some of the biggest obstacles to expanded vaccines coverage in the world s poorest and most conflict ridden nations are lack of cold chain storage unpredictable supply chains and transport barriers not claims of vaccine hesitancy in the global south according to a new report the picture of the steep challenges faced by 14 nations during the covid 19 pandemic is more nuanced than a simple attribution to hesitancy or poor education consistent with findings elsewhere two advocacy groups and a research company conclude in a joint 55 page report friday our findings demonstrate that as the world moved and transitioned from covid 19 massive inequities remain in access to all covid 19 tools including oxygen and rapid tests the report says among developed nations some 1 1 billion covid 19 vaccines were likely wasted since the global rollout began according to findings in july by airfinity a global health surveillance firm the two groups international treatment preparedness coalition itpc and people s vaccine alliance and the malaysian research company matahari global solutions say numerous structural access barriers exist to the fair widespread distribution of covid 19 vaccines those include insufficient local cold chain storage and advance notice about arrival dates which impedes national planning and implementation abilities other barriers include physical infrastructure such as access roads and in some places limited access to transportation that works and is affordable unpredictable wait times fluctuating supply stocks and people s inability to leave their jobs also play an important role the study finds in addition it says the lower vaccination rates are influenced by a lack of access to information and suspicion of medical technologies brought to countries by westerners and white men owing to historical memory and perceptions of experimentation on black bodies in most cases the information including technical terms was delivered in the official language most often english french or spanish instead of local languages study dismisses claims about importance of skepticism about vaccines that contrasts with the so called vaccine hesitancy that some pharmaceutical companies have blamed for low vaccination rates among poorer countries the study looked at bangladesh democratic republic of the congo drc haiti jamaica liberia madagascar nepal nigeria peru senegal somalia uganda and ukraine reflecting a variety of factors some such as the drc and haiti had internal conflicts and vaccination rates of less than 10 in contrast to the world health organization s recommended 70 target rate that some high income countries already have achieved others such as nigeria somalia and ukraine were included primarily for their domestic turmoil or insecurity peru was studied due to its high numbers of covid 19 deaths madagascar was put on the list because of relative exclusion from discussion among academic and policy circles dr elia badjo founder and executive director of cosamed and the lead local consultant for the itpc pva project in the democratic republic of congo drc said health workers hadn been paid since the start of the vaccination campaigns at the beginning of the pandemic due to lack of funds many are not trained either he said adding that ebola and monkeypox outbreaks exacerbate the situation and stretch scarce public health resources violent conflicts also have displaced people and made them more inaccessible to health workers in uganda richard musisi executive director of masala association of persons with disabilities living with hiv aids madipha said people with disabilities were disproportionately affected by the covid 19 pandemic there were consistent vaccine stock outs and limited awareness the study says doctors and nurses in several rural communities reported never having heard of paxlovid or novel antivirals for covid 19 while some nations had no outreach to lgbtiq persons those who cannot afford to self isolate if they tested positive or people living in single room homes these point to the need for direct cash transfers during pandemics and long term planning on social security nets on the domestic level but also to the failure of global pandemic platforms to account for local and specialized contexts the study says report cites role in vaccines of modern day slavery the unsalaried community health workers that are essential for pandemic response also are a top concern across the 14 countries and territories community health workers play an essential role in deployment of tools community engagement and vaccine uptake it says yet they largely remain unpaid a phenomenon some have described as modern day slavery the people s vaccine alliance says the disregard for the needs of people in lower income countries is evidence of systemic racism in the global covid 19 response though the study does not mention this term or others such as racism or racial discrimination the group also emphasizes that true infection and death rates are likely to be far higher than official figures due to the inaccessibility of testing and vaccination sites among the studied nations pcr test results can take anywhere from 8 to 12 hours in bangladesh to more than two weeks in rural drc people cannot leave work at short notice travel long distances to a vaccination testing site and then wait for a long unpredictable period of time it says for rural populations and nomadic people in countries like somalia this problem is particularly acute mobile vaccination and testing is not widespread enough approach to vaccines in the global south left people abandoned maaza seyoum the group s global south convenor says the report shows that communities have repeatedly been let down by a system geared towards protecting people in wealthy countries leaving people in the global south abandoned their lives have been treated as an afterthought seyoum said local populations are expected to shoulder blame and be grateful for what vaccines they do receive when there has been little effort to meet their needs she said it is yet more evidence of the systemic racism that has plagued the global response to covid 19 fifa a rahman the report s lead author and principal consultant at matahari global solutions says the report found layered issues why people are not accessing vaccines rather than an outright widespread distrust of vaccines the vaccine hesitancy narrative is rooted in racism and colonialism and the idea that some people don t know how to do certain things she said it s the same kind of condescension that still happens and it s really problematic part of it is intellectual laziness but it s largely due to ingrained racism and colonialism image credits joe karp sawey people s vaccine alliance
the executive board of the international monetary fund is slated to convene monday to decide whether to disburse over 1 billion in loans to pakistan the move will unlock critically needed additional foreign funding as the country struggles to avoid economic collapse amid high inflation and low foreign exchange reserves while pakistan s economic woes are nothing new experts say its strategic significance compels global powers to keep this nuclear armed south asian nation of almost 230 million people afloat how poor is pakistan s economy the pakistani currency the rupee lost more than a third of its value and hit an all time low against the u s dollar in july before rebounding a bit year over year inflation touched a painful 25 according to government data released in july with prices of staples like cooking oil and lentils almost doubling earlier the government banned imports of more than three dozen nonessential or luxury items including canned fish jams and jellies a government minister famously urged people to drink less tea as the rising import bill coupled with a lack of foreign funding ate away at the country s foreign exchange reserves file the logo of the international monetary fund is visible on its building april 5 2021 in washington according to the state bank of pakistan the central bank s foreign exchange reserves stood below 8 billion in mid august barely enough to cover a few weeks worth of imports government officials blame the country s economic woes on the global rise in the cost of food and fuel because of supply chain issues caused by the covid 19 pandemic and russia s war in ukraine uzair younus director of the pakistan initiative at the atlantic council s south asia center said in an interview pakistan s covid strategy on the health and economic side was perhaps the best in the region the amount of stimulus and amnesties that were given were just enormous and so a lot of import spending went out as a result of that the country relies heavily on foreign loans and imports government data show its total external debt the money it owes other countries and foreign lenders is more than 80 of its gdp why pakistan s economic stability matters standing on the brink of default pakistan managed in the last six weeks to secure loans financing deferred oil payments and investment commitments close to 12 billion from china saudi arabia qatar and uae however much of this and more from other multilateral lenders such as the world bank will become available only after the imf board approves the release of almost 1 2 billion younus believes the optics of a pakistan in peril are particularly poor for china which is anxious for the success of its global infrastructure project the belt and road initiative bri if the bri is the poster child of china s foreign and economic policy globally that shows china has arrived then cpec was its crown jewel in so many ways he told voa referring to the china pakistan economic corridor an almost 60 billion collection of infrastructure development projects funded by chinese loans and investments in pakistan file passengers ride in a newly built orange line metro train a project planned under the china pakistan economic corridor a day after an official opening in the eastern city of lahore oct 26 2020 if goes belly up and defaults that will really raise questions about china s own ability to set up competing infrastructure competing financial instruments et cetera for its own strategic partners younis said in that event the contagion effect of pakistan s economic collapse on broader chinese foreign policy economic policy would be too big tamanna salikuddin director of south asia programs at the united states institute of peace said the u s tap much more dried up over the last 20 years as the war in afghanistan dragged on however she said washington still supports the loans through the imf where it is the biggest donor because a crisis on afghanistan s border is not something that the u s wants to see counterterrorism interests and nuclear security and stability remain in u s national security interests as the competition for global influence between beijing and washington heats up salikuddin said pakistan can position itself in the middle and ensure that it certainly gets bailed out why pakistan needs repeated bailouts pakistan is among the world s most bailed out countries it is currently participating in its 23rd loan program with the imf since the country joined the institution in 1950 just three years after partition from india file an investor monitors a stock index on a screen while brokers work at their desks at the pakistan stock exchange which responded positively after the news of an international monetary fund bailout package in karachi pakistan july 14 2022 successive governments have promised to break the beggar s bowl or get the country out of imf s trap but experts note a consistent lack of political will and public appetite for necessary economic reforms in a nation of almost 230 million fewer than 3 million file income tax returns according to government data any efforts at expanding the tax net are met with severe opposition the latest disbursement to be decided on by the imf board monday is in fact part of a 6 billion loan program agreed upon with islamabad in 2019 if approved the money will come after months of delays and tough negotiations as pakistan backtracked on promised policy reforms younis applauded the new government that took over in may for its willingness to

jackson hole wyoming federal reserve chair jerome powell delivered a stark warning friday about the fed s determination to fight inflation with more sharp interest rate hikes it will likely cause pain for americans in the form of a weaker economy and job losses the message landed with a thud on wall street sending the dow jones industrial average down more than 1 000 points for the day these are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation powell said in a high profile speech at the fed s annual economic symposium in jackson hole but a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain investors had been hoping for a signal from powell that the fed might moderate its rate increases later this year if inflation were to show further signs of easing but the fed chair indicated that that time may not be near and stocks tumbled in response runaway price increases have soured most americans on the economy even as the unemployment rate has fallen to a half century low of 3 5 it has also created political risks for president joe biden and congressional democrats in this fall s elections with republicans denouncing biden s 1 9 trillion financial support package approved last year as having fueled inflation dow nasdaq sag the dow jones average finished down 3 friday its worst day in three months the tech heavy nasdaq composite shed nearly 4 shorter term treasury yields climbed as traders built up bets for the fed to stay aggressive with rates some on wall street expect the economy to fall into recession later this year or early next year after which they expect the fed to reverse itself and reduce rates a number of fed officials though have pushed back against that notion powell s remarks suggested that the fed is aiming to raise its benchmark rate to about 3 75 to 4 by next year yet not so high as to tank the economy in hopes of slowing growth long enough to conquer high inflation the idea they are trying to hammer into the market s head is that their approach makes a rapid pivot to unlikely said eric winograd an economist at asset manager alliancebernstein they are going to stay tight even when it hurts after raising its key short term rate by a steep three quarters of a point at each of its past two meetings part of the fed s fastest series of hikes since the early 1980s powell said the fed might ease up on that pace at some point suggesting that any such slowing isn t near powell said the size of the fed s rate increase at its next meeting in late september whether one half or three quarters of a percentage point will depend on inflation and jobs data an increase of either size though would exceed the fed s traditional quarter point hike a reflection of how severe inflation has become the fed chair said that while lower inflation readings that have been reported for july have been welcome he added that a single month s improvement falls far short of what will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down drop in inflation on friday an inflation gauge that is closely monitored by the fed showed that prices actually declined 0 1 from june to july though prices did jump 6 3 in july from 12 months earlier that was down from a 6 8 year over year jump in june which had been the highest since 1982 the drop largely reflected lower gas prices in his speech friday powell noted that the history of high inflation in the 1970s when the central bank sought to counter high prices with only intermittent rate hikes shows that the fed must stay focused the historical record cautions strongly against prematurely lowering interest rates he said we must keep at it until the job is done what particularly worries powell and other fed officials is the prospect that inflation would become entrenched leading consumers and businesses to change their behavior in ways that would perpetuate higher prices if for example workers began demanding higher pay to match higher inflation many employers would then pass on those higher labor costs to consumers in the form of higher prices many analysts speculate that fed officials want to see roughly six months or so of lower monthly inflation readings similar to july s before stopping their rate hikes powell s speech was the marquee event of the fed s annual economic symposium at jackson hole the first time the conference of central bankers is being held in person since 2019 after it went virtual for two years during the covid 19 pandemic rapid hikes since march the fed has implemented its fastest pace of rate increases in decades to try to curb inflation which has punished households with soaring costs for food gas rent and other necessities the central bank has lifted its benchmark rate by 2 full percentage points in just four meetings to a range of 2 25 to 2 5 those hikes have led to higher costs for mortgages car loans and other consumer and business borrowing home sales have been plunging since the fed first signaled it would raise borrowing costs at last year s jackson hole symposium powell listed five reasons he thought inflation would be transitory yet it has persisted and many economists have noted that those remarks haven t aged well powell indirectly acknowledged that history at the outset of his remarks friday when he said that at past jackson hole conferences i have discussed broad topics such as the ever changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy today he said my remarks will be shorter my focus narrower and my message more direct

washington the u s and china have reached a tentative agreement to allow u s regulators to inspect the audits of chinese companies whose stocks are traded on u s exchanges in a long festering dispute u s regulators have threatened to boot a number of chinese companies off the new york stock exchange and nasdaq if china doesn t permit inspections the deal announced friday by market regulators in the u s and china is preliminary securities and exchange commission chairman gary gensler said the proof will be in the pudding while important this framework is merely a step in the process gensler said in a prepared statement this agreement will be meaningful only if actually can inspect and investigate completely audit firms in china if cannot roughly 200 china based issuers will face prohibitions on trading of their securities in the u s if they continue to use those audit firms an agreement would mean that u s investors will maintain access to shares of important chinese companies while at the same time being protected by the integrity of company audits positive but just a first step this is unequivocally positive news and a major step toward averting mass delisting of chinese companies in the u s analyst tobin marcus at evercore isi said in a note to clients however he said a deal is only the first step toward avoiding delisting what ultimately needs to happen is that inspectors need to show up and complete inspections he said the inspections could take months the u s regulators plan to have inspection teams on the ground in china by mid september the public company accounting oversight board pcaob is due to determine by year s end whether the chinese government is continuing to block access to the audit books a negative finding could result in u s actions such as stock trading bans although it s preliminary the agreement is a rare instance of accord at a time when relations between the u s and china are fraught by sparring over trade the war in ukraine and human rights the tension was ratcheted higher by u s house speaker nancy pelosi s recent trip to taiwan the self governing island that china claims as its territory the chinese responded to the visit by pelosi second in the line of succession to the u s presidency with military drills around the island file in this sept 19 2014 photo the alibaba logo is displayed during the company s ipo at the new york stock exchange the u s and china have reached a preliminary agreement to allow u s regulators to inspect the audits of china based companies whose stocks are traded on u s exchanges the deal was announced aug 26 2022 u s regulators had warned that without an agreement 200 companies including alibaba group the world s biggest e commerce competitor might be ejected from u s exchanges or face trading restrictions the americans said that other governments had agreed to allow such audit reviews which are required by u s law and that china and hong kong were the only holdouts three of china s biggest state owned companies announced this month that they would remove their shares from the new york stock exchange but didn t indicate the action was related to the audit dispute petrochina ltd china life insurance ltd and china petroleum chemical co cited the small volume of trading of their shares in the new york market and the expense of complying with regulations in a foreign market the companies said their shares still would be traded in hong kong which is chinese territory but open to non chinese investors the dispute over audits of chinese companies goes back more than a decade scores of chinese companies were suspended or kicked off u s exchanges most of them for failing to file timely financial reports at least two dozen were hit with sec fraud or accounting charges but investigations stalled because the companies audit papers were in china beyond the sec s reach direct access to personnel under terms of the new agreement u s accounting inspectors in the pcaob would have independent discretion to select any chinese company audit for inspection or investigation and they would get direct access to interview all personnel of the audit firms whose work is being inspected the inspectors could see complete audit work papers with no redactions in beijing the china securities regulatory commission called the agreement an important step in resolving the issue of common concern of audit and regulatory cooperation investors and companies on both sides will benefit from keeping chinese shares trading on u s exchanges the commission said the terms the commission outlined would give chinese officials a role in any possible investigations china won the right to conduct similar reviews of u s audit firms where relevant according to the chinese regulators allowing beijing to portray the agreement as mutually positive rather than an instance of china giving in to american pressure china has yet to express any need to carry out such reviews of its own chinese regulators also would be allowed to participate in interviews with audit personnel

cai meng china daily for years some western politicians and media outlets have been accusing china of violating human rights they have passed bills accusing china of subjecting people to forced labor and committing genocide published reports which they claim expose china s poor human rights record and held hearings for some people who they allege were targeted by chinese authorities as a retired man who has visited all of china s provinces regions and municipalities and interviewed thousands of people during his 40 year journalism career i have not engaged in any debate or argument with people who accuse china of human rights violations for those attacking china will do so anyway citing facts and figures to counter their claims is like playing the lute to a cow as a chinese saying goes besides i believe that some external pressure either out of ignorance or with an evil design could serve as a warning to us to keep strengthening human rights protection yet one can t keep quiet on seeing china a model of human rights protection and development for me being bombarded with groundless accusations lies rumors and slanders to make things worse the anti china forces wield the microphone like a weapon to influence the opinions of millions of uninitiated and innocent people in their own countries as an english major i learned the abc of journalism in the united states and what was west germany in the 1980s i was taught that respecting facts and being objective are key elements of good journalism my professors i m afraid have all passed away but if some of them were still alive i would like to ask them whether they think what they taught us is still true especially when it comes to reporting about china my teachers also tried to convince me that facts speak louder than anything and everything although sometimes i doubt if that is really the case especially judging by some western media s reports on china s human rights record i still believe human society would be doomed if facts were not respected and the fact is that after decades of efforts especially with the intensive campaign over the past 10 years china has lifted more than 700 million people out of absolute poverty an achievement that is unparalleled in the human rights rather human history unfortunately such crucial facts have been largely neglected by the western media which are prone to digging some dirt up and highlighting the few loopholes in the poverty alleviation work that involved millions of people the faces of some of the farmers i ve interviewed float before my eyes as i write i can hear them say how grateful they are to the party and the government for giving them a life they could not have dreamed of those who lived in caves were shifted to new houses especially built for them by the government and those who were seriously ill got proper medical treatment thanks to the medical insurance system which now covers about 95 percent of china s population as far as the right to religious belief is concerned it is well protected by the law in china in northwestern gansu and ningxia which have a large muslim population newly built or renovated mosques can be seen in almost all villages where people are free to pray and engage in other religious activities statistics show that the number of religious venues in china has been increasing i have visited the xinjiang uygur autonomous region several times and interviewed muslim clerics professionals as well as common people from different ethnic groups when asked about their opinion on some western politicians and media accusing china of genocide in the region they all responded with an angry nonsense the truth is that over the past four decades the uygur population in xinjiang has more than doubled a growth rate much higher than the regional and the national average those accusing china of genocide in the region will have to prove there has been no population growth in xinjiang or explain how the population of an ethnic group that has faced genocide can grow faster than the national average in fact the prevalence of religious extremism and terrorist activities prevented the region from developing economically in the past as a result jobs were difficult to get especially for minority ethnic group members who lacked the required skills and could not speak standard chinese people who landed stable jobs would become the object of envy of the whole village or neighborhood because with the income they earned they could lift the entire family out of poverty and some of those who didn t have stable jobs would work in the farms during harvest season but even such seasonal jobs began disappearing because of mechanization why would a company or individual force someone to work when there are lots of job seekers on the waiting list and how could a company or individual do so under the watchful eyes of the state ethnic affairs commission a ministry that safeguards and promotes the interests of the ethnic groups when told about the accusation of forced labor all that the locals including uygurs could do was to shrug their shoulders and laugh the real story is that over the past decade or so the central government has been encouraging investors from home and abroad to set up shop in xinjiang and create new jobs as a result xinjiang s gdp has been growing at a faster rate than the national average no wonder i saw big smiles on the faces of xinjiang residents during my visits there a country s human rights record can be assessed by determining whether it is upholding the interests of its people and whether the people have an increasing sense of fulfillment happiness and security should i remind the china bashers that the surveys and polls conducted by international organizations over the past few years show the chinese people are among the group that is highly satisfied with their country s achievements and development prospects over 90 percent are satisfied with governance too yet human rights conditions in no country are perfect china is no exception and it s frustrating to see the exposure of new corruption cases and officials malpractices which hurt people s interests and the country s development human rights protection is a long term pursuit for all countries and the goal can be realized only when all parties concerned sit together to find solutions to the problems and quite often good solutions can be found only after brainstorming accusing each other won t take forward the global human rights cause and those who accuse others

new york ap the dow jones industrial average sank more than 1 000 points friday after the head of the federal reserve dashed wall street s hopes that it may soon ease up on high interest rates in its effort to tame inflation the s p 500 lost 3 4 its biggest drop since mid june after jerome powell said the fed will likely need to keep interest rates high enough to slow the economy for some time in order to beat back the high inflation sweeping the country the dow dropped 3 and the nasdaq composite ended 3 9 lower reflecting a broad sell off led by technology stocks higher rates help corral inflation but they also hurt asset prices the fed has indicated it will raise rates into next year as it tries to quell demand and bring down prices for goods and services but some investors speculated the central bank might pause or even reverse course next year if inflation subsides leading to a rally for stocks in july and early august some analysts expected powell to bat down that talk in friday s speech and he delivered his speech followed up remarks by several other fed officials who also pushed back on speculation the fed might act less aggressively or even pivot he basically said there will be pain and that they won t stop and can t stop hiking until inflation moves a lot lower said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments powell acknowledged the increases will hurt u s households and businesses in perhaps an unspoken nod to the potential for a recession but he also said the pain would be far greater if inflation were allowed to fester and that we must keep at it until the job is done he was speaking at an annual economic symposium in jackson hole wyoming which has been the setting for market moving fed speeches in the past the sell off capped a week of choppy trading that left major indexes down 4 or more for the week all told the s p 500 fell 141 46 points to 4 057 66 the benchmark index is now down almost 15 for the year the dow lost 1 008 38 points to close at 32 283 40 the last time the blue chip average had a 1 000 point drop was in may the nasdaq slid 497 56 points to 12 141 71 its biggest drop since june the russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 64 81 points or 3 3 to finish at 1 899 83 stocks are still showing solid gains for the third quarter with the s p 500 up more than 7 and the nasdaq up 10 recent earnings reports were better than some analysts had expected and there are signs that inflation may have peaked although it remains at sharply elevated levels still powell s speech made clear the fed will accept weaker growth for a while for the sake of getting inflation under control analysts said powell reiterated that the fed is worried about rising prices and getting inflation under control is emphatically job number one said jeff klingelhofer co head of investments at thornburg investment management perhaps giving some hope to investors some analysts said powell seemed to indicate expectations for future inflation aren t taking off if that were to happen it could cause a self perpetuating cycle that worsens inflation a report on friday said u s consumers are expecting 2 9 annual inflation over the long run which is at the lower end of the 2 9 to 3 1 range seen in the university of michigan s survey over the last year for now the debate on wall street is whether the fed will raise short term rates by either half a percentage point next month double the usual margin or by three quarters of a point the fed s last two hikes have been by 0 75 points and a slight majority of bets on wall street are favoring a third such increase in september according to cme group a report friday morning showed that the fed s preferred gauge of inflation decelerated last month and wasn t as bad as many economists expected it s a potentially encouraging signal which may embolden more of wall street to say that the worst of inflation has already passed or will soon other data showed that incomes for americans rose less last month than expected while consumer spending growth slowed following the reports and powell s comments the two year treasury yield rose for much of the day but slipped by late afternoon to 3 36 from 3 37 late thursday it tends to track expectations for fed action the 10 year treasury yield which follows expectations for longer term economic growth and inflation initially rose then slipped to 3 02 from 3 03 late thursday the fed has already hiked its key overnight interest rate four times this year in hopes of slowing the worst inflation in decades the hikes have already hurt the housing industry where more expensive mortgage rates have slowed activity but the job market has remained strong helping to prop up the economy investors got a fresh set of warnings from companies about the persistent impact from inflation and a slowing economy computer maker dell slumped 13 5 after it said weaker demand will hurt revenue
